  abstract     = {In ASIACRYPT 2017, Costello and Hisil proposed two methods of evaluating ℓ -isogenous curves: the usage of Vélu formulas and the recovery from special isogenous points. In isogeny-based cryptography, such as the supersingular isogeny Diffie–Hellman (SIDH)/supersingular isogeny key encapsulation protocol, small-degree isogenies are typically prioritized, because the costs of evaluating points and curves through isogenies using Vélu&#39;s formulas will increase with the increase of isogeny degrees. Compared with the use of Vélu formulas, the recovery from special isogenous points is independent from ℓ and runs in constant time under certain conditions. Therefore, it could be efficient in the evaluation of the ℓ -isogenous curve in some variants of SIDH (such as SIDH using twisted torsion (B-SIDH)). In this study, we optimize the evaluation of the ℓ -isogenous curve when three differential isogenous points are provided in advance. We also propose the optimized evaluation in projective coordinates on different elliptic curve models such as the Montgomery, Edwards, Jacobi, and Huff models. Finally, we propose an acceleration of B-SIDH by applying our new function to evaluate the ℓ -isogenous curve in the Montgomery model.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary histories for species that cross with one another or exchange genetic material can be represented by leaf-labelled, directed graphs called phylogenetic networks . A major challenge in the burgeoning area of phylogenetic networks is to develop algorithms for building such networks by amalgamating small networks into a single large network. The level of a phylogenetic network is a measure of its deviation from being a tree; the higher the level of a network, the less treelike it becomes. Various algorithms have been developed for building level-1 networks from small networks. However, level-1 networks may not be able to capture the complexity of some data sets. In this paper, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for constructing a rooted binary level-2 phylogenetic network from a collection of 3-leaf networks or trinets . Moreover, we prove that the algorithm will correctly reconstruct such a network if it is given all of the trinets in the network as input. The algorithm runs in time O ( t ⋅ n + n 4 ) O(t⋅n+n4) with t the number of input trinets and n the number of leaves. We also show that there is a fundamental obstruction to constructing level-3 networks from trinets, and so new approaches will need to be developed for constructing level-3 and higher level-networks.},

Each target sensor is associated with a handling time and each dispatched data mule must return to the depot before time span D . Our main contribution is as follows. First, we give the first constant-factor 2-approximation algorithm and a bicriteria polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for the DMSTC defined on a tree. The former result resolves an open problem proposed in the literature (Chen et al., 2020 [4] ). This is achieved by an approximation preserving reduction from the DMSTC to the distance constrained vehicle routing problem, i.e. a special case of the DMSTC with zero handling times. Second, we show that our approximation preserving reduction can be extended to the multi-depot version of the DMSTC and derive a similar bicriteria PTAS for the multi-depot DMSTC on a tree if the number of depots is a fixed constant. Finally, we consider the uniform DMSTC, which is a particular case of the DMSTC with all handling times identical, and develop the first non-trivial polynomial algorithms for the uniform DMSTC define on several classes of special networks, including spiders, paths and cycles.},

This typically requires these languages to be extended with a downcast operator, which is a common operator in statically-typed languages but not in dynamically-typed languages. Our objective is to investigate an approach for static type checking of object-oriented languages that does not require such an additional downcast operator. We systematically weaken the rules for static type checking to avoid reporting errors that can be resolved using downcast operators. This leads to an approach similar to quasi-static typing that enables to make type annotations stricter in a gradual way. These static type checking rules can be applied to dynamically-typed languages by interpreting the dynamic type as the top of the subtype relation. Based on these ideas we have implemented a static type checker for the dynamically-typed, object-oriented language POOSL without introducing a downcast operator. Practical experiences with this type checker indicate that it is useful for early validation.},

Given a set { S 1 , … , S k } {S1,…,Sk} of k strings of total length n , we are asked to find, for each string S i Si , i ∈ [ 1 , k ] i∈[1,k] , its longest suffix that is a prefix of string S j Sj , for all j ≠ i j≠i , j ∈ [ 1 , k ] j∈[1,k] . Several algorithms running in the optimal O ( n + k 2 ) O(n+k2) time for solving APSP are known. All of these algorithms are based on suffix sorting and thus require space Ω ( n ) Ω(n) in any case. We consider the parameterized version of the APSP problem, denoted by ℓ -APSP, in which we are asked to output only the pairs whose suffix/prefix overlap is of length at least ℓ . We give an algorithm for solving ℓ -APSP that runs in the optimal O ( n + | OUTPUT ℓ | ) O(n+|OUTPUTℓ|) time using O ( n ) O(n) space, where OUTPUT ℓ OUTPUTℓ is the set of output pairs. Our algorithm is thus optimal for the APSP problem as well by setting ℓ = 0 ℓ=0 . Notably, our algorithm is fundamentally different from all optimal algorithms solving the APSP problem: it does not rely on sorting the suffixes of all input strings but on a novel traversal of the Aho-Corasick machine, and it thus requires space linear in the size of the machine.},

As concrete applications, by combining our new lower bound with known spectral independence computations and known coupling arguments: (1) we show that for a triangle-free graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) with maximum degree Δ ≥ 3 Δ≥3 , the Glauber dynamics for the uniform distribution on proper k -colorings with k ≥ ( 1.763 … + δ ) Δ k≥(1.763…+δ)Δ colors has spectral gap Ω ˜ δ ( | V | − 1 ) Ω˜δ(|V|−1) . Previously, such a result was known either if the girth of G is at least 5 (Dyer et al. (2004) [12] ), or under restrictions on Δ (Chen et al. (2021) [7] ; Hayes and Vigoda (2003) [18] ). (2) We show for the binomial random graph G ( n , d / n ) G(n,d/n) with d = O ( 1 ) d=O(1) , with high probability, an approximately uniformly random matching may be sampled in time O d ( n 2 + o ( 1 ) ) Od(n2+o(1)) . This improves the corresponding running time of O ˜ d ( n 3 ) O˜d(n3) due to Jerrum and Sinclair (1989) [22] ; Jerrum (2003) [21] .},

The t -admissibility problem is NP -complete for σ T ( G ) ≤ t σT(G)≤t , t ≥ 4 t≥4 . We develop strategies and implementations of two exact brute-force algorithms: sequential and parallel, in such a way that we propose parallel strategies for generating all spanning trees of a graph. We also propose two greedy heuristics to obtain solutions for the t -admissibility problem. We evaluate these implementations on random Barabási-Albert graphs, Erdös-Rényi graphs, Watts-Strogatz graphs and Bipartite graphs. Moreover, we determine graph classes for which the heuristics lead us to the stretch index value, such as split graphs, cographs and p -cycle power graphs.},

  abstract     = {In [1] , Kumar et al. proposed an enhanced and secured RSA public key cryptosystem (ESRPKC) algorithm using Chinese remainder theorem. In their scheme, the public key is defined as ( N , e , μ ) (N,e,μ) where N is the product of four distinct large prime numbers, e is a public exponent, and μ is a parameter called encryption key to encrypt the message. Compared to the traditional RSA cryptosystem, the authors used the extra parameter μ , and claimed that security increased due to this extra parameter. They claimed that it is required to use a brute force attack to break the system even if the number N is factorized by an adversary to obtain the private parameters k 1 k1 and k 2 k2 which are components of μ . The authors claimed that ESRPKC is a highly secure and not easily breakable scheme compared to the traditional RSA scheme. In this paper, we do a cryptanalysis on Kumar et al.&#39;s scheme given in [1] and demonstrate some major security weaknesses. We prove that if N is factorized, there is no need to use brute force to break the system. Additionally, choosing four prime numbers instead of two prime numbers decreases the security significantly and only increases the computation time. Therefore, the proposed system (ESRPKC) is not as efficient as the traditional RSA algorithm.},

We consider the notion of global minimality in this paper. We are interested in globally minimal defensive alliance of maximum size. This problem is known to be NP-hard but its parameterized complexity remains open until now. We enhance our understanding of the problem from the viewpoint of parameterized complexity by showing that the Globally Minimal Defensive Alliance problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the treewidth of the graph.

For any dataset X ⊆ R d X⊆Rd , integer k ≥ 1 k≥1 , and a precision parameter ε &gt; 0 ε&amp;gt;0 , let L ( X , k , ε ) L(X,k,ε) denote the smallest integer such that Δ ( X , L ( X , k , ε ) ) ≤ ε ⋅ Δ ( X , k ) Δ(X,L(X,k,ε))≤ε⋅Δ(X,k) .

The binary Gaussian distribution D Z + , σ 2 DZ+,σ2 is a special discrete Gaussian distribution with σ 2 = 1 / ( 2 ln ⁡ 2 ) σ2=1/(2ln⁡2) and μ = 0 μ=0 over the set of non-negative integers Z + Z+ , and a sampling algorithm for D Z + , σ 2 DZ+,σ2 can be used as the base sampler in a generic algorithm based on rejection sampling for any discrete Gaussian distribution over the integers. We present a constant-time algorithm for sampling from the binary Gaussian distribution D Z + , σ 2 DZ+,σ2 . It requires no precomputation storage and mainly relies on bitwise operations, which could be more hardware-friendly. Its computational complexity is lower than that of the algorithm based on the full-tree Knuth-Yao method, and its entropy consumption is smaller than that of the full-table access algorithm based on a cumulative distribution table. The Rényi-divergence based security analysis of our constant-time algorithm can also be simplified.},

  abstract     = {In 1979 Valiant introduced the complexity class VNP of p-definable families of polynomials, he defined the reduction notion known as p-projection and he proved that the permanent polynomial and the Hamiltonian cycle polynomial are VNP-complete under p-projections. In 2001 Mulmuley and Sohoni (and independently Bürgisser) introduced the notion of border complexity to the study of the algebraic complexity of polynomials. In this algebraic machine model, instead of insisting on exact computation, approximations are allowed. This gives VNP the structure of a topological space. In this short note we study the set VNPC of VNP-complete polynomials. We show that the complement VNP ∖ VNPC lies dense in VNP. Quite surprisingly, we also prove that VNPC lies dense in VNP. We prove analogous statements for the complexity classes VF, VBP, and VP. The density of VNP ∖ VNPC holds for several different reduction notions: p-projections, border p-projections, c-reductions, and border c-reductions. We compare the relationships of the completeness notions under these reductions and separate most of the corresponding sets. Border reduction notions were introduced by Bringmann, Ikenmeyer, and Zuiddam ((2018) [7] ). Our paper is the first structured study of border reduction notions.},

  abstract     = {The k -path problem asks whether a given graph contains a simple path of length k . Along with other prominent parameterized problems, it reduces to the problem of detecting multilinear terms of degree k ( k -MLD), making the latter a fundamental problem in parameterized algorithms. This has generated significant efforts directed at devising fast deterministic algorithms for k -MLD, and there are now at least two independent approaches that yield the same record bound on the running time. Namely the combinatorial representative-set based approach of Fomin et al. (JACM&#39;16), and the algebraic techniques of Pratt (FOCS&#39;19) and Brand and Pratt (ICALP&#39;21). In this note, we explore the relationship between the latter results, based on partial differentials, and a previous algebraic approach based on the exterior algebra (Brand, ESA&#39;19; Brand, Dell and Husfeldt, STOC&#39;18). We do so by studying the relevant algebraic objects. These are on the one hand (1) the subalgebras of the tensor square of the exterior algebra generated in degree one. On the other hand, we consider (2) the space of partial derivatives of generic determinants, and closely related, (3) the space of minors of generic matrices. We prove that (2) arises as a quotient of (1), and that there is an isomorphism between the objects (1) and (3). Hence, the techniques are essentially equivalent, and the quotient relation between (2) and both of (1) and (3) hints at a possible refinement of the techniques.},

For a collection B B of bicolorings of P , a geometric system of unbiased representatives (G-SUR) is a subset O ′ ⊆ O O′⊆O such that for any bicoloring B of B B there is an object in O ′ O′ that is balanced with respect to B . We pose and study problems on finding G-SURs. We obtain general bounds on the size of G-SURs consisting of intervals, size-restricted intervals, axis-parallel boxes and Euclidean balls. We show that the G-SUR problem is NP -Hard even in the simple case of points on a line and interval ranges. Furthermore, we study a related problem on determining the size of the largest and smallest balanced intervals for points on the real line with a random distribution and coloring. Our results are a natural extension to a geometric context of the work initiated by Balachandran et al. (Discrete Mathematics, 2018) on arbitrary systems of unbiased representatives.},

This is class-optimal , i.e., there are rooted trees that require log 2 ⁡ ( n + 1 ) log2⁡(n+1) width, but not instance-optimal , i.e., for some trees the drawing uses much more width than required. In this paper, we study how to find upward drawings with instance-optimal width.

It is well known that any permutation of [ n ] [n] contains an increasing or a decreasing subsequence of at least n n elements. A classical proof of this result is the following [6] : To every σ i σi assign the coordinates f ( σ i ) = ( x i , y i ) f(σi)=(xi,yi) on the plane, where x i xi is the length of a longest increasing subsequence of Σ ending at σ i σi , and y i yi is the length of a longest decreasing subsequence of Σ starting at σ i σi . Then it is easy to see that at least one point in f ( Σ ) = { f ( σ i ) : i = 1 , … , n } f(Σ)={f(σi):i=1,…,n} has its x or y -coordinate greater than or equal to n n . In this paper, we characterize the point sets S in N 2 N2 such that S = f ( Σ ) S=f(Σ) for some permutation Σ. Furthermore, given a set S of n points in N 2 N2 , we give an O ( n log ⁡ n ) O(nlog⁡n) -time algorithm to obtain, if it exists, a permutation Σ such that f ( Σ ) = S f(Σ)=S . Additionally, we show that by slightly modifying S , the permutation Σ always exists and can be found in O ( n log ⁡ n ) O(nlog⁡n) time. Our results can be used, for example, to encrypt keywords by generating permutations from which the keywords can be recovered.},

The birthday problem can be modeled as sampling balls with replacement until one is sampled twice. In the classical scenario, balls are sampled uniformly. Inspired by the analysis of algorithms solving certain discrete logarithms, Galbraith and Holmes considered the non-uniform birthday problem and gave an estimate on the number of sampling before having a collision up to the dominating term. In this paper, we give a refined analysis to the non-uniform birthday problem, and apply it to the analysis of an algorithm solving certain discrete logarithm problem. Experiment results suggest that parameter selection following this refined analysis performs better than related work.},

  abstract     = {Data transmissions are often subjected to errors due to the noise in the channel. Due to the possibility of errors in the received word, it is important to be able to correct the received word to the word having the best likelihood to be the sent codeword. In this work, we propose the idea of using words sharing the same Parikh matrix (namely, M -equivalent words) as codewords. The Hamming distance for binary and ternary M -equivalent words is studied in detail. Two types of defects in the received word are considered, namely erasure and error. We show that the associated Parikh matrix is able to correct the received word having up to a certain number of erasures and errors. It is also shown that there exists an arbitrarily large M -equivalence class having a minimal Hamming distance of eight, which we reasonably expect to be the largest attainable value.},

Vertex-minors have been the subject of intense study in graph theory over the last decades and have found applications in other fields such as quantum information theory . Therefore it is natural to consider the computational complexity of deciding whether a given graph G has a vertex-minor isomorphic to another graph H . Here we prove that this decision problem is NP-complete, even when restricting H and G to be circle graphs, a class of graphs that has a natural relation to vertex-minors.},

We use parity filters as post-processing blocks and improve results on the required minimal parity filter size to obtain a given target entropy. In addition, we see in numerical experiments that these models are robust in the sense that the minimal required size of a parity filter to exceed a given entropy bound does not change when weakening the assumption on the reference clock; i.e. when considering jittered instead of perfect reference clocks.},

For the settings of uniformly related machines, it is known that such algorithms cannot maintain an optimal solution (for general input sequences). Thus, we consider the semi-online case where the job sequence has non-increasing job sizes and design an optimal algorithm with migration factor 1. Previously such result was known only for the case of identical machines where it holds for an arbitrary input sequence.},

A hub layer is configured by establishing hubs at selected nodes at considerable cost so that the routes between hubs can be operated cheaply. The remaining edges in the network are operated at regular cost. The resulting problem is to determine the set of nodes to open hubs and the set of edges to establish in order to find a network of minimum total cost. We consider the case where the network is required to form a Steiner tree spanning a given set of terminal vertices. When edge costs are non-metric, we show logarithmic approximation hardness even for the special case of spanning trees. On the other hand, we show a polynomial-time reduction for Steiner trees to its corresponding node-weighted version thus proving a logarithmic approximation factor. When edge costs are metric, we show the problem is only a constant factor harder to approximate than its original version (with no hub installation) using a similar reduction.},

In that setting, vertices are often assumed to lie on a horizontal line and edges are drawn as semicircles above said line. For trees, various algorithms are available to solve the problem in polynomial time in n = | V | n=|V| . There exist variants of the MLA in which the arrangements are constrained. Iordanskii, and later Hochberg and Stallmann (HS), put forward O ( n ) O(n) -time algorithms that solve the problem when arrangements are constrained to be planar (also known as one-page book embeddings). We also consider linear arrangements of rooted trees that are constrained to be projective (planar embeddings where the root is not covered by any edge). Gildea and Temperley (GT) sketched an algorithm for projective arrangements which they claimed runs in O ( n ) O(n) but did not provide any justification of its cost. In contrast, Park and Levy claimed that GT&#39;s algorithm runs in O ( n log ⁡ d m a x ) O(nlog⁡dmax) where d m a x dmax is the maximum degree but did not provide sufficient detail. Here we correct an error in HS&#39;s algorithm for the planar case, show its relationship with the projective case, and derive simple algorithms for the projective and planar cases that run without a doubt in O ( n ) O(n) time.},

In order to improve its slow diffusion, several design ideas have been proposed. In this contribution, we explore the (im)possibility of further improving the round diffusion of GFS by modifying its round permutations. First, we generalize a technique called sub-block dividing, which further divides each sub-block into smaller blocks. We prove that the diffusion round of a round permutation with sub-block dividing is four, regardless of the number of sub-blocks. Moreover, we show that the round diffusion of GFS can be improved by alternately using two different round permutations instead of a single permutation. We present the first results that, by using two round permutations, 10- and 12-block GFS partially and fully reach the lower bounds on the diffusion round, respectively.},

The Δ-vertex cover number is the minimum number ν such that the classical vertex cover number of the union of any Δ consecutive layers of the temporal graph is upper-bounded by ν .

Here, a vertex v is d -distance dominated by another vertex u means the shortest path distance between u and v is at most d in G . A set U is d -distance dominated by a set of ℓ vertices means size of the union of the d -distance neighborhood of all vertices of U in V ′ V′ is at least ℓ . The objective of the d -distance m -tuple ( ℓ , r ℓ,r )-domination problem is to find a minimum size subset V ′ ⊆ V V′⊆V satisfying the above two conditions.

With atomic registers every read or write operation is instantaneous (and thus indivisible). As pointed out by Golab, Higham, and Woelfel (2011), however, a randomized algorithm that works with atomic registers does not necessarily work if we replace the atomic registers that it uses with linearizable implementations of registers. This raises the following question: does the randomized consensus algorithm by Aspnes and Herlihy still work against a strong adversary if we replace its atomic registers with linearizable registers? We show that the answer is affirmative; in fact we show that even linearizable registers are not necessary. More precisely, we prove that the algorithm by Aspnes and Herlihy works against a strong adversary even if the algorithm uses only regular registers.},

It is known that, when S is over an alphabet of size σ and is given in an online manner, then the palindromic tree of S can be constructed in O ( n log ⁡ σ ) O(nlog⁡σ) time with O ( n ) O(n) space. In this paper, we consider the sliding window version of the problem: For a sliding window of length at most d , we present two versions of an algorithm which maintains the palindromic tree of size O ( d ) O(d) for every sliding window S [ i . . j ] S[i..j] over S , where 1 ≤ j − i + 1 ≤ d 1≤j−i+1≤d . The first version works in O ( n log ⁡ σ ′ ) O(nlog⁡σ′) time with O ( d ) O(d) space where σ ′ ≤ d σ′≤d is the maximum number of distinct characters in the windows, and the second one works in O ( n + d σ ) O(n+dσ) time with ( d + 2 ) σ + O ( d ) (d+2)σ+O(d) space.

In this work, we revisit adversaries&#39; abilities defined by Verma et al. and show that the PFCBPS scheme cannot resist the signature forgery attack performed by a malicious proxy signer (a weak Type II adversary). As a result, the above signature scheme cannot be deployed in practical IIoT applications. Moreover, we discuss the reason for such an attack and provide an improved scheme PFCBPS + .},

  abstract     = {A colouring of a graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) is a mapping c : V → { 1 , 2 , … } c:V→{1,2,…} such that c ( u ) ≠ c ( v ) c(u)≠c(v) for every two adjacent vertices u and v of G . The List k -Colouring problem is to decide whether a graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) with a list L ( u ) ⊆ { 1 , … , k } L(u)⊆{1,…,k} for each u ∈ V u∈V has a colouring c such that c ( u ) ∈ L ( u ) c(u)∈L(u) for every u ∈ V u∈V . Let P t Pt be the path on t vertices and let K 1 , s 1 K1,s1 be the graph obtained from the ( s + 1 ) (s+1) -vertex star K 1 , s K1,s by subdividing each of its edges exactly once. Recently, Chudnovsky, Spirkl and Zhong (Discrete Math. 2020) proved that List 3 -Colouring is polynomial-time solvable for ( K 1 , s 1 , P t ) (K1,s1,Pt) -free graphs for every t ≥ 1 t≥1 and s ≥ 1 s≥1 . We generalize their result to List k -Colouring for every k ≥ 1 k≥1 . Our result also generalizes the known result that for every k ≥ 1 k≥1 and s ≥ 0 s≥0 , List k -Colouring is polynomial-time solvable for ( s P 1 + P 5 ) (sP1+P5) -free graphs, which was proven for s = 0 s=0 by Hoàng, Kamiński, Lozin, Sawada and Shu (Algorithmica 2010) and for every s ≥ 1 s≥1 by Couturier, Golovach, Kratsch and Paulusma (Algorithmica 2015). We show our result by proving boundedness of an underlying width parameter. Namely, we show that for every k ≥ 1 k≥1 , s ≥ 1 s≥1 , t ≥ 1 t≥1 , the class of ( K k , K 1 , s 1 , P t ) (Kk,K1,s1,Pt) -free graphs has bounded mim-width and that a corresponding branch decomposition is “quickly computable” for these graphs.},

The task is to find a walk which starts at the source vertex s , visits, in any order, all waypoints, ends at the destination vertex t , respects edge capacities, that is, traverses each edge at most as many times as is its capacity, and minimizes the cost computed as the sum of costs of traversed edges with multiplicities. We study the problem for graphs of bounded treewidth and present a new algorithm for the problem working in 2 O ( tw ) ⋅ n 2O(tw)⋅n time, significantly improving upon the previously known algorithms. We also show that this running time is optimal for the problem under Exponential Time Hypothesis.},

All jobs belong to two agents A and B, and each job is arriving over time, which means that no information of the job is known in advance before its arrival. The objective is to schedule all jobs on a single machine such that the linear combination of the makespans of the two agents, i.e. C max A + θ C max B ( θ ≥ 1 ) CmaxA+θCmaxB(θ≥1) , is minimized. For the problem, we propose an online algorithm and show the competitive ratio of the algorithm is 1 + 2 θ + θ 2 2 + 2 θ + θ 2 1+2θ+θ22+2θ+θ2 .},
