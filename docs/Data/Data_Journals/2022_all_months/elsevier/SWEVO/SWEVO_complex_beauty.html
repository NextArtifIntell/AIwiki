  abstract     = {The task to simulate realistic absorption spectra of electronic transitions in pigment molecules takes the form of the art of optimization, particularly if one must choose between the quality of the results obtained and the calculation time necessary to get such quality. The semiclassical theory of optical response provides us with a good opportunity to escape a so-called sum-over-state procedure of considering the innumerable number of vibronic states of a pigment by applying a correlation function approach. This approach, known as the multimode Brownian oscillator model (MBOM), involves replacing an infinite set of vibronic states, which interacts with an electronic transition, with a finite set of effective vibronic modes. Thus, the parameters of effective vibronic modes and an electronic transition can be found only by fitting experimental data . This situation gives rise to the following problem: as the number of free parameters increases, it becomes more difficult to find a single solution. To overcome this obstacle, differential evolution (DE), a method of global optimization, which is based on the idea of natural selection, seems to be the right choice. To test the efficiency of DE in solving quantum mechanical problems, we simulated absorption spectra of astaxanthin (AST) in 18 different organic solvents by using the MBOM. To do so, we developed software that implements both the DE algorithm and linear absorption modeling procedures. We have shown that simulating practically identical AST spectra, DE allows determining the effect of polar and nonpolar solvents on several parameters of MBOM of AST with high accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Taguchi method This paper presents a novel particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) variant to tackle single-objective numerical optimization, named “Lévy flight orthogonal learning particle swarm optimization” (LOPSO). There are three contributions mentioned in the paper: First, a novel PSO based on Lévy flight and orthogonal learning with enhanced exploitation ability and faster search efficiency is proposed. The jumping ability of Lévy flight is utilized to enhance the exploration, while the orthogonal learning process aims to strengthen the exploitation; Second, an orthogonal learning process for particle swarms is developed. In the orthogonal learning process, the Lévy flight term&#39;s inclusion in the Taguchi method levels is determined based on the flight probability value. Besides, parallel computation is easier to perform during orthogonal learning, which greatly improves efficiency. Third, each particle in the proposed LOPSO learns from the only best experience generated by a new search strategy instead of the historical best experience of each particle and the global best experience that is used in the classical PSO variants, thus avoiding the conflict between the above two guides. A large test suite containing benchmarks from the CEC2013 and the CEC2015 test suites on real-parameter single-objective optimization is employed in the algorithm validation, and extensive experiments demonstrate that the comprehensive performance of LOPSO ranks first in terms of accuracy and Wilcoxon signed-rank test in most cases with the same population size and iteration steps and similar time consumption, when compared with the canonical PSO and 13 state-of-the-art PSO variants.},

  abstract     = {Swarm intelligence is a discipline that studies the collective behavior that is produced by local interactions of a group of individuals with each other and with their environment. In Computer Science domain, numerous swarm intelligence techniques are applied to optimization problems that seek to efficiently find best solutions within a search space. Gradual pattern mining is another Computer Science field that could benefit from the efficiency of swarm based optimization techniques in the task of finding gradual patterns from a huge search space. A gradual pattern is a rule-based correlation that describes the gradual relationship among the attributes of a data set. For example, given attributes { G , H } {G,H} of a data set a gradual pattern may take the form: “ the less G, the more H ” (simply denoted as { G ↓ , H ↑ } {G↓,H↑} ). In this paper, we propose a numeric encoding for gradual pattern candidates that we use to define an effective search space. In addition, we present a systematic study of several meta-heuristic optimization techniques as efficient solutions to the problem of finding gradual patterns using our search space.},

  abstract     = {Human factors , including worker flexibility and learning–forgetting effects, are crucial factors in modern manufacturing systems to reduce costs and improve efficiency. However, traditional flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) only considers machine flexibility and ignores human factors. Therefore, this paper originally investigates a multi-objective FJSP considering human factors (MO-FJSPHF) to simultaneously minimize makespan, maximum machine workload, and total machine workload. Firstly, a multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is established based on the characteristics of the MO-FJSPHF. Then, a multi-objective memetic algorithm based on learning and decomposition (MOMA-LD) is proposed to solve the model by incorporating the learning-based adaptive local search into the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). In MOMA-LD, the machine learning technique determines which solutions deserve to perform the local search. Meanwhile, the computational resources are allocated dynamically based on the degree of population convergency during the evolutionary process. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms four state-of-the-art algorithms on forty-three test instances and three real-world cases from a casting workshop. The validity of the proposed MINLP model is examined by the exact solver Gurobi.},

However, evidences observed in recent contributions confirm that there are critical aspects that are not properly addressed to date. This short communication aims to engage the readership around a reflection on these issues, and to provide rationale why they remain unsolved. Specifically, we emphasize on three critical points of Evolutionary Multitasking Optimization: (i) the plausibility and practical applicability of this paradigm; (ii) the novelty of some proposed multitasking methods; and (iii) the methodologies used for evaluating newly proposed multitasking algorithms. As a result of this research, we conclude that some important efforts should be directed by the community in order to keep the future of this promising field on the right track. Our ultimate purpose is to unveil gaps in the current literature, so that prospective works can attempt to fix these gaps, avoiding to stumble on the same stones and eventually achieve valuable advances in the area.},

  abstract     = {Today, transportation has become a vital service due to increased competition among businesses. In this regard, customer service is one of the major challenges of logistics units. Companies can improve logistics costs, capacity utilization, service levels, and customer satisfaction by sharing new demands. The need for fast, flexible, reliable, and low-cost delivery is another challenge in urban areas for the distribution of goods. As demand increases, more vehicles are needed to deliver goods and congestion increases in urban transportation networks. A feeder vehicle routing problem (FVRP) consists of a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles, including trucks and motorcycles. In this problem, motorcycles pass easily in crowded areas, and the traffic of urban logistics is distributed easily. More importantly, it reduces the number of returns to the physical depot, lowers the costs, and leads to time savings. This study introduces the real-time collaborative feeder vehicle routing problem (RTCFVRP) with flexible time windows in which vehicles are permitted to serve customers before and after the time window. We propose the mixed-integer linear programming model with the CPLEX mathematical programming solver applying the augmented epsilon constraint. Also, multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and MOPSO-variable neighborhood search (MOPSO-VNS) were developed regarding the complexity of the problem. The performance of these algorithms was compared with Pareto solutions generated by the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) in both static and dynamic modes. Finally, in addition to statistical analysis, the AHP-TOPSIS method is employed to analyze and prioritize algorithms. The obtained results show the better performance of the proposed algorithm in both static and dynamic modes in small and large-size instances.},

  abstract     = {Previous studies on production scheduling have neglected the impact of the supply mode of inventory allocation on the arrangement of production resources and guiding significance of delivery information to the demand side. To fill these gaps, this study investigates a collaborative scheduling model of production resources and spare parts inventory to satisfy the spare parts requirements of demand-side distributed equipment, and we propose feedback guidance based on delivery information to reduce the negative impact of delayed spare parts. The feedback guidance adopts an optimal operating strategy to reduce the capacity loss of the equipment corresponding to the delayed spare parts. An optimization objective , referred to as the total capacity loss of all distributed equipment, is introduced to visually display the effect of the scheduling scheme on the demand side. Another objective is to minimize the total service cost of the service provider, including the inventory, transportation, and tardiness costs. A modified restarted iterated Pareto greedy algorithm is proposed to solve the model. Based on the problem characteristics, certain effective operators, including two problem-dependent local-search operators and a modified idle-time insertion method , are designed to improve the search performance. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, including the feedback guidance and proposed operators. Finally, the impact of different inventory levels on the service provider and demand side is analyzed, and the results indicate that the collaborative mode can effectively reduce inventory.},

The CCM operator is used in CCM-BBO to establish Eigen coordinate system and enables the migration operator independent on fixed coordinate system . By embedding CCM operator into BBO, the migration operator is implemented in the Eigen coordinate system to enhance the rotation invariance of BBO. To verify the performance of CCM operator, CCM-BBO has been applied to three state-of-the-art variants of BBO: SBBO , DE/BBO and EMBBO. The experimental results on 25 benchmark functions of CEC2005, 10 benchmark functions of CEC2020, and a real-world intrusion detection optimization problem have demonstrated that CCM-BBO is an effective framework to enhance the performance of BBO.},

This paper explores the properties of the two mainstream selection operators and designs an ensemble approach, striving to integrate their merits and complement each other’s weaknesses. In this ensemble approach, each selection operator manipulates a population, and the offspring solutions reproduced by any population update two populations concurrently. In this way, high-quality offspring solutions reproduced by one population have opportunities to improve the convergence or diversity of another population. Moreover, this ensemble approach includes a novel adaptive strategy to pick up mating solutions from each population according to their contributions during previous generations. Thus, the population with a higher contribution will receive more evolution opportunities to reproduce solutions with better convergence and diversity. Finally, we compare the proposal with twelve baseline algorithms on 43 test cases from four frequently-used test suites and the real-world application of cloud service compositions. The comparison results demonstrate the superiority of the proposal in balancing diversity and convergence.},

  abstract     = {Gene expression programming (GEP) is a commonly used approach for solving symbolic regression (SR) problems. However, GEP often falls into a local optimum. GEP also randomly searches for results and could revisit low value search spaces, which impacts its performance. To overcome the two problems, we propose a new algorithm using an adversarial bandit (AB) technique to enhance GEP and the new algorithm is named AB-GEP. AB-GEP segments the mathematical expression space into many subspaces. It then leverages a new search space selection method, AvgExp3, to enhance the population jump between subspaces. This prevents the algorithm from falling into a local optimum. AvgExp3 dynamically estimates a subspace by the rewards generated in the search space. The dynamical reward estimation makes AB-GEP more adaptive to reward changes and it also provides guidance for AB-GEP to choose a subspace that could contain the correct results. This study proves that AvgExp3 is an unbiased estimation of the average rewards of subspace, and its variance is lower than the standard Exp3 method. The evaluation on two benchmark datasets shows that AB-GEP can maintain better population diversity and obtain better results than three traditional GEPs, GEP, SL-GEP, and SPJ-GEP. AB-GEP ranks top in 50\% of the 32 benchmarks, while one of the traditional GEPs only gets no more than 20\% of the best results. We release our code at https://github.com/kgae-cup/ab-gep .},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a robust method to improve the search performance of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) using a Pareto-based archiving mechanism and a crowding distance-based archive handling mechanism. The aim of the proposed method is to provide a sustainable diversity in the objective and decision spaces and to establish a stable exploitation-exploration balance in both spaces. To this purpose: 1) reference space combinations are defined, 2) strategies consisting of reference space combinations are developed to improve the performance of the crowding-distance calculation, and 3) a dynamic switching mechanism is proposed to implement these strategies. In the proposed DSC method, non-dominated solutions are represented in three different reference spaces: the decision space, the objective space, and the unified result of these two spaces. Binary combinations of these three spaces were created and strategies using different reference spaces were developed. The switching mechanism was designed to implement these strategies dynamically. Crowding-distance calculation was performed with reference to the space vector selected by this switching mechanism. The proposed DSC method was tested on multimodal multi-objective optimization problems (MMOPs) and real-world engineering problems incorporating both alternating current optimal power flow (AC-OPF) and alternating current/direct current optimal power flow (AC/DC-OPF). According to the experimental study results, the proposed DSC-MOAGDE algorithm has about 30\% better success rate on MMOPs compared to its competitors. Similarly, the proposed method was able to optimize cost by 6.66\%, 24.15\%, 52.13\%, 56.72\%, and 120.21\% better than the MMODE_ICD, MO_RING_PSO_SCD, MOAGDE, NSWOA and SSMOPSO algorithms in AC-OPF and AC/DC-OPF real-world problems.

  abstract     = {Differential evolution (DE) has recently attracted a lot of attention as a simple and powerful numerical optimization approach for solving various real-world applications. However, the performance of DE is significantly influenced by the configuration of control parameters and mutation strategy. To address this issue, we proposed reinforcement learning-based hybrid parameters and mutation strategies differential evolution (RL-HPSDE) in this paper. The RL-HPSDE is based on the Q-learning framework, the population individual is regarded as an agent. The optimization problem&#39;s dynamic fitness landscape analysis results are utilized to represent the environmental states. The ensemble of parameters and mutation strategy is employed as optional actions for the agent. Furthermore, a reward function is designed to guide the agent to perform the optimal action strategy. Based on its reinforcement learning experience stored by the corresponding Q table, the agent could adaptively select an optimal combination of mutation strategy and parameters to generate offspring individual during each generation. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using the CEC2017 single objective test function set. Several well-known DE variants are also compared with the proposed algorithm. Empirical studies suggest that the proposed RL-HPSDE algorithm is competitive with all other competitors.},

  abstract     = {We present a new methodology called J-SIGMA to infer state change information using the minimum Jensen–Shannon distance to describe a continuous optimization problem as a Boltzmannian system, as well as its applications to population-based metaheuristics . In general, a Boltzmannian system describes a macrostate from the statistics of the constituent microstate where the minimum energy is the most probable. If we model an optimization problem as a Boltzmann process, the global optimum would be the most probable state. To achieve this, we propose an analytical derivation of the minimum distance to the Boltzmann distribution using the parameters μ μ and σ 2 σ2 to fit this model. As a case study, we implemented the J-SIGMA methodology on three families of population-based metaheuristics : Swarm , Evolutionary, and Estimation of Distribution, and used a set of continuous optimization functions from CEC’17 to evaluate their performance against other metaheuristics of each family. Finally, from a statistical analysis of the convergence performance, the evidence is shown to affirm that the J-SIGMA methodology can significantly improve the convergence performance of the algorithms, regardless of the metaheuristic family to which it belongs.},

  abstract     = {Multi-objective stochastic simulation optimization plays an important role in designing complex engineering systems. To identify optimal solutions via simulations, Bayesian optimization , which utilizes metamodels and an acquisition function to determine the next design point, has been popular in machine learning . However, studies on Bayesian optimization of multi-objective stochastic simulation are limited and can give undesired performances in terms of convergence and diversity metrics. Moreover, direct extension of Bayesian optimization algorithms of deterministic responses is unrealistic as stochastic responses are observed with heterogeneous noise. To handle these issues, we propose a novel framework for Bayesian optimization of multiple stochastic responses. Stochastic kriging metamodels are constructed independently for multiple stochastic responses considering heterogeneous simulation noise. To remove undesired effects of random simulation noise on comparing solutions, quantiles of stochastic kriging metamodels are employed to define the Pareto dominance. Acquisition functions are proposed by integrating the hypervolume-based and probability-of-improvement (PoI)-based acquisition functions from deterministic multi-objective optimization with typical acquisition functions from univariate stochastic response optimization. This not only enhances the convergence and diversity of Pareto-optimal solutions but also properly handles heterogeneous noise. Exact calculation formulas of the proposed algorithms are further developed. Typical numerical cases and two engineering examples (a rocket injector design example and a real inventory design scenario) demonstrate that the proposed algorithms give better Pareto-optimal solutions of which the proximity to true Pareto fronts and the diversity are improved.},

As DL structure is problem-dependent and it has the crucial impact on its performance, it is still necessary to re-design the structures of DL according to the actual needs, even there exists various benchmark DL structures. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) which can design the DL network automatically has been widely investigated. However, many NAS methods suffer from the huge computation time. To overcome this drawback, this research proposed a new Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search with RepVGG nodes (EvoNAS-Rep). Firstly, a new encoding strategy is developed, which can map the fixed-length encoding individual to DL structure with variable depth using RepVGG nodes. Secondly, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is adopted for searching the optimal individual and its corresponding DL model. Thirdly, the iterative training process is designed to train the DL model and to evolve the GA simultaneously. The proposed EvoNAS-Rep is validated on the famous CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100. The results show that EvoNAS-Rep has obtained 96.35\% and 79.82\% with only near 0.2 GPU days, which is both effectiveness and efficiency. EvoNAS-Rep is also validated on two real-world applications, including the NEU-CLS and the Chest XRay 2017 datasets, and the results show that EvoNAS-Rep has achieved the competitive results.},

However, little attention has been paid to differentiated production resources for distributed production scheduling. This paper studies an energy and labor-aware distributed heterogeneous hybrid flow shop scheduling problem (ELDHHFSP). The heterogeneous factors, i.e. different numbers and capabilities of machines, time-of-use electricity price, labor shift, salary and bonus of workers, are included in the ELDHHFSP. The mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model of ELDHHFSP is presented with the objectives of minimization of total tardiness, total production cost, and total carbon emission. A network memetic algorithm (NMA) is proposed for the ELDHHFSP from the solution and strategy space. The NMA mainly includes two critical parts, i.e., probability network model and learning-based local search, corresponding to global and local search. A probability network model is established to guide the search towards the optimal regions from different directions by employing multiple objective weight vectors . The sampling part samples from the probability matrix of each node in the network to construct new solutions. The learning-based local search integrates several local search operators and a reward learning mechanism is designed to find suitable local search operators when evolutionary. A comprehensive experiment on extensive testing instances is conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the probability network and local-learning strategy. The comparison of NMA and other related algorithms shows the effectiveness and efficiency of NMA.},

PECP is highly constrained by multiple practical constraints, and requires a long time to converge to the optimal or near-optimal solution, as the evolutionary method used to solve it often encounters a population of infeasible solutions. This study proposes a tailored simplified swarm optimization method (SSO) with two novel mechanisms to solve this problem, and utilizes the problem-specific knowledge of PECP to accelerate the solution process and improve the solution quality. The proposed approach (SSO R&amp;D ) is empirically verified on a set of randomly generated problems, and compared with widely popular evolutionary approaches. SSO R&amp;D can reduce the average of fitness value by at least 26\% performed better than original SSO owing to the two proposed mechanisms. Compared to three other evolutionary methods and their improved versions, SSO R&amp;D outperformed 26 out of 36 instances of PECP in terms of the average of fitness values. Overall, the computational results demonstrate that the proposed approach is highly competitive and performs well in terms of solution quality and convergence rate.},

In this study, we develop three different evolutionary approaches based on tabu search and also develop a CMSA-tabu search (CMSA-TS) hybrid. We conduct experiments on a wide range of d d -regular and scale-free graphs and find that, overall, CMSA-TS is the most effective approach, nearly always finding the best-observed solutions.

Dynamic, constrained, and multimodal properties frequently appear in real-world applications, but the dynamic constrained multimodal optimization problems (DCMMOPs) that simultaneously possess all these properties have not been studied yet. This paper is an extended version of our conference work, aiming to investigate the effect of different techniques for solving DCMMOP.

A parallel technique can be used to parallelly evaluate the true-expensive objective functions in one iteration to boost the execution time. An effective and straightforward approach is to design an acquisition function that can evaluate the performance of a bath of multiple solutions, instead of a single point/solution, in one iteration. This paper proposes five alternatives of Probability of Improvement (PoI) with multiple points in a batch (q-PoI) for multi-objective Bayesian global optimization (MOBGO), taking the covariance among multiple points into account. Both exact computational formulas and the Monte Carlo approximation algorithms for all proposed q-PoIs are provided. Based on the distribution of the multiple points relevant to the Pareto-front, the position-dependent behavior of the five q-PoIs is investigated. Moreover, the five q-PoIs are compared with the other nine state-of-the-art and recently proposed batch MOBGO algorithms on twenty bio-objective benchmarks. The empirical experiments on different variety of benchmarks are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of two greedy q-PoIs ( q-PoI best q-PoI best and q-PoI all q-PoI all ) on low-dimensional problems and the effectiveness of two explorative q-PoIs ( q-PoI one q-PoI one and q-PoI worst q-PoI worst ) on high-dimensional problems with difficult-to-approximate Pareto front boundaries.},

Thus, this paper first introduces a new Dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem (DPDP), which has more practical constraints like dock, time windows, capacity and last-in-first-out loading. This DPDP model can fit the practical scenarios more, which cannot be directly solved by the existing optimization algorithms . To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new V ariable N eighborhood S earch Algorithm with M ultiple local search strategies and an E fficient disturbance, called VNSME. Specifically, each new optimization period is activated when new orders are coming, in which a variable neighborhood search is used to find the best solution for this period. At each start of a period, the best solution found in the previous period is reconstructed as an initial solution for the new period by using exhaustion and cheapest insertion heuristics. Next, four different local search strategies (couple-exchange*, block-exchange*, block-relocate* and multi-relocate*) are designed to search around the initial solution, and then the currently found best solution is further perturbed by a modified 2-opt-L* method. At last, the performance of VNSME is studied on the real-world DPDP benchmarks offered by Huawei in the competition at ICAPS 2021, where the advantages of VNSME are confirmed in the competition as its final score gets the first rank among 153 teams.},

  abstract     = {With their complexity and vast search space, large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (LSMOPs) challenge existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). Recently, several large-scale multiobjective evolutionary algorithms have been developed to tackle LSMOPs. Unlike conventional MOEAs that concentrate on selection operations in the objective space, large-scale MOEAs emphasize operations in the decision space, such as offspring generation, to tackle the large number of decision variables. Nevertheless, most present large-scale MOEAs experience difficulty effectively and efficiently solving LSMOPs with tens of thousands or more decision variables or exhibit poor versatility in solving different LSMOPs. We propose a fast large-scale MOEA framework with reference-guided offspring generation, named FLEA, aiming at these issues. Generally, FLEA constructs several reference vectors in the decision space to steer the sampling of promising solutions during offspring generation. A parameter is used to allocate computation resources between the convergence and diversity of the offspring population adaptively. Without computationally expensive problem reformulation or decision variable analysis techniques, the proposed method can significantly accelerate the search speed of conventional MOEAs in solving LSMOPs. FLEA is examined on various LSMOPs with up to 1.6 million decision variables, demonstrating its superior effectiveness, efficiency, and versatility in large-scale multiobjective optimization .},

  abstract     = {For evolutionary computation, how to balance the convergence and diversity of populations is a challenging problem for solving many-objective optimization problems . In particular, with the increasing of the number of objectives, the non-dominated solutions in the population increase sharply, and there is no sufficient convergence pressure for the population to converge to the true Pareto front . How to solve this problem, we propose a new preferred solution selection strategy by finding non-dominated solutions with better convergence to enhance the convergence pressure of evolution, where a number of special solutions are selected with the best convergence index value from the surviving solutions of the previous generation. The number of special solutions determines the convergence pressure, so an adaptive updating method of the number of special solutions is further proposed to dynamically adjust the convergence pressure of the population, the aim is to guide the convergence direction to the Pareto front . Based on these strategies, we propose a convergence enhanced evolutionary algorithm (CEEA) to balance the convergence and diversity of the search algorithm. A large number of experiments have been carried out on some benchmark many-objective problems with 3–15 objectives, experimental results demonstrate that CEEA has better results compared with some state-of-the-art many-objective evolutionary algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In today&#39;s global economy, distributed manufacturing has become increasingly appropriate. Job setup time is invariably a factor in manufacturing, and needs to be considered when making scheduling decisions. This study aims to minimize the total flow time by solving a distributed permutation flowshop scheduling problem (DPFSP) with a sequence-dependent setup time (SDST) to minimize total flowtime. First, to manage the DPFSP/SDST effectively, we propose a constructive heuristic framework based on the LR heuristic, which contains three constructive heuristics to obtain good initial solutions. Second, a discrete artificial bee colony (DABC) method based on variable neighborhood structures (DABC vns ) is proposed. By analyzing the problem-specific characteristics in the DABC vns , four different neighborhood structures are proposed, which are selectively applied in three stages of DABC vns to obtain more feasible neighborhood solutions. In addition, two variable neighborhood descent algorithms are proposed, which are each based on local search methods. The algorithms are developed to improve the best solution obtained in initial population and the best solution generated in the three stages. Finally, we conduct an experiment to calibrate the parameter of the DABC vns method. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method compared to six other algorithms, comprehensive computational experiments are conducted. The simulation results indicate that the proposed method delivers the best quality solutions for the DPFSP/SDST in the minimization of total flowtime.},

Various constrained multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithms were developed for the CMOPs. However, most of them are ineffective in dealing with CMOPs with complex infeasible regions. In this paper, the two archives assisted push–pull evolutionary algorithm (namely PPTA) is proposed to handle the CMOPs with complex infeasible regions effectively. PPTA has the following features: (i) Two archives ( A A and B B ) are used, where A A is used in the push stage to promote convergence and diversity, and in the pull stage to explore undetected feasible regions; in the pull stage B B is used for the promotion of convergence, diversity, and feasibility. (ii) A new push stage strategy is devised for better approximating the unconstrained Pareto front , as well as the constrained Pareto front . (iii) The aggregation function in the pull stage is improved to better explore the objective space. (iv) a new ɛ ɛ ɛ -constrained method is customized to enhance the ability to explore feasible regions. Results on 33 widely used instances and eight real-world problems verify the superiority of PPTA over 10 related methods.},

  abstract     = {Significant circular hotspot detection (SCHD) aims at identifying those circular regions in a spatial space where the occurrence of a particular activity is uncommonly higher than the surrounding areas. Plentiful societal applications make SCHD a problem of utmost interest. In many domains, detection of the most significant circular hotspot (MSCHD) is of further usefulness. Well-timed detection of the most significant hotspot helps crucially for short term response planning (STRP) in situations like a disease outbreak, police vigilance, etc. State of the art methods like SaTScan, identify circular hotspots by listing all possible circles in the search area, followed by a statistical significance test, making it a very high computational cost problem. Considering their high costs, these methods are inefficient in applications related to STRP. To reduce the computational time of SaTScan, two randomized versions of the SaTScan algorithm are presented in this paper. Further, the MSCHD problem is modeled as an optimization problem and three improved variants of Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO) namely I-PSO, HCL-PSO and Ensemble PSO are applied to detect the most significant hotspots. The comparative and sensitivity analysis are performed using synthetic datasets . The comparative analysis of SaTScan and the presented PSO based schemes is made in terms of the quality of identified hotspots and the computational time. Results reveal that the PSO based schemes (I-PSO, HCL-PSO, and Ensemble PSO) are promising and far efficient than randomized and traditional SaTScan algorithms. Further, for the datasets containing only a single hotspot, the performance of all PSO based schemes is at par with each other. However, for datasets with more than one hotspot in the study area, HCL-PSO has lower average rank than I-PSO and Ensemble PSO schemes and hence seems more promising for MSCHD. The superiority of HCL-PSO based hotspot detection is also validated using Friedman Test . Finally, the presented schemes are applied to the case study of Chicago city for identification of different types of crime hotspots.},

  abstract     = {Heuristic optimisation is a popular tool for solving problems in the sciences and engineering fields. These algorithms explore the search space by sampling solutions, evaluating their fitness, and biasing the search in the direction of promising solutions. However, in many cases, this fitness function involves executing expensive computational calculations, drastically reducing the reasonable number of evaluations. In this context, surrogate models have emerged as an excellent alternative to alleviate these computational problems. This paper addresses the formulation of surrogate problems as both regression models that approximate fitness (surface surrogate models) and a novel way to connect classification models (pairwise surrogate models). The pairwise approach can be directly exploited by some algorithms, such as Differential Evolution, in which the fitness value is not actually needed to drive the search, and it is sufficient to know whether a solution is better than another one or not. Based on these modelling approaches, we have conducted a multidimensional analysis of surrogate models under different configurations: different machine learning algorithms (regularised regression, neural networks , decision trees , boosting methods, and random forests), different surrogate strategies (encouraging diversity or relaxing prediction thresholds), and compare them for both surface and pairwise surrogate models. The experimental part of the article includes the benchmark problems already proposed for the SOCO’2011 competition in continuous optimisation and a simulation problem included in the recent GECCO’2021 Industrial Challenge. This paper shows that the performance of the overall search, when using online machine learning-based surrogate models, depends not only on the accuracy of the predictive model but also on both the kind of bias towards positive or negative cases and how the optimisation uses those predictions to decide whether to execute the actual fitness function.},

Home health care (HHC) is treated as an alternative solution to serve the elderly community. In recent years, managing and organizing the operation of HHCs receive a great deal of attention. The HHC routing and scheduling problems attract huge amounts of interest from modeling and optimization areas. Nevertheless, there are rarely studies focusing on the cooperation of multiple HHC centers in such problems. This work addresses a multi-center, multi-objective and stochastic HHC routing and scheduling problem for minimizing the total operation cost and penalty cost incurred by earliness and delay service, where the caregivers’ working time, customers’ requirements and resource constraints are considered. Firstly, a multi-objective chance-constrained programming model is developed to formulate the studied problem. Secondly, a multi-objective cooperation evolutionary algorithm by using stochastic simulation is specially developed, in which two populations respectively perform global and local searches, and the cooperation of two populations is designed. The stochastic simulation approach is employed to evaluate the quality and feasibility of the obtained solutions. Finally, extensive experiments are performed on a set of test instances and three multi-objective optimization algorithms are compared to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm. The comparisons and discussions validate the competitiveness of the designed approach.},

Due to its wide applications, a variety of PU algorithms with promising performance have been proposed. However, few of them consider PU learning from high-dimensional PU data . To fill the gap, in this work, we focus on designing the sparse PU classifier. However, it is difficult to achieve it, since the labels of U samples are uncertain. To this end, a loss matrix-based alternating optimization method, named LMAO-PU is proposed, where a two-stage alternating optimization idea is suggested to solve the difficulty in sparse PU learning. Firstly, a loss matrix is designed to measure the classification performance of the PU classifier on U samples. Then, a two-stage alternating optimization under the guide of loss matrix is developed. Specifically, the first stage is to optimize the PU model, aiming to address the challenge of labels uncertainty of U samples, where two objectives, TPR (True Positive Rate) and a suggested LRU (Loss Rate on Unlabeled), are optimized simultaneously. The second stage is to perform the sparse model optimization, where Sparsity and ErrorRate are adopted as the objectives to obtain the sparse model. The two-stage optimization procedure mentioned above is carried alternately and the sparse PU classifier with high quality is finally achieved. Experiments on 10 high-dimensional datasets demonstrate the superiority of proposed method over six state-of-the-art baselines in terms of sparsity, accuracy and area under ROC curve.},

  abstract     = {Expensive dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (EXDMOPs) involve multiple objective functions changing over time steps. In this kind of problems, only a small number of function evaluations can be allowed in each time step. The challenge of EXDMOP is how to quickly and accurately track the changing optimal solutions with only a small number of function evaluations. Although EXDMOP can be solved as a series of independent expensive multi-objective optimization problems or as an ordinary dynamic multi-objective optimization problems, these two methods either ignore the connection between different time steps or degrade the performance significantly due to the requirement for a large number of function evaluations. In this paper, we incorporate two proposed strategies named training data augmentation and sampling pool expansion to the Kriging-assisted reference vector guided evolutionary algorithm to construct a novel algorithm for solving EXDMOPs. The training data augmentation strategy tries to look for the previous similar time step, and adds the solutions evaluated by the objective functions at that time step to current time step. The accuracies of the Kriging models are improved in this way. The sampling pool expansion strategy sends the predicted optimal solutions to the competition of the function evaluations assignment at each time step, where the predicted optimal solutions are generated by the improved population prediction strategy. We set the ablation experiment for the proposed algorithm and compare it with four dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithms on various of problems. The experiment results validate the effectiveness of the proposed two strategies. It also indicates that the proposed algorithm is promising for solving EXDMOPs.},

Different statistical approaches have been proposed to perform this type of estimation, being the Extreme Value Theory currently one of the most widespread. The contribution of this paper is to provide empirical evidence on how unreliable the estimates of global optima of combinatorial optimization problems can be when using Extreme Value Theory . This study uses a structural engineering optimization problem as a case study. Four metaheuristics with different performances are used to solve the problem: two genetic algorithms and two evolution strategies with different search parameters. The study shows that the use of Extreme Value Theory can lead to wrong conclusions because its global optimum estimates depend on the search algorithm&#39;s performance. The results also show that samples generated by poorly performing search algorithms produce estimates of the global optimum with high variability. Additionally, it was observed that high-performing algorithms generated samples with low variability, which paradoxically made the statistical estimation of the global optimum inviable. The conclusions derived from the study are of great relevance for anyone interested in using the Extreme Value Theory to estimate the global optimum of a combinatorial optimization problem.},

Inspired by natural systems in which large numbers of simple agents (e.g., schooling fish, flocking birds, swarming insects) perform complicated collective behaviours for efficiency and safety, the first element uses three simple rules to maintain a swarm formation. The second element provides a means to select promising regions to explore (and cover) by minimising a cost function involving robots’ relative distance to frontier cells and the frontier’s size. We tested the performance of our approach on heterogeneous and homogeneous groups of mobile robots in different environments. We measure both coverage performance and swarm formation statistics as indicators of the robots’ ability to explore effectively while maintaining a formation conducive to short-range communication. Through a series of comparison experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed strategy has superior performance to recently presented map coverage methodologies and conventional swarming methods.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have become increasingly popular for solving computationally expensive problems, profiting from surrogate modeling and infill approaches to reduce the time cost of optimization. Most existing algorithms have specified the type of surrogate model before a run and keep the type static during the optimization process. However, a sole surrogate model may not consistently perform well for all problems without any prior knowledge. In this context, this paper proposes an adaptive technique for surrogate models with multiple radial basis functions (RBFs), as the technique can dynamically establish the most promising RBF for each objective, thereby enhancing the reliability of surrogate prediction. Moreover, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) that are employed as optimizers for infilling criteria can highly affect the search behavior of a surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm . The proposed infill technique develops a crowding distance-based prescreening operator to embed various MOEAs. Two techniques collaboratively promote the convergence, coverage, and diversity of the predicted Pareto front. Representative benchmark problems and a structural optimization problem are given to show the effectiveness of the algorithm that employs these techniques. Empirical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in most cases.},

Although many surrogate-assisted metaheuristic algorithms have been proposed to tackle this challenge, most of them still suffer from low prediction accuracy on high-dimensional problems. This article presents a surrogate-assisted hierarchical learning water cycle algorithm (SA-HLWCA) for high-dimensional expensive optimization problems . SA-HLWCA utilizes two searching modes, namely, global search and local search, to cooperatively search for the optimal solution. A global search is conducted by a surrogate using a global diverse subset and aims to locate promising optimal areas. A local search is conducted by a surrogate built in the neighboring region of the current best and aims to refine the optimal solution. To validate the performance, comprehensive studies of the impacts of major components of SA-HLWCA are conducted. The proposed algorithm is then compared with three state-of-the-art algorithms on a series of tests on problems that range from 20 dimensions to 100 dimensions, and the results show that SA-HLWCA performs better in terms of both effectiveness and robustness. In addition, SA-HLWCA is applied to the shape optimization of a blended-wing-body underwater glider (BWBUG), and the lift-drag ratio of the optimized shape is improved by 7.66\% compared with that of the initial shape.},

First, an MaOP is divided into a set of subproblems by the distance between weight vectors . Each subproblem selects an appropriate solution from its region, using the specified scalarizing function. Then, the first adjustment updates all the scalarizing functions for each weight vector, where a strategy integrating history information is used to promote the accuracy of the adjustment. Sequentially, the second adjustment updates weight vectors based on the population distribution, which simulates and modifies the value function of reinforcement learning to intensify the rationality of updates. Note that the excitation frequencies of two adjustments are adaptive. Additionally, we design fine-tuning introducing reminding solutions to enhance exploitation. Finally, numerous experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs better or is equivalent to five state-of-the-art algorithms on 150 test instances and one practical problem .},

  abstract     = {It is challenging to balance convergence and diversity in constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) since the complex constraints will disperse the feasible regions into many diverse, small parts of the entire search region. Although there has been some research on CMOPs, existing evolutionary algorithms still cannot cause the evolutionary population to converge a diversified feasible Pareto-optimal front. In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel two-phase evolutionary algorithm for solving CMOPs, named DTAEA. DTAEA divides the population’s coevolutionary process into two phases. In the first phase, the dual population weak coevolution is combined with the complementary environmental selection strategy to improve the algorithm’s exploration under constraints, which makes the evolutionary population quickly traverse the infeasible regions and search for all of the feasible regions. When the proportion of feasible solutions in the population reaches a certain threshold or the convergence of feasible solutions reaches a certain level, the population’s evolutionary process enters the second phase, that is, the progressive phase. In the second phase, a feasibility-oriented method guides a single population to distribute itself widely in the feasible regions explored in the first phase. Comparative experiments show that the DTAEA is more competitive than other algorithms on CMOP benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {As global search techniques, population-based optimization algorithms have provided promising results in feature selection (FS) problems. However, their major challenge is high time complexity associated with the exploration of a large search space and consequently a large number of fitness function evaluations. Moreover, the interaction between features is another key issue in FS problems, directly affecting the classification performance through selecting correlated features. In this paper, an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA)-based method is proposed with three important contributions. Firstly, as an extension of EDA, the proposed method in each iteration generates only two individuals competing based on a fitness function, evolving during the algorithm using our proposed update procedure. Secondly, we provide a guiding technique to determine the number of features to be selected for individuals in each iteration. As a result, the number of selected features in the final solution would be optimized during the evolution process. These two would lead to increasing the convergence speed of the algorithm. Thirdly, as the main contribution of the paper, in addition to considering the importance of each feature alone, the proposed method can consider the interaction between features, being able to deal with complementary features and consequently increase classification performance. To do this, we provide a conditional probability scheme that considers the joint probability distribution of selecting two features. The introduced probabilities successfully detect correlated features. Experimental results on a synthetic dataset with correlated features proved the performance of our proposed approach facing these types of features. Furthermore, the results on 13 real-world datasets obtained from the UCI repository showed the superiority of the proposed method in comparison with some state-of-the-art approaches. To evaluate the effectiveness of each feature subset, support vector machines are used as classifier. The efficiency analysis of the experimental results using two non-parametric statistical tests proved that the proposed method had significant advantages in comparison to other approaches.},

To achieve this goal, a novel DMOEA based on particle swarm prediction strategy and prediction adjustment strategy is proposed in this paper. After detecting environmental changes, the particle swarm prediction strategy is implemented through the population information at the moment before environmental change to form a predicted population that approximates the new Pareto optimal set ( P S PS )/Pareto optimal front ( P F PF ) as much as possible. In addition, by comparing the individual information of the predicted population with that of the population at the moment before the environmental change, a prediction adjustment strategy is given to leave the better individuals to form the initial population in the new environment. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated on the DF test cases and compared with the advanced DMOEAs.

As the technology of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) matures, the growing attempts have been made to use UAVs to replace fixed ground stations for MEC due to their flexibility. In this work, we study the multiobjective trajectory optimization for mobile edge computing system assisted by a single UAV, where the UAV is used to provide computing services for Internet of Things (IoT) devices located on the ground. A multiobjective trajectory optimization problem is formulated, which not only needs to minimize the energy consumption of the MEC system to provide computing services to all IoT devices, but also minimize the task urgency indicator by optimizing the UAV’s flight trajectory . In this problem, the number and the locations of hover points (HPs) of UAVs have been taken into consideration. To solve this problem, a multiobjective trajectory optimization algorithm with a cutting and padding encoding strategy is proposed, where the cutting and padding encoding strategy is used to help optimize the population whose individuals may have different lengths. The verification experiments are carried out on a set of instances with up to 400 IoT devices and the experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed algorithm for trajectory optimization problems in a single-UAV-assisted MEC system.},

  abstract     = {There are various constraints in many real engineering problems, and the constrained handling methods play a key role in the constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs). Many constraint-handling strategies will struggle to reach optimum results when dealing with constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) with large and complex infeasible areas. It brings stiffer challenges to CMOEAs in maintaining the convergence, diversity, and feasibility of the population. To remedy these issues, this paper proposes an improved constrained dominance principle (ICDP) embedded in MOEA/D, named MOEA/D-ICDP. In MOEA/D-ICDP, the original weight vector that a solution matches may not be the best suitable weight vector that this solution corresponds to, then there is a deviation between them. According to the above situation, ICDP is designed in this way. Firstly, a dynamic tolerability value about the deviation is introduced. Then ICDP adjusts the dominance relationship of solutions in light of the relationship between the deviation and tolerability so that it can preserve some valuable infeasible solutions in the early evolutionary stage and help the population to cross the large and complex regions. Three test suites and two real-world engineering optimization problems are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed MOEA/D-ICDP and the other five representative CMOEAs. The experimental results demonstrate that MOEA/D-ICDP has more excellent performance and competitiveness than the other five CMOEAs.},

To fully utilize these promising solutions, this paper proposes an archive-based two-stage evolutionary algorithm, called AT-CMOEA, for solving constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs). AT-CMOEA divides the evolutionary process into two stages — exploration and exploitation. The purpose of the exploration stage is to encourage a broader exploration of the search space to discover some promising regions, which is achieved by two populations with different priorities of constraints and objectives. In the exploitation stage , the goal is to obtain a set of well-distributed Pareto-optimal solutions by utilizing the useful archived information found during the exploration stage, allowing the search resources to be focused on the region of interest. Then, the two populations cooperatively converge to the constrained Pareto front (CPF). Comprehensive experiments on a series of benchmark test problems and three real-world CMOPs demonstrate the competitiveness of our method when compared with other representative algorithms in terms of effectiveness and reliability in finding a set of well-distributed optimal solutions.},

The first phase uses the general genetic operators to generate the offspring, and then in the second phase, the selected non-dominated solutions are utilized by the proposed deep sampling method to produce offspring again. Specifically, the proposed deep sampling method makes use of the selected non-dominated solutions to establish search directions at first, then solutions are sampled on them. It is expected to take advantage of both offspring generation schemes, thereby balancing the diversity and convergence of the population. Existing large-scale evolutionary algorithms can easily be extended to our proposed bi-level architecture.

The novelty of the proposed algorithms is the integration of multiple parameters for the CH selection in a heterogeneous WSN . NCOGA formulates fitness parameters by integrating multiple parameters like the residual energy, initial energy, distance to the sink, number of neighbors surrounded by a node, load balancing factor, and communicating mode decider (CMD). The parameters for load balancing and CMD are utilized to discover out the best candidate to be selected as a relay CH and for deciding the mode of communication (single or multi-hop) of CH. Further, these parameters are useful in avoiding hot-spot problem in the network. The working of the NCOGA starts based on the criteria “consider only those nodes which have energy higher than the pre-defined threshold energy”. This criterion of nodes selection makes the NCOGA more efficient and quickly convergent. Extensive computer simulations are conducted to determine the effectiveness of the NCOGA. Simulation results reveal that the proposed NCOGA outperforms the state-of-the-art optimization algorithms based on GA in terms of several performance metrics, specifically, stability period, residual energy, network lifetime, and throughput.},

This problem arises in the pharmaceutical industry, more specifically in physical–chemical analysis processes. Since each sample must be processed in some specific machines, we have missing operations. Given the NP-hardness of the problem, we present approximate algorithms to solve large-sized instances. First, we propose an innovative size-reduction matheuristic for a scheduling problem with due dates. This approach is based on partitioning the decision variables considering due dates and a dispatch rule. Furthermore, we develop a novel Biased Random Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA) that considers an efficient local search as 2-opt best improvement with swap neighborhood and a parameter-free restart procedure which restarts the search if the quality of the worst and best solutions were equal, minimizing the amount of parameters to be defined by the BRKGA. We perform computational experiments on 640 test instances to evaluate the proposed solution approaches. The results indicate the superiority of BRKGA compared to the competitive algorithms for order scheduling and its recent variants. In all set of instances, the novel BRKGA performed better than benchmarking methods and mathematical programming models, with average relative deviation index regarding best results as lower as 0.15\%. Computational results point to the capacity of the proposed approaches to solve large-sized problems.},

For example, in automotive design , one might be interested in simultaneously minimizing the aerodynamic drag and maximizing the torsional rigidity/collision strength of the vehicle. For a number of problems encountered in engineering design, the objectives can be independently evaluated and such evaluations are often computationally expensive. While surrogate-assisted optimization (SAO) methods are typically used to deal with such problems, they evaluate all objectives for the chosen infill solution(s). If however the objectives can be independently evaluated, there is an opportunity to improve the computational efficiency by evaluating the selected objective(s) only. In this study, we introduce a SAO approach capable of selectively evaluating the objective(s) of the infill solution(s). The approach exploits principles of non-dominance and sparse subset selection to facilitate decomposition and identifies the infill solutions through maximization of probabilistic dominance measure. Thereafter, for each of these infill solutions, one or more objectives are evaluated, taking into account the evaluation status of its closest neighbor and the probability of improvement along each objective. The performance of the approach is benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods on a range of mathematical problems to highlight the efficacy of the approach. Thereafter, we present the performance on two engineering design problems namely a vehicle crashworthiness design problem and an airfoil design problem. We hope that this study would motivate further algorithmic developments to cater to such classes of problems.},

  abstract     = {Recently, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have shown their strong competitiveness in handling many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs) with different Pareto fronts (PFs). However, maintaining convergence and diversity simultaneously in high-dimensional problems can be further explored. This paper suggests an adaptive convergence-diversity balanced evolutionary algorithm (ACDB-EA) to handle the above issue, which maintains balance between convergence and diversity adaptively during the evolutionary process. In the proposed algorithm, a novel diversity maintenance mechanism based on the global and local diversities is developed to promote the diversity by considering them collaboratively. To be specific, the average similarity and the maximal similarity represent respectively the global and local diversities of the solution, where the similarity between two solutions is defined as the cosine similarity between their objective vectors. In the environmental selection, the proposed adaptive convergence-diversity balanced strategy is used to adjust weights of convergence (defined as the L 2 L2 norm in the objective space), global diversity and local diversity according to the population adaptively. Under this strategy, each solution produces a score and the solution with the highest score will enter the next generation, which means it acquires the optimal performance in terms of convergence and diversity. In each iteration, scores of candidate solutions will be recalculated to continuously search for the most suitable one, which strengthens the selection pressure toward the true PFs. We conduct experimental study on 111 benchmark testing instances with 2-20 objectives. The proposed method is shown to be superior to seven state-of-the-art algorithms in maintaining balance between convergence and diversity.},

  abstract     = {Margin trading is an important part of stock market. Compared with traditional channel business, it brings excess profits to both financial institutions and investors. As an important optimization problem in the field of finance, portfolio optimization with the purpose of spreading risks and improving returns is the essence of margin trading. In this paper, aiming at achieving the portfolio optimization for multi-period margin trading, we propose a multi-objective interval portfolio optimization method, including model construction and optimization. Based on real business rules, the process of model construction consists of three steps. First, an interval estimation method of securities’ returns and risks is designed according to market feedback to keep portfolios remaining robust under the market fluctuation. Second, a multi-objective problem of maximizing return and minimizing risk is constructed to seek portfolios with balanced risks and returns. Third, a rolling investment mechanism is formed based on the portfolio’s actual return of each period to maintain effective continuous investment. For the model optimization, a multi-objective interval optimization evolutionary algorithm with knee based decision-making is developed. It obtains knee solutions for different risk segments to meet the investment needs of investors with different risk preferences, so that their investment decisions do not need to rely on quantitative expression of their preferences. Furthermore, adapting to the interval model, an interval optimization method is developed to enhance the robustness of knee points. Experimental results on several benchmark problems and the real portfolio optimization problem demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model and algorithm.},

Turning off machines and restarting them frequently, however, would incur a considerable amount of additional energy and may even cause damage to the machines. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model based on the energy-efficient flexible job shop scheduling problem (EEFJSP), aiming to minimize not just the makespan and total energy consumption but also the total number of machine restarts. Our idea here is that shifting the start time of operations on different machines appropriately can effectively decrease the number of restarts required and the total energy consumption . We present a two-stage memetic algorithm (TMA) to solve the EEFJSP. A variable neighborhood search approach is designed to improve the convergence speed and fully exploit the solution space of the TMA. An operation-block moving operator is developed to further reduce the total energy consumption as well as the total number of machine restarts without affecting the makespan. Extensive computational experiments carried out to compare the TMA with some well-known algorithms confirm that the proposed TMA can easily obtain better Pareto solutions for the EEFJSP.},

To address these difficulties and enhance the performance of existing DE algorithms , this paper proposes a two-level parameter cooperation-based population regeneration (TPPR) framework that can easily be integrated with various DE algorithms without increasing the time consumption. In the TPPR framework, whether an individual executes the regeneration operation depends on a specific cooperation strategy for a macroparameter and a microparameter, and the regeneration operation updates the positions of the selected individuals using a dynamic coordination strategy for the Cauchy and Gaussian distributions , that are constructed using those two parameters. Comparative experiments of ten representative DE algorithms with and without the TPPR framework on thirty functions with different dimensions from the IEEE CEC 2014 test platform and four real-life problems are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the TPPR framework. The comparative results based on the improvement rate and deterioration rate indicate that using the TPPR framework, the performance of the adopted DE algorithms can be significantly improved with a very high probability , and the possibility of deterioration is very low.},

This scheduling phenomenon is called blocking, and it usually occurs in an industrial setting because of the buffer capacity or the product volume. This study addresses several blocking flowshop scheduling problems to individually optimize the following criteria, i.e. makespan, maximum lateness, or maximum delivery-completion time, in which the tasks are available at different release dates. Given that these scheduling problems are strongly NP-complete, exact and metaheuristic algorithms are designed for different scale instances. An effective branch and bound method is proposed to search exact solutions for small-scale instances within a given period, where well-designed branching rules and lower bounds prune considerable invalid nodes. Further, to seek high-quality feasible schedules in a short time, a discrete artificial bee colony algorithm is provided for medium-scale instances, where a dispatching-rule-based initialization, a series of efficient non-delay variable neighborhood search mechanisms, and a well-designed disturbing scheme enhance the optimization capability. Comprehensive computational tests are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

With the increasing amount of production, however, the current STPs cannot satisfy the production level. Policymakers propose several location candidates to build new STPs and aim to minimize the total cost of running the newly built STPs and the original STPs. The practical attributes of the sewage return logistics, capacity of vehicles and STPs, uncertain amount of sewage, stochastic travel times, and other constraints are taken into account.

The first phase of the TEA uses a novel two-population structure to simultaneously optimize the two criteria. According to the characteristics of the structure, two construction heuristics are designed to obtain solutions with both high quality and diversity. Four crossover and two mutation operators are presented. The interaction between the two populations increases the diversity within each population. The second phase integrates the previous two populations and uses the method of normalized objective function to enhance efficiency. Two new crossover operators are proposed to improve the performance of the algorithm. The TEA first finds several approximate front solutions to provide ideal feasible areas, and then continuously expands the solutions to the Pareto front. It embodies convergence, diversity and uniformity in different phases. Finally, through 810 benchmark instances, the TEA is compared with five classical and popular algorithms. The effectiveness of the two mechanisms in the TEA is analyzed. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the TEA in terms of distribution and coverage of solutions.},

Then the harmony search algorithm iterates to look for and to develop a new solution enhanced by using neighboring heuristics. A migration process is applied, after a predefined number of iterations, to perform an exchange between some individuals in islands. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using 12 real-world datasets, each with 10 instances. A sensitivity analysis of the island model parameters is conducted to choose values that minimize the total flow time. The evaluation is conducted using two criteria, the number of evolutions and the Central Processing Unit (CPU) time using six comparative methods and sixteen comparative methods , respectively. For the first criterion, the proposed algorithm excels other comparative algorithms when solving instances of four datasets. For the second criterion, the proposed algorithm outperforms other comparative methods in six out of the twelve datasets.

However, HS has shortcomings such as low optimization accuracy and premature convergence. Therefore, various HS variants have been proposed. In response to this trend, this article systematically reviews HS and its variants from various aspects. First, the basic HS principle is described. Secondly, how the improvement of HS affects the performance of the algorithm is discussed. Finally, the characteristics of HS variants and their applications are analyzed. It can be seen from the literature that the improvement of HS is mainly focused on parameter improvement and mixing with other metaheuristic algorithms. Some HS even use both techniques to improve the algorithm simultaneously. HS is mainly used to solve optimization problems in engineering, which provides future research directions for improving HS.},

  abstract     = {Prediction in evolutionary dynamic optimization (EDO), such as predicting the movement of optima, or when and how an environment will change, is a topic that is still under investigation and presents unsolved challenges. A few studies approach prediction based on re-initialising a population or requirement satisfaction problems such as Robust Optimization Over Time. The benchmark problems in these studies inherently use randomly changing parameters and therefore such randomness may make it difficult to compare these algorithms with other EDO approaches. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark, called Moving Peaks Benchmark with Attractors, which incorporates an attractor heuristic that attracts peaks to a certain location in the environment into the moving peaks problem. The proposed benchmark is fully flexible where the dynamics of the attractors and the rate at which a peak is attracted to such attractors can be modified. By adjusting these characteristics, certain styles of movements can be achieved by a peak. We also introduce a new performance measure that focuses on the comparison of algorithms that use prediction. Seven EDO algorithms based on different working logics are chosen to give a wide representation of the state-of-the-art in this area. We argue that having predictable characteristics in the benchmark problem is more adequate for studying the performances and behaviours of those algorithms that embed prediction mechanisms. Experimental results obtained with the proposed benchmark show it’s suitability for the EDO domain as all algorithms featuring prediction capabilities display higher accuracy than their competitors.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale low-orbit communication satellite constellations play an indispensable role in the satellite Internet of Things , remote sensing and other fields, while the inter-satellite link scheduling problem is a crucial problem that significantly affects constellation communication performance. To address the inter-satellite link scheduling problem of large-scale low-orbit communication satellite constellations, this paper proposes a time-discrete network multi-commodity flow model in which satellites are viewed as network nodes, inter-satellite links are viewed as transmission paths and virtual intermediate nodes and virtual endpoints are set. Based on this model, a data-driven parallel adaptive large neighborhood search (DP-ALNS) algorithm, an extension of the ALNS, is proposed for solving the problem. In this algorithm, a probability prediction model is trained based on extreme gradient boosting to predict the probabilities that a satellite is connected to its visible satellites. An initial solution generation strategy is further adopted for constructing a high-quality initial solution. Meanwhile, an adaptive mechanism including a rule adaptive layer and an operator adaptive layer is used to improve the search performance of the algorithm, in which the rule adaptive layer affects solution selection and the operator adaptive layer is used in the neighborhood search. Computational experiments indicate that the DP-ALNS algorithm can optimize the average transmission time delay of all on-board data from approximately 8 units to only 4 units when the ratio of the number of gateway satellites to entry satellites is set to 1:8. Simultaneously, the DP-ALNS algorithm presents better overall performance than other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Early studies conducted with existing modular design methods have shown their limitations in the design of spatially-organizing behaviors for robots that operate under spatial constrains.

  abstract     = {Integrated Energy System (IES) in steel industry, typically involving gas, heat and electricity, exhibits distributed nature and complex coupling relationship, which demands effective scheduling optimization to cooperatively utilize the multiple energy media. For this purpose, a Granular-Evolutionary Hybrid Computing (GEHC) framework is proposed in this study to solve the scheduling of IES as a Constrained Multi-Objective Problem (CMOP). More specifically, a Collaborative Fuzzy C-Means (CFCM) clustering model is firstly established, where the horizontal and vertical structures are well constructed to obtain information granules regarding the cooperative relationship among the units in different energy subsystems. Then, a Probability-based Granular Computing (PGrC) approach is proposed for the initial optimization of the IES scheduling, which is guided by the expert knowledge compacted in the information granules. To determine the collaborative parameters in CFCM that essentially controls the cooperation among the multiple energy media, as well as satisfying the complex practical constraints, a Multi-Objective Differential Evolution (MODE)-based method is proposed for further scheduling optimization. To evaluate the performance on cooperativity, convergency and diversity, the proposed GEHC and the compared methods that either has partial collaborations or use other optimization frameworks are applied to a real-world optimization problem . The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GEHC performs superior to the other methods considering both the objective functions and performance indicators, which can be potentially helpful to achieve well-performed unmanned IES scheduling in steel industry.},

  abstract     = {Generating the low-discrepancy point sets in high-dimensional space is an optimization problem which involves two issues: how to define the objective function of optimization, and how to optimize this optimization problem with tens of thousands of variables. Inspired by natural phenomena, we make two assumptions: the first is that the static solution to the multi-body problem is a low-discrepancy point set, and the second is that the discrepancy of bodies is the lowest when the potential energy is the smallest. Under these assumptions, the objective function is defined as the potential energy of the point set. A dynamical evolutionary model (DEM) based on the minimum potential energy principle is established to construct low-discrepancy point sets. The central difference algorithm is adopted to solve the DEM and the selection of coefficients to ensure the convergence is discussed in detail. Numerical examples confirm the assumption that there is a significant positive correlation between the potential energy and the discrepancy. We also combine the DEM with the restarting technique to generate a series of low-discrepancy point sets. These point sets are unbiased and perform better than other low-discrepancy point sets in terms of the discrepancy, the potential energy, integrating eight test functions and computing the statistical moments for two practical stochastic problems . Numerical examples also show that the DEM can generate uniformly distributed point sets in non-cubes. More interestingly, it is observed that the DEM point sets can greatly improve the convergence speed of the heterogeneous comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization .},

Truss optimization is a challenging optimization involving many difficulties, such as discrete variables and non-convex problems. In order to solve these problems, various metaheuristic optimization methods have been proposed. Due to the stochastic feature of these methods, it is always computationally intensive, and the optimization results may vary greatly in different optimization runs. In this paper, a hybrid intelligent genetic algorithm (HIGA) is proposed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of truss optimization problems. This method systematically integrates deep neural network (DNN) and genetic algorithm (GA) in the optimization process. A two-step training procedure is proposed where the data generated during the optimization process is exploited to update DNN. Next, based on the generated DNN model, an optimization prediction procedure is proposed to seek more optimized trusses in an efficient manner. Through the investigation of three classical truss problems (size optimization, shape optimization and size-shape integrated optimization), the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated. In addition, the influence of different settings on the optimization performance and efficiency is investigated to demonstrate the applicability and robustness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have faced the challenge of balancing diversity and convergence in dealing with many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs). Most of them use a series of strategies to increase the selection pressure among solutions for convergence promotion, or additional auxiliary strategies for diversity maintenance. Decision variable classification (DVC), as the method that analyzes the feature of an MaOP, can help MOEAs search for optimal solutions in terms of convergence and diversity through optimizing the corresponding category of decision variables. Therefore in this paper, we propose a new DVC method by analyzing the monotonicities of objectives. Unlike other DVC methods, it does not need to consider dominance relationships or help with extra vectors. Based on the classification results , we design a new directional crossover (DC) method for generating promising solutions. This crossover method has a higher probability that the generated offspring can integrate the advantages of the parents in convergence and diversity. Incorporating it with MOEA, a DVC-based MOEA (DVC-MOEA) is proposed for dealing with MaOPs. In DVC-MOEA, two archives focusing on convergence and diversity separately are maintained. In addition, an interval mapping(IM) strategy is designed to obtain solutions with good diversity, especially for some problems with biased features. To evaluate the performance of DVC-MOEA on MaOPs, comparison experiments are conducted on two wide used benchmarks with nine state-of-the-art MOEAs. The experimental results show that DVC-MOEA has high competitiveness over these MOEAs in dealing with MaOPs. Moreover, three variants are compared with DVC-MOEA respectively, and the comparison experimental results confirm the effect of the three strategies (DVC, DC, and IM) in our proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a two-stage surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm (TS-SAEA) is presented for computationally expensive multi/many-objective optimization, which consists of a convergence stage and a diversity stage. In the convergence stage, the objective space is partitioned into several sub-regions by reference vectors, where the individuals compete with each other. In the diversity stage, the converged individuals and the current non-dominated solutions are combined to form a potential sample set, on which a secondary selection is conducted to further improve the diversity. Specifically, the proposed diversity strategy firstly defines the initial boundary individuals and a candidate pool. The individuals with “max-min angles” will continuously be selected from the pool to supplement the boundary individuals until the number of the boundary individuals equals the number of the current non-dominated solutions. At last, the points with the better space-filling features are picked out from the updated boundary individuals to evaluate the true objectives. The above-mentioned process keeps running until the maximal number of function evaluations is satisfied. To evaluate the performance of TS-SAEA on both low and high-dimensional multi/many-objective problems, it is compared with four state-of-art algorithms on 52 benchmark problems and one engineering application .

Two learning architectures based on parallel and incremental learning are proposed to automatically derive abstractions. The evaluations conducted with three different complex task environments indicate that the proposed approach with both architectures surpass the performance of generic grammar-based evolutionary models by automatically identifying appropriate abstractions and generating more complex rule structures. The evolutionary process shows further performance improvements with the use of scaffolded environments which were used to train the models in increasingly complex environments across several stages. The results infer that the proposed approach incorporating grammatical evolution with techniques to autonomously discover abstractions can facilitate solving complex problems of agent systems in real-world domains.},

  abstract     = {During the last decade, metaheuristic algorithms have been well-established approaches which are utilized for solving complex real-world optimization problems . The most metaheuristic algorithms uses stochastic strategies in their initialization phase as well as during their new candidate generation steps when there is no a-priori knowledge about the solution, which is a common valid assumption for any black-box optimization algorithm . In recent years, researchers have introduced a new concept called center-based sampling which can be utilized in any search component of the optimization process, but so far it mainly has been used just for population initialization. This novel concept clarifies that in a search space, the center point has a higher chance to be closer to an unknown solution compared to a random point, especially when the dimension of the search space increases. Thus, this concept helps the optimizer to find a better solution in a shorter time. In this paper, a comprehensive study has been conducted on the effect of center-based sampling to solve an optimization problem using three different levels of detailed investigation. These levels are as the follows: 1) considering no specific algorithm and no specific landscape (i.e., Monte-Carlo simulation); 2) considering a specific landscape but no specific algorithm (i.e., random search vs. center-based random search), and finally, 3) considering a specific algorithm and specific landscape which includes the proposing three different schemes for using center-based sampling scheme for solving Large-scale Global Optimization (LSGO) problems effectively. Furthermore, in this study, we seek to investigate the properties and capabilities of center-based sampling during optimization, which can be extended to utilize it in machine learning too, because optimization is a key role player in search and learning models. The proposed methods in this paper are evaluated on CEC 2013 LSGO benchmark functions and a real-world optimization problem, i.e., evolving ANN on two medical data sets. The experimental results confirm that center-based sampling has a crucial impact in improving the convergence rate of optimization/search algorithms when solving high-dimensional optimization problems .},

  abstract     = {The core task of constrained multiobjective optimization is to achieve a tradeoff between exploration and exploitation as well as a tradeoff between constraints and objectives. We present an effective e volutionary a lgorithm with a d ynamic p opulation s ize (DPSEA) to achieve these two tradeoffs. In order to balance exploration and exploitation, the population size of DPSEA decreases continually as generation increases. In this manner, a bigger population size can encourage exploration in the early stage, while a smaller one can promote exploitation in the later stage. Aiming to balance constraints and objectives, a two-stage environmental selection strategy is proposed. In this strategy, objective information and constraint information is used to select two sets of solutions, respectively. Note that the sizes of these two sets are also adjusted dynamically. In this way, the information of both objectives and constraints can be used. Moreover, a novel mating selection strategy is designed to select promising parents. By assembling the above processes, DPSEA is able to achieve the two tradeoffs which are critical to constrained multiobjective optimization . Experiments on three sets of benchmark test functions owning difficult characteristics validate that DPSEA is competitive against some state-of-the-art constrained multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithms .},

Conducting performance regression testing after every code change is known to be expensive which emigres the need to direct the performance regression testing efforts on code changes that are most likely introducing performance regression. In this paper, we exploit code change metrics to identify the group introducing the regression based on a pre-trained detection rule. We present PRICE approach as a new formulation of detecting code changes introducing performance regression as an optimization problem using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms . PRICE evaluated using a set of 8000 commits, extracted from the Git project. Results show the effectiveness of our approach in accurately detecting performance regression introducing code changes. The average regression detection PRICE provides is 77\% which is 22\% more than the state-of-the-art deterministic approach . This improvement didn’t compromise the detection of the contradicted code changes that are not introducing a regression. PRICE provides detection of code changes not introducing a regression averaged 63\%, which is also an improvement of 14\% than the comparative approach. Using PRICE, we were able to explore new search spaces and provide competing results.},

  abstract     = {The continuous roaming of particles in high-dimensional space makes it difficult for particle swarm optimization to achieve better optimization results. On the other hand, increasing the dimensionality may also bring about an explosive increase in the number of locally optimal solutions surrounded by more significant local optimal regions . Therefore, the algorithm requires high convergence while maintaining good diversity. This paper proposes a level-based multi-strategy learning swarm algorithm called LSLSO. LSLSO’s optimization process is divided into the level-based multi-strategies search and the detailed search stages. First, particles are divided into four levels according to their fitness value. When the particles are at different levels, the particles have different learning strategies to update. Particles with better fitness focus on exploiting space. In contrast, particles with poor fitness will focus on exploring space. In the detailed search stage, particles at the same level learn from each other. Particles with similar fitness to detail search for the small gaps in the promising space already explored. The theoretical discussion results show that LSLSO has strong competitiveness in exploration and exploitation capabilities. Moreover, it shows good performance compared with the most advanced large-scale multi-objective optimization algorithms on the LSMOP and LMF problems.},

The optimization objectives include minimizing the total mileage of vehicles, the total mileage of employees, and the extra time consumed by employees. A mathematical model was established, and a sequence code was designed. A novel type of multiple leaders particle swarm optimization algorithm MPSO-VNS combined with variable neighborhood search is proposed.

Experiments show that the MPSO-VNS algorithm can effectively solve the multiobjective carpooling problem.

In the case of unknown network propagation principle, this paper introduces the idea of swarm intelligence , which utilizes the positive feedback mechanism of ant colony to simulate the propagation of negative influence, and finds a set of high-value and low-cost suppression nodes. On this basis, the graph embedding technique is used to obtain the new relationships between nodes in the network, and the new relationships between the nodes are used as heuristic information for the ant colony algorithm. Experiments show that our algorithm can not only find the set of inhibitory nodes with limited cost, but also effectively limit the spread of negative influence in the network compared with other algorithms.

SODA-AD improves dynamic coordinate search (DCS) in two ways, i.e., with a new way of sampling candidate points and a new adaptive scaling method, which help to balance global and local search and address high-dimensional problems. Additionally, two variants of SODA-AD are described. One is SODA-AD with a modified infill strategy (SODA-ADM), which uses the prediction scoring criterion to replace the weighted scoring criterion when the budgeted computation resources are going to run out. The second method first employs SODA-ADM and then carries out a sequential dimensioned perturbation search for each iteration periodically to continue the local search, and this is named SODA-ADM-DP. In numerical experiments, we compare SODA-AD and its two variants with other well-known counterparts using one complex real-world engineering problem and eight 100-dimensional (100-D) benchmark problems. It is concluded that SODA-AD and its two variants outperform the other counterparts on most of the test problems and are promising for solving high-dimensional mixed-integer optimization problems with black-box objective functions or nonlinear and nonconvex objective functions.},

Moreover, MRBFO defines a multi-resolution grid strategy to produce well-distributed diverse nondominated solutions .

  abstract     = {Multi-objective Optimization Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) face numerous challenges when they are used to solve Many-objective Optimization Problems (MaOPs). Decomposition-based strategies, such as MOEA/D, divide an MaOP into multiple single-optimization sub-problems, achieving better diversity and a better approximation of the Pareto front, and dealing with some of the challenges of MaOPs. However, these approaches still require one to solve a multi-criteria selection problem that will allow a Decision-Maker (DM) to choose the final solution. Incorporating preferences may provide results that are closer to the region of interest of a DM. Most of the proposals to integrate preferences in decomposition-based MOEAs prefer progressive articulation over the “a priori” incorporation of preferences. Progressive articulation methods can hardly work without comparable and transitive preferences, and they can significantly increase the cognitive effort required of a DM. On the other hand, the “a priori” strategies do not demand transitive judgements from the DM but require a direct parameter elicitation that usually is subject to imprecision . Outranking approaches have properties that allow them to suitably handle non-transitive preferences, veto conditions, and incomparability, which are typical characteristics of many real DMs. This paper explores how to incorporate DM preferences into MOEA/D using the “a priori” incorporation of preferences, based on interval outranking relations, to handle imprecision when preference parameters are elicited. Several experiments make it possible to analyze the proposal&#39;s performance on benchmark problems and to compare the results with the classic MOEA/D without preference incorporation and with a recent, state-of-the-art preference-based decomposition algorithm. In many instances, our results are closer to the Region of Interest, particularly when the number of objectives increases.},

This paper expands upon the existing body of research by presenting a novel ant-based generation constructive hyper-heuristic and then investigates how different pheromone maps affect its performance. Previous work has focused on applying ant-based optimisation techniques that work in the solution space directly to the heuristic space and we hypothesise that this may be problematic for the hyper-heuristic’s efficacy. The focus of this analysis is primarily on how the pheromone map, 2D and 3D, of ant-based methods, can be used for this hyper-heuristic task. 2D pheromone maps are the predominant pheromone map type used by ant-based algorithms. Thus the comparison here is between the existing 2D pheromone map and the newly introduced 3D pheromone map. The analysis consists of multiple experiments with algorithms in the TSP and 1DBPP domain which are assessed in terms of optimality and generality. The results of the experiment demonstrate key differences in performance between the two different pheromone spaces. The 3D pheromone map showed better generality and optimality in the 1DBPP domain whereas the 2D pheromone map showed better generality and only marginally better optimality for the TSP domain. The analysis indicated that the different pheromone maps work most optimally for different types of optimisation problems . The hybrid method showed some improvements in generality but showed little improvements in optimality overall.},

Fog can be considered as a continuum between the cloud layer and IoT users that allows the execution of applications or storage/processing of data in network infrastructure devices. The heterogeneity and wider distribution of fog devices are the key differences between cloud and fog infrastructure. Genetic-based optimization is commonly used in distributed systems; however, the differentiating features of fog computing require new designs, studies, and experimentation. The growing research in the field of genetic-based fog resource optimization and the lack of previous analysis in this field have encouraged us to present a comprehensive, exhaustive, and systematic review of the most recent research works. Resource optimization techniques in fog were examined and analyzed, with special emphasis on genetic-based solutions and their characteristics and design alternatives. We defined a taxonomy of the optimization scope in fog infrastructures and used this optimization taxonomy to classify the 70 papers in this survey. Subsequently, the papers were assessed in terms of genetic optimization design. Finally, the benefits and limitations of each surveyed work are outlined in this paper. Based on these previous analyses of the relevant literature, future research directions were identified. We concluded that more research efforts are needed to address the current challenges in data management, workflow scheduling, and service placement. Additionally, there is still room for improved designs and deployments of parallel and hybrid genetic algorithms that leverage, and adapt to, the heterogeneity and distributed features of fog domains.},

  abstract     = {There is evidence that many real-world applications can be characterized as sparse multiobjective problems (SMOPs), where most variables of their Pareto optimal solutions are zero. Existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have shown their competitiveness on conventional SMOPs. However, they may encounter difficulties when tackling large-scale SMOPs (LSMOPs). This paper thereby proposes a two-stage MOEA tailored to LSMOPs, named TS-SparseEA. TS-SparseEA integrates the prior information into the evolution and enables the population to spread over the Pareto front by two stages. In the first stage, TS-SparseEA adopts a new binary weight optimization framework, transforming the original large-scale optimization problem into a low-dimensional one via a set of low-dimensional binary weights. In the second stage, TS-SparseEA employs an improved evolutionary algorithm, including a hybrid encoding and a specialized matching strategy, where each solution is reproduced by a conditional combination between two types of variables. To summarize, the proposed binary weight optimization can better address large-scale sparse variables by generating a high-quality initial population, whereas the new hybrid encoding can facilitate the offspring evolution. Extensive experiments have verified the effectiveness of TS-SparseEA on LSMOPs, by comparing it with several state-of-the-art MOEAs on both benchmark problems and real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Collective behaviours such as swarm formation of autonomous agents offer the advantages of efficient movement, redundancy, and potential for human guidance of a single swarm organism. However, tuning the behaviour of a group of agents so that they swarm, is difficult. Behaviour-bootstrapping algorithms permit agents to self-tune behaviour adapted for their physical form and associated movement constraints. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework to tune collective motion behaviours from random behaviours. The learning process is guided by a novel reward function capable of autonomously detecting generic collective motion behaviours from sensor data about the relative velocity and position of neighbouring agents. Our reward function is designed using a meta-learner trained on a human-labelled collective motion dataset. We demonstrate that our reinforcement learner can tune the behaviour of randomly moving groups so that structured collective motion emerges. We compare our framework to an existing developmental evolutionary framework for this purpose. Our results demonstrate that the proposed learning framework can generate behaviours with different collective motion characteristics more quickly than existing approaches. In addition, the trained reinforcement learner can tune the behaviour of robots with movement characteristics that it has not been trained on.},

  abstract     = {The solving of large-scale multi-objective optimization problem (LSMOP) has become a hot research topic in evolutionary computation. To better solve this problem, this paper proposes a self-organizing weighted optimization based framework, denoted S-WOF, for addressing LSMOPs. Compared to the original framework, there are two main improvements in our work. Firstly, S-WOF simplifies the evolutionary stage into one stage, in which the evaluating numbers of weighted based optimization and normal optimization approaches are adaptively adjusted based on the current evolutionary state. Specifically, regarding the evaluating number for weighted based optimization (i.e., t 1 ), it is larger when the population is in the exploitation state, which aims to accelerate the convergence speed, while t 1 is diminishing when the population is switching to the exploration state, in which more attentions are put on the diversity maintenance. On the other hand, regarding the evaluating number for original optimization (i.e., t 2 ), which shows an opposite trend to t 1 , it is small during the exploitation stage but gradually increases later. In this way, a dynamic trade-off between convergence and diversity is achieved in S-WOF. Secondly, to further improve the search ability in the large-scale decision space, an efficient competitive swarm optimizer (CSO) is implemented in S-WOF, which shows efficiency for solving LSMOPs. Finally, the experimental results have validated the superiority of S-WOF over several state-of-the-art large-scale evolutionary algorithms .},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) show good performance in solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). An EA needs to perform a substantial number of fitness evaluations. For the MOP with high complexity, the fitness evaluation functions are computationally expensive, making the evolutionary algorithms time-consuming. Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) that apply surrogate models instead of fitness exact evaluation functions have successfully reduced the computational complexity of fitness evaluations. However, because training a surrogate model requires a certain amount of calculation, a large amount of calculation is required by the SAEA to train multiple surrogate models . Furthermore, most existing surrogate models may not achieve desired evaluation accuracy when processing medium-dimensional and high-dimensional MOPs. This paper proposes a novel surrogate model. The surrogate model can be applied in multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), which is a classic decomposition-based multi-objective optimization algorithm. The surrogate model is designed based on the convolutional neural network structure, and it is called the multi-objective parallel fitness evaluation network (MPFEN). An MPFEN model contains multiple sub-networks which can be applied as the surrogate models. By training the MPFEN model, we can obtain all surrogate models required by a MOEA/D simultaneously without training each required surrogate model separately. Therefore, the amount of calculation of training surrogate models in a MOEA/D is reduced. The evaluation accuracy of the MPFEN model is tested by experiments. The experimental results show that the evaluation accuracy of MPFEN model is higher than that of other classical surrogate models in most cases. By applying the MPFEN model, the solution quality of SAEA is also improved.},

Most recently, algorithms for solving sparse problems have been developed rapidly, and many sparse optimization problems in machine learning , such as the search for lightweight neural networks , can be solved with the help of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms . In this paper, we introduce a sparse truncation operator which uses the accumulative gradient value as a criterion for setting a decision variable to zero. In addition, to balance the exploration and exploitation, a cluster-based competitive particle swarm optimizer is proposed, which takes advantage of both particle swarm optimization and competitive swarm optimizer to search efficiently and escape from local optima. Consequently, aiming at solving sparse multi-objective optimization problems, a novel cluster-based competitive particle swarm optimizer with a sparse truncation operator is proposed, and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms its peers on sparse test instances and neural network training tasks.},

On the other hand, the weight vector adaptation strategy in DMOEAs is an essential ingredient for better performance, especially when dealing with MaOPs with irregular Pareto Front (PF). In general, an effective weight vector adaptation strategy faces challenges like identification of ineffective weight vectors, the proper timing and frequency of adaptation, reallocation of ineffective weight vectors and effective estimation of reference points. DMOEAs proposed in the literature try to address a subset of these issues, but fail to handle all of them simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a DMOEA namely ‘A Twin-Archive Guided Decomposition based Multi/Many-objective Evolutionary Algorithm’ (TAG-DMOEA) that basically employs two archives to update weight vectors and to estimate nadir point, separately. The better performance of TAG-DMOEA is validated over 10 representative state-of-the-art algorithms on 16 test problems with the number of objectives ranging from 2 to 10. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of TAG-DMOEA on MOPs/MaOPs in both regular and irregular PFs.},

A model pool is constructed by four radial basis function models with different smoothness degrees for model selection. Meanwhile, two model selection criteria are designed for offline optimization. Among them, Model Error Criterion uses some ranking-top data as test set to test the ability to predict optimum. Distance Deviation Criterion estimate reliability by distances between predicted solution and some ranking-top data. Combining the two criteria, we select the most suitable surrogate model for offline optimization. Experiments show that this method can effectively select suitable models for most test problems. Results on the benchmark problems and airfoil design example show that the proposed algorithm is able to handle offline problems with better optimization performance and less computational cost than other state-of-the-art offline data-driven optimization algorithms .},

  abstract     = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) present an interesting approach to solve multi-objective problems (MOPs). Moreover, studies on MOEAs with decomposition approaches have been rapidly growing and many have demonstrated that the distribution of weight vectors plays a key role in obtaining a uniform set of solutions. However, a uniform distribution of weight vectors at the beginning of the evolution may not always result in a uniform set of solutions in the objective space, as the results are highly dependent on the Pareto front shape. Pareto fronts with irregular shape (disconnected, inverted, etc.), are usually not present in all parts of the initial set of weight vectors and one approach to overcome this issue is to adapt the weight vectors to the shape of the Pareto front . To remedy this problem and contribute with the field of study, it is proposed an algorithm based on decomposition that adapts progressively its weight vectors during the evolution process. The algorithm is called Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition with Local-Neighborhood Adaptation (MOEA/D-LNA). To better evaluate the adaptation of weight vectors, a set of benchmark functions with irregular characteristics is proposed through the Generalized Position-Distance (GPD) benchmark generator. Thereafter, the proposed algorithm is compared against other algorithms in the literature on three additional sets of benchmark functions and with two different procedures for the initialization of weight vectors. The experiments have shown promising results on irregular Pareto fronts, specially for disconnected and inverted ones.},

However, the crossover operator used by CSs does not faithfully generalize the standard two-parents crossover: it samples a convex hull instead of a segment. Segmentwise Evolutionary Search algorithms (SESs) are defined as a more faithful generalization, equipped with a crossover operator that samples the metric segment of two parents. In metric spaces where the union of all possible segments of a given set is always a convex set , a SES is a particular CS. Consequently, the representation-free analysis of the CS on quasi-concave landscapes can be extended to the SES in these particular metric spaces. When instantiated to binary strings of the Hamming space (resp. d d -ary strings of the Manhattan space), a polynomial expected runtime upper bound is obtained for quasi-concave landscapes with at most polynomially many level sets for well-chosen population sizes. In particular, the SES solves Leading Ones in at most 288 n ln [ 4 n ( 2 n + 1 ) ] 288nln[4n(2n+1)] expected fitness evaluations when the population size is equal to 144 ln [ 4 n ( 2 n + 1 ) ] 144ln[4n(2n+1)] .},

This predictor can generate good initial population for the new environment.

  abstract     = {Environmental selection of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) is a key component that chooses promising solutions from a candidate set for later usage. Most environmental selection strategies choose solutions based on their function values. However, in real-world optimization problems , function evaluations can be time consuming. The necessity of a large number of function evaluations leads to the low efficiency of MOEAs. How to decrease the number of function evaluations is one of the main issues of MOEAs. The environmental selection can be regarded as a classification process. The selected solutions are the promising class, and the discarded solutions are the unpromising class. Based on this consideration, we propose a classification-assisted environmental selection (CAES) strategy in this paper to decrease the number of function evaluations in MOEAs. In the proposed method, solutions are divided into two classes. One is non-dominated solutions (i.e. promising class) and the other is dominated solutions (i.e. unpromising class). The classifier is built to classify the offspring solutions into these two classes. Only promising offspring are evaluated (unpromising ones are removed with no function evaluations). Therefore, the number of function evaluations is reduced. We integrate the proposed CAES strategy into six MOEAs. The effectiveness of the proposed CAES strategy is examined through computational experiments on various test suites and three real-world application problems. Our experimental results show that the proposed CAES strategy clearly reduces the number of function evaluations without severely degrading the search ability of the original MOEAs.},

In this paper, we propose an multioperator search strategy for the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm , which adaptively learns the manifold structure of Pareto optimal solution set and Pareto optimal front by using the distribution information in the decision space and objective space. Firstly, a mating pool composed of highly similar solutions is constructed to guide the local search direction of the current population. Then, the promising solutions in the objective space are collected and their difference vectors are used to guide the global search direction of the current population. Finally, in order to select the candidate solution which is more suitable for the search stage of the algorithm, the offspring restriction probability is designed to adaptively direct the search towards promising regions of the search space. Experimental results verify the advantages of multioperator search strategy in improving search efficiency.},

We also proposed modeling the chaos present in the time series as a preprocessor , which we called stage-1. Accordingly, we proposed 2-stage models, where stage-1 is followed by obtaining the optimal point prediction using NSGA-II/NSPSO/MOEA-D and using these point predictions to obtain PIs (stage-2). We then proposed a 3-stage hybrid, which is built on the 2-stage model, wherein the 3 rd stage also invokes NSGA-II/NSPSO/MOEA-D in order to estimate the PIs from the point predictions obtained in 2 nd stage by simultaneously and explicitly optimizing (i) prediction interval coverage probability (PICP) and (ii) prediction interval average width (PIAW). The proposed models yielded better results in terms of both PICP and PIAW compared to the state-of-the-art Lower Upper Bound Estimation Method (LUBE) with Gradient Descent (GD) and LUBE with long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The 3-stage models outperformed the 2-stage models with respect to PICP but showed similar performance in PIAW at the cost of running NSGA-II/NSPSO/MOEA-D second time. Overall, MOEA-D yielded best PIs in two datasets and NSGA-II outperformed the other two in the third dataset. But, in terms of hypervolume, in 2-stage MOEA-D produced most diverse solutions in two datasets, while NSGA-II was the winner in the third dataset.},

  abstract     = {As an emerging topic, network embedding aims to convert the complicated network information into a low-dimensional vector space that largely preserves the network topology and effectively benefits various network tasks. Most existing methods mainly focus on the sketchy preservation of local or global network information, which greatly limits their application scenarios. In this paper, we propose a single-particle optimization algorithm for network embedding problems (SPO-NE) to carefully preserve both the local properties of nodes and the global community structure of networks. Based on the evolutionary scheme of particle swarm optimization, SPO-NE innovatively uses a single particle with two well-designed strategies for optimization. The multi-level learning strategy is devoted to comprehensively saving the local properties of nodes from three aspects of similarity, degree, and community, while the transfer strategy serves to help the nodes located at the community boundary to obtain better community labels. In experiments, SPO-NE is compared with several state-of-the-art baselines on both real-world and synthetic networks. The results indicate the superiority of SPO-NE on various network tasks. Specifically, SPO-NE can outperform the best baselines by over 10\% on five datasets in community detection. With only 10\% training samples in node classification , SPO-NE can improve the best baselines by 7–10\% on five datasets.},

  abstract     = {A memetic version between an evolutionary algorithm (differential evolution) and the local search provided by protein fragment replacements was defined for protein structure prediction. In this problem, it is intended to find the global minimum in a high-dimensional energy landscape to discover the native structure of the protein. This problem presents a multimodal energy landscape which can additionally present deceptiveness when searching for the protein structure with minimum energy. One strategy is to try to obtain a diverse set of optimized and different protein conformations, which can be located in different local minima of the energy landscape. For this purpose, different niching methods (crowding, fitness sharing and speciation) were integrated into the memetic algorithm . The integration of niching makes it possible to obtain in a straightforward way a diverse set of optimized and structurally different protein conformations. Compared to previous studies, as well as to the widely used Rosetta protein structure prediction method, the potential solutions offered here present a diverse set of folds with different distances (RMSD) from the real native conformation, with wide RMSD distributions, and obtaining conformations closer to the native structure (in RMSD values) in some proteins.},

  abstract     = {The symbolic methods have recently regained popularity due to their reasonable interpretability compared to neural network-based artificial intelligence techniques. The regression tree is such a symbolic method that divides the feature space into several subregions and builds a simple response surface model, such as a constant value or a linear model, for each subregion. However, this strategy may fail when nonlinear structures exist in the subregions . To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a new regression model, named piecewise symbolic regression tree (PS-Tree). Instead of using constant values or linear models as the leaf nodes , PS-Tree builds symbolic regressors for the leaf nodes or subregions. In addition to that, we also propose an adaptive space partition strategy by dynamically adjusting the partition of the space to alleviate the problem caused by incorrect partitioning. PS-Tree is applied to 122 synthetic and real-world datasets, and the results show that it outperforms several state-of-the-art regression methods .},

Specifically, PSO variants that can be rewritten as a finite sum of stochastically weighted difference vectors between a particle’s position and swarm informers are covered by the theorem. Additionally, the use of the derived theorem allows a PSO practitioner to obtain stability criteria that contains no artificial restriction on the relationship between control coefficients . The majority of previous stability results for PSO variants provided stability criteria under the restriction that certain control coefficients are equal; such restrictions are not present when using the derived theorem. Using the derived theorem, as demonstration of its ease of use, stability criteria are derived without the imposed restriction on the relation between the control coefficients for four popular PSO variants.},

Therefore, it is necessary to provide robustness to adversarial examples with an accurate score when developing a new classifier. In this work, we perform a comparative study of the effects of these attacks on the complex problem of art media categorization, which involves a sophisticated analysis of features to classify a fine collection of artworks. We tested a prevailing bag of visual words approach from computer vision , four deep convolutional neural networks (AlexNet, VGG, ResNet , ResNet101), and brain programming. The results showed that brain programming predictions’ change in accuracy was below 2\% using adversarial examples from the fast gradient sign method. With a multiple-pixel attack, brain programming obtained four out of seven classes without changes and the rest with a maximum error of 4\%. Finally, brain programming got four categories without changes using adversarial patches and for the remaining three classes with an accuracy variation of 1\%. The statistical analysis confirmed that brain programming predictions’ confidence was not significantly different for each pair of clean and adversarial examples in every experiment. These results prove brain programming’s robustness against adversarial examples compared to deep convolutional neural networks and the computer vision method for the art media categorization problem.},

  abstract     = {Differential Evolution (DE) has been widely appraised as a simple yet robust population-based, non-convex optimization algorithm primarily designed for continuous optimization . Two important control parameters of DE are the scale factor F F , which controls the amplitude of a perturbation step on the current solutions and the crossover rate C r Cr , which limits the mixing of components of the parent and the mutant individuals during recombination. We propose a very simple, yet effective, nearest spatial neighborhood-based modification to the adaptation process of the aforesaid parameters in the Success-History based adaptive DE (SHADE) algorithm. SHADE uses a historical archive of the successful F F and C r Cr values to update these parameters and stands out as a very competitive DE variant of current interest. Our proposed modifications can be extended to any SHADE-based DE algorithm like L-SHADE (SHADE with linear population size reduction), jSO (L-SHADE with modified mutation) etc. The enhanced performance of the modified SHADE algorithm is showcased on the IEEE CEC (Congress on Evolutionary Computation) 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2017 benchmark suites by comparing against the DE-based winners of the corresponding competitions. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed neighborhood-based parameter adaptation strategy is demonstrated by using the real-life problems from the IEEE CEC 2011 competition on testing evolutionary algorithms on real-world numerical optimization problems .},

These techniques include (a) the node clustering concept where transition nodes are organised in a set of clusters, (b) adaptive pheromone evaporation controlled dynamically based on the information entropy and (c) the formulation of the new termination condition based on the diversity of solutions in population. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed principles, a number of experiments were conducted using 30 benchmark instances (ranging from 51 to 2,392 nodes with various nodes topologies) taken from the well-known TSPLIB benchmarks and the results are compared with several state-of-the-art ACO-based methods; the proposed algorithm outperforms these rival methods in most cases.

Recently, various methods have been presented to enhance the performance for the constrained multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs). However, most of them encounter difficulties when dealing with the CMOPs with complex feasible regions. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes a tri-population based co-evolutionary framework (TriP): i) the first and second populations are evolved through a weak co-evolutionary relation for the original and unconstrained problems respectively to handle CMOPs with relatively simple constraints; and ii) the third population is evolved solely for the constraint relaxed problem with constraint relaxation technique. The cooperation of three populations preserve the advantages of weak co-evolution and constraint relaxation. Experiments on six benchmark CMOPs with 65 instances and diverse features are performed. Compared to 9 state-of-the-art CMOEAs, the proposed framework yields highly competitive performance and the best versatility. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed framework on handling real-world CMOPs is also verified.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary robotics employs unconventional techniques to continuously evolve controllers for robots, based on their fitness values. In most cases, a parent controller is subjected to mutation to evolve its offspring. If the offspring performs better than the parent, the former is made to replace the latter. This essentially results in a major loss in information learned by the parents over generations. One simple workaround to circumvent this problem is to maintain a Hall of Fame ( HoF ) comprising the best parent controllers for use in future generations. In embodied evolutionary robotic scenarios, caching a large number of controllers in an HoF would result in increased computational overheads while selecting the best out of them, resulting in a drastic reduction in performance. With no means to find an upper limit to the number of controllers that can populate an HoF a priori , devising a technique to dynamically regulate this population is imperative. In this work, a novel method to evict the non-performing controllers within an HoF based on the dynamics of the system, is proposed. We describe the evolution of such controllers using genetic operators that eventually form an Idiotypic Network . A constantly varying Resource , associated with each controller together with its concentration in the Idiotypic Network , helps decide its eviction from the HoF . Experiments performed using simulations and also a real robot indicate a marked improvement in the learning process due to the dynamic eviction policy.},

ACO is one of the most widely used metaheuristic algorithms applicable to various optimization problems. Nevertheless, the deficiency of ACO is early maturity and slow convergence, usually leading to dissatisfactory performance. In this research, a new type of ACO is proposed with innovative adaptive learning mechanism is devised (the algorithm is called ADACO). In the paper, first, the ACO algorithm for Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is modeled in the framework of reinforcement learning (RL) and learns a best policy by stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Then, an adaptive gradient descent strategy, which can exploit the update history of per-dimensional pheromones to achieve intelligent convergence, is integrated into the ACO algorithm as ADACO. A parallel computation process is implemented in the process to expedite computational efficiency. Finally, through case studies in TSP and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), ADACO is validated. ADACO is trialed on various sizes of TSP and CVRP instances and compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms. Results show that ADACO is competitive in terms of accuracy (better in most cases), stability (statistically significant) and adaptability (support various types of problems). The results also elucidate that the algorithm maintains good computational efficiency owing to its parallel implementation. It can be concluded that ADACO is effectively applicable to routing problems with good performance.},

  abstract     = {A method based on decision variable partition is often utilized for large-scale optimization problems , but it only considers the convergence and diversity of decision variables. However, decision variables in the same group may still have different (strong or weak) correlations with objectives, even if they are only related to convergence or diversity. This situation not only reduces the accuracy of the grouping of decision variables, but also affects the allocation of computational resources. To address this issue, an algorithm based on dual analysis of objective space and decision space to group decision variables more accurately for solving large-scale many-objective optimization problems is proposed; this algorithm is called LM-DAS. It first divides decision variables into two categories: convergence-related variables and the diversity-related variables. Then, the correlation between convergence-related variables and objective functions is analyzed. The decision space is divided into several subspaces according to the objective importance. Next, the decision variables are grouped using the method of interaction analysis between two level variables. Under the premise of ensuring the correctness of the grouping as much as possible, the algorithm can allocate more search resources to decision variables that are related to more important objective functions. The performance of LM-DAS is compared with four representative algorithms for 71 test instances. These instances involved 5–10 objectives and 200–1000 decision variables. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is competitive and effective.},

A key cited strength of GOMEAs is linkage learning, i.e., the ability to determine and leverage, during optimization, key dependencies between problem variables. However, the added value of linkage learning was not tested in depth for permutation GOMEA. Here, we introduce a new version of permutation GOMEA, called qGOMEA, that works directly in permutation space, removing the redundancy of using random keys. We additionally consider various linkage information sources, including random noise, in both GOMEA variants, and compare performance with various classic genetic algorithms on a wider range of problems than considered before. We find that, although the benefits of linkage learning are clearly visible for various artificial benchmark problems, this is far less the case for various real-world inspired problems. Finally, we find that qGOMEA performs best, and is more applicable to a wider range of permutation problems.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Things (IoT) assisted robotic applications are becoming prominent in smart cities for granting autonomous services for end-users. The IoT-enabled edge-computing paradigm provides ubiquitous computing and resource access for the robots for robust services. The interactive sessions and partial computations of the robots result in unnecessary exploitation of real-time resources. This paper introduces a swarm intelligence-based modular interactive computation scheme (MICS) for IoT-assisted robots to address the incompleteness in resource utilization and reduce computational complexity . In this scheme, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is incorporated with intelligent decision-making. The role of swarm intelligence is to improve interactive computations using different agents that provide offloading support. The flexible sharing of swarm agents provides shared resource utilization and comprehensive calculations for robot-based assistance. The proposed scheme performs computing and interaction decisions based on the robot inputs and its parallel processing feature. The proposed scheme&#39;s performance is verified using the metrics interaction span, decision complexity, offloading ratio, computing time, and outages. The proposed scheme achieves a 12.74\% high interaction span, 6.68\% less decision complexity, 11.69\% less offloading ratio, and 19.41\% less computing time under different intervals. Based on the resource availability analysis, MICS achieves 62.1\% compared to IoT-IF 25.6\%, SF-EM 32.9, and 25.61\%. Further MICS offloading ratio achieves up to 8.5\% following IoT-IF 11.9\%, SF-EM 10.1\%, and SDF 9.1\%.},

  abstract     = {The environments of the dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs), such as Pareto optimal front (POF) or Pareto optimal set (POS), usually frequently change with the evolution process. This kind of problem poses a higher challenge for evolutionary algorithms because it requires the population to quickly track (i.e., converge) to the position of a new environment and be widely distributed in the search space. The prediction-based response mechanism is a commonly used method to deal with environmental changes, but it’s only suitable for predictable changes. Moreover, the imbalance of population diversity and convergence in the process of tracking the dynamically changing POF has aggravated. In this paper, we proposed a new change response mechanism that combines a hybrid prediction strategy and a precision controllable mutation strategy (HPPCM) to solve the DMOPs. Specifically, the hybrid prediction strategy coordinates the center point-based prediction and the guiding individual-based prediction to make accurate predictions. Thus, the population can quickly adapt to the predictable environmental changes. Additionally, the precision controllable mutation strategy handles unpredictable environmental changes. It improves the diversity exploration of the population by controlling the variation degree of solutions. In this way, our change response mechanism can adapt to various environmental changes of DMOPs, such as predictable and unpredictable changes. This paper integrates the HPPCM mechanism into a prevalent regularity model-based multiobjective estimation of distribution algorithm (RM-MEDA) to optimize DMOPs. The results of comparative experiments with some state-of-the-art algorithms on various test instances have demonstrated the effectiveness and competitiveness of the change response mechanism proposed in this paper.},

  abstract     = {Memetic algorithms are known for their enhanced solution refinement capabilities. These capabilities are a result of incorporating local-search methods into population-based metaheuristics such as swarm and evolutionary algorithms . However, designing a memetic algorithm is not a trivial task. The inclusion of local-search procedures must consider the exploitation–exploration balance and its interplay with other algorithm operators. Due to these variables, there is no universal methodology to design a memetic algorithm. Although previous works have investigated the impact of local search procedures on genetic and ant colony algorithms, we have limited knowledge about the impact of these procedures on other types of swarm-based algorithms. For swarm-based algorithms, the interactions within the population are vital to the emergence of collective intelligence and shape the algorithm’s behaviour. Here, we model these interactions into a network and analyse the impact of local search in swarm-based algorithms. We selected the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), and one memetic version of each algorithm as a case study. We examined the effects of the modifications proposed in the memetic variants. The results obtained indicate that the networks of interactions capture several characteristics of the algorithms and the impact of the local search strategies. The impact of local search operators can be gauged by the temporal analysis of the changes in the structural properties of the algorithm’s network (e.g. study of the weight and distribution of the network’s connections). These changes are linked to the algorithms’ convergence signature and can be used as a proxy to assess the differences between the algorithms studied and their memetic versions.},

However, the existing structural balance models usually neglect the influence between nodes, and simultaneously, fail to achieve a desirable trade-off between the structural balance cost and the community quality, which does not fit the nature of the practical network scenarios and then affects the performance of balancing the complex network structure. For this issue, this paper first proposes an improved structural balance model, which jointly takes the influence between nodes and the community quality into account. Then, in order to solve the above model, this paper designs an enhanced multi-objective optimizer based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm framework, which utilizes the estimation of distribution model and a local search strategy to improve the search ability in the discrete search space. Especially, the proposed optimizer has a better ability of exploring the complex solution space and exploiting the local optimal region with a fast convergence rate. However, the use of the estimation of distribution operation and the local search operation may lead to expensive computational cost. Then, to alleviate the computational complexity , this paper introduces a novel evaluation method, which only calculates the total weights of positive edges and negative edges that need to be changed to balance the network, instead of computing the real objective function in the local search operation. Experiments on the different networks confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

The key to handling such problems is locating and maintaining all Pareto optimal solutions in decision space simultaneously. The distribution of Pareto optimal solutions obtained by some existing multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms is still not satisfactory. This paper proposes a niching backtracking search algorithm with adaptive local search to solve such problems. In the proposed algorithm, the affinity propagation clustering method as a parameter-free automatic niching technique is adopted to form multiple niches. A novel mutation based on affinity propagation clustering is then developed to search for more Pareto solutions within each niche. In addition, an adaptive local search strategy is designed in each niche to improve the search efficiency and the accuracy of Pareto optimal solutions. The proposed algorithm is compared with seven state-of-the-art multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms on a multimodal multiobjective optimization test suite with 22 benchmark functions from CEC 2019 competition and a map-based practical application problem. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms its competitors on 14 out of 22 benchmark functions in terms of the reciprocal of Pareto sets proximity and inverted generational distance in decision space metrics. Also, the proposed method is more effective and competitive than its competitors when solving the map-based practical application problem.},

DBGA is compared to the state of the art across a set of conventional instances. The results of the experimental study provided interesting insight in the problem structure and showed that DBGA is quite competitive with the state of the art.

  abstract     = {In mining supply chains, transporting ore from mines to ports, is a problem of significant interest. Resources required in transporting ore are limited, and hence using resource efficiently goes a long way towards solving this problem. A key issue is that the resource availability is subject to uncertainties. Previous studies have considered similar (deterministic) problems, commonly tackled as resource constrained job scheduling. However, the uncertainty associated with resources needed to transport ore has not been considered. This study extends previous ones, by investigating resource constrained job scheduling with uncertainty (considering resource availabilities). The focus is on robust optimisation , where the aim is to find high-quality solutions irrespective of the input data. To solve this problem a population-based ant colony optimisation approach is devised, with the aim of identifying high-quality solutions across several uncertain scenarios. Moreover, computing the objective is inefficient due to uncertainty, and hence surrogate models are used. Experiments are conducted on a wide range of problem instances with varying uncertainty levels considering resources, and find that population-based ant colony optimisation is superior to ant colony optimisation on its own. The key advantage of this method is that it is able to maintain a population of excellent solutions, which can be used to efficiently approximate the objective values of new solutions, and hence update the pheromones globally of the ant colony optimisation algorithm. Using this information the surrogate model considers only high quality solutions, and by carrying out increased learning in short time-frames, achieves excellent results.},

This simple approach allowed us to use the standard RMSE function to evaluate the train classification error on binary classification problems and, consequently, to preserve the intrinsic properties of the geometric semantic operators. The results encouraged us to investigate this approach further.

The regularity model and the probabilistic ranking method are proven that they can reduce the effect of noise in NMOPs to some degree, so in this paper, we combine them together to solve NMOPs better. On the other hand, we combine the Gaussian model with the non-dominated sorting so as to overcome the shortage of the regularity model. Consequently, a new noisy multi-objective optimization algorithm is proposed, denoted as GMRM-NSGA-II in this paper. The population of each generation is divided into two subpopulations adaptively, which are prepared for two different models with different sorting methods.

With the increased number of objectives, multiobjective optimization becomes more challenging due to the difficulty of convergence in population selection. A number of many-objective evolutionary algorithms (MaOEAs) have been designed to enhance population selection, but studies selecting parents for evolution are still rare. Fortunately, multiobjective immune algorithms (MOIAs) provide a promising approach to select high-quality parents for evolution. However, the existing MOIAs are not effective for solving many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs), as these algorithms consider only the local information of solutions for cloning but ignore the global information of populations; consequently, the populations of these algorithms may easily be trapped in local optima. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a many-objective immune algorithm with a novel immune cloning operator. In this approach, the global information in the population is used to estimate the quality of each solution, and only a few offspring from high-quality parents are generated in each generation to improve the convergence and diversity of the population. When the proposed algorithm is compared with nine MaOEAs and six MOIAs on three MaOP benchmarks with 5, 10, and 15 objectives, the experimental results validate that the proposed algorithm obtains the best performance in most cases. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is also validated on one real-world optimization problem.},

SPS is an optimization subroutine that replaces uniform sampling for population initialization, and can be applied to any population-based algorithm, including evolutionary or particle swarm algorithms . Through rigorous testing, we have found that SPS leads to near-universal improvements in hyper-volume for common population-based algorithms in large-scale (i.e. over 8000 decision variable) and sparse multi-objective optimization problems. Additionally, the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) with SPS is found to outperform a selection of other existing multi-objective optimization algorithms with SPS for handling sparse high-dimensional decision spaces. Considering these benefits and its simplicity, the proposed SPS method is an evidently promising method for boosting performance in large-scale sparse multi-objective optimization algorithms.},

This proposal is suitable if the preferences of the Decision Maker (DM) can be modeled through outranking relations. The introduced algorithm (Interval Outranking-based ACO, IO-ACO) is the first ant-colony optimizer that embeds an outranking model to bear vagueness and ill-definition of the DM&#39;s preferences. This capacity is the most differentiating feature of IO-ACO because this issue is highly relevant in practice. IO-ACO biases the search towards the Region of Interest (RoI), the privileged zone of the Pareto frontier containing the solutions that better match the DM&#39;s preferences. Two widely studied benchmarks were utilized to measure the efficiency of IO-ACO, i.e., the DTLZ and WFG test suites. Accordingly, IO-ACO was compared with four competitive multi-objective optimizers: The Indicator-based Many-Objective ACO, the Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition, the Reference Vector-Guided Evolutionary Algorithm using Improved Growing Neural Gas, and the Indicator-based Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm with Reference Point Adaptation. The numerical results show that IO-ACO approximates the RoI better than leading metaheuristics based on approximating the Pareto frontier alone.},

  abstract     = {In order to efficiently solve the binary optimization problems by using differential evolution (DE), a class of new transfer functions, Taper-shaped transfer function, is firstly proposed by using power functions. Then, the novel binary differential evolution algorithm based on Taper-shaped transfer functions (T-NBDE) is proposed. T-NBDE transforms a real vector representing the individual encoding into a binary vector by using the Taper-shaped transfer function, which is suitable for solving binary optimization problems . For verifying the practicability of Taper-shaped transfer functions and the excellent performance of T-NBDE, T-NBDE is firstly compared with binary DE based on S-shaped, U-shaped and V-shaped transfer functions, respectively. Subsequently, it is compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms for solving the knapsack problem with a single continuous variable (KPC) and the uncapacitated facility location problem (UFLP). The comparison results show that Taper-shaped transfer functions are competitive than existing transfer functions, and T-NBDE is more effective than existing algorithms for solving KPC problem and UFLP problem.},

In general, NESs have more than one root, and it is a great challenge to locate multiple roots in a single run for numerical computation . In order to tackle this challenging task, we propose a neighborhood-based particle swarm optimization with discrete crossover (MNPSO). MNPSO has three main characteristics: (1) it adopts a two-stage framework to balance exploitation and exploration well; (2) a distance-based adaptive neighborhood technique is proposed, which can form an appropriate neighborhood for each particle; (3) a discrete crossover operator improves the performance of PSO in the high dimension problems. We choose thirty NESs with different features as the test suite to evaluate the performance of MNPSO. The experimental results reveal that MNPSO can locate multiple roots in a single run, and the root ratio and the success ratio of MNPSO are higher than other methods.},

The approach adopts a context-free grammar to describe the syntax of evolving rules, which facilitates an evolutionary algorithm to evolve rule structures without manual intervention. We propose modifications to the genome structure to address the requirements of heterogeneity, and two cooperative learning architectures based on team learning and cooperative coevolution . Experimental evaluations with four behaviours illustrate that both architectures are successful in evolving heterogeneous collective behaviours. Both heterogeneous architectures surpass a homogeneous model in performance for deriving a flocking macro behaviour, however the homogeneous model is superior for evolving micro behaviours such as cohesion and alignment. The results infer that by placing the entire set of agent rules and their syntax under evolutionary control, effective solutions to complex problems can be evolved when human knowledge and intuition becomes insufficient.},

  abstract     = {The present work discusses a novel conceptual formulation of the Fractional-Order Ant Colony Algorithm (FACA), which is a fractional long term memory based cooperative learning approach. In the standard Integer-order Ant Colony Algorithms (IACAs), each ant selects its next edge on the graph according to a transition probability that is obtained from the pheromone value and additional information found on the edges adjacent to its present node. To improve the optimization capability associated with traditional IACAs, we have studied here, as an interesting theoretical problem, whether it will be possible to apply the inherent strengths of fractional calculus to modify the transition behaviour of the classical IACAs by replacing the simple one-step probability by a more complex expression that seems to include some look-ahead information. The formal motivation for this expression is from the fractional derivatives where simple differences are replaced by more involved expressions. Motivated by this need, in this work, we introduce a novel algorithm called Fractional-Order Ant Colony Algorithm (FACA). At first, we extend the IACA to the FACA based on the long-term memory of fractional difference. Secondly, we discuss the algorithmic flow of the FACA. Thirdly, we present the mathematical proof and convergence analysis of the FACA. Fourthly, we present the experiment results obtained and the associated analyses carried out. The paper introduces a novel mathematical approach, fractional calculus, to the family of ant colony algorithms, that differs from most of the previous approaches and hence it presents an interesting theoretical contribution in this research domain.},

  abstract     = {The induction of decision trees is a widely-used approach to build classification models that guarantee high performance and expressiveness. Since a recursive-partitioning strategy guided for some splitting criterion is commonly used to induce these classifiers, overfitting, attribute selection bias, and instability to small training set changes are well-known problems in them. Other approaches, such as incremental induction, classifier ensembles , and the global search in the decision-tree-space, have been implemented to overcome these problems. In particular, metaheuristics such as simulated annealing, genetic algorithms , genetic programming , and ant colony optimization have been used to induce compact and accurate decision trees. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of the use of single-solution-based metaheuristics and swarm and evolutionary computation algorithms to build decision trees as classification models. We outline the decision-tree-induction process components and detail the existing literature studies on metaheuristic-based approaches to building these classifiers. Several timelines showing the chronological order in which these approaches were introduced in the literature are included. A summary analysis of these studies is also conducted, focusing on their internal components and experimental studies. This work provides a useful reference point for future research in this field.},

Although heterogeneous UAVs have an enormous advantage in improving performance and conserving energy with respect to homogeneous ones, they give rise to a complex path planning problem . Especially in large-scale cooperative search systems with multiple separated regions, coverage path planning which seeks optimal paths for UAVs to completely visit and search all of regions of interest, has a NP-hard computation complexity and is difficult to settle. In this work, we focus on the coverage path planning problem of heterogeneous UAVs, and present an ant colony system (ACS)-based algorithm to obtain good enough paths for UAVs and fully cover all regions efficiently. First, models of UAVs and regions are built, and a linear programming-based formulation is presented to exactly provide the best point-to-point flight path for each UAV. Then, inspired by the foraging behaviour of ants that they can obtain the shortest path between their nest and food, an ACS-based heuristic is presented to seek approximately optimal solutions and minimize the time consumption of tasks in the cooperative search system. Experiments on randomly generated regions have been organized to evaluate the performance of the new heuristic in terms of execution time, task completion time and deviation ratio.},

This process can be described as a multi-agent single-machine scheduling (MSS) problem with release dates, where several packets (jobs) share a common network (processor) but are maintained by several competitive applications (agents) that optimize their criteria. The objective is to minimize the sum of makespans belonging to several agents individually. The NP-hardness of the model indicates that it cannot be optimally solved in polynomial time . For small-scale instances, an effective branch and bound (B&amp;B) algorithm integrated with an elaborately designed pruning rule and a lower bound is developed to achieve exact solutions. Given the quality of service requirements and the periodical maintenance of networks, this problem is generalized to the weighted and periodic maintenance versions, respectively. For the weighted version, a hybrid discrete artificial bee colony (HDABC) algorithm integrated with effective improvement strategies is developed to achieve satisfactory solutions for medium-scale instances. For the periodic maintenance version, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method is introduced to obtain high-quality solutions in dynamic situation.

Various intermediated procedures, such as variable analysis, clustering, and grouping, to divide large-scale decision variables are needed by most existing algorithms, seriously affecting the optimization performance. The tensor factorization , which is excellent in decomposition and dimensionality reduction of tensors, is originally introduced to the proposed algorithm to decompose the large-scale decision space into small-scale sub-spaces. Then an evolutionary strategy is designed to optimize these sub-populations by speed-constrained multi-objective particle swarm optimization circularly, searching for ideal solutions in each newly constructed lower-scale sub-space. Finally, tensor factorization is used to reconstruct the whole population for asymptotically optimizing the population by all the subpopulations. Using the proposed algorithm on some well-known multi-objective and many-objective benchmarks with 1000 decision variables, it outperformed other state-of-the-art algorithms both in solution quality and convergence rate. The main weakness of the proposed algorithm is the reconstruction error caused by the tensor factorization, which slows down the convergence rate of optimization. Hence our future work is to construct a constrained objective function with the restricted condition of the sparsity of the tensor, which affects the reconstruction error, and seek the solving algorithm.},

This paper is the first to present a mathematical model of the blocking hybrid flow shop problem with an energy-efficient criterion and a modified Iterative Greedy algorithm based on a swap strategy designed to optimize the constructed model. In the proposed algorithm, first, a heuristic is adopted to generate the initial solution. Second, a local perturbation strategy based on a swap operator is designed to ensure the convergence of the algorithm. Third, a simple global perturbation strategy based on a half-swap operator is proposed as a means to further search for the potentially best solution with the traditional simulated annealing criterion. The proposed algorithm is applied to 150 test instances at different scales and compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.

  abstract     = {Real-world optimisation problems pose domain specific challenges that often require an ad-hoc algorithmic design to be efficiently addressed. The present paper investigates the optimisation of a key stage in data mining , known as instance reduction, which aims to shrink the input data prior to applying a learning algorithm. Performing a smart selection or creation of a reduced number of samples that represent the original data may become a complex large-scale optimisation problem, characterised by a computationally expensive objective function, which has been often tackled by sophisticated population-based metaheuristics that suffer from a high runtime. Instead, by following the Ockham’s Razor in Memetic Computing, we propose a Memetic Computing approach that we refer to as fast Single-Point Memetic Structure with Accelerated Local Search (SPMS-ALS). Using the k-nearest neighbours algorithm as base classifier , we first employ a simple local search for large-scale problems that exploits the search logic of Pattern Search, perturbing an n n -dimensional vector along the directions identified by its design variables one by one. This point-by-point perturbation mechanism allows us to design a strategy to re-use most of the calculations previously made to compute the objective function of a candidate solution. The proposed Accelerated Local Search is integrated within a single-point memetic framework and coupled with a resampling mechanism and a crossover. A thorough experimental analysis shows that SPMS-ALS, despite its simplicity, displays an excellent performance which is as good as that of the state-of-the-art while reducing up to approximately 85\% of the runtime with respect to any other algorithm that performs the same number of function calls.},

Population topology is a key aspect of particle swarm optimization research. However, after more than twenty years of research, the effects of the population topology are still poorly understood. Previous research has established that the information propagation speed determined by the population topology has an important impact on the algorithm performance; however, the impact of information propagation speed on particle swarm optimization and its variants has not yet been investigated. In this paper, information propagation in particle swarms is described and, hence, a method of simulating information propagation in particle swarms is introduced, which is used to obtain the information propagation speed. The correlation between the information propagation speed and algorithm performance is clarified through numerical simulation. The results show that the information propagation speed has a strong negative correlation with the population diversity of particle swarm optimization and its variants in the early iterations, regardless of the adopted test function and population diversity measure. The results also show that when optimizing problems with the same property, the impact of population topology on the optimization results of particle swarm optimization and variant algorithms is similar. Further more, this study provides some guidance on the population topology selection for particle swarm optimization and its variants. These findings contribute to our understanding of the impact of population topology on particle swarm optimization and its variants, and provide a basis for population topology selection for particle swarm optimization and its variants.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel multi-swarm particle swarm optimizer driven by delayed-activation (DA) strategy and repulsive mechanism, named as enhanced multi-swarm cooperative particle swarm optimizer (EMCPSO) is proposed. EMCPSO is designed to make use of the advantage of multi-swarm technique and overcome the problem of premature convergence of original PSO. In this algorithm, the whole population is partitioned into four identical sub-swarms. The best particle of each sub-swarm, sbest , is used to estimate the evolutionary state of the group. If the sbest can continuously improve its solution&#39;s quality, that sub-swarm evolves independently without communicating with other counterparts. Otherwise, based on a non-ascending sequence, a delayed-activation (DA) strategy will be triggered. With information sharing among multi-swarm, activating exemplar is constructed to promote the stagnant sub-swarm to search for better solutions again. On the other hand, a repulsive mechanism is introduced to prevent the whole population from gathering together prematurely. In this way, more potential regions of the search space can be explored by EMCPSO. The experiment results on CEC 2017 problem set demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed EMCPSO in terms of solution accuracy and convergence speed.},

To remedy this issue, a surrogate-assisted decomposition-based evolutionary algorithm is proposed in this work where the Kriging model is used to approximate each objective function. In order to balance exploration and exploitation, the model management strategy integrates the infill criterion with the distribution information of both weight vectors and population. Additionally, a one-by-one replacement strategy is developed to select a fixed number of training data to limit computational time for the model training as well as maintain the approximation accuracy. The empirical results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is competitive to the state-of-the-art algorithms on a number of benchmarks. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied for a real-world optimization problem in the refining process and exhibits superior performance.},

  abstract     = {Many multi-objective optimization problems in the real world are dynamic, with objectives that conflict and change over time. These problems put higher demands on the algorithm’s convergence performance and the ability to respond to environmental changes. Confronting these two points, this paper proposes a dynamic multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm based on adversarial decomposition and neighborhood evolution (ADNEPSO). To overcome the instability of the traditional decomposition method for the changing Pareto optimal front (POF) shape, the proposed algorithm utilizes the complementary characteristics in the search area of the adversarial vector, and the two populations are alternately updated and co-evolved by adversarial search directions. Additionally, a novel particle update strategy is proposed to select promising neighborhood information to guide evolution and enhance diversity. To improve the ability to cope with environmental changes, an effective dynamic response mechanism is proposed, including three parts: archive set prediction, exploration of global optimal information, and retention of excellent particles to accelerate convergence to the Pareto optimal set (POS) in the new environment. The proposed algorithm is tested on a series of benchmark problems and compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms. The results show that ADNEPSO performed excellently in both convergence and diversity, and is highly competitive in dealing with dynamic problems .},

Designing complex approximate circuits is, however, a very difficult and computationally demanding process. Evolutionary approximation—in particular, the method of Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP)—currently represents one of the most successful approaches for automated circuit approximation. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate mutation operators for CGP with respect to the performance of circuit approximation. We design a novel dedicated operator that combines the classical single active gene mutation with a node deactivation operation (eliminating a part of the circuit forming a tree from an active gate). We show that our new operator significantly outperforms other operators on a wide class of approximation problems (such as 16 bit multipliers and dividers) and thus improves the performance of the state-of-the-art approximation techniques. Our results are grounded on a rigorous statistical evaluation including 39 approximation scenarios and 14,000 runs.},

This work addresses a mixture of job-shop and flow-shop production scheduling problem with a speed-scaling policy and no-idle time strategy. A mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated to determine the speed level of operations and the sequence of job-shop and flow-shop products, aiming at the simultaneous optimization of production efficiency and energy consumption. Then, a multi-objective Q-learning-based hyper-heuristic with Bi-criteria selection (QHH-BS) is developed to obtain a set of high-quality Pareto frontier solutions. In this algorithm, a new three-layer encoding is designed to represent the production sequence of job-shop and flow-shop products; the Pareto-based and indicator-based selection criteria are sequentially implemented to encourage diversity and convergence; Q-learning with a multi-objective metric-based reward mechanism is applied to select an optimizer from three prominent optimizers in each iteration for better exploration and exploitation. Three conclusions are drawn from extensive experiments: (1) Bi-criteria selection is superior to single-criterion selections; (2) Q-learning-based hyper-heuristic is more effective and robust than single optimizer-based algorithms and simple hyper-heuristics; (3) QHH-BS outperforms the existing state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms in convergence and diversity.},

  abstract     = {Not all generate-and-test search algorithms are created equal. Bayesian Optimization (BO) invests a lot of computation time to generate the candidate solution that best balances the predicted value and the uncertainty given all previous data, taking increasingly more time as the number of evaluations performed grows. Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) on the other hand rely on search heuristics that typically do not depend on all previous data and can be done in constant time. Both BO and EA community typically assess their performance as a function of the number of evaluations, i.e., data efficiency. However, this is unfair once we start to compare the efficiency of these classes of algorithms, as the overhead times to generate candidate solutions are significantly different . We suggest to measure the efficiency of generate-and-test search algorithms as the expected gain in the objective value per unit of computation time spent, i.e., time efficiency. To the time-efficient search algorithm, we therefore propose a new algorithm, a combination of BO and an EA, BEA for short, that starts with BO, then transfers knowledge to an EA, and subsequently runs the EA. We compare the BEA with BO, the EA, Differential Evolution (DE), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The results show that BEA outperforms BO, the EA, DE and PSO in terms of time efficiency, and ultimately leads to better performance on well-known benchmark objective functions with many local optima. Moreover, we test BEA, BO, and the EA on nine test cases of robot learning problems and here again we find that BEA outperforms the other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Assembly line balancing considering regular production and preventive maintenance scenarios (ALBP_RP/PM) is a new and effective way to simultaneously handle the assembly production and equipment maintenance. It generates multiple allocation plans in advance. If a workstation is to be maintained, the corresponding allocation plan is applied to bypass this workstation and enable production continuity within the assembly line. However, the ALBP_RP/PM was generally solved as a single-task optimization problem, implying the coupling relationship of allocation plans under different scenarios was essentially ignored. For this reason, it is hereafter treated as a multi-task optimization problem under the premise that the assembly line balancing under each scenario is an independent task. On this basis, an improved multi-objective multifactorial evolutionary algorithm with two extra improvements is proposed to minimize cycle times and operation alterations. Specifically, the native evolutionary operators are reformulated to encourage the inter-scenario sharing of effective knowledge fragments among allocation plans to accelerate the simultaneous optimization of all the tasks; a matrix reduction method is proposed to reduce the decoding time in generating operation sequence; a neighborhood search operator is designed to strengthen the convergence performance of the algorithm. Comprehensive computational results demonstrate that the inter-scenario sharing mechanism in the multi-task optimization expedites the convergence speed and improves the operation allocation plans effectively. Besides, the proposed algorithm clearly outperforms the other five single-task optimization algorithms and four multi-task ones under the same computational limits.},

So, it is of great importance to fully identify the valuable infeasible solutions that are helpful to find the constrained Pareto fronts . To achieve this, this paper evaluates the potential value of each infeasible solution from different aspects, and forms a criterion to fully identify the valuable infeasible solutions. Comparative analysis shows that compared with the existing constraint handling techniques, the proposed criterion is more effective in identifying valuable infeasible solutions. Accordingly, we embed the proposed criterion in the evolutionary algorithm and design a criterion-based constrained multi-objective algorithm for CMOPs. In the proposed algorithm, an archive preferring feasible solutions is used to record the best solutions, which are then mixed with the valuable infeasible solutions identified by the criterion to deal with the CMOPs. A series of simulation experiments on several benchmarks and engineering problem show the competitive performance of the proposed algorithm. Compared with the other state-of-the-art constrained evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms, the proposed algorithm performs better in dealing with different types of CMOPs, and it is the only one that can successfully deal with the problems that the initial population arises in the complex infeasible regions below the Pareto fronts .},

Traditionally, electricity networks have been built using a centralised network infrastructure. In remote areas these typically include long distances between sparsely distributed consumers that lead to high costs and several risks that accompany these long connection lines. Therefore, alternative distributed infrastructures including potential microgrids or stand-alone power systems can be beneficial. Given a set of electricity consumers, their loads and locations, the aim is to find an optimal electricity network topology that might not be interconnected. Previously, this problem has been addressed using different standard clustering approaches comparing the total network costs of each solution. We propose a problem-specific evolutionary algorithm that alters the network structure directly as well as a novel quadtree-based evolutionary algorithm. The algorithms minimise a non-linear objective function representing the cost of the network while approximating real-world constraints. They are tested on a large set of various problem instances and compared to the standard clustering algorithms that have been used previously and an intuitive baseline method . The problem-specific evolutionary algorithm outperforms most standard clustering methods on a range of different test cases while the quadtree-based algorithm is shown to be effective in certain settings.},

Three novel schemes are introduced to enhance the performance of ETA-ACO, including an energy- and bandwidth-aware PM selection scheme, a traffic-based VM ordering scheme, and a direct information exchange scheme. The first scheme consists of two steps when selecting a PM to host a given VM. In the first step, PMs with lower power consumption are preserved. In the second step, the one with the lowest bandwidth resource consumption is chosen to host the VM. In the second scheme, ETA-ACO places VMs in descending order by their traffic demands. The third scheme constructs new solutions by spreading the components of the best solution over a group of constructed solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the three novel schemes are effective in adapting ETA-ACO for the VMP problem. Besides, ETA-ACO outperforms a number of state-of-the-art heuristics and metaheuristics in terms of solution quality.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic multimodal optimization problems (DMMOPs) are a class of problems consisting of two characteristics, i.e., dynamic and multimodal natures. The former characteristic reveals that the properties of DMMOPs change over time, which is derived from dynamic optimization problems (DOPs). The latter one indicates that there exist multiple global or acceptable local optima, which comes from the multimodal optimization problems (MMOPs). Although there has been much attention to both DOPs and MMOPs in the field of meta-heuristics, there is little work devoting to the connection between the dynamic and multimodal natures in DMMOPs. To solve DMMOPs, the strategies dealing with dynamic and multimodal natures in the algorithms should cooperate with each other. Before looking deeply into the connections between two natures, there is necessary to measure the performances of the methods dealing with two natures in DMMOPs. In this paper, first, considering the dynamic and multimodal natures of DMMOPs, we design a set of benchmark problems to simulate various dynamic and multimodal environments. Then, we propose the optimization framework called PopDMMO containing several popular algorithms and methods to test and compare the performances of these algorithms, which gives a general view of solving DMMOPs.},

  abstract     = {Differential evolution (DE) has been a simple yet effective algorithm for global optimization problems . The performance of DE highly depends on its operators and parameter settings. In the last couple of decades, many advanced variants of DE have been proposed by modifying the operators and introducing new parameter tuning methods. However, the majority of the works on advanced DE have been concentrated upon the mutation and crossover operators . The initialization and selection operators are less explored in the literature. In this work, we implement the orthogonal array-based initialization of the population and propose a neighborhood search strategy to construct the initial population for the DE-based algorithms. We also introduce a conservative selection scheme to improve the performance of the algorithm. We analyze the influence of the proposed initialization and selection schemes on several variants of DE. Results suggest that the proposed methods highly improve the performance of DE algorithm and its variants. Furthermore, we introduce an ensemble strategy for parameter adaptation techniques in DE. Incorporating all the proposed initialization, selection, and parameter adaptation strategies, we develop a new variant of DE, named OLSHADE-CS. The performance of OLSHADE-CS is found to be highly competitive and significantly better in many cases when compared with the performance of the state-of-the-art algorithms on CEC benchmark problems.},

  abstract     = {The conception of memetic algorithms (MAs) has provided a new perspective in algorithmic design through hybridizing and combining of local search techniques and population-based search. Previous research has proven that the performance of some multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) could be improved by hybridization with local search strategy. However, when designing many-objective evolutionary optimization algorithms , if the ranking scheme relies on the Pareto dominance relation, it is quite challenging to evaluate solutions with several objective values and distinguish the most effective solutions from a population full of “the first rank” solutions. In this study, a new many-objective five-element cycle optimization algorithm based on a gradient-based local search method (termed LSMaOFECO) is proposed. In the evolutionary search part of LSMaOFECO, within the five-element cycle model, the forces exerted on every individual on different objective dimensions are summed up as an evaluating criterion to decide whether a solution should be accepted directly or updated. In the selection phase, this evaluation method is used to choose the next generation from the parents and the offspring when the dominance relation ranking loses effectiveness. In the local search part, three search tactics are proposed, among which the worst-objective-search tactic outperforms the other two in the experiment and is subsequently used in the updating phase of LSMaOFECO. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with six state-of-the-art multi- and many-objective algorithms by solving a set of many-objective test problems. The results obtained verify the utility of the LSMaOFECO in solving many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs).},

In the proposed HCMFOA, a reference points-based cluster strategy is introduced to dynamic divide the swarm into multiple sub-swarms. Moreover, a hybrid initial strategy is designed based on non-linear weight vector and two assignment rules of tasks to initialize the location of all the fruit flies in the problem space. In the collaborative smell-based foraging, three effective problem-specific neighborhood operators are employed to collaborative explore the global scope. In multi-objective vision-based foraging, the sub-swarms based crossover operator is designed to perform exploitation in local region. Finally, an extensive computational experiment is conducted to validate the performance of HCMFOA. The statistical results reveal that HCMFOA significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms based on decomposition (MOEA/Ds) have been generally recognized as competitive techniques for solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) with complicated Pareto-optimal sets. To date, ensemble methods have been developed for adaptively selecting evolution operators to enhance the performance of MOEA/Ds. However, most established ensemble methods ignore the variance of the characteristics of complicated MOPs throughout both the decision and objective spaces, and subproblems inevitably have distinct characteristics. Keeping these observations in mind, we propose a one-to-one ensemble mechanism, namely OTOEM, for adaptively associating each subproblem of an MOEA/D with a suitable evolution operator, which differs substantially from the established ensemble methods, in which all the subproblems of the MOEA/D are associated with the same evolution operator during each generation. Another novel feature of the OTOEM is that both the local and global credits of an evolutionary operator are considered in measuring its suitability for subproblems. Moreover, an adaptive rule is designed to stimulate evolution operators with higher overall credits to generate more new solutions and guarantee the continuity of the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. The performance of the proposed OTOEM is evaluated by comparing it with eleven baseline MOEAs on 26 complicated MOPs, and empirical results demonstrate its powerful performance in terms of two widely used metrics, namely, the inverted generational distance and hypervolume.},

Gaussian processes are used as a flexible regression model, providing an approximate characterization of the problem landscape. We use the difference between regression models of different problem instances as a measure of distance between the problems. The goodness of fit of the regression models allows us to validate the approximation that the model makes of the problem. This can subsequently be used to determine an appropriate sample size to provide a good representation of the problem. We apply our model-based framework to explore the problem relationships in the BBOB benchmark problem set. The results demonstrate that the framework is effective at representing the problem similarities in relatively high dimensions . We also evaluate the method on a set of clustering problems where a known ranking of similarity is imposed. The results show that the framework is very effective in recovering the problem similarities.},

A uniformly distributed set of unchanging weight vectors may lead to well-distributed solutions over a smooth, continuous, and well-spread Pareto front . However, fixed-value weight vectors may lead to solutions that fail, depending on the geometry of the problem. Several studies have used a predefined lapse of time to adapt weight vectors. This suggests that adaptation may not be being performed at the most appropriate moments of the evolutionary process. This paper presents the MOEA/D with updating when required (MOEA/D-UR) that uses a metric that detects improvements so as to determine when to adjust weights and a procedure for dividing the objective space in order to increase diversity. The results of experimental tests, which used real-world problems and the problem classes WFG1-WFG9, DTLZ1-DTLZ7, IDTLZ1-2, and MaOP1-6 with 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 15 objectives, suggest that MOEA/D-UR is more effective, when compared with ten state-of-the-art algorithms.},

A uniform mixture design method aims to spread points (mixtures) uniformly distributed in the experimental region. Each mixture should meet the constraint that the sum of its components must be equal to one. In this paper, we propose a new method to approximate uniform mixture designs via evolutionary multi-objective optimization. For this task, we formulate three M M -objective optimization problems whose Pareto optimal fronts correspond to a mixture design of M M components (or dimensions). In order to obtain a uniform mixture design, we consider six well-known algorithms used in the area of evolutionary multi-objective optimization to solve M M -objective optimization problems . Thus, a set of solutions approximates the entire Pareto front of each M M -objective problem, while it implicitly approximates a uniform mixture design. We evaluate our proposed methodology by generating mixture designs in two, three, and up to eight dimensions, and we compare the results obtained concerning those produced by different methods available in the specialized literature. Our results indicate that the proposed strategy is a promising alternative to approximate uniform mixture designs. Unlike most of the existing approaches, it obtains mixture designs for an arbitrary number of points. Moreover, the generated design points are properly distributed in the experimental region.},

Many CMOPs with disconnected feasible subregions make it difficult for algorithms to search for all feasible nondominated solutions . To address these issues, we propose a population state detection strategy (PSDS) and a restart scheme to determine whether the environmental selection strategy needs to be changed based on the situation of population. When the population converges in the feasible region, the unconstrained environmental selection allows the population to cross the current feasible region. When the population converging outside the feasible region, all constraints will be considered in the environmental selection to select the population for the feasible region. In addition, the restart scheme will use reinitialization to make the population jump out of unprofitable iterations. The proposed algorithm enhances the search ability through the detection strategy and provides more diversity by reinitializing the population. The experimental results on four constraint test suites with various features have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm had better or competitive performance against other state-of-the-art constrained multi-objective algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Equivalent Pareto sets and local Pareto sets in decision space are involved in multimodal multi-objective optimization problems (MMOPs). While popular multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MMEAs) devote greater attention to locating equivalent Pareto sets in decision space, resulting in the fact that local Pareto sets are overlooked. To tackle this issue, a clearing-based evolutionary algorithm with layer-to-layer evolution strategy (CEA-LES) is therefore proposed in this paper. A clearing-based niching technique is used in CEA-LES to remove inferior local Pareto optimal solutions, in which the clearing radius dynamically changes with the number of nearest neighbors of each individual. To develop equivalent global Pareto sets and local Pareto sets, a layer-to-layer evolutionary strategy is proposed based on Pareto ranking. Each layer performs mutation selection and reproduction operations with the aid of its closest neighbor layer to produce offspring. Particularly, the whole evolutionary operation is divided into two stages, and the first stage is to select parents using the roulette method and the second stage is using the tournament method. An environmental selection strategy is suggested to maintain diverse solutions and balance the distribution of solutions. The proposed algorithm is performed on CEC 2020 MMOPs benchmark with local Pareto set and Polygon-based MMOPs and is compared with some state-of-the-art MMEAs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm obtains superior performance in comparison to its competing algorithms, and is capable of locating equivalent global Pareto sets and local Pareto sets, simultaneously.},

To address these issues, in this work, we propose a framework to reuse knee points into the newly generated environment. Reusing knee points can provide high-quality knowledge to generate a better initial population and the knee points also bring convenience to DMs. In this work, we also introduce a benchmark of Hybrid Charging Strategy based Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem (HCS-DVRP). The obtained experimental results on this benchmark validate that our proposed design can achieve a promising optimization performance via reusing knee points.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been successfully applied to optimize the policies for Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks due to their exploration ability. The recently proposed Negatively Correlated Search (NCS) provides a distinct parallel exploration search behavior and is expected to facilitate RL more effectively. Considering that the commonly adopted neural policies usually involves millions of parameters to be optimized, the direct application of NCS to RL may face a great challenge of the large-scale search space. To address this issue, this paper presents an NCS-friendly Cooperative Coevolution (CC) framework to scale-up NCS while largely preserving its parallel exploration search behavior . The issue of traditional CC that can deteriorate NCS is also discussed. Empirical studies on 10 popular Atari games show that the proposed method can significantly outperform three state-of-the-art deep RL methods with 50\% less computational time by effectively exploring a 1.7 million-dimensional search space.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have recently received increasing attention in solving computationally expensive engineering optimization problems . Existing studies have shown that surrogate modeling techniques based on different radial basis functions (RBF) can highly affect the search capability of an optimizer. However, without any prior knowledge about the optimization problem to be solved, it is very hard for a designer to decide which modeling techniques should be used. To defeat this issue, we suggested a brand-new model management strategy based on multi-RBF parallel modeling technology in this paper. The proposed strategy aims to adaptively select a high-fidelity surrogate from a pre-specified set of RBF modeling techniques during the optimization process. At each evolutionary interaction, the most promising RBF surrogate was employed to help neighborhood field optimizer (NFO) perform fitness evaluation, and the proposed algorithm is named aRBF-NFO. Moreover, a detailed experimental analysis was given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method, and an overall comparison was made between the aRBF-NFO and two state-of-the-art SAEAs on a commonly-used test set as well as an antenna optimization problem. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed algorithm is robust and efficient.},
