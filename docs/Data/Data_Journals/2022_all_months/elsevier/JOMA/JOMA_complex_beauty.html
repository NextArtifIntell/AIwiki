The common distribution function is not assumed to be continuous, and the test statistics are based on the multilinear copula process. A bootstrap procedure based on multipliers is also proposed and shown to be valid. Tests based on Spearman’s rho and Kendall’s tau statistics are also considered, extending the results known for the case of continuous distributions. Contiguity results are obtained for some specific models and sufficient conditions for consistency of test statistics are stated, as well as a data-driven procedure to select p p . Also, numerical experiments are performed to assess the finite sample level and power of the proposed tests. A case study using a time series of Arctic sea ice extent images is used to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed methodologies. The R package MixedIndTests (Nasri et al., 2022) includes all the methodologies proposed in this article.},

However, most of existing methods consider the univariate case and methodology for multivariate functional data analysis is rather limited. In this article, we consider testing equality of vectors of mean functions for multivariate functional data, i.e., functional one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). To this aim, we study asymptotic null distribution of the functional Lawley–Hotelling trace (FLH) test statistic and approximate it by a Welch–Satterthwaite type χ 2 χ2 -approximation. We describe two approaches to estimating the parameters in the χ 2 χ2 -approximation ratio-consistently. The resulting FLH test has the correct asymptotic level , is root- n n consistent in detecting local alternatives, and is computationally efficient. The numerical performance is examined via some simulation studies and application to three real data examples. The proposed FLH test is comparable with four existing tests based on permutation in terms of size control and power. The major advantage is that it is much faster to compute.},

We introduce sub-dimensional Mardia measures of multivariate skewness and kurtosis, and investigate the information they convey about all sub-dimensional distributions of some symmetric and skewed families of multivariate distributions. The maxima of the sub-dimensional Mardia measures of multivariate skewness and kurtosis are considered, as these reflect the maximum skewness and kurtosis present in the distribution, and also allow us to identify the sub-dimension bearing the highest skewness and kurtosis. Asymptotic distributions of the vectors of sub-dimensional Mardia measures of multivariate skewness and kurtosis are derived, based on which testing procedures for the presence of skewness and of deviation from Gaussian kurtosis are developed. The performances of these tests are compared with some existing tests in the literature on simulated and real datasets.},

The MrDc-SIS achieves multiple desirable properties such as being distribution-free, completely nonparametric, scale-free and robust for outliers or heavy tails. Moreover, the MrDc-SIS can be used to screen either univariate or multivariate responses and either one dimensional or multi-dimensional predictors. We establish the theoretical sure screening and rank consistency properties of the MrDc-SIS approach under a mild condition by lifting previous assumptions about the finite moments. Simulation studies demonstrate that MrDc-SIS outperforms eight other closely relevant approaches under certain settings.

In ultra-high dimensional data analysis, such irregular settings are usually overlooked for both theoretical and computational convenience. In this paper, we establish a framework for estimation in high-dimensional regression models using Penalized Robust Approximated quadratic M-estimators (PRAM). This framework allows general settings such as random errors lack symmetry and homogeneity, or covariates are not sub-Gaussian. To reduce the possible bias caused by data’s irregularity in mean regression, PRAM adopts a loss function with an adaptive robustification parameter. Theoretically, we first show that, in the ultra-high dimension setting, PRAM estimators have local estimation consistency at the minimax rate enjoyed by the LS-Lasso. Then we show that PRAM with an appropriate non-convex penalty in fact agrees with the local oracle solution, and thus obtain its oracle property. Computationally, we compare the performances of six PRAM estimators (Huber, Tukey’s biweight or Cauchy loss function combined with Lasso or MCP penalty function). Our simulation studies and real data analysis demonstrate satisfactory finite sample performances of the PRAM estimator under different irregular settings.},

Through simulation study, we present that the naive LLE is biased while the proposed estimation method shows superior performance with much reduced bias under various choices of FAR model settings.

  abstract     = {In using multiple regression methods for prediction, one often considers the linear combination of explanatory variables as an index. Seeking a single such index when here are multiple responses is rather more complicated. One classical approach is to use the coefficients from the leading Canonical Correlation . However, methods based on variances are unable to disaggregate responses by quantile effects, lack robustness, and rely on normal assumptions for inference. An alternative canonical regression quantile (CanRQ) approach seeks to find the linear combination of explanatory variables that best predicts the τ τ th quantile of the best linear combination of response variables. Applying this “regression” approach more generally, subsequent linear combinations are chosen to explain what earlier CanRQ components failed to explain. While numerous technical issues need to be addressed, the major methodological issue concerns directionality: a quantile analysis requires that the notion of a larger or smaller response be well-defined. To address this issue, the sign of at least one response coefficient will be assumed to be non-negative. CanRQ results can be quite different from those of classical canonical correlation, and can offer the kind of improvements offered by regression quantiles in linear models.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we develop a novel procedure of variable screening for a multivariate additive random-effects model, based on B-spline function approximations. With these approximations, the so-called signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be defined to inform the importance of each covariate in the model. Then, SNR-based forward filtering is conducted on covariates by using iterative projections of the multiple response data into the space of covariates. The proposed procedure is easy to use and allows the user to pool non-linear information across heterogeneous subjects through random-effects variables. We establish an asymptotic theory on the selection consistency under some regularity conditions . By simulations, we show that the procedure has a superior performance over some existing methods in terms of sensitivity and specificity. We also apply the procedure to anti-cancer drug data, revealing a set of biomarkers that potentially influence concentrations of anti-cancer drugs in cancer cell lines.},

  abstract     = {Statistical inference for sparse covariance matrices is crucial to reveal the dependence structure of large multivariate data sets, but lacks scalable and theoretically supported Bayesian methods. In this paper, we propose a beta-mixture shrinkage prior, computationally more efficient than the spike and slab prior, for sparse covariance matrices and establish its minimax optimality in high-dimensional settings. The proposed prior consists of independent beta-mixture shrinkage and gamma priors for off-diagonal and diagonal entries, respectively. To ensure positive definiteness of the covariance matrix, we further restrict the support of the prior to the subspace of positive definite matrices . We obtain the posterior convergence rate of the induced posterior under the Frobenius norm and establish a minimax lower bound for sparse covariance matrices. The class of sparse covariance matrices for the minimax lower bound considered in this paper is controlled by the number of nonzero off-diagonal elements and has more intuitive appeal than those appeared in the literature. We show that the posterior convergence rates of the proposed methods are minimax or nearly minimax. In the simulation study, we also show that the proposed method is computationally more efficient than competitors while achieving comparable performance. Advantages of the beta-mixture shrinkage prior are demonstrated based on two real data sets.},

We derive the first order upper-tail behaviour of the weighted sum of bivariate random variables under weak assumptions on their marginal distributions and their copula . The extremal behaviour of the marginal variables is characterised by the generalised Pareto distribution and their extremal dependence through subclasses of the limiting representations of Ledford and Tawn (1997) and Heffernan and Tawn (2004). We find that the upper-tail behaviour of the aggregate is driven by different factors dependent on the signs of the marginal shape parameters; if they are both negative, the extremal behaviour of the aggregate is determined by both marginal shape parameters and the coefficient of asymptotic independence (Ledford and Tawn, 1996); if they are both positive or have different signs, the upper-tail behaviour of the aggregate is given solely by the largest marginal shape. We also derive the aggregate upper-tail behaviour for some well known copulae which reveals further insight into the tail structure when the copula falls outside the conditions for the subclasses of the limiting dependence representations.},

  abstract     = {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) describe the relationship between two stochastic processes: an observed process and an unobservable finite-state transition process. Owing to their modeling dynamic heterogeneity, HMMs are widely used to analyze heterogeneous longitudinal data . Traditional HMMs frequently assume that the number of hidden states (i.e., the order of HMM) is a constant and should be specified prior to analysis. This assumption is unrealistic and restrictive in many applications. In this study, we consider regression-based hidden Markov model (RHMM) while allowing the number of hidden states to be unknown and determined by the data. We propose a novel likelihood-based double penalized method, along with an efficient expectation-conditional maximization with iterative thresholding-based descent (ECM–ITD) algorithm, to perform order selection in the context of RHMM. An extended Group-Sort-Fuse procedure is proposed to rank the regression coefficients and impose penalties on the discrepancy of adjacent coefficients. The order selection consistency and convergence of the ECM–ITD algorithm are established under mild conditions. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the empirical performance of the proposed method. An application of the proposed methodology to a real-life study on Alzheimer’s disease is presented.},

In this paper, we investigate the nonparametric estimation of the madogram where data are completely missing at random . We provide the functional central limit theorem for the considered multivariate madrogram correctly normalized, towards a tight Gaussian process for which the covariance function depends on the probabilities of missing.

This model is referred to as the interference-plus-noise matrix in the study of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, which belongs to the category of the so-called signal-plus-noise model. For the case t = 1 t=1 , the spectral statistics of this model have been studied to a certain extent in the literature (Dozier and Silverstein, 2007[17,18]; Vallet et al., 2012). In this paper, we study the singular value and singular vector statistics of Y t Yt around the right-most edge of the spectrum in the harder regime n − 1 / 3 ≪ t ≪ 1 n−1/3≪t≪1 . This regime is harder than the t = 1 t=1 case, because on the one hand, the edge behavior of the empirical spectral distribution (ESD) of Y Y ⊤ YY⊤ has a strong effect on the edge statistics of Y t Y t ⊤ YtYt⊤ for a “small” t ≪ 1 t≪1 , while on the other hand, the edge eigenvalue behavior of Y t Y t ⊤ YtYt⊤ is not merely a perturbation of that of Y Y ⊤ YY⊤ for a “large” t ≫ n − 1 / 3 t≫n−1/3 . Under certain regularity assumptions on Y , Y, we prove the Tracy–Widom law for the edge eigenvalues, the eigenvalue rigidity, and eigenvector delocalization for the matrices Y t Y t ⊤ YtYt⊤ and Y t ⊤ Y t Yt⊤Yt . These results can be used to estimate and infer the massive MIMO system. To prove the main results, we analyze the edge behavior of the asymptotic ESD of Y t Y t ⊤ YtYt⊤ and establish optimal local laws on its resolvent . These results are of independent interest, and can be used as important inputs for many other problems regarding the spectral statistics of Y t Yt .},

However, the time-invariant coefficient assumption is too restrictive in reality and fails to represent the time-dynamic association between the covariates and event occurrence rates. In this paper, we discuss regression analysis of multivariate panel count data where both the covariates and their effects may be time-varying. We propose a marginal estimating equation approach combined with the B-splines that approximate the functional forms of the regression coefficients . The asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are rigorously established. A simulation study is conducted to assess the performance of the proposed estimation procedure and suggests that it works well for practical situations.

The obtained estimators are called approximate least squares estimators (ALSEs). We also put forward a sequential algorithm for parameter estimation of a more general version of the model with multiple number of components. The main focus of the paper has been on developing the large-sample properties of the proposed estimators. Derived theoretical results show that the proposed estimators are strongly consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. Moreover, it is shown that the derived asymptotic distribution is identical to that of the traditional least squares estimators (LSEs). The numerical performance of the ALSEs and sequential ALSEs is demonstrated through extensive simulation studies. The results are positioned parallel to that obtained using the least squares method and 2-D multilag High Order Ambiguity function (2D-ml-HAF) for a comparative study. These simulations make use of the true values as the initial guesses in the optimization algorithm as using a fine grid search for this purpose is practically infeasible. We also provide a practical alternative for modeling of real world signals in an another set of simulation experiments. This involves a combination of two methods- 2D-ml-HAF estimators and genetic algorithm (GA). The results show that the proposed combination is a reasonable scheme to find initial guesses and provides satisfactory performance for varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).},

These population distributions share some latent structure, so it is advantageous to jointly analyze the samples to make efficient inferences on the multiple distributions and their functionals. One effective way to connect the distributions is the density ratio model (DRM). A key ingredient of the DRM is that the log density ratios are linear combinations of prespecified functions; the vector formed by these functions is called the basis function. The benefit of DRM relies on correctly specifying the basis function to a large degree. In applications, the user may not have a complete knowledge to enable a suitable choice of the basis function, and many discussions have been devoted to this topic. In this article, we consider the still open problem of a data-adaptive choice of the basis function that can alleviate the risk of severe model misspecification . We propose a data-adaptive approach to the choice of basis function based on functional principal component analysis. Under some conditions, we show that this approach leads to consistent basis function estimation. Our simulation results show that the proposed adaptive choice can achieve an efficiency gain. We use a real-data example from economics to demonstrate the efficiency gain and the ease of our approach.},

  abstract     = {Methods are developed for checking and completing systems of bivariate and multivariate Kendall’s tau concordance measures in applications where only partial information about dependencies between variables is available. The concept of a concordance signature of a multivariate continuous distribution is introduced; this is the vector of concordance probabilities for margins of all orders. It is shown that every attainable concordance signature is equal to the concordance signature of a unique mixture of the extremal copulas , that is the copulas with extremal correlation matrices consisting exclusively of 1’s and − 1 −1 ’s. A method of estimating an attainable concordance signature from data is derived and shown to correspond to using standard estimates of Kendall’s tau in the absence of ties. The set of attainable Kendall rank correlation matrices of multivariate continuous distributions is proved to be identical to the set of convex combinations of extremal correlation matrices, a set known as the cut polytope . A methodology for testing the attainability of concordance signatures using linear optimization and convex analysis is provided. The elliptical copulas are shown to yield a strict subset of the attainable concordance signatures as well as a strict subset of the attainable Kendall rank correlation matrices; the Student t t copula is seen to converge, as the degrees of freedom tend to zero, to a mixture of extremal copulas sharing its concordance signature with all elliptical distributions that have the same correlation matrix. A characterization of the attainable signatures of equiconcordant copulas is given.},

The TDM serves as a parsimonious measure of multivariate tail dependence akin to the correlation matrix in the context of dependence. The set of all TDMs corresponding to d d -dimensional random vectors is a convex polytope with an intricate description known only for d d up to six, with both its numbers of facets and vertices growing at least exponentially in d d . We posit that the richness of its subset that a copula family can accommodate is a practically vital feature to be considered in its choice for modeling in the presence of tail dependence. In this paper, our focus is on the t t -copula family, which is a popular choice for parametric modeling in risk management and financial econometrics. We discuss some geometric properties of the subset of TDMs supported by the t t -copula family and provide an efficient algorithm to determine the t t -copula that best captures the tail dependence specified by a target TDM.},

One of these models is the joint mean–covariance model, which is a multivariate heteroscedastic regression model with autoregressive covariance structures . In these models, parameter estimation is usually carried on under normality assumption, but the resulting estimators will be very sensitive to the outliers or non-normality of data. In this study, we propose a robust alternative method and an EM algorithm for estimating the parameters of joint mean–covariance models. Robustification is achieved using a multivariate heavy-tailed distribution with the same number of parameters as the multivariate normal distribution . To simplify the estimation procedure, a modified Cholesky decomposition is adopted to factorize the dependence structure in terms of unconstrained autoregressive and scale innovation parameters. Also, the technique for the prediction of future responses is given. An intensive simulation study and a real data example are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.},

Each underlying Markov jump process comprising the mixture has its own intensity matrix and is defined on the same finite state space with overlapping absorbing sets. The main distinctive aspect of the mixture is that despite the underlying processes have the Markov property , the mixture itself in general does not. Conditional transition matrix and the joint probability distribution of the first-exit times form non-stationary functions of time with ability to capture path dependence when conditioning on available information (either full or partial) of the sample path. In particular, initial profile of the joint distribution forms a generalized mixture of the multivariate phase-type distributions of Assaf et al. (1984). When the underlying Markov processes have the same intensity matrix, in which case the mixture becomes a simple Markov jump process, the path dependence and non-stationary properties are removed from the transition matrix and the joint distribution, while the initial profile distribution reduces to Assaf et al. (1984). Some explicit and numerical examples are discussed to illustrate the results.},

  abstract     = {We propose the family of dimension-wise scaled normal mixtures (DSNMs) to model the joint distribution of a d d -variate random variable with real-valued components. Each member of the family generalizes the multivariate normal (MN) distribution in two directions. Firstly, the DSNM has a more general type of symmetry with respect to the elliptical symmetry of the MN distribution. Secondly, the univariate marginals have similar heavy-tailed normal scale mixture distributions with (possibly) different tailedness parameters; as a consequence of practical interest, the DSNM allows for a different excess kurtosis on each dimension. These peculiarities are obtained in an MN scale mixture framework by introducing a d d -variate mixing random variable with independent and similar components acting separately for each dimension. We examine several properties of DSNMs, such as the joint density function , hierarchical and stochastic representations, relations with other families of symmetric distributions , type of symmetry, marginal and conditional distributions, no correlation implying independence, moment generating function , and moments of practical interest. For illustrative purposes, we describe two members of the DSNM family obtained in the case of components of the mixing random vector being either uniform or shifted exponential; these are examples of mixing distributions that guarantee a closed-form expression for the joint density of the DSNM. For the two DSNMs analyzed in detail, we introduce parsimony by allowing the d d tailedness parameters to be tied across dimensions, and describe algorithms, based on the expectation–maximization (EM) principle, to estimate the parameters by maximum likelihood. We use real data from the financial and biometrical fields to appreciate the advantages of our DSNMs over other symmetric heavy-tailed distributions available in the literature.},

In large samples, strong consistency and asymptotic normality of the MLE-like estimators are confirmed. Based on the MLE-like estimator and the MLE , two types of bias-corrected estimators (BC-MLE and BC-MLL estimators) are developed to reduce the bias in small samples. These two estimators are asymptotically unbiased. Simulation studies suggest that MLE-like estimators have a performance similar to that of the MLE .

  abstract     = {We propose a principal components regression method based on maximizing a joint pseudo-likelihood for responses and predictors. Our method uses both responses and predictors to select linear combinations of the predictors relevant for the regression, thereby addressing an oft-cited deficiency of conventional principal components regression. The proposed estimator is shown to be consistent in a wide range of settings, including ones with non-normal and dependent observations; conditions on the first and second moments suffice if the number of predictors ( p p ) is fixed, the number of observations ( n n ) tends to infinity, and dependence is weak, while stronger distributional assumptions are needed when p → ∞ p→∞ with n n . We obtain the estimator’s asymptotic distribution as the projection of a multivariate normal random vector onto a tangent cone of the parameter set at the true parameter, and find the estimator is asymptotically more efficient than competing ones. In simulations our method is substantially more accurate than conventional principal components regression and compares favorably to partial least squares and predictor envelopes. The method’s practical usefulness is illustrated in a data example with cross-sectional prediction of stock returns.},

After a finite number of iterations, the final solution estimates the rank consistently, and more importantly, achieves the oracle rate. We recast sufficient dimension reduction methods under the framework of reduced rank regressions, which enables us to recover the central subspace and simultaneously estimate its structural dimension.

However, QDA is less helpful when the number of features in a data set is moderate or high, and LDA and its variants often perform better due to their robustness against dimensionality. In this work, we introduce a new dimension reduction and classification method based on QDA. In particular, we define and estimate the optimal one-dimensional (1D) subspace for QDA, which is a novel hybrid approach to discriminant analysis. The new method can handle data heteroscedasticity with number of parameters equal to that of LDA. Therefore, it is more stable than the standard QDA and works well for data in moderate dimensions. We show an estimation consistency property of our method, and compare it with LDA, QDA, regularized discriminant analysis (RDA) and a few other competitors by simulated and real data examples.},

The objective is to test that the regression parameter is constant across several quantile levels of interest. The parameter function is estimated by combining ideas from functional principal component analysis and quantile regression.

In this sense, different contexts of joint symmetry of data distributions have been dealt with extensively in both theory and practice. Univariate characterizations of properties of multivariate distributions can allow the reduction of the original problem to a substantially simpler one. We focus on research scenarios when vectors x x and Ax Ax are identically distributed, where A A is a diagonal matrix and absolute values of A A ’s elements equal to one. It is shown that these scenarios are attractive in new characterizations of joint or mutual independence between random variables. We establish projections of the joint symmetry and independence via the one-dimensional symmetry of linear combinations of x x ’s components and their interactions. These projections are the most revealing of the multivariate data distribution. The usefulness of the linear projections is exemplified by constructing an efficient nonparametric exact test for joint treatment effects. In this framework, an algorithm for implementing linear projection-based tests is proven. Numerical studies based on generated vectors and a real dataset show that the proposed test can exhibit high and stable power characteristics. The present method can be also used for testing independence between symmetric random vectors.},

  abstract     = {Principal component analysis (PCA) has long been a useful and important tool for dimension reduction. However, this method must be used with care under certain circumstances such as high dimension and small sample size. In general, low dimension with large sample size or large signal to noise ratio is vital to guarantee the consistency of the leading eigenvalues and eigenvectors obtained by PCA. Cross data matrix (CDM)-based PCA is another way to estimate PCA components, through splitting data into two subsets and calculating singular value decomposition for the cross product of the corresponding covariance matrices . It has been shown that CDM-based PCA has a broader region of consistency than ordinary PCA for leading eigenvalues and eigenvectors . Although the difference in regions of consistency is well studied, an interesting practical as well as theoretical question is how they differ in eigenvalues and eigenvectors estimation, especially for the case where both fall in a common region of consistency. In this article, we derive the finite sample approximation results as well as the asymptotic behavior for CDM-based PCA via matrix perturbation. Furthermore, we also derive a comparison measure for CDM-based PCA vs. ordinary PCA. This measure only depends on the data dimension, noise correlations and the noise-to-signal ratio (NSR). Using this measure, we develop an algorithm, which selects good partitions and integrates results from these good partitions to form a final estimate for CDM-based PCA. Numerical and real data examples are presented for illustration.},

Existing methods, such as parametric and semiparametric mixture regression, usually model the mean in each subpopulation with assumption that observations sharing a common trajectory are independent or their covariance structure is pre-specified, but less research considers modeling of covariance structures while accounting for heterogeneity. In this paper, we introduce a joint model which models the mean and covariance structures simultaneously in a finite normal mixture regression, demonstrating how important the within-subject correlation is in clustering longitudinal data . Model parameters are estimated with an iteratively re-weighted least squares EM (IRLS-EM) algorithm. Our estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. We can identify different mean trajectories and covariance structures in all clusters. Simulations show that the proposed method performs well and gives more accurate clustering results by introducing covariance modeling. Real data analysis is also used to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method, and it presents good performance in clustering COVID-19 deaths for European countries in terms of progression trajectory.},

  abstract     = {Multivariate analysis of multiple correlated responses is often challenging due to the complex data structure. For analyzing such responses, this paper presents a pragmatic multivariate mixed-effects model. The model can flexibly accommodate both symmetric and asymmetric structures by utilizing a novel multivariate transformed distribution belonging to the family of elliptical distributions . It also offers a convenient alternative to most multivariate mixed models for analyzing bounded and positive correlated multivariate responses. The model is based on the median vector and a useful hierarchical representation, facilitating a theoretical investigation of its properties. An additional advantage is its flexibility in modeling correlated response vectors without assuming the existence of the mean. The maximum likelihood approach is proposed to estimate the model parameters. Results are illustrated by applying the proposed methodology to the health data sets for investigating the risk factors associated with childhood obesity.},

However, the dependency among predictive variables also provides useful information for fitting QQ responses. Hence in this work, we propose a novel generative approach to jointly model the QQ responses by incorporating the dependency information of predictors. The proposed method is computationally efficient and provides accurate parameter estimation under a penalized likelihood framework. Moreover, because of the generative approach framework, the asymptotically theoretical results of the proposed method are established under some regularity conditions .

We generalize the classic Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test through using pairwise distances of all observations. The generalized test can be readily used even when the random observations are multivariate. It is also very powerful in the presence of scale differences. The generalized test is in spirit to compare difference between the distribution functions of two random samples. It is m n / ( m + n ) mn/(m+n) -consistent under the strong null and local alternatives, and root- m n / ( m + n ) mn/(m+n) -consistent under fixed alternatives, where m , n m,n stand for the respective sizes of the two random samples. The power of the generalized test is asymptotically independent of m / n m/n , the size ratio of the two random samples. This indicates that the generalized test has nontrivial power as long as the sample sizes are not extremely unbalanced.

  abstract     = {In missing data analysis, it is challenging to estimate the propensity score (PS) function. Traditional parametric , nonparametric or semiparametric approaches to estimate the PS function may be subject to model misspecification or lead to inefficient estimation. To address the aforementioned issues, we here assume that the PS function is unknown, and it is estimated by a series estimation method. To our knowledge, there is little work developed in utilizing the series estimation approach to estimate PS function even though it is widely used to estimate a regression function in the literature. The augmented inverse probability weighted (AIPW) estimating equations (EEs) are constructed via the estimated PS functions. Based on the constructed AIPW EEs, we propose generalized empirical likelihood (GEL) estimators of parameters, which are semiparametric efficient. Under some regularity conditions , we establish asymptotic properties of GEL estimators of parameters and GEL ratio statistics for parametric restrictions enjoying the Wilks’ phenomenon. In particular, we construct a pseudo-residual-based stochastic process to assess the plausibility of the posited nonsmooth EEs, their asymptotic properties are shown under null and local alternative hypotheses. A resampling procedure is proposed to evaluate the p p -values of the proposed goodness-of-fit test statistics. Simulation studies and real data are used to illustrate the proposed methodologies.},

In this article, we propose some nonparametric tests for this purpose. These tests have the distribution-free property in finite sample situations. They are based on a high dimensional clustering algorithm that makes a partition of the data to form a contingency table. Using the cell frequencies of that table, we construct the test statistics . We can develop tests based on a k k -partition of the data or estimate the number of partitions from the data and construct tests based on it. Under appropriate regularity conditions , we prove the consistency of these tests in the HDLSS asymptotic regime. We also consider a multiscale approach, where the results for different number of partitions are aggregated judiciously. Extensive simulation study and analysis of some benchmark datasets illustrate the superiority of the proposed tests over some existing methods.},

Our model assumes that the non-zero values occur in the recent past (time-lag less than p / 2 p/2 ). We build test procedures that combine a sum and a scan-type procedure, but are computationally fast, and show their non-asymptotic behaviour in both one-sided (only positive correlations) and two-sided alternatives, respectively. We also exhibit a selector of significant lags and bound the Hamming-loss risk of the estimated support. These results can be extended to the case of nearly Toeplitz covariance structure and to sub-Gaussian vectors. Numerical results illustrate the excellent behaviour of both test procedures and support selectors — larger the dimension p p , faster are the rates.},

This paper proposes a family of spatial covariance functions , which stems from a reparameterization of the generalized Wendland family. As for the Matérn case, the proposed family allows for a continuous parameterization of the smoothness of the underlying Gaussian random field , being additionally compactly supported. More importantly, we show that the proposed covariance family generalizes the Matérn model which is attained as a special limit case. This implies that the (reparametrized) Generalized Wendland model is more flexible than the Matérn model with an extra-parameter that allows for switching from compactly to globally supported covariance functions. Our numerical experiments elucidate the speed of convergence of the proposed model to the Matérn model. We also inspect the asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood method when estimating the parameters of the proposed covariance models under both increasing and fixed domain asymptotics. The effectiveness of our proposal is illustrated by analyzing a georeferenced dataset of mean temperatures over a region of French, and performing a re-analysis of a large spatial point referenced dataset of yearly total precipitation anomalies.},

  abstract     = {Longitudinal binary data arise commonly in a variety of fields including public health, biomedicine, finance, agriculture and social science, among many others. In longitudinal binary studies, the aims are to assess the association of longitudinal binary response with certain covariates of interest, and to quantify the within-subject correlations for longitudinal binary responses. In the literature, various methods were developed to model longitudinal binary data but little work was done to account for the fact that the correlation coefficients of correlated binary responses have the so-called Fréchet–Hoeffding bounds. Ignoring this fact can lead to incorrect statistical inferences for longitudinal binary data. In this paper, based on latent Gaussian copula a new statistical modeling method is proposed to model the mean and within-subject correlation structures , simultaneously, for longitudinal binary data. Specifically, the mean structure is modeled by a semiparametric regression model, and the within-subject correlation coefficients are modeled through introducing a latent Gaussian copula model with certain latent correlation structures characterized by some parameters. Generalized estimating equations are then proposed to estimate the parameters in the mean and latent correlation structures, and consistency and asymptotic normality of the resulting parameter estimators are established. The proposed model and method ensure that the estimated correlation coefficients must satisfy the Fréchet–Hoeffding bounds for longitudinal binary data. Simulation studies show that the proposed method has a stable numerical performance. A practical data set is analyzed using the proposed method for illustration.},

The proposed procedure enjoys not only theoretical guarantees and high power but also the robustness of FDR control even when the population precision matrices of predictors are replaced by consistent estimates. Furthermore, a scalable implementation approach is developed such that all knockoff variables can be generated through one single estimation of the overall graphical structure.

  abstract     = {The noncentral Wishart distribution has become more mainstream in statistics as the prevalence of applications involving sample covariances with underlying multivariate Gaussian populations as dramatically increased since the advent of computers. Multiple sources in the literature deal with local approximations of the noncentral Wishart distribution with respect to its central counterpart. However, no source has yet developed explicit local approximations for the (central) Wishart distribution in terms of a normal analogue, which is important since Gaussian distributions are at the heart of the asymptotic theory for many statistical methods. In this paper, we prove a precise asymptotic expansion for the ratio of the Wishart density to the symmetric matrix-variate normal density with the same mean and covariances. The result is then used to derive an upper bound on the total variation between the corresponding probability measures and to find the pointwise variance of a new density estimator on the space of positive definite matrices with a Wishart asymmetric kernel. For the sake of completeness, we also find expressions for the pointwise bias of our new estimator, the pointwise variance as we move towards the boundary of its support, the mean squared error, the mean integrated squared error away from the boundary, and we prove its asymptotic normality .},

  abstract     = {To quantify the dependence between two random vectors of possibly different dimensions, we propose to rely on the properties of the 2-Wasserstein distance. We first propose two coefficients that are based on the Wasserstein distance between the actual distribution and a reference distribution with independent components. The coefficients are normalised to take values between 0 and 1, where 1 represents the maximal amount of dependence possible given the two multivariate margins. We then make a quasi-Gaussian assumption that yields two additional coefficients rooted in the same ideas as the first two. These different coefficients are more amenable for distributional results and admit attractive formulas in terms of the joint covariance or correlation matrix. Furthermore, maximal dependence is proved to occur at the covariance matrix with minimal von Neumann entropy given the covariance matrices of the two multivariate margins. This result also helps us revisit the RV coefficient by proposing a sharper normalisation. The two coefficients based on the quasi-Gaussian approach can be estimated easily via the empirical covariance matrix . The estimators are asymptotically normal and their asymptotic variances are explicit functions of the covariance matrix, which can thus be estimated consistently too. The results extend to the Gaussian copula case, in which case the estimators are rank-based. The results are illustrated through theoretical examples. Monte Carlo simulations and a case study involving electroencephalography data are proposed in the supplementary material.},

For multi-sample functional ANOVA (mfANOVA), based on local polynomial regression , exact local and global ANOVA decompositions into within- and between-group of variations are obtained. A local mfANOVA test is developed to examine differences in a local neighborhood, and combining local quantities, a global mfANOVA test statistic is formed. We show that both the local and global mfANOVA test statistics are location, scale, and translation invariant, allow interchanging the order of smoothing and ANOVA projection, and have asymptotic F F -distributions under the null hypotheses with the Gaussian assumption. This paper contributes to the literature by being the first, to our knowledge, to study mfANOVA tests with several invariant properties. Simulation studies are presented to compare the proposed global mfANOVA test with some existing procedures. Application to an earthquake impact study in Taiwan reveals that when an earthquake in 2016 resulted in closed highways, the patterns of traffic flows were significantly different between three time periods, before the earthquake, during, and after the repair period.

The proposed method is capable of dealing with the spatial structure of data by building a permutation testing procedure on spatially filtered residuals of a spatial regression model. Indeed, due to the spatial dependence existing among the data, the residuals of the regression model are not exchangeable, breaking the basic assumptions of the Freedman and Lane permutation scheme. Instead, it is proposed here to estimate the variance–covariance structure of the residuals by variography, remove this correlation by spatial filtering residuals and base the permutation test on these approximately exchangeable residuals. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in terms of empirical size and power, examining its behavior under different covariance settings. We show that neglecting the residuals spatial structure in the permutation scheme (thus permuting the correlated residuals directly) yields a very liberal testing procedures, whereas the proposed procedure is close to the nominal size of the test. The methodology is demonstrated on a real world data set on the amount of waste production in the Venice province of Italy.},

We address both one-step-ahead forecasting and dynamic updating. Dynamic updating is a forward prediction of the unobserved segment of the most recent curve. Among the two proposed methods, the first one is a straightforward adaptation to FTS of the k k -nearest neighbors methods for univariate time series forecasting. The second one is based on a selection of curves, termed the curve envelope, that aims to be representative in shape and magnitude of the most recent functional observation, either a whole curve or the observed part of a partially observed curve. In a similar fashion to k k -nearest neighbors and other projection methods successfully used for time series forecasting, we “project” the k k -nearest neighbors and the curves in the envelope for forecasting. In doing so, we keep track of the next period evolution of the curves. The methods are applied to simulated data, daily electricity demand, and NOx emissions and provide competitive results with and often superior to several benchmark predictions. The approach offers a model-free alternative to statistical methods based on FTS modeling to study the cyclic or seasonal behavior of many FTS.},

Under quite general conditions, asymptotic validity of the bootstrap procedure is established for estimating the distribution of the test statistic under the null.

The approach uses tensor product representations, in particular the multivariate Karhunen–Loève (KL) expansion on complex domains. From the associated eigenspaces of the covariance operator a series of nested function spaces are constructed, allowing detection of signals lying in orthogonal subspaces. In particular this can succeed even if the stochastic behavior of the signal changes either in a global or local sense. A mathematical approach is developed to locate and measure sizes of extraneous components based on construction of multilevel nested subspaces. We show examples in R and on a spherical domain S 2 . However, the method is flexible, allowing the detection of orthogonal signals on general topologies, including spatio-temporal domains.},

In particular, we introduce a convex formulation that jointly estimates the model’s coefficients and the weight function, with a roughness penalty on the center, and constraints on the weights in order to recover a possibly smooth and/or sparse solution. This allows for a non-iterative and continuous variable selection mechanism, as the weight function can either inflate or deflate the initial center, reducing the unwanted shrinkage on some of the coefficients.

  abstract     = {The Financial Risk Meter (FRM) is an established quantitative tool that, based on conditional Value at Risk (VaR) ideas, yields insight into the dynamics of network risk. Originally, the FRM has been composed via Lasso based quantile regression, but we here extend it by incorporating the idea of expectiles, thus indicating not only the tail probability but rather the actual tail loss given a stress situation in the network. The expectile variant of the FRM enjoys several advantages: Firstly, the multivariate tail risk indicator conditional expectile-based VaR (CoEVaR) can be derived, which is sensitive to the magnitude of extreme losses. Next, FRM index is not restricted to an index compared to the quantile based FRM mechanisms, but can be expanded to a set of systemic tail risk indicators, which provide investors with numerous tools in terms of diverse risk preferences. The power of FRM also lies in displaying the FRM distribution across various entities every day. In a functional data context, the FRM identifies outlying curves and serves as a signal box to display aberrant functional behavior. Two distinct patterns can be discovered under high stress and during stable periods from the empirical results in the United States stock market. Furthermore, the framework is able to identify individual risk characteristics and to capture spillover effects in a network.},

We further derive consistency and local asymptotic results for this detector in the presence of a change in the covariance function . The corresponding change point estimator based on such a process is also shown to be rate optimal for estimating an existing change point, and further is asymptotically distributed as the argument maximum of a Gaussian process under a local asymptotic framework. We study the detector and change point estimator in a small simulation study to detect changes in the covariance of functional autoregressive and generalized conditionally heteroscedastic processes, which demonstrate that the use of the weighted CUSUM statistics in this context generally improves performance over existing methods.

  abstract     = {In modern contexts, some types of data are observed in high-resolution, essentially continuously in time. Such data units are best described as taking values in a space of functions. Subject units carrying the observations may have intrinsic relations among themselves, and are best described by the nodes of a large graph. It is often sensible to think that the underlying signals in these functional observations vary smoothly over the graph, in that neighboring nodes have similar underlying signals. This qualitative information allows borrowing of strength over neighboring nodes and consequently leads to more accurate inference. In this paper, we consider a model with Gaussian functional observations and adopt a Bayesian approach to smoothing over the nodes of the graph. We characterize the minimax rate of estimation in terms of the regularity of the signals and their variation across nodes quantified in terms of the graph Laplacian . We show that an appropriate prior constructed from the graph Laplacian can attain the minimax bound, while using a mixture prior, the minimax rate up to a logarithmic factor can be attained simultaneously for all possible values of functional and graphical smoothness. We also show that in the fixed smoothness setting, an optimal sized credible region has arbitrarily high frequentist coverage. A simulation experiment demonstrates that the method performs better than potential competing methods like the random forest. The method is also applied to a dataset on daily temperatures measured at several weather stations in the US state of North Carolina.},

We develop a doubly penalized fusion approach, which includes a smoothness penalty for estimating functionals and, more importantly, a fusion penalty for clustering. Statistical properties are rigorously established, providing the proposed approach a strong ground. We also develop an effective ADMM algorithm and accompanying R code.

  abstract     = {This paper considers nonparametric estimation of a parameter, which is a zero of a certain estimating equation, indexed by a class of functions and depending on an infinite-dimensional covariate . This problem is known in the literature as Z Z -estimation, where a rich theory, in the case of the finite-dimensional covariates, exists. However, in certain applications, covariates may belong to an infinite-dimensional space, which makes the estimation as well as the study of the asymptotic properties challenging topics. This paper aims to bring several contributions to the existing functional data analysis literature. First, we introduce nonparametric conditional Z Z -estimators whenever functional stationary ergodic data are observed under right-censorship model. A sharp uniform-in-bandwidth limit law for the proposed estimator is presented. Such result allows the bandwidth to vary within a complete range for which the estimator is consistent. Consequently, it represents an interesting guideline in practice to select the optimal bandwidth in nonparametric functional data analysis. Moreover, a uniform consistency rate, over Vapnik–Chervonenkis classes of functions, is provided for the process of conditional Z Z -estimators. Finally, a uniform central limit theorem for the process indexed by functions is established. The last result is of particular interest since it is obtained for dependent functional data. The uniform limit theorems , discussed in this paper, are key tools for many further developments in functional data analysis involving empirical process techniques. These results are proved under some standard structural conditions on the Vapnik–Chervonenkis classes of functions and some mild conditions on the model.},

We propose a method for canonical correlation analysis between paired probability densities or shapes of closed planar curves, routinely used in biomedical studies, which combines a convenient linearization and dimension reduction of the data using tangent space coordinates. Leveraging the fact that the corresponding manifolds are submanifolds of unit Hilbert spheres, we describe how finite-dimensional representations of the functional data objects can be easily computed, which then facilitates use of standard multivariate canonical correlation analysis methods. We further construct and visualize canonical variate directions directly on the space of densities or shapes. Utility of the method is demonstrated through numerical simulations and performance on a magnetic resonance imaging dataset of glioblastoma multiforme brain tumors.},

Typically, a rather ad hoc choice of some standard basis such as Fourier, wavelets, splines, etc. is used for the data transforming purpose. To address this important problem, we present its mathematical formulation, demonstrate its importance, and propose a data-driven method of functionally representing observations. The method chooses an initial functional basis by an efficient placement of the knots. A simple machine learning style algorithm is utilized for the knot selection and recently introduced orthogonal spline bases - splinets - are eventually taken to represent the data. The benefits are illustrated by examples of analyses of sparse functional data.},

  abstract     = {Spatial regression with differential regularization is an innovative approach at the crossroad between functional data analysis and spatial data analysis. These models have been shown to be numerically efficient and capable to handle complex applied problems. On the other hand, their theoretical properties are still largely unexplored. Here we consider the discrete estimators in spatial regression models with differential regularization , obtained after numerical discretization , using an expansion on a finite element basis. We study the consistency and the asymptotic normality of these discrete estimators. We also propose a nonparametric test procedure for the linear part of the models, based on random sign-flipping of the score components. The test exploits an appropriate decomposition of the smoothing matrix, in order to reduce the effect of the spatial dependence, without any parametric assumption on the form of the correlation structure . The proposed test is shown to be superior to parametric alternatives.},

The global features concerning the dominant modes of variation over the entire function domain, and local features of function variations over particular short intervals within function domain, are both important in functional data analysis. Functional principal component analysis (FPCA), though a key feature extraction tool, only focus on capturing the dominant global features, neglecting highly localized features. We introduce a FPCA-BTW method that initially extracts global features of functional data via FPCA, and then extracts local features by block thresholding of wavelet (BTW) coefficients. Using Monte Carlo simulations , along with an empirical application on near-infrared spectroscopy data of wood panels, we illustrate that the proposed method outperforms competing methods including FPCA and sparse FPCA in the estimation functional processes. Moreover, extracted local features inheriting serial dependence of the original functional time series contribute to more accurate forecasts. Finally, we develop asymptotic properties of FPCA-BTW estimators, discovering the interaction between convergence rates of global and local features.},

This allows for a greater degree of flexibility in specifying the model and freeing the response matrix from following a single multivariate normal distribution . The new model is considered under two parsimonious covariance structures together with the unstructured covariance. The maximum likelihood estimation of the proposed model is studied using the ECM algorithm, which clusters growth curve data simultaneously. Data-driving methods are proposed to find various model parameters so as to create an appropriate model for complex growth curve data. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed methods and real data analysis on gene expression clustering is made, showing that the proposed procedure works well in both, model fitting and growth curve data clustering .},

Throughout we use the classic data set of Galton on the heights of parents and their children. In the second part we explain how these same data can be studied from a multivariate viewpoint, using canonical correlation analysis, Procrustes correlation and simple/multiple correspondence analysis. For correspondence analysis, we use the same data as categorized by Galton into intervals of heights for the parents and their children. In this part we also make an incursion into the continuous form of correspondence analysis. The third part is dedicated to bivariate distributions, where we give the main results of bivariate distributions with given marginals, commenting on the correlations of Spearman and Kendall. Seeing that a bivariate distribution can be generated using a copula, we fit Galton’s data to two copulas: the Gaussian copula and the copula which has the best fit.},

Changing technologies have created this flood and have led to a real hunger for new modeling strategies and data analysis by scientists. In many cases data are not Euclidean; for example, in molecular biology, the data sit on manifolds. Even in a simple non-Euclidean manifold (circle), to summarize angles by the arithmetic average cannot make sense and so more care is needed. Thus non-Euclidean settings throw up many major challenges, both mathematical and statistical. This paper will focus on the PCA and clustering methods for some manifolds. Of course, the PCA and clustering methods in multivariate analysis are one of the core topics. We basically deal with two key manifolds from a practical point of view, namely spheres and tori. It is well known that dimension reduction on non-Euclidean manifolds with PCA-like methods has been a challenging task for quite some time but recently there has been some breakthrough. One of them is the idea of nested spheres and another is transforming a torus into a sphere effectively and subsequently use the technology of nested spheres PCA. We also provide a new method of clustering for multivariate analysis which has a fundamental property required for molecular biology that penalizes wrong assignments to avoid chemically no go areas. We give various examples to illustrate these methods. One of the important examples includes dealing with COVID-19 data.},

In order to find the difference between two populations, we utilize a geometric feature of high-dimensional data. The classification analysis based on the geometric feature of high-dimensional data is called geometrical quadratic discriminant analysis (GQDA). We create new GQDA on the basis of the high-dimensional spiked eigenstructures. We precisely study the influence of the spiked eigenstructure on GQDA using several examples. In order to remove the spiked noise, we use a data transformation technique. We show that our proposed classifier has a consistency property with respect to the error rate of misclassifying an individual. By using computer simulation, we discuss the performance of the proposed classifier. Finally, we give several demonstrations of data analysis using a microarray data set.},

The three canonical hypothesis testing procedures available in the statistical literature are the likelihood ratio (LR) test, the Wald test and the Rao (score) test. All of them have good optimality properties and past research has not identified any of these three procedures to be a clear winner over the other two. However, the classical versions of these tests are based on the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), which, although the most optimal estimator asymptotically, is known for its lack of robustness under outliers and model misspecification. In the present paper we provide an overview of the analogues of these tests based on the minimum density power divergence estimator (MDPDE), which presents us with an alternative option that is strongly robust and highly efficient. Since these tests have, so far, been mostly studied for univariate responses, here we primarily focus on their performances for several important hypothesis testing problems in the multivariate context under the multivariate normal model family.},

  abstract     = {The classification of high-dimensional data is a very important problem that has been studied for a long time. Many studies have proposed linear classifiers based on Fisher’s linear discriminant rule (LDA) which consists of estimating the unknown covariance matrix and the mean vector of each group. In particular, if the data dimension p p is larger than the number of observations n n ( p &gt; n ) (p&amp;gt;n) , the sample covariance matrix cannot be a good estimator of the covariance matrix due to the well-known rank deficiency. To solve this problem, many studies proposed methods by modifying the LDA classifier through diagonalization or regularization of covariance matrix. In this paper, we categorize existing methods into three cases and discuss the shortcomings of each method. To compensate for these shortcomings, our baseline idea is that we consider estimation of the high dimensional mean vector and covariance matrix altogether while existing methods focus on shrinkage estimator of either mean vector or covariance matrix. We provide theoretical result that the proposed method is successful in both sparse and dense situations of the mean vector structures. In contrast, some existing methods work well only under specific situations. We also present numerical studies that our methods outperform existing methods through various simulation studies and real data examples such as electroencephalogy (EEG), gene expression microarray, and Spectro datasets.},

In modern statistical applications, however, high-throughput data with increasing dimensions are ubiquitous in fields ranging from economics, finance to genetics and engineering. For those problems, the earlier works are typically no longer applicable. As a result, the problem of testing a change point for high dimensional data sequences has been an important yet challenging task. In this paper, we first focus on models for at most one change point, and review recent state-of-art techniques for change point testing of high dimensional mean vectors and compare their theoretical properties. Based on that, we provide a survey of some extensions to general high dimensional parameters beyond mean vectors as well as strategies for testing multiple change points in high dimensions .

Using random samples generated by Monte Carlo (MC) method to infer the population has been dominant in statistics. The empirical distribution of a random sample can be regarded as a discrete approximation of the population distribution in a certain statistical sense. However, MC has a poor performance in many problems. This paper concerns some alternative methods, such as Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) F-numbers and Mean Square Error Representative Points (MSE-RPs), and constructs approximation distributions for elliptically contoured distributions and skew-normal distributions. Numerical comparisons are given for two geometric probability problems and for estimation accuracy by resampling from the discrete approximation distributions obtained by MC, QMC and MSE-RPs. Our simulation results indicate that QMC and MSE-RPs have better performance in most comparisons. These results show that QMC and MSE-RPs have high potential in statistical inference. In addition, we also discuss the relationship between principal component analysis and MSE-RPs for elliptically contoured distributions, as well as its potential applications.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the shrinkage approach has increased its popularity in theoretical and applied statistics, especially, when point estimators for high-dimensional quantities have to be constructed. A shrinkage estimator is usually obtained by shrinking the sample estimator towards a deterministic target. This allows to reduce the high volatility that is commonly present in the sample estimator by introducing a bias such that the mean-square error of the shrinkage estimator becomes smaller than the one of the corresponding sample estimator. The procedure has shown great advantages especially in the high-dimensional problems where, in general case, the sample estimators are not consistent without imposing structural assumptions on model parameters. In this paper, we review the mostly used shrinkage estimators for the mean vector, covariance and precision matrices. The application in portfolio theory is provided where the weights of optimal portfolios are usually determined as functions of the mean vector and covariance matrix . Furthermore, a test theory on the mean–variance optimality of a given portfolio based on the shrinkage approach is presented as well.},

  abstract     = {Multivariate linear regression analysis is an important technique for modeling the predictive relationships of multiple related response variables on a set of common predictor variables. Numerous studies have been conducted on situations where response variables are given and only predictor variables are subject to variable selection. In practice, however, some response variables do not depend on any of the predictor variables and have very small regression coefficients, implying that response variables need to be selected. Several methods have been proposed for response variable selection in multivariate linear regression. Examples include Bonferroni selection, linear step-up selection, adaptive linear step-up selection, multiple-stage linear step-up selection, response best-subset selection and sparse envelope selection. In this article, we address some aspects of response variable selection focusing on the above-mentioned examples concerning methodological developments, theoretical properties and computational algorithms.

This method evaluates the volume of a spherical tube about the index set, and then transforms it to the tail probability. In this study, we generalize the tube method to a case in which the variance is not constant. We provide the volume formula for a spherical tube with a non-constant radius in terms of curvature tensors, and the tail probability formula of the maximum of a Gaussian random field with inhomogeneous variance, as well as its Laplace approximation. In particular, the critical radius of the tube is generalized for evaluation of the asymptotic approximation error. As an example, we discuss the approximation of the largest eigenvalue distribution of the Wishart matrix with a non-identity matrix parameter. The Bonferroni method is the tube method when the index set is a finite set. We provide the formula for the asymptotic approximation error for the Bonferroni method when the variance is not constant.},

We modify the weight functions in the classic distance covariance such that, the modified distance covariance between the random vectors of primary interest is the same as its classic version between the surrogate random vectors, which is referred to as the invariance law in the present context. The presence of measurement errors may substantially weaken the degree of nonlinear dependence. An immediate issue arises: The classic distance correlation between the surrogate vectors cannot reach one even if the two random vectors of primary interest are exactly linearly dependent . To address this issue, we propose to estimate the distance variance using repeated measurements. We study the asymptotic properties of the modified distance correlation thoroughly. In addition, we demonstrate its finite-sample performance through extensive simulations and a real-world application.},

In this paper, we compare the performance of the proposed regularized-covariance-function-based estimator and the conventional high-dimensional covariance matrix estimator of the within-subject errors. It shows that when the number p p of the time points in each subject is large enough compared to the number n n of the subjects, i.e., p ≫ n 1 / 4 log n p≫n1/4logn , the estimation errors of the high-dimensional covariance matrix will be accumulated, therefore the error bound of the proposed regularized-covariance-function-based estimator will be smaller than that of the high-dimensional covariance matrix estimator in Frobenius norm . We also assess the performance of these two estimators for the incomplete longitudinal data. All the comparisons and theoretical results are illustrated using both simulated and real data.},

Based on the “true structure” specification, we propose a penalized multiply robust estimation equation in the presence of multiply candidate model sets. The selecting criterion for optimal tuning parameters is modified for the model identification with incomplete data. We validate that our tuning criterion can correctly distinguish the true autoregressive coefficients from zero asymptotically, the estimators of population parameters enjoy the oracle properties as well.

In particular, robustifying model fitting is appealing in the presence of potential outlying points. This paper introduces a robust regression methodology in a parametric setting by constructing a novel multivariate skew-Huber distribution for longitudinal data with heavy-tails and skewed structures. Unlike preceding studies, our model allows for jointly estimating the tuning parameter, which controls the impact of outliers, with all other parameters using an undemanding computational algorithm. Moreover, by promoting an unconstrained parameterization through the modified Cholesky decomposition , the estimate of variance–covariance components can be merely accessible. We also present a spline mixed model to account for the covariate effect. To highlight the usefulness of our methodology, we conducted a simulation study and analyzed a data set collected on type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria over a 6-year prospective cohort study. Findings show that our proposed robust model leads to convincing conclusions in empirical studies.},

  abstract     = {New inference methods for the multivariate coefficient of variation and its reciprocal, the standardized mean, are presented. While there are various testing procedures for both parameters in the univariate case , it is less known how to do inference in the multivariate setting appropriately. There are some existing procedures but they rely on restrictive assumptions on the underlying distributions. We tackle this problem by applying Wald-type statistics in the context of general, potentially heteroscedastic factorial designs. In addition to the k k -sample case, higher-way layouts can be incorporated into this framework allowing the discussion of main and interaction effects. The resulting procedures are shown to be asymptotically valid under the null hypothesis and consistent under general alternatives. To improve the finite sample performance, we suggest permutation versions of the tests and show that the tests’ asymptotic properties can be transferred to them. An exhaustive simulation study compares the new tests, their permutation counterparts and existing methods. To further analyze the differences between the tests, we conduct two illustrative real data examples.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, shrinkage priors have received much attention in high-dimensional data analysis from a Bayesian perspective . Compared with widely used spike-and-slab priors, shrinkage priors have better computational efficiency. But the theoretical properties, especially posterior contraction rate, which is important in uncertainty quantification , are not established in many cases. In this paper, we apply global–local shrinkage priors to high-dimensional multivariate linear regression with unknown covariance matrix . We show that when the prior is highly concentrated near zero and has heavy tail, the posterior contraction rates for both coefficients matrix and covariance matrix are nearly optimal. Our results hold when number of features p grows much faster than the sample size n, which is of great interest in modern data analysis. We show that a class of readily implementable scale mixture of normal priors satisfies the conditions of the main theorem.},

The simplex is an important case as it is the natural domain of compositional data and has been neglected in the literature on asymmetric kernels. The Dirichlet kernel estimator , which generalizes the (non-modified) unidimensional Beta kernel estimator from Chen (1999), is free of boundary bias and non-negative everywhere on the simplex. We show that it achieves the optimal convergence rate O ( n − 4 / ( d + 4 ) ) O(n−4/(d+4)) for the mean squared error and the mean integrated squared error, we prove its asymptotic normality and uniform strong consistency, and we also find an asymptotic expression for the mean integrated absolute error. To illustrate the Dirichlet kernel method and its favorable boundary properties, we present a case study on minerals processing.},

  abstract     = {The investigation of the relationship between a time-to-event outcome and time-dependent risk factors is often of great interest in longitudinal studies. However, the time-dependent risk factors may not be directly observed or simply measured by a single variable. Instead, they are latent and should be characterized by several observed variables from different aspects. In this article, we consider a novel joint modeling framework to examine the effects of latent time-dependent risk factors on the hazard of interest. A factor analysis model is used to depict the dependence between time-dependent latent variables and multivariate longitudinal observed variables, and a proportional hazard model is adopted for linking latent time-dependent factors to the hazard of interest. We develop a hybrid procedure that combines an asymptotically distribution-free generalized least square approach and a conditional score method. Theoretical results are provided on the consistency and asymptotic normality of parameter estimators. The method is evaluated through simulation studies and applied to a dataset about Alzheimer’s disease.},

The basic interest is in linear combinations across the p p dimensions that make the deterministic functions constant over time. The number of such linearly independent linear combinations is referred to as a cotrending dimension, and their spanned space as a cotrending space. This work puts forward a framework to test statistically for cotrending dimension and space. Connections to principal component analysis and cointegration are also considered.

The methods are iterative and rely on successive imputation of data and updating of model estimates. Imputations are done according to a periodic model on an expanded domain. The periodicity of the imputations is a key feature that reduces edge effects in the periodogram and is facilitated by efficient circulant embedding techniques. In addition, we describe efficient methods for decomposing the estimated cross spectral density function into a linear model of coregionalization plus a residual process. The methods are applied to two storm datasets, one of which is from Hurricane Florence, which struck the southeastern United States in September 2018. The application demonstrates how fitted models from different datasets can be compared, and how the methods are computationally feasible on datasets with more than 200,000 total observations.},

Different from a few existing methodologies on the GLHT problem which impose strong assumptions on the underlying covariance matrices so that the associated tests’ null distributions are asymptotically normal, it is shown that under some regularity conditions , the proposed test statistic under the null hypothesis and a chi-square type mixture have the same normal or non-normal limiting distributions. It is then suggested to approximate the test’s null distribution using the distribution of the chi-square type mixture, which can be further approximated by the Welch–Satterthwaite chi-square-approximation with approximation parameters consistently estimated. Several simulation studies and a real data application are presented to demonstrate the good performance of the proposed test.},

Traditional log-linear models, which generalize independence and conditional independence , do not apply in such cases, as they may associate positive probabilities with the non-existing cells. To describe the association structure in incomplete sample spaces, this paper develops a class of hierarchical multiplicative models which are defined by setting certain non-homogeneous generalized odds ratios equal to one and are named after Aitchison and Silvey who were among the first to consider such ratios. These models are curved exponential families that do not contain an overall effect and, from an algebraic perspective, are non-homogeneous toric ideals. The relationship of this model class with log-linear models and quasi log-linear models is studied in detail in terms of both statistics and algebraic geometry . The existence of maximum likelihood estimates and their properties, as well as the relevant algorithms are also discussed.},
