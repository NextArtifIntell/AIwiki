  abstract     = {This paper provides characterizations of the value function as the unique lower semicontinuous solution, appropriately defined, to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, for optimal control problems of Bolza type with state constraints. Notable features of our analysis are that it covers problems in which the running cost is possibly non Lipschitz continuous w.r.t. the state variable and the dynamic constraint takes the form of a differential inclusion that is possibly discontinuous w.r.t. time. Alternative characterizations are given, in terms of lower Dini derivative type solutions and of proximal solutions to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Distance estimates, which permit us to approximate an arbitrary state trajectory by a state trajectory that strictly satisfies the state constraint, have a key role in the analysis. Earlier research, treating problems in which the running cost is absent or at least Lipschitz continuous w.r.t. the state, makes use of known distance estimates in which ‘approximate’ is interpreted in terms of the L ∞ L∞ norm. L ∞ L∞ distance estimates are inadequate, however, for problems in which the running cost may fail to be Lipschitz continuous. We show that, for this broader class of problems, the analysis can still be carried out, if it is based on stronger distance estimates involving the W 1 , 1 W1,1 norm. The new W 1 , 1 W1,1 distance estimates, developed here for this purpose, are of independent interest. Motivation for the study of problems with running costs that are not Lipschitz continuous is provided by a ‘growth versus consumption’ problem in neo-classical macro-economics. Our theory provides fresh insights into this much studied problem, by extending the class of initial data points for which a solution can be achieved.},

These classical techniques also show us that the solution is almost everywhere in H 1 H1 . On the other hand, if the forcing term is in L 2 L2 , it is known that the solution is bounded in H 2 H2 globally – a gain of two derivatives. In this paper we prove new maximal regularity results for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations. First, we explore classical techniques to show that if the force is in H α Hα for α ∈ ( − 1 , 0 ) α∈(−1,0) , then the solution gains two derivatives globally. These methods break down for forces in H − 1 H−1 . In this scenario, we use the Littlewood-Paley decomposition in Fourier space, and an appropriate frequency splitting, to show that for any initial data in H 1 H1 there exists a bounded in H 1 H1 solutions for a short time interval .},

The ground state can be represented by a solution curve which has either oscillatory or monotone behavior, depending on the dimension of the system and the power of the focusing nonlinearity . We address here the monotone case for the cubic nonlinearity in the spatial dimensions d ≥ 13 d≥13 . By using the shooting method for the radial Schrödinger operators , we prove that the Morse index of the ground state is finite and is independent of the (large) amplitude. We also prove that it is equal to the Morse index of the limiting singular solution, which can be computed from numerical approximations . The numerical results suggest that the Morse index of the ground state is equal to one for every d ≥ 13 d≥13 .},

The orbital stability is proved by combining some tools regarding the oscillation theorem for fractional Hill operators and the Vakhitov-Kolokolov condition, well known for Schrödinger equations. We then perform a numerical approach to generate the periodic standing wave solutions of the fNLS equation by using the Petviashvili&#39;s iteration method .

This result gives a partial affirmative answer for Simon&#39;s conjecture ( [21, p. 482] ). As a byproduct, we prove a short time asymptotic estimate for the integral kernel of e − i t ( − Δ + V ) e−it(−Δ+V) . Moreover, when V belongs to Schwartz function classes, we can write e − i t ( ( − Δ ) λ 2 + V ) e−it((−Δ)λ2+V) as Fourier integral operators and give expansions of the symbols.},

  abstract     = {In this article we consider direct and inverse problems for α -stable, elliptic nonlocal operators whose kernels are possibly only supported on cones and which satisfy the structural condition of directional antilocality as introduced by Y. Ishikawa in the 80s. We consider the Dirichlet problem for these operators on the respective “domain of dependence of the operator” and in several, adapted function spaces. This formulation allows one to avoid natural “gauges” which would else have to be considered in the study of the associated inverse problems. Exploiting the directional antilocality of these operators we complement the investigation of the direct problem with infinite data and single measurement uniqueness results for the associated inverse problems . Here, due to the only directional antilocality, new geometric conditions arise on the measurement domains. We discuss both the setting of symmetric and a particular class of non-symmetric nonlocal elliptic operators , and contrast the corresponding results for the direct and inverse problems. In particular for only “one-sided operators” new phenomena emerge both in the direct and inverse problems: For instance, it is possible to study the problem in data spaces involving local and nonlocal data, the unique continuation property may not hold in general and further restrictions on the measurement set for the inverse problem arise.},

  abstract     = {We analyze the inversion of the photo-acoustic imaging modality using electromagnetic plasmonic nano-particles as contrast agents. We prove that the generated pressure, before and after injecting the plasmonic nano-particles, measured at a single point, located away from the targeted inhomogeneity to image, and at a given band of incident frequencies is enough to reconstruct the (eventually complex valued) permittivity. Indeed, from these measurements, we define an indicator function which depends on the used incident frequency and the time of measurement. This indicator function has differentiating behaviors in terms of both time and frequency. First, from the behavior in terms of time, we can estimate the arrival time of the pressure from which we can localize the injected nano-particle. Second, we show that this indicator function has maximum picks at incident frequencies close to the plasmonic resonances. This allows us to estimate these resonances from which we construct the permittivity. To justify these properties, we derive the dominant electric field created by the injected nano-particle when the incident frequency is close to plasmonic resonances. This is done for the full Maxwell system. To this end, we use a natural spectral decomposition of the vector space ( L 2 ( D ) ) 3 (L2(D))3 based on the spectra of the Newtonian and the Magnetization operators. As another key argument, we provide the singularity analysis of the Green&#39;s tensor of the Maxwell problem with varying permittivity. Such singularity is unusual if compared to the ones of the elliptic case (as the acoustic or elastic models). In addition, we show how the derived approximation of the electric fields propagates, as a source, in the induced pressure with the time.},

Concerning global solvability , we deal with two different cases —depending on whether the surface is compact or not— and prove two positive results which extend and unify several known results on the subject. In our positive results, it is assumed that X ∧ Y X∧Y vanishes of order greater than 1 on all closed one-orbits, on the other hand, we prove that global solvability cannot hold if there exists at least one closed one-orbit on which X ∧ Y X∧Y vanishes of order 1. We also give a characterization of globally hypoelliptic complex vector fields L in terms of the topological type of the equivalence classes determined by a standard equivalence relation defined on the set of non elliptic points of L . Some of the consequences are that globally hypoelliptic vector fields are globally solvable and that if a surface M carries a globally hypoelliptic vector field, it must be parallelizable.},

By using a change of variables, the model is then transformed to a standard age-structured model in which the total population dependent coefficient of the transport term reduces to a constant 1. We use this transformation to get existence, uniqueness of solutions of the problem in a semigroup setting. Since straight lines are more convenient in the exact and approximate solution of PDEs , we provide sufficient conditions of reducing more general equations. We give a difference scheme to find approximate solutions of the age-structured model.

By using alternatively-coupling upper-lower solution method, we establish the existence of forced pulsating traveling wave, as long as the shifting speed falls in a finite interval where the end points are obtained from KPP-Fisher speeds. The asymptotic behaviors of the forced pulsating traveling wave are derived and this helps us show that this wave is unique. Moreover in the Lyapunov sense, the stability of the forced pulsating wave is also studied. Finally, when the forced speed is beyond the finite interval, gap formation is investigated theoretically and illustrated further by numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {We study heat kernels of Schrödinger operators whose kinetic terms are non-local operators built for sufficiently regular symmetric Lévy measures with radial decreasing profiles and potentials belong to Kato class. Our setting is fairly general and novel – it allows us to treat both heavy- and light-tailed Lévy measures in a joint framework. We establish a certain relative-Kato bound for the corresponding semigroups and potentials. This enables us to apply a general perturbation technique to construct the heat kernels and give sharp estimates of them. Assuming that the Lévy measure and the potential satisfy a little stronger conditions, we additionally obtain the regularity of the heat kernels. Finally, we discuss the applications to the smoothening properties of the corresponding semigroups. Our results cover many important examples of non-local operators, including fractional and quasi-relativistic Schrödinger operators.},

  abstract     = {This paper examines the stationary distribution of the stochastic Lotka-Volterra model with infinite delay. Since the solutions of stochastic functional or delay differential equations depend on their history, they are non-Markov, which implies that traditional techniques based on the Markov property , cannot be applicable. This paper uses the variable substituting technique to obtain a higher-dimensional stochastic differential equation without delay. In this paper it is shown that the new equation satisfies the strong Feller property and strong Markov property , by which the invariant measure follows from the Krylov-Bogoliubov Theorem. Since distribution of the original model is actually the marginal distribution of the new equation, these results also show that there exists the stationary distribution for the original equation. Moreover, when the noise intensity is strongly dependent on the population size, by Hörmander&#39;s theorem, this paper also shows that the stationary distribution of this stochastic Lotka-Volterra system with infinite delay holds a C ∞ C∞ -smooth density.},

The existence and nonexistence of minimizers are classified completely by establishing the refined Gagliardo-Nirenberg type inequality. Based on some delicate estimates of the Hartree energy functional, the limit behavior of minimizers is also analyzed as the interspecies interaction strength goes to a critical value, where each component of minimizers blows up and concentrates at a flattest common minimum point of trapping potentials. An optimal blow-up rate of minimizers for the Hartree energy functional is concomitantly obtained.},

Complete classification of global existence and blow-up in finite time of solutions is given when the initial data satisfies different conditions. We first obtain a threshold result for the solution to exist globally or to blow up in finite time when the initial energy is subcritical or critical. We also establish a decay rate of the L 2 L2 norm for global solutions. Furthermore, we provide some sufficient conditions for the existence of global and blow-up solutions for supercritical initial energy. We finally give two-sided estimates of asymptotic behavior when the diffusion term dominates the source. This is a continuation of our previous work [17] .},

  abstract     = {We analyse two variants of a nonconvex variational model from micromagnetics with a nonlocal energy functional, depending on a small parameter ϵ &gt; 0 ϵ&amp;gt;0 . The model gives rise to transition layers , called Néel walls, and we study their behaviour in the limit ϵ → 0 ϵ→0 . The analysis has some similarity to the theory of Ginzburg-Landau vortices. In particular, it gives rise to a renormalised energy that determines the interaction (attraction or repulsion) between Néel walls to leading order. But while Ginzburg-Landau vortices show attraction for degrees of the same sign and repulsion for degrees of opposite signs, the pattern is reversed in this model. In a previous paper, we determined the renormalised energy for one of the models studied here under the assumption that the Néel walls stay separated from each other. In this paper, we present a deeper analysis that in particular removes this assumption. The theory gives rise to an effective variational problem for the positions of the walls, encapsulated in a Γ-convergence result. In the second part of the paper, we turn our attention to another, more physical model, including an anisotropy term. We show that it permits a similar theory, but the anisotropy changes the renormalised energy in unexpected ways and requires different methods to find it.},

  abstract     = {Many science phenomena are described as interacting particle systems (IPS). The mean field limit (MFL) of large all-to-all coupled deterministic IPS is given by the solution of a PDE , the Vlasov Equation (VE) . Yet, many applications demand IPS coupled on networks/graphs. In this paper, we are interested in IPS on a sequence of directed graphs, or digraphs for short. It is interesting to know, how the limit of a sequence of digraphs associated with the IPS influences the macroscopic MFL. This paper studies VEs on a generalized digraph, regarded as limit of a sequence of digraphs, which we refer to as a digraph measure (DGM) to emphasize that we work with its limit via measures. We provide (i) unique existence of solutions of the VE on continuous DGMs, and (ii) discretization of the solution of the VE by empirical distributions supported on solutions of an IPS via ODEs coupled on a sequence of digraphs converging to the given DGM. Our result extends existing results on one-dimensional Kuramoto-type networks coupled on dense graphs. Here we allow the underlying digraphs to be not necessarily dense which include many interesting graphical structures such that stars, trees and rings, which have been frequently used in many sparse network models in finance, telecommunications, physics, genetics, neuroscience, and social sciences. A key contribution of this paper is a nontrivial generalization of Neunzert&#39;s in-cell-particle approach for all-to-all coupled indistinguishable IPS with global Lipschitz continuity in Euclidean spaces to distinguishable IPS on heterogeneous digraphs with local Lipschitz continuity, via a measure-theoretic viewpoint . The approach together with the metrics is different from the known techniques in L p Lp -functions using graphons and their generalization by means of harmonic analysis of locally compact Abelian groups . Finally, to demonstrate the wide applicability, we apply our results to various models in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces in epidemiology, ecology, and social sciences.},

We introduce a variational formulation of the differential system equipped with boundary conditions. We show the existence of a solution of the variational problem , and derive uniform estimates of the solutions depending on the characteristic parameters of the flow. Using the two-scale convergence method, we rigorously derive a two-scale equation for the two-scale current density, and a two-pressure Stokes system. We derive, in the case of constant magnetic permeability, an explicit relation expressing the macroscopic velocity as a function of the macroscopic Lorentz force, the pressure gradient , the external body force , and the macroscopic current density, via two permeability filtration tensors. When the magnetic field is absent, this relation reduces to the Darcy law.},

  abstract     = {We consider planar and spatial autonomous Newtonian systems with Coriolis forces and study the existence of branches of periodic orbits emanating from equilibria. We investigate both degenerate and nondegenerate situations. While Lyapunov&#39;s center theorem applies locally in the nondegenerate, nonresonant context, our result provides a global answer which is significant also in some degenerate cases. We apply our abstract results to a problem from Celestial Mechanics. More precisely, in the three-dimensional version of the Restricted Triangular Four-Body Problem with possibly different primaries our results show the existence of at least seven branches of periodic orbits emanating from the stationary points.},

Path differentiable functions constitute a proper subclass of Lipschitz functions which admit conservative gradients, a notion of generalized derivative compatible with basic calculus rules. Our main result states that such flows inherit the path differentiability property of the driving vector field. We show indeed that forward propagation of derivatives given by the sensitivity differential inclusions provides a conservative Jacobian for the flow. This allows to propose a nonsmooth version of the adjoint method, which can be applied to integral costs under an ODE constraint. This result constitutes a theoretical ground to the application of small step first order methods to solve a broad class of nonsmooth optimization problems with parameterized ODE constraints. This is illustrated with the convergence of small step first order methods based on the proposed nonsmooth adjoint.},

This work extends to the case of two shocks a previous result of the authors in the case of a single shock. It is based on the method of weighted relative entropy with shifts known as a -contraction theory. A major difficulty due to the method is that very little control is available on the shifts. A modification of the construction of the shifts is needed to ensure that the two shock waves are well separated, at the level of the Navier-Stokes system, even when subjected to large perturbations. This work put the foundations needed to consider a large family of interacting waves. It is a key result in the program to solve the Bianchini-Bressan conjecture, that is the inviscid limit of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equation to the unique BV solution of the Euler equation , in the case of small BV initial values .},

We show that, under some mild assumptions on the perturbation, if the ODE has a nondegenerate periodic orbit, then the FDE has a smooth periodic orbit. Moreover, when the perturbation depends on some parameters, we get smooth dependence of the periodic orbit and its frequency on the parameters with high regularity. The method can also be applied to treat equations with small delays appearing in electrodynamics and FDEs which are perturbations of some evolutionary partial differential equations (PDEs). The proof consists in solving functional equations satisfied by the parameterization of the periodic orbit and the frequency using a fixed-point approach. We do not need to consider the smoothness of the evolution or even the phase space of the FDEs.},

We show that an unknown potential a ( x , t ) a(x,t) of the wave equation □ u + a u m = 0 □u+aum=0 can be recovered in a Hölder stable way from the map u | ∂ Ω × [ 0 , T ] ↦ 〈 ψ , ∂ ν u | ∂ Ω × [ 0 , T ] 〉 L 2 ( ∂ Ω × [ 0 , T ] ) u|∂Ω×[0,T]↦〈ψ,∂νu|∂Ω×[0,T]〉L2(∂Ω×[0,T]) . This data is equivalent to the inner product of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map with a measurement function ψ . We also prove similar stability result for the recovery of a when there is noise added to the boundary data. The method we use is constructive and it is based on the higher order linearization. As a consequence, we also get a uniqueness result. We also give a detailed presentation of the forward problem for the equation □ u + a u m = 0 □u+aum=0 .},

  abstract     = {For the Newtonian (gravitational) n -body problem in the Euclidean d -dimensional space, d ≥ 2 d≥2 , the simplest possible periodic solutions are provided by circular relative equilibria, (RE) for short, namely solutions in which each body rigidly rotates about the center of mass and the configuration of the whole system is constant in time and central (or, more generally, balanced) configuration. For d ≤ 3 d≤3 , the only possible (RE) are planar, but in dimension four it is possible to get truly four dimensional (RE). A classical problem in celestial mechanics aims at relating the (in-)stability properties of a (RE) to the index properties of the central (or, more generally, balanced) configuration generating it. In this paper, we provide sufficient conditions that imply the spectral instability of planar and non-planar (RE) in R 4 R4 generated by a central configuration, thus answering some of the questions raised in [14, Page 63] . As a corollary, we retrieve a classical result of Hu and Sun [11] on the linear instability of planar (RE) whose generating central configuration is non-degenerate and has odd Morse index , and fix a gap in the statement of [6, Theorem 1] about the spectral instability of planar (RE) whose (possibly degenerate) generating central configuration has odd Morse index. The key ingredient is a new formula of independent interest that allows to compute the spectral flow of a path of symmetric matrices having degenerate starting point, and a symplectic decomposition of the phase space of the linearized Hamiltonian system along a given (RE) which is inspired by Meyer and Schmidt&#39;s planar decomposition [13] and which allows us to rule out the uninteresting part of the dynamics corresponding to the translational and (partially) to the rotational symmetry of the problem.},

In this paper, we further allow the linear parts to depend on the parameters, where only Hölder dependence is possible and a difficulty arises: the projections in the nonuniform exponential dichotomy do not have explicit expressions. We will overcome the difficulty by giving a new result on the Hölder dependence of nonuniform exponential dichotomy and constructing the conjugacy in a different way. Moreover, under Barreira and Valls&#39;s framework we will improve the C 1 C1 dependence to C r Cr , where another difficulty arises: without the non-resonant condition, the systems do not have small derivatives of orders ≥2 in general. We will introduce functional spaces with small bounds to overcome the difficulty.

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with periodic measures of fractional stochastic reaction-diffusion equations with variable time delay defined on unbounded domains . We first prove the existence of periodic measures of the Markov process associated with the equation by showing the weak compactness of distribution laws of a family of solutions based on the uniform estimates and the equicontinuity of solutions in probability . We then establish the regularity of periodic measures and prove the tightness of the set of all periodic measures of the equation for small noise intensity. As a result, any sequence of periodic measures possesses at least one limit point, and we further prove every such limit must be a periodic measure of the corresponding limiting system. Finally, under further assumptions on the nonlinear terms , we establish the uniqueness and the exponential mixing property of periodic measures in the sense of Wasserstein metric. All the results of the paper are also valid for invariant measures of the corresponding autonomous version of the stochastic equation with constant time delay. The idea of uniform tail estimates of solutions in probability is employed to overcome the difficulty introduced by the non-compactness of Sobolev embeddings on unbounded domains.},

Here we establish some results about the global dynamics , in particular, the stability of and global Hopf bifurcation from the spatially homogeneous steady state when the maturation delay is taken as a bifurcation parameter. We also use a degree theoretical argument to identify intervals for the diffusion rate when the model system has a spatially heterogeneous steady state.

Recently, for the space-time region | x / ( 2 t ) | &lt; 1 |x/(2t)|&amp;lt;1 which is a solitonic region without stationary phase points on the jump contour, Cuccagna and Jenkins presented the asymptotic stability of the N -soliton solutions for the NLS equation by using the ∂ ¯ ∂¯ generalization of the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method . Their large-time asymptotic expansion takes the form (0.1) q ( x , t ) = T ( ∞ ) − 2 q s o l , N ( x , t ) + O ( t − 1 ) , q(x,t)=T(∞)−2qsol,N(x,t)+O(t−1), whose leading term is N-soliton and the second term O ( t − 1 ) O(t−1) is a residual error from a ∂ ‾ ∂‾ -equation. In this paper, we are interested in the large-time asymptotics in the space-time region | x / ( 2 t ) | &gt; 1 |x/(2t)|&amp;gt;1 which is outside the soliton region, but there will be two stationary points appearing on the jump contour R R . We found an asymptotic expansion that is different from (0.1) (0.2) q ( x , t ) = e − i α ( ∞ ) ( 1 + t − 1 / 2 h ( x , t ) ) + O ( t − 3 / 4 ) , q(x,t)=e−iα(∞)(1+t−1/2h(x,t))+O(t−3/4), whose leading term is a nonzero background, the second t − 1 / 2 t−1/2 order term is from the continuous spectrum and the third term O ( t − 3 / 4 ) O(t−3/4) is a residual error from a ∂ ‾ ∂‾ -equation. The above two asymptotic results (0.1) and (0.2) imply that the region | x / ( 2 t ) | &lt; 1 |x/(2t)|&amp;lt;1 considered by Cuccagna and Jenkins is a fast decaying soliton solution region, while the region | x / ( 2 t ) | &gt; 1 |x/(2t)|&amp;gt;1 considered by us is a slow decaying nonzero background region.},

Our main result concerns the construction of a blow-up solution with the description of its asymptotic behavior . Our method relies on a formal approach, where we find an approximate solution . Then, adopting a rigorous approach, we linearize the equation around that approximate solution, and reduce the question to a finite dimensional problem. Using an argument based on index theory , we solve that finite-dimensional problem, and derive an exact solution to the full problem. We would like to point out that our constructed solution has a new blowup speed with a log correction term, which makes it different from the speed in the subcritical range of parameters and the standard heat equation.},

In this setup, we first show pure haptotaxis ( χ = 0 χ=0 ) cannot induce any blow-up and pattern for any n ≥ 1 n≥1 , showing haptotaxis is overbalanced by diffusion on boundedness and longtime behavior. Then, in the radial setting with Ω = B R ⊂ R n ( n ≥ 3 ) Ω=BR⊂Rn(n≥3) , it is well-known that small mass of ‖ u 0 ‖ L 1 ( Ω ) ‖u0‖L1(Ω) can lead to blow-up in the corresponding Keller-Segel chemotaxis-only model obtained by setting w ≡ 0 w≡0 , known as generic mass blow-up phenomenon [23] . Herein, in the presence of the temporal nonlocality brought by haptotaxis, we show, in an explicit realm of the form χ ‖ u 0 ‖ L 1 ( Ω ) &gt; A ( n , R ) ξ ‖ w 0 ‖ L ∞ ( Ω ) χ‖u0‖L1(Ω)&amp;gt;A(n,R)ξ‖w0‖L∞(Ω) , that the aforementioned generic mass finite time blow-up phenomenon preserves. This seems to be the first rigorous blow-up result in relevant chemotaxis-haptotaxis models. The blow-up result also suggests that haptotatic cross-diffusion may not be negligible compared to chemotactic aggregation in ≥3D, in contrast to the recently detected 2D negligibility of haptotaxis in a minimal chemotaxis-haptotaxis model [16] .}}},

  abstract     = {We study Cauchy problem of a Keller-Segel type chemotaxis model with logistic growth, logarithmic sensitivity and density-dependent production/consumption rate. Our Cauchy data connect two different end-states for the chemical signal while the cell density takes its typical carrying capacity at the far fields. We are interested in the time-asymptotic behavior of the solution. We show that in the borderline, the component representing the chemical signal converges to a permanent, diffusive background wave, which connects the two end-states monotonically. On the other hand, the cell component converges to the spatial derivative of a heat kernel. The asymptotic solution has explicit formulation and is common to all solutions sharing the same end-states. Optimal L 2 L2 and L ∞ L∞ convergence rates are obtained. We first convert the model into a 2 × 2 2×2 hyperbolic-parabolic system via inverse Hopf-Cole transformation. Then we apply Chapman-Enskog expansion to identify the asymptotic solution. After extracting the asymptotic solution, we use a variety of analytic tools to study the remainder and obtain optimal rates. These include time-weighted energy method, spectral analysis, Green&#39;s function estimate and iterations. Our results apply to a general class of Cauchy data for the model and for its transformed system. In particular, our results apply to large data solutions.},

We start by proving the existence and uniqueness of the Cauchy problem, which is not a trivial step due to presence of couple nonlocal dispersals and new types of nonlinear reaction terms. Next, we provide simple conditions on comparing the basic reproduction numbers R 0 R0 and ⁎ R ⁎ R⁎ with 1 to characterize the global dynamics , as t → ∞ t→∞ . We further obtain the sharp criteria for the spreading and vanishing in term of the initial data . This is also called the vanishing-spreading phenomena. The couple dispersals yield significant obstacle that we cannot employ the approach of Zhao, Zhang, Li, Du [34] and Du-Ni [14] . To overcome this, we must prove the existence and the variational formula for the principal eigenvalue of a linear system with nonlocal dispersals, then use it to obtain the right limits as the dispersal rates and domain tend to zero or infinity. The maximum principle and sliding method for the nonlocal operator are ingeniously employed to achieve the desired results.},

First we establish the existence and uniqueness of stationary solutions by reducing the system to a single equation. Then we study the asymptotic profiles of the endemic steady states for large and small diffusion rates to illustrate the persistence or extinction of the infectious disease. The lack of regularity of the endemic steady state makes it more difficult to obtain the limit function of the sequence of endemic steady states. We also observe the concentration phenomenon which occurs when the diffusion rate of the infected individuals tends to zero. Our analytical results demonstrate that limiting the movement of susceptible individuals is not effective in eliminating the infectious disease unless the total population size is relatively small.},

On the other hand, in the particular linear noise case, we show that singularities occur in finite time with positive probability, and we derive lower bounds of these probabilities. To conclude, we introduce the notion of stability of exiting times and show that one cannot improve the stability of the exiting time and simultaneously improve the continuity of the dependence on initial data .},

We define the topological entropy of noncompact sets for flows, analogous to Bowen&#39;s definition. We show that this entropy coincides with the Bowen topological entropy of the time-1 map on any set. We also show a Bowen&#39;s inequality for flows; namely, that the metric entropy with respect to every invariant measure for a continuous flow is an upper bound for the topological entropy of the set of generic points with respect to the same measure, and the equality is always true if the measure is ergodic. We propose a definition of almost specification property for flows and prove that a continuous flow has the almost specification property if the time-1 map satisfies this property. Using Bowen&#39;s inequality for flows, we show that every continuous flow with the almost specification property is saturated, extending a result of Meson and Vericat in [22] . Under the same hypotheses, we extend a result of Thompson on the entropy of irregular points in [29] .},

In the derivation of this estimate, we study the maximal L 1 L1 regularity for a linear Stokes system with variable coefficients . The analysis tools are a use of the semigroup generated by a generalized Stokes operator to characterize some Besov norms and a new gradient estimate for a class of second-order elliptic equations of divergence form .

We also use Lin&#39;s method to reduce the spectral problem for periodic multi-pulses to computing the determinant of a block matrix , which encodes both eigenvalues resulting from interactions between neighboring pulses and eigenvalues associated with the essential spectrum. We then use this matrix to compute the spectrum associated with periodic single and double pulses. Most notably, we prove that brief instability bubbles form when eigenvalues collide on the imaginary axis as the periodic domain size is altered. These analytical results are all in good agreement with numerical computations , and numerical timestepping experiments demonstrate that these instability bubbles correspond to oscillatory instabilities.},

  abstract     = {We show existence, uniqueness and stability for a family of stationary subsonic compressible Euler flows with mass-additions in two-dimensional rectilinear ducts, subjected to suitable time-independent multi-dimensional boundary conditions at the entrances and exits. The stationary subsonic Euler equations consist a quasi-linear system of elliptic-hyperbolic composite-mixed type, while addition-of-mass destructs the usual methods based upon conservation of mass and Lagrangian coordinates to separate the elliptical and hyperbolic modes of the system. We establish a new decomposition and nonlinear iteration scheme to overcome this major difficulty. It reveals that mass-additions introduce very strong interactions in the elliptic and hyperbolic modes, and lead to a class of second-order elliptic equations with multiple integral nonlocal terms. The linearized problem is solved by studying algebraic and analytical properties of infinite weakly coupled boundary-value problems of ordinary differential equations , each with multiple nonlocal terms, after applications of Fourier analysis methods.},

In four and higher space dimensions, it is known that for any frequency and any power of the subcritical nonlinearity , there exists a ground state . In contrast to those cases, when the space dimension is three and the subcritical power is three or less, we can show that there exists a threshold frequency, above which no ground state exists, and below which the ground state exists (see Theorems 1.1 and 1.2). Furthermore, we prove the difference between two typical variational problems used to characterize the ground states (see Theorem 1.3).},

It is worth mentioning that in the previously known results concerning the corresponding three-dimensional Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system with direct signal production, the global weak or very weak solution was obtained under some more restrictive conditions on m and α .

We then proceed to show that these solutions can be defined globally-in-time if some smallness conditions are imposed to initial data . We also show the existence of unique global-in-time self-similar solutions when initial data are sufficiently small in scaling invariant Besov spaces. But, these solutions do not exhibit (expected) temporal decay rates. So, we change the fluid part to the Stokes equations and we derive temporal decay rates of the bacteria density and the fluid velocity.},

The results concern Hamiltonians of the form G ( p ) + V ( x , ω ) G(p)+V(x,ω) , where the nonlinearity G is the minimum of two or more convex functions with the same absolute minimum, and the potential V is a bounded stationary process satisfying an additional scaled hill and valley condition. This condition is trivially satisfied in the inviscid case, while it is equivalent to the original hill and valley condition of A. Yilmaz and O. Zeitouni [32] in the uniformly elliptic case . Our approach is based on PDE methods and does not rely on representation formulas for solutions. Using only comparison with suitably constructed super- and sub- solutions, we obtain tight upper and lower bounds for solutions with linear initial data x ↦ θ x x↦θx . Another important ingredient is a general result of P. Cardaliaguet and P. E. Souganidis [13] which guarantees the existence of sublinear correctors for all θ outside “flat parts” of effective Hamiltonians associated with the convex functions from which G is built. We derive crucial derivative estimates for these correctors which allow us to use them as correctors for G .},

Thus, this work advances the implementation of the Fokas method, used earlier for the KdV on the half-line with smooth data and solution in the classical Hadamard space, consisting of function that are continuous in time and Sobolev in the spatial variable, to the more general Bourgain spaces framework of dispersive equations with rough data on the half-line. The spaces needed and the estimates required arise at the linear level and in particular in the estimation of the linear pure ibvp, which has forcing and initial data zero but non-zero boundary data. Using the iteration map defined by the Fokas solution formula of the forced linear ibvp in combination with the bilinear estimates in modified Bourgain spaces introduced by this map, well-posedness of the nonlinear ibvp is established for rough initial and boundary data belonging in Sobolev spaces .},

In this paper we are concerned about studying the piecewise holomorphic systems (PWHS). Specifically, we study the sewing, sliding, and tangential regions of the PWHS and we classify the typical singularities of these systems. Also, we are interested in understanding how the trajectories of the regularized system associated with the PWHS transit through the region of regularization . In addition, we know that holomorphic systems have no limit cycles, but piecewise holomorphic systems do, so we provide conditions to ensure the existence of limit cycles of these systems. Additional conditions are provided to guarantee the stability and uniqueness of such limit cycles.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the period function of the reversible quadratic centers X ν = − y ( 1 − x ) ∂ x + ( x + D x 2 + F y 2 ) ∂ y , Xν=−y(1−x)∂x+(x+Dx2+Fy2)∂y, where ν = ( D , F ) ∈ R 2 ν=(D,F)∈R2 . Compactifying the vector field to S 2 S2 , the boundary of the period annulus has two connected components, the center itself and a polycycle. We call them the inner and outer boundary of the period annulus, respectively. We are interested in the bifurcation of critical periodic orbits from the polycycle Π ν Πν at the outer boundary. A critical period is an isolated critical point of the period function. The criticality of the period function at the outer boundary is the maximal number of critical periodic orbits of X ν Xν that tend to Π ν 0 Πν0 in the Hausdorff sense as ν → ν 0 ν→ν0 . This notion is akin to the cyclicity in Hilbert&#39;s 16th Problem. Our main result ( Theorem A ) shows that the criticality at the outer boundary is at most 2 for all ν = ( D , F ) ∈ R 2 ν=(D,F)∈R2 outside the segments { − 1 } × [ 0 , 1 ] {−1}×[0,1] and { 0 } × [ 0 , 2 ] {0}×[0,2] . With regard to the bifurcation from the inner boundary, Chicone and Jacobs proved in their seminal paper on the issue that the upper bound is 2 for all ν ∈ R 2 ν∈R2 . In this paper the techniques are different because, while the period function extends analytically to the center, it has no smooth extension to the polycycle. We show that the period function has an asymptotic expansion near the polycycle with the remainder being uniformly flat with respect to ν and where the principal part is given in a monomial scale containing a deformation of the logarithm, the so-called Écalle-Roussarie compensator. More precisely, Theorem A follows by obtaining the asymptotic expansion to fourth order and computing its coefficients, which are not polynomial in ν but transcendental. Theorem A covers two of the four quadratic isochrones , which are the most delicate parameters to study because its period function is constant. The criticality at the inner boundary in the isochronous case is bounded by the number of generators of the ideal of all the period constants but there is no such approach for the criticality at the outer boundary. A crucial point to study it in the isochronous case is that the flatness of the remainder in the asymptotic expansion is preserved after the derivation with respect to parameters. We think that this constitutes a novelty that is of particular interest also in the study of similar problems for limit cycles in the context of Hilbert&#39;s 16th Problem. Theorem A also reinforces the validity of a long standing conjecture by Chicone claiming that the quadratic centers have at most two critical periodic orbits. A less ambitious goal is to prove the existence of a uniform upper bound for the number of critical periodic orbits in the family of quadratic centers. By a compactness argument this would follow if one can prove that the criticality of the period function at the outer boundary of any quadratic center is finite. Theorem A leaves us very close to this existential result.},

Still in the Tonelli case, such a limit is in turn related to the existence of solutions of the critical (or ergodic) Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The goal of this paper is to address similar issues when set on the whole Euclidean space and the Hamiltonian fails to be Tonelli. We first study the convergence of the time-averaged value function as the time horizon goes to infinity, proving the existence of the critical constant (Mañé critical value) for a general control system . Then, we show that the ergodic equation admits solutions for systems associated with a family of vector fields which satisfies the Lie Algebra rank condition. Finally, we construct a solution to the critical HJB equation on the whole space which coincides with its Lax-Oleinik evolution.},

Our aim of this paper is to remove the structural condition and prove a global existence of strong solutions to compressible viscoelastic flows in critical spaces. In absence of compatible conditions, the new effective flux is introduced, which enables us to capture the dissipation arising from combination of density and deformation tensor.

We provide explicit bounds on the error between solutions of that kinetic equation and the limiting equation, which is known under the names of aggregation-diffusion equation or McKean–Vlasov equation. Introducing an intermediate system via a coarse-graining map, we quantitatively estimate the error between the spatial densities of the Vlasov–Fokker–Planck equation and the intermediate system in the Wasserstein distance of order 2. We then derive an evolution-variational-like inequality for Wasserstein gradient flows which allows us to quantify the error between the intermediate system and the corresponding limiting equation. Our strategy only requires weak integrability of the interaction potentials, thus in particular it includes the quantified overdamped limit of the kinetic Vlasov–Poisson–Fokker–Planck system to the aggregation-diffusion equation with either repulsive electrostatic or attractive gravitational interactions.},

For scalar models, we prove that accelerated spreading could happen if and only if a threshold condition is violated by kernel function. Then we discuss a classical Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model with nonlocal diffusions and a free boundary which can be seen as nonlocal diffusion counterpart of the model in the work of Wang (2014) [24] .},

In this paper, we deal with the quasi-neutral limit in a two-fluid Euler-Poisson system. This limit presents a different feature since it leads to compressible Euler equations. We justify this limit for global smooth solutions near constant equilibrium states in one space dimension . Specifically, we prove a global existence of smooth solutions by establishing uniform energy estimates with respect to the Debye length and the time. This allows to pass to the limit in the system for all time. Moreover, we establish global error estimates between the solution of the two-fluid Euler-Poisson system and that of the compressible Euler equations. The proof is based on classical uniform energy estimates together with various dissipation estimates. In order to control the quasi-neutrality of the velocities of two-fluids, similar conditions on the initial data are needed.},

We prove optimal results on the existence of minimizers in the mass-subcritical and mass-critical cases. In the mass-supercritical case global minimizers do not exist. However, if the Laplacian and the bi-Laplacian in the equation have the same sign, we are able to show the existence of local minimizers . The existence of those local minimizers is significantly more difficult than the study of global minimizers in the mass-subcritical and mass-critical cases. They are global in time solutions with small H 2 H2 -norm that do not scatter. Such special solutions do not exist if the Laplacian and the bi-Laplacian have opposite sign. If the mass does not exceed some threshold μ 0 ∈ ( 0 , + ∞ ) μ0∈(0,+∞) , our results on “best” local minimizers are optimal.},

To this end, we investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of a diffusive plant-water model in an arid flat environment in this paper. By carrying out bifurcation analysis, we find that the system has the properties of Turing-Hopf bifurcation. Based on the normal form theory of reaction-diffusion equations, the dynamics of the diffusive plant-water model in the neighbourhood of the Turing-Hopf bifurcation point are exactly analyzed. Our results show that tiny changes of parameters can induce the switch of four different states including uniform state, time periodic state, spatially inhomogeneous steady state and spatially inhomogeneous periodic state. Moreover, there are different types of bistable phenomenon between desert state and other states, which will provide some insights into that whether ecosystems are vulnerable.},

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to the study, for the first time in the literature, of optimal control problems for sweeping processes governed by integro-differential inclusions of the Volterra type with different classes of control functions acting in nonconvex moving sets, external dynamic perturbations, and integral parts of the sweeping dynamics. We establish the existence of optimal solutions and then obtain necessary optimality conditions for a broad class of local minimizers in such problems. Our approach to deriving necessary optimality conditions is based on the method of discrete approximations married to basic constructions and calculus rules of first-order and second-order variational analysis and generalized differentiation. The obtained necessary optimality conditions are expressed entirely in terms of the problem data and are illustrated by nontrivial examples that include applications to optimal control models of non-regular electrical circuits.},

Overcoming the difficulties from irrational fractions of the 4 parameters in determining the signs of determinant and trace, we find that the system has at most 5 interior equilibria, 4 edge equilibria and 4 corner equilibria and give a complete qualitative analysis for all equilibria in both hyperbolic cases and non-hyperbolic cases, including the case of fully null degeneracy. On this basis we display all bifurcations of equilibria such as pitchfork bifurcation, transcritical bifurcation and bifurcations at corner equilibria of fully null degeneracy, which is of codimension 2 but none of known results of codimension 2 can be applied to. We further discuss the unfolding system of fully null degeneracy, displaying all its bifurcations and giving bifurcation curves analytically. Our results provide an intuitive basis for us to predict the genetic composition of a population and provide the basic mathematical theory for the protection and loss of alleles.},

Firstly, we successfully derive the Hamiltonian function of the CSP equation based on its Lax pair . Furthermore, the long time asymptotic behavior of the solution u ( x , t ) u(x,t) is derived in a fixed space-time cone S ( y 1 , y 2 , v 1 , v 2 ) = { ( y , t ) ∈ R 2 : y = y 0 + v t , y 0 ∈ [ y 1 , y 2 ] , v ∈ [ v 1 , v 2 ] } S(y1,y2,v1,v2)={(y,t)∈R2:y=y0+vt,y0∈[y1,y2],v∈[v1,v2]} .

We apply the recent existence and regularity results on the Herglotz&#39; type variational problem to the aforementioned Hamilton-Jacobi equation with smooth initial data . We obtain some new results on the local structure of the cut set of the viscosity solution near non-conjugate singular points . Especially, we obtain an existence result of smooth strict singular characteristic from and to non-conjugate singular initial point based on the structure of the superdifferential of the solution, which is even new in the classical time-dependent case.

First, we construct the planar rarefaction wave to the three-dimensional full compressible Navier-Stokes-Korteweg equations, which can be derived by the fact that the rarefaction wave is nonlinearly stable to the one-dimensional full compressible Navier-Stokes-Korteweg equations. Then it is shown that the planar rarefaction wave is asymptotically stable provided that the initial data are a suitably small perturbation of the planar rarefaction wave and the strength of the rarefaction wave is small.

  abstract     = {We present a new regularized Oldroyd-B model in three dimensions which satisfies an energy estimate analogous to that of the standard model, and maintains the positive semi-definiteness of the conformation tensor. This results in the unique existence and stability of global solutions in a periodic domain. To be precise, given an initial velocity u 0 u0 and initial conformation tensor σ 0 σ0 , both with components in H 2 H2 , we obtain a velocity u and conformation tensor σ both with components in C ( [ 0 , T ] ; H 2 ) C([0,T];H2) for all T &gt; 0 T&amp;gt;0 . Assuming better regularity for the initial data allows us to obtain better regularity for the solutions. We treat both the diffusive and non-diffusive cases of the model. Notably, the regularization in the equation for the conformation tensor in our new model has been applied only to the velocity, rather than to the conformation tensor, unlike other available regularization techniques [5] . This is desired since the stress, and thus the conformation tensor, is typically less regular than the velocity for the creeping flow of non-Newtonian fluids. In [9] the existence and regularity of solutions to the non-regularized two dimensional diffusive Oldroyd-B model was established. However, the proof cannot be generalized to three dimensions nor to the non-diffusive case. The proposed regularization overcomes these obstacles. Moreover, we show that the solutions in the diffusive case are stable in the H 2 H2 norm. In the non-diffusive case, we are able to establish that the solutions are stable in the L 2 L2 norm. Furthermore, we show that as the diffusivity parameter goes to zero, our solutions converge in the L 2 L2 norm to the non-diffusive solution.},

It also contrasts the fact that for the linearized system associated to the classical resp. relaxed compressible Navier-Stokes equations, the qualitative behavior is exactly the same: exponential stability in bounded domains and polynomial decay without loss of regularity for the Cauchy problem.},

In this paper, we solve this problem by proving the norm inflation and hence the ill-posedness for the Camassa-Holm equation in B ∞ , 1 1 ( R ) B∞,11(R) . Therefore, the well-posedness and ill-posedness for the Camassa-Holm equation in all critical Besov spaces B p , 1 1 + 1 p ( R ) Bp,11+1p(R) with p ∈ [ 1 , ∞ ] p∈[1,∞] have been completed. Finally, since the norm inflation occurs by choosing an special initial data u 0 ∈ B ∞ , 1 1 ( R ) u0∈B∞,11(R) but u 0 x 2 ∉ B ∞ , 1 0 ( R ) u0x2∉B∞,10(R) (an example implies B ∞ , 1 0 ( R ) B∞,10(R) is not a Banach algebra), we then prove that this condition is necessary. That is, if u 0 x 2 ∈ B ∞ , 1 0 ( R ) u0x2∈B∞,10(R) holds, then the Camassa-Holm equation has a unique solution u ( t , x ) ∈ C T ( B ∞ , 1 1 ( R ) ) ∩ C T 1 ( B ∞ , 1 0 ( R ) ) u(t,x)∈CT(B∞,11(R))∩CT1(B∞,10(R)) and the norm inflation will not occur.},

Considerable efforts have been made to the relationship between the existence of nonuniform exponential dichotomies and the admissibility of a pair of function classes. In order to reduce the effect of nonuniformity, most results on this aspect need Lyapunov norms in function classes. However, it is difficult to construct an appropriate Lyapunov norm before the existence of a nonuniform exponential dichotomy is established, which happens in the converse problem from admissibility to dichotomy. In this paper, we prove the relationship without a Lyapunov norm. Then we apply our results to giving the relationship between nonuniform exponential dichotomy and invertibility of a differential mapping on some function spaces.},

  abstract     = {An intrinsic characteristic of musical sounds is the qualitative evolution of their timbre (tone colour). In this paper, we interpret each qualitative change by a bifurcation . We employ spectral and temporal envelopes as two of the most salient features of tone colour. Fourier analysis of a note generates its n -leading harmonic partials and an amplitude spectral n-vector A A for n ≥ 2 n≥2 . We introduce harmonic manifolds associated with amplitude spectral vectors. This is to accommodate the n -leading harmonic partials of the note. Then, harmonic partials are modelled by solutions of a radial coupling of n -tuple parametric Hopf oscillators. We use one bifurcation parameter and interpolate the qualitative evolution of temporal envelope over a set of consecutive time-intervals via bifurcation analysis and control. Bifurcation scenarios involve harmonic asymptotic sets as time-asymptotic limits of harmonic partials. Each harmonic asymptotic set is homeomorphic to a k -tori, where k ≤ n k≤n is the number of contributing harmonic partials. Bifurcation classification of tone colour is then drawn up by encoding the spectral geometry of acoustic signals into harmonic manifolds and harmonic asymptotic sets . For instance, we treat audio C ♯ 4 C♯4 files obtained from piano and violin. Different bifurcation scenarios distinguish temporal amplitude bifurcations of these sounds. A complete hysteresis cycle is observed within the temporal amplitude bifurcations of C ♯ 4 C♯4 note played by violin.},

To this end we construct Riesz bases in the trace spaces associated with the curl -operator and introduce a modified version of boundary triple adapted to the specifics of Maxwell equations , namely, to the mixed-order duality of the related trace spaces. This provides a translation of the problem to operator-theoretic settings of abstract Maxwell operators. In particular, we show that Calkin reduction operators are naturally connected with Leontovich boundary conditions and provide an abstract version of impedance boundary condition applicable to other types of wave equations. Taking Friedrichs and Krein-von Neumann extensions of related boundary operators, it is possible to associate m-dissipative Maxwell operators to arbitrary non-negative measurable impedance coefficients.},

  abstract     = {Dangerous tipping points and catastrophic transitions in ecosystems have recently been popular for detecting early warning signals in ecology. B-tipping is induced by bifurcation such as spatial pattern formation resulting from Turing instability. As one of the most important models in predator-prey interactions, we extend the Bazykin model to incorporate diffusive movement under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions . For the local model, we provide some preliminary analysis on stability and Hopf bifurcation . For the reaction-diffusion model, we first improve some sufficient conditions for the local and global stability of a semi-trivial constant steady state or a unique positive constant steady state in Du and Lou (2001) [11] . Next we obtain the sufficient and necessary conditions for Turing instability, show the existence of Turing bifurcation, Hopf bifurcation, Turing-Turing bifurcation, Turing-Hopf bifurcation and Turing-Turing-Hopf bifurcation, and the nonexistence of triple-Turing bifurcation. Our results reveal that the model can exhibit complex spatial, temporal and spatiotemporal patterns, including complex regime shifts and critical transitions at bifurcation points , transient states (spatially inhomogeneous periodic solutions), tristability (a pair of non-constant steady states and a spatially homogeneous periodic solution), heteroclinic orbits (connecting a spatially inhomogeneous periodic solution to a non-constant steady state or a spatially homogeneous periodic solution, connecting a spatially homogeneous periodic solution to non-constant steady states and vice versa). Finally, numerical simulations illustrate complex dynamics and verify our theoretical results.},

Roughly speaking, this principle states that if the initial data enjoys some extra smoothness prescribed on a family of half-spaces, then the regularity is propagated with infinite speed. In this sense, we prove that regardless of the scale measuring the extra regularity in such hyperplane collection, then all this regularity is also propagated by solutions of this model. Our analysis is mainly based on the deduction of propagation formulas relating homogeneous and non-homogeneous derivatives in certain regions of the plane.},

Justh and Krishnaprasad proposed a planar Newtonian particle model for an ensemble of flocking agents moving with a unit speed, where the dynamics of the heading angles (of velocities) is governed by a generalized Kuramoto-type model with a communication weight. In this paper, we are interested in the random perturbation of the communication weight, which is represented by a multiplicative noise. Unlike the additive white noise perturbation, the multiplicative one is known not to violate collective behaviors. We present sufficient conditions leading to the nematic alignment of velocities in terms of the system parameters and initial data . Our analysis begins with the two-body system, where it turns out to be stable under the effect of noise, showing that the nematic alignment occurs when the communication is sufficiently strong with respect to the noise strength. For the general many-body system with a corresponding condition, we showed the accumulation of heading angles modulo π / 2 π/2 and the stochastic stability of nematic alignment under the assumption of the constant communication weight, which suggests a strong evidence for the nematic alignment. This analysis is done by transporting the system into a similar form to the stochastic Kuramoto model, where we refined the order parameter analysis in order to extend local stochastic stability results to the whole circle of heading angles. We present several numerical simulations and compare them with analytical results.},

We associate a coupled nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation on R d Rd , i.e. with solution paths in P P , to a linear Fokker-Planck equation for probability measures on the product space R d × P Rd×P , i.e. with solution paths in P ( R d × P ) P(Rd×P) . We explicitly determine the corresponding linear Kolmogorov operator L ˜ t L˜t using the natural tangent bundle over P P with corresponding gradient operator ∇ P ∇P . Then it is proved that the diffusion process generated by L ˜ t L˜t on R d × P Rd×P is intrinsically related to the solution of a McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation (SDE). We also characterize the ergodicity of the diffusion process generated by L ˜ t L˜t in terms of asymptotic properties of the coupled nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation. Another main result of the paper is that the restricted well-posedness of the non-linear Fokker-Planck equation and its linearized version imply the (restricted) well-posedness of the McKean-Vlasov equation and that in this case the laws of the solutions have the Markov property . All this is done under merely measurability conditions on the coefficients in their measure dependence, hence in particular applies if the latter is of “Nemytskii-type”. As a consequence, we obtain the restricted weak well-posedness and the Markov property of the so-called nonlinear distorted Brownian motion, whose associated nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation is a porous media equation perturbed by a nonlinear transport term. This realizes a programme put forward by McKean in his seminal paper of 1966 for a large class of nonlinear PDEs . As a further application we obtain a probabilistic representation of solutions to Schrödinger type PDEs on R d × P 2 Rd×P2 , through the Feynman-Kac formula for the corresponding diffusion processes.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the persistence of spatial analyticity for the solutions to the Klein-Gordon-Schrödinger system, which describes a physical system of a nucleon field interacting with a neutral meson field, with analytic initial data . Unlike the case of a single nonlinear dispersive equation, not much is known about nonlinear dispersive systems as it is harder to show the spatial analyticity of coupled equations simultaneously. The only results known so far are rather recent ones for the Dirac-Klein-Gordon system which governs the physical system when the nucleon is described by Dirac spinor fields in the case of relativistic fields. In contrast, we aim here to study the Klein-Gordon-Schrödinger system that works in the non-relativistic regime. It is shown that the radius of spatial analyticity of the solutions at later times obeys an algebraic lower bound as time goes to infinity.},

The free boundary is moving in the radial direction with the radial velocity, which will affect the angular velocity but does not affect the axial velocity. However, the compressible Euler equations or Euler-Poisson equations with damping become a degenerate system at the moving boundary. By setting a suitable weighted Sobolev space and using Hardy&#39;s inequality , we successfully overcome the singularity at the center point and the vacuum occurring on the moving boundary, and obtain the well-posedness of local smooth solutions. We also summarize the recent related results on the free boundary value problem for the Euler equations with damping, compressible Euler equations and Euler-Poisson equations.},

We find that the nilpotent focus of codimension 4 serves as an organizing center to connect all the codimension 3 bifurcations in the two-dimensional center manifold of the system, and the bifurcations are also associated with a third order cubic Liénard system. Moreover, we present a classification of the nilpotent singularities of the system using the hatching rate of pest eggs as the parameter.

We show that if the boundary data has sufficiently slow decay rate, it affects the order of the nonlinearity for which we are able to construct the scattering operator. This suggests a modification for the critical value of the nonlinear term due to the presence of non zero boundary condition. In order to prove our results, we construct an explicit formula for the solutions to corresponding linear Klein-Gordon equation on a quarter-plane. Using this explicit formula, we obtain weighted Sobolev estimates for the solution to the complete nonlinear problem .

Recall that the regional fractional Laplacians are generated by Lévy-type processes which are not allowed to jump outside Ω. We consider weak solutions to the equation ( − Δ ) Ω s w ( x ) = p . v . ∫ Ω w ( x ) − w ( y ) | x − y | N + 2 s d y = f ( x ) (−Δ)Ωsw(x)=p.v.∫Ωw(x)−w(y)|x−y|N+2sdy=f(x) , for s ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) s∈(0,1) and Ω ⊂ R N Ω⊂RN , subject to zero Neumann or Dirichlet boundary conditions . The boundary conditions are defined by considering w as well as the test functions in the fractional Sobolev spaces H s ( Ω ) Hs(Ω) or H 0 s ( Ω ) H0s(Ω) respectively. While the interior regularity is well understood for these problems, little is known in the boundary regularity, mainly for the Neumann problem . Under optimal regularity assumptions on Ω and provided f ∈ L p ( Ω ) f∈Lp(Ω) , we show that w ∈ C 2 s − N / p ( Ω ‾ ) w∈C2s−N/p(Ω‾) in the case of zero Neumann boundary conditions .

The bulk of this paper is a sharp blow-up analysis that we perform on certain approximate solutions of (1) with bounded but arbitrary high energies. When these approximate solutions are positive, our analysis leads to improvements of results in [5] regarding positive ground state solutions for (1) , as we show that they exist whenever n ≥ 4 n≥4 , 0 ≤ γ ≤ ( n − 2 ) 2 4 − 1 0≤γ≤(n−2)24−1 and λ &gt; 0 λ&amp;gt;0 . The latter result also holds true for n ≥ 3 n≥3 and γ &gt; ( n − 2 ) 2 4 − 1 γ&amp;gt;(n−2)24−1 provided the domain has a positive “hyperbolic mass”. On the other hand, the same analysis yields that if γ &gt; ( n − 2 ) 2 4 − 1 γ&amp;gt;(n−2)24−1 and the mass is non vanishing, then there is a surprising stability of regimes where no variational positive solution exists. As for higher energy solutions to (1) , we show that there are infinitely many of them provided n ≥ 5 n≥5 , γ &lt; ( n − 2 ) 2 4 − 4 γ&amp;lt;(n−2)24−4 and λ &gt; n − 2 n − 4 ( n ( n − 4 ) 4 − γ ) λ&amp;gt;n−2n−4(n(n−4)4−γ) .}}},

  abstract     = {The goal of our paper is to study limit cycles in smooth planar slow-fast systems, Hausdorff close to canard cycles containing hyperbolic saddles located away from the critical (or slow) curve . Our focus is on a broad class of smooth slow-fast systems with a Hopf breaking mechanism (often called a generic turning point), a jump breaking mechanism or a non-generic turning point . Such canard cycles naturally occur in predator-prey systems with Holling type II and IV response functions and with a small predator&#39;s death rate . The study of canard cycles is also relevant for the Hilbert&#39;s 16th problem. We primarily focus on the canard cycles with one hyperbolic saddle (located away from the slow curve) and we allow isolated singularities in the slow dynamics.},

If the potential has sufficient polynomial decay at infinity, we obtain a variety of results on the perturbed conic resolvent operator R V RV and the nature of the continuous spectrum of − Δ + V −Δ+V . Using these results, we are able to show that the Schrödinger flow on each eigenspace of the link manifold satisfies a weighted L 1 → L ∞ L1→L∞ dispersive estimate. In odd dimensions, the decay rate we compute is consistent with that of the Schrödinger equation in a Euclidean space of the same dimension, but the spatial weights reflect the more complicated regularity issues in frequency that we face in the form of the spectral measure. In even dimensions, we prove a similar estimate, but with a loss of t 1 / 2 t1/2 compared to the sharp Euclidean estimate.},

If the trajectory of the body of zero mass is defined for all time, it can have the following four types of asymptotic motion when time tends to infinity forward or backward in time: bounded, parabolic (goes to infinity with asymptotic zero velocity), hyperbolic (goes to infinity with asymptotic positive velocity) or oscillatory (the position of the body is unbounded but goes back to a compact region of phase space for a sequence of arbitrarily large times). We consider realistic mass ratio for the Sun-Jupiter pair and Jacobi constant which allows the massless body to cross Jupiter&#39;s orbit. This is a non-perturbative regime. We prove the existence of all possible combinations of past and future final motions. In particular, we obtain the existence of oscillatory motions. All the constructed trajectories cross the orbit of Jupiter but avoid close encounters with it. The proof relies on analyzing the stable and unstable invariant manifolds of infinity and their intersections. We construct orbits shadowing these invariant manifolds by the method of correctly aligned windows. The proof is computer assisted.},

Using this characterization we derive several sharp Phragmen–Lindelöf-type theorems for certain classes of well known PDEs. The equation need not be uniformly elliptic nor homogeneous and we obtain results both in case the subsolution is bounded or unbounded. Among our results we retrieve classical estimates in the halfspace for p -subharmonic functions and extend those to more general equations; we prove sharp growth estimates, in terms of k and the asymptotic behavior of ∫ 0 R C ( s ) d s ∫0RC(s)ds , for subsolutions of equations allowing for sublinear growth in the gradient of the form C ( | x | ) | D u | k C(|x|)|Du|k with k ≥ 1 k≥1 ; we establish a Phragmen–Lindelöf theorem for weak subsolutions of the variable exponent p -Laplace equation in halfspaces, 1 &lt; p ( x ) &lt; ∞ 1&amp;lt;p(x)&amp;lt;∞ , p ( x ) ∈ C 1 p(x)∈C1 , of which we conclude sharpness by finding the “slowest growing” p ( x ) p(x) -harmonic function together with its corresponding family of p ( x ) p(x) -exponents.

We consider coupled systems with coupling of order zero, one and two. The systems are considered with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions and with localized interior controls acting on both transport and parabolic equations . We show that coupled systems are not null controllable at small time. This time depends on the transport velocity and the support of the controls. When the transport velocity is identically zero, the systems are not null controllable at any time. To achieve these results, we construct highly localized solutions, known as Gaussian beams , corresponding to the adjoint systems , and using them, we show that the corresponding observability inequalities fail. However, these systems are null controllable at any time by controls acting everywhere in the parabolic equation, under suitable assumptions on the initial data and the coefficients.},

Starting from this model, combined with the compressible Euler equation with damping, we introduce a more general system. We rigorously prove that the solutions to the Cauchy problem of this system globally exist and time-asymptotically converge to the shifted nonlinear diffusion waves whose profile is self-similar solution to the corresponding parabolic equation governed by the classical Darcy&#39;s law. Moreover, the optimal convergence rates are also obtained. Compared with previous results obtained by Nishihara, Wang and Yang in [29] , we have a weaker and more general condition on the initial data , and the conclusions are more sharper. The approach adopted in the paper is the technical time-weighted energy estimates with the Green function method together.},

These general fractional derivatives are defined as compositions of the first order derivative and a convolution integral with a non-negative and non-increasing kernel. First we prove some estimates for these derivatives acting on the non-negative functions. These estimates are employed for derivation of the comparison principles in several different forms. Finally, we consider an application of the comparison principles for analysis of solutions to the initial-value problems for the fractional differential equations with the general fractional derivatives.},

  abstract     = {Our aim in this paper is twofold. Firstly, we develop a new asymptotic theory for Floquet exponents. We consider a linear system of differential equations with a time-periodic coefficient matrix . Assuming that the coefficient matrix depends analytically on a small parameter, we derive a full asymptotic expansion of its Floquet exponents. Based on this, we prove that only the constant order Floquet exponents of multiplicity higher than one will be perturbed linearly. The required multiplicity can be achieved via folding of the system through certain choices of the periodicity of the coefficient matrix. Secondly, we apply such an asymptotic theory for the analysis of Floquet metamaterials. We provide a characterization of asymptotic exceptional points for a pair of subwavelength resonators with time-dependent material parameters. We prove that asymptotic exceptional points are obtained if the frequency components of the perturbations fulfill a certain ratio, which is determined by the geometry of the dimer of subwavelength resonators.},

  abstract     = {In the physics literature it is common to use “in cascade” the rotating wave approximation and the adiabatic approximation for chirped pulses of two-level quantum systems driven by one external field, in particular when the resonance frequency is not known precisely. Both approximations need relatively long time and are based on averaging theory of dynamical systems . Unfortunately, the two approximations cannot be done independently since, in a sense, the two time scales interact. We study how the cascade of the two approximations can be justified, while preserving the robustness of the adiabatic strategy. Our first result, based on high-order averaging techniques, gives a precise quantification of the uncertainty interval of the resonance frequency for which the population inversion works. As a by-product, we prove controllability of an ensemble of spin systems by a single real-valued control, providing an extension of a celebrated result with two controls by Khaneja and Li.},

Similarly, for multiple delays, the absolute stability is equivalent to asymptotic stability for hierarchically large delays. Additionally, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a linear DDE to be hyperbolic for all delays. The latter conditions are crucial for determining whether a system can have stabilizing or destabilizing bifurcations by varying time delays.},

For such a class of systems, we provide clear pictures on the dynamical behaviors in terms of the spontaneous death rate c of predators and diffusion rates d 1 d1 and d 2 d2 by using the monotonicity of the principal eigenvalue , and then present global results on the persistence/extinction of both species on the c − d 2 c−d2 plane or the d 1 − d 2 d1−d2 plane by appealing to the theory of uniform persistence and the comparison principle. In contrast to non-advective environments, the invasion of predators depends heavily on diffusion rates and advection rates. Further, we establish the global stability of a unique positive equilibrium for a special predator-prey interaction by constructing a spatial Lyapunov function.},

The dynamic is transformed into an abstract setting and by combining an approximation technique with the Leray-Schauder continuation principle, we prove global existence results. By the compactness of the semigroup generated by the linear operator , we do not assume any Lipschitzianity, nor compactness on the nonlinear term or on the nonlocal initial condition. In addition, the exploited approximation technique coupled to a Hartman-type inequality argument, allows to treat nonlinearities with superlinear growth. Moreover, regarding the periodic case, we are able to show the existence of at least one periodic solution on the half line .},

The obtained matrix Sturm-Liouville operator contains the weight, which causes qualitative difficulties in the study of the inverse problem. As a result, we show that the considered FDO with involution is uniquely specified by five spectra of certain regular boundary value problems .},

In this paper, we use several classical methods (freezing of coefficients, alternative methods for nonlinear elliptic equations) to extend the results of [39] . We weaken the regularity assumptions on the perturbation and we describe the phenomena that happens for all parameters. In the ill-posed problem, we use a recently developed time-dependent center manifold theorem which allows to reduce the problem to a finite-dimensional ODE with quasi-periodic dependence on time.

Specifically, due to the constitutive law, we assume that higher deformations lock the material, leading to the inequality | ∇ u | ≤ g |∇u|≤g , where u denotes the displacement of the membrane and g is a certain positive threshold. We then introduce the concepts of weak and generalised solutions to the associated wave equation, and prove the existence of them for rather general data and homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions . The presence of the gradient constraint provides the existence of a Lagrange multiplier λ related to the existence of a reaction term ϒ, which corresponds to a strongly nonlinear term in the wave equation. We then extend the existence result to a weak form of the Neumann type boundary condition α u + ∂ u ∂ ν + ∂ u ˙ ∂ ν + ϒ ⋅ ν = 0 αu+∂u∂ν+∂u˙∂ν+ϒ⋅ν=0 , for any α ≥ 0 α≥0 , and we show that these solutions tend, as α → ∞ α→∞ , in a certain sense to a solution of the homogeneous Dirichlet constrained problem.},

With the aid of priori L ∞ -estimates (for solutions of the system) built up in this paper, we treat the semi-linear parabolic equation in the system as a linear parabolic equation, and then use the frequency function method and the localization technique to build up two unique continuation inequalities for the system. As a consequence of the above-mentioned two inequalities, we have the following qualitative unique continuation property: if one component of a solution vanishes in a nonempty open subset ω ⊂ Ω at some time T &gt; 0 , then the solution is identically zero.},

We transform the characteristic integral equation for the delay differential equation (DDE) into a linear partial differential equation (PDE) with boundary conditions. We demonstrate that finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the DDE is equivalent with obtaining nontrivial solutions of this boundary value problem (BVP). When the connectivity kernel consists of a single exponential, we construct a basis of the solutions of this BVP that forms a complete set in L 2 L2 . This gives a complete characterization of the spectrum and is used to construct a solution to the resolvent problem. As an application we give an example of a Hopf bifurcation and compute the first Lyapunov coefficient.},

We show that in the neighborhood of trivial solutions , variables can be chosen so that the form of the reduced vector field relies not only on the information of the linearized system at the critical point but also on the inherent symmetry. We observe that the normal forms give critical information about dynamical properties, such as generic local branching spatiotemporal patterns of equilibria and periodic solutions. As an important application of equivariant normal forms, we not only establish equivariant Hopf bifurcation theorem for semilinear FDEs in general Banach spaces, but also in a natural way derive criteria for the existence, stability, and bifurcation direction of branches of bifurcating periodic solutions. We employ these general results to obtain the existence of infinite many small-amplitude wave solutions for a delayed Ginzburg-Landau equation on a two-dimensional disk with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition .},

The main simple idea consists in replacing the iterates of a single map by the compositions of several various maps. For an equicontinuous countable family of self–maps on a compact connected polyhedron , we develop a lower estimate of this entropy in terms of the asymptotic Nielsen numbers of their compositions. This Ivanov–type equality is then applied, via the associated Poincaré translation operators, to differential equations with time–dependent impulses on tori. If the supporting space differs from a homotopy type of tori, then the situation becomes more delicate. Nevertheless, on compact connected punctured surfaces, we are still able to apply in a similar way the Artin braid group theory to planar differential equations with a finite number of homeomorphic impulses. Some further possibilities are commented in remarks and several illustrative examples are supplied.},

We show situations in which no decay occurs, implying absence of zero-energy eigenfunctions . Then we obtain results on the sign of potentials at infinity, which is also crucial for the occurrence or absence of zero eigenvalues.

  abstract     = {We study stable solutions to the equation ( − Δ ) 1 / 2 u = f ( u ) (−Δ)1/2u=f(u) , posed in a bounded domain of R n Rn . For nonnegative convex nonlinearities , we prove that stable solutions are smooth in dimensions n ≤ 4 n≤4 . This result, which was known only for n = 1 n=1 , follows from a new interior Hölder estimate that is completely independent of the nonlinearity f . A main ingredient in our proof is a new geometric form of the stability condition. It is still unknown for other fractions of the Laplacian and, surprisingly, it requires convexity of the nonlinearity. From it, we deduce higher order Sobolev estimates that allow us to extend the techniques developed by Cabré, Figalli, Ros-Oton, and Serra for the Laplacian. In this way we obtain, besides the Hölder bound for n ≤ 4 n≤4 , a universal H 1 / 2 H1/2 estimate in all dimensions. Our L ∞ L∞ bound is expected to hold for n ≤ 8 n≤8 , but this has been settled only in the radial case or when f ( u ) = λ e u f(u)=λeu . For other fractions of the Laplacian, the expected optimal dimension for boundedness of stable solutions has been reached only when f ( u ) = λ e u f(u)=λeu , even in the radial case.},

The existence of positive stationary solutions of the considered model is first discussed and the nonlinear system is linearized around a positive stationary solution. Then the resulting linear system is formulated as an abstract non-densely defined Cauchy problem so that the well-posedness is obtained for the system. Following that the problems of locally asymptotic stability/instability, asynchronous exponential growth as well as Hopf bifurcations for the linearized system are investigated with the help of operator semigroups theory and spectral analysis under some conditions. Finally, some numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {We study the existence and uniqueness of solution of a evolutionary partial differential equation originating from the continuum limit of a coupled process of totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) and Langmuir kinetics (LK). In the fields of physics and biology, the TASEP-LK coupled process has been extensively studied by Monte Carlo simulations, numerical computations , and detailed experiments. However, no rigorous mathematical analysis so far has been given for the corresponding differential equations, especially the existence and uniqueness of their solutions. In this paper, we prove the existence of the C ∞ [ 0 , 1 ] C∞[0,1] steady-state solution by the method of upper and lower solution, and the uniqueness in both W 1 , 2 ( 0 , 1 ) W1,2(0,1) and L ∞ ( 0 , 1 ) L∞(0,1) by a generalized maximum principle. We further prove the global existence and uniqueness of the time-dependent solution in C ( [ 0 , 1 ] × [ 0 , + ∞ ) ) ∩ C 2 , 1 ( [ 0 , 1 ] × ( 0 , + ∞ ) ) C([0,1]×[0,+∞))∩C2,1([0,1]×(0,+∞)) , which, for any continuous initial value , converges to the steady-state solution in C [ 0 , 1 ] C[0,1] (global attractivity). Our results support the numerical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, and provide theoretical foundations for the TASEP-LK coupled process, especially the most important phase diagram of particle density along the travel track under different model parameters, which is difficult because the boundary layers (at one or both boundaries) and domain wall (separating high and low particle densities) may appear as the length of the travel track tends to infinity. The methods used in this paper may be instructive for studies of the more general cases of the TASEP-LK process, such as the one with multiple travel tracks and/or multiple particle species.},

Using the method of generalized potentials and characteristic triangles, extended to the boundary value case, an explicit way of constructing measure-valued solutions is presented. The prescription of boundary data is shown to depend on the behavior of the generalized potentials at the boundary. We show that the constructed solution satisfies an entropy condition and it conserves mass, whereby mass may accumulate at the boundary. Conservation of momentum again depends on the behavior of the generalized boundary potentials. There is a large amount of literature where the initial value problem for the pressureless gas dynamics model has been studied.

The main difficulty lies in the fact that the comparison principle cannot be used for the predator-prey system. We use the comparison principle of the scalar equation and the method of upper and lower solutions to prove the results. In addition, we establish the comparison principle of nonlocal dispersal equations in space and time dependent environment.

We prove closeness of the solutions of both systems in the sense of a “continuous dependence” on their initial data in the l 2 l2 and l ∞ l∞ metrics. The most striking relevance of the analytical results is that small amplitude solutions of the Ablowitz-Ladik system persist in the Discrete Nonlinear Schrödinger one. It is shown that the closeness results are also valid in higher dimensional lattices , as well as, for generalised nonlinearities . For illustration of the applicability of the approach, a brief numerical study is included, showing that when the 1-soliton solution of the Ablowitz-Ladik system is initiated in the Discrete Nonlinear Schrödinger system with cubic or saturable nonlinearity, it persists for long-times. Thereby, excellent agreement of the numerical findings with the theoretical predictions is obtained.},

In this paper, we develop some methods and techniques to show that the faster traveling waves of a class of integro-differential Fisher-KPP equations with degenerated monostable reaction functions are strictly monotone increasing, unique up to translation, and they are globally exponentially stable under some perturbations in an exponentially weighted space.},

In this paper, we show that this inhibition phenomenon can be rigorously verified in the (nonlinear) inhomogeneous, incompressible, inviscid case with velocity damping. More precisely, we show that there is a critical number m C , such that if the strength | m | of a horizontal magnetic field is bigger than m C , then the small perturbation solution around the magnetic RT equilibrium state is exponentially stable in time. Moreover, we also provide a nonlinear instability result for the case | m | ∈ ( 0 , m C ) . Our instability result reveals that a horizontal magnetic field can not inhibit the RT instability, if it&#39;s strength is too small.},

Indeed, we prove that the invariant measure of stochastic real Ginzburg-Landau equation on torus and driven by cylindrical α -stable Lévy processes converges to the invariant measure of stochastic real Ginzburg-Landau equation forced by cylindrical Brownian motions under the Wasserstein distance, as α tends to 2. We state our strategy as below. First, by using an abstract result given by Hairer and Mattingly, we prove that a type of Wasserstein distance is contracting for the dual operator of Markov semigroup associated with the limit equation which forced by Brownian motions. Then, through server priori uniform moment estimates and a convergence result on stochastic convolutions of cylindrical subordinated Brownian motions, we establish a strong convergence result on the solution of stochastic real Ginzburg-Landau equation driven by cylindrical subordinated Brownian motions conditioned on the initial data is distributed as an invariant measure, in the limit α → 2 α→2 . Finally, by the Monge-Kantorovich duality, we prove that the invariant probability measure of stochastic real Ginzburg-Landau equation driven by cylindrical α -stable Lévy processes converges to the invariant measure of stochastic real Ginzburg-Landau equation forced by Brownian motions under the Wasserstein distance.},

It is shown that the highest codimension of a nilpotent cusp is 4, and the model can undergo degenerate Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 4. Moreover, when the model has a center-type equilibrium, we show that it is a weak focus with order at least 3 and at most 4, and the model can exhibit Hopf bifurcation of codimension 3. Some algebraic methods including resultant elimination and pseudo-division are used to solve the semi-algebraic varieties of normal form coefficients or focal values. Our results indicate that constant-yield prey harvesting can cause not only richer dynamics and bifurcations, but also the coextinction of both populations with some positive initial densities. Finally, numerical simulations, including the coexistence of limit cycle and homoclinic cycle, and three limit cycles, are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.},

To demonstrate the application of our theoretical result and its superiority for some systems to the existing averaging theory, we study the maximum number of limit cycles bifurcating from an n -dimensional periodic submanifold caused by non-smooth centers of the fold-fold type, providing an upper bound for any order piecewise polynomial perturbations of degree m . Concerning the planar case of the unperturbed system, a piecewise Hamiltonian system, we obtain a better upper bound for piecewise polynomial Hamiltonian perturbations up to order two.

This result improves and extends the previously known ones. We point out that the same result to the corresponding two-dimensional Navier-Stokes system with direct signal production holds necessarily imposing some saturated chemotactic sensitivity, logistic damping or small total initial population mass. In the case coupled with logistic source ( r ∈ R r∈R , μ &gt; 0 μ&amp;gt;0 ), it is shown that for any reasonably regular initial data, the corresponding initial-boundary value problem for the spatially three-dimensional Stokes system (⋆) possesses a globally bounded classical solution, and that this solution stabilizes toward the corresponding spatially homogeneous equilibrium with the explicit convergence rates for the cases r &lt; 0 r&amp;lt;0 , r = 0 r=0 and r &gt; 0 r&amp;gt;0 . We underline that the global boundedness of classical solution to the corresponding three-dimensional Stokes system with direct signal production was obtained only for μ ≥ 23 μ≥23 (or sublinear signal production), and that the convergence result to the corresponding system with direct signal production was established only for r = 0 r=0 and μ ≥ 23 μ≥23 . Our results rigorously confirm that the indirect signal production mechanism genuinely contributes to the global boundedness of classical solution to the Keller-Segel(-Navier)-Stokes system.}}},

Roughly speaking, the word “external” means that we consider a DAE (locally) everywhere and “internal” means that we consider the DAE on its (locally) maximal invariant submanifold (i.e., where its solutions exist) only. First, we revise the geometric reduction method in DAEs solution theory and formulate an implementable algorithm to realize that method. Then a procedure called explicitation with driving variables is proposed to connect nonlinear DAEs with nonlinear control systems and we show that the driving variables of an explicitation system can be reduced under some involutivity conditions. Finally, due to the explicitation, we use some notions from nonlinear control theory to derive two nonlinear generalizations of the Weierstrass form.},

Furthermore, by refining the upper bound of the ground state energy, we provide a precise mass collapse behavior of the ground state and a precise limit behavior of the excited state as β → 0 β→0 . Finally, we deal with the high dimensional cases N ≥ 4 N≥4 . Several non-existence results are obtained if β &lt; 0 β&amp;lt;0 . When N = 4 N=4 , β &gt; 0 β&amp;gt;0 , the system is a mass-energy double critical problem, we obtain the existence of a normalized ground state and its synchronized mass collapse behavior. Comparing with the well studied homogeneous case β = 0 β=0 , our main results indicate that the quadratic interaction term not only enriches the set of solutions to the above Schrödinger system but also leads to a stabilization of the related evolution system.}}},

It is proved rigorously that this curved delta shock wave solution satisfies the pressureless drift-flux equations in the sense of distributions. Finally, the asymptotic limits of Riemann solutions are investigated in detail when the adiabatic exponent tends to one, in which the concentration phenomenon can be observed when the non-self-similar Riemann solution consisting of curved 1-shock wave, 2-contact discontinuity and 3-shock wave converges to this curved delta shock wave solution.

  abstract     = {The paper is concerned with the stability property under perturbation Q → Q ˜ Q→Q˜ of different spectral characteristics of a boundary value problem associated in L 2 ( [ 0 , 1 ] ; C 2 ) L2([0,1];C2) with the following 2 × 2 2×2 Dirac type equation (0.1) L U ( Q ) y = − i B − 1 y ′ + Q ( x ) y = λ y , B = ( b 1 0 0 b 2 ) , b 1 &lt; 0 &lt; b 2 , y = col ( y 1 , y 2 ) , LU(Q)y=−iB−1y′+Q(x)y=λy,B=(b100b2),b1&amp;lt;0&amp;lt;b2,y=col(y1,y2), with a potential matrix Q ∈ L p ( [ 0 , 1 ] ; C 2 × 2 ) Q∈Lp([0,1];C2×2) and subject to the regular boundary conditions U y : = { U 1 , U 2 } y = 0 Uy:={U1,U2}y=0 . If b 2 = − b 1 = 1 b2=−b1=1 this equation is equivalent to one dimensional Dirac equation . Our approach to the spectral stability relies on the existence of the triangular transformation operators for system (0.1) with Q ∈ L 1 Q∈L1 , which was established in our previous works. The starting point of our investigation is the Lipshitz property of the mapping Q → K Q ± Q→KQ± , where K Q ± KQ± are the kernels of transformation operators for system (0.1) . Namely, we prove the following uniform estimate: ‖ K Q ± − K Q ˜ ± ‖ X ∞ , p 2 + ‖ K Q ± − K Q ˜ ± ‖ X 1 , p 2 ⩽ C ⋅ ‖ Q − Q ˜ ‖ p , Q , Q ˜ ∈ U p , r 2 × 2 , p ∈ [ 1 , ∞ ] , ‖KQ±−KQ˜±‖X∞,p2+‖KQ±−KQ˜±‖X1,p2⩽C⋅‖Q−Q˜‖p,Q,Q˜∈Up,r2×2,p∈[1,∞], on balls U p , r 2 × 2 Up,r2×2 in L p ( [ 0 , 1 ] ; C 2 × 2 ) Lp([0,1];C2×2) . It is new even for Q ˜ = 0 Q˜=0 . Here X ∞ , p 2 X∞,p2 , X 1 , p 2 X1,p2 are the special Banach spaces naturally arising in such problems. We also obtained similar estimates for Fourier transforms of K Q ± KQ± . Both of these estimates are of independent interest and play a crucial role in the proofs of all spectral stability results discussed in the paper. For instance, as an immediate consequence of these estimates we get the Lipshitz property of the mapping Q → Φ Q ( ⋅ , λ ) Q→ΦQ(⋅,λ) , where Φ Q ( x , λ ) ΦQ(x,λ) is the fundamental matrix of the system (0.1) . Assuming the spectrum Λ Q = { λ Q , n } n ∈ Z ΛQ={λQ,n}n∈Z of L U ( Q ) LU(Q) to be asymptotically simple, denote by F Q = { f Q , n } | n | &gt; N FQ={fQ,n}|n|&amp;gt;N a sequence of corresponding normalized eigenvectors , L U ( Q ) f Q , n = λ Q , n f Q , n LU(Q)fQ,n=λQ,nfQ,n . Assuming boundary conditions (BC) to be strictly regular , we show that the mapping Q → Λ Q − Λ 0 Q→ΛQ−Λ0 sends L p ( [ 0 , 1 ] ; C 2 × 2 ) Lp([0,1];C2×2) either into ℓ p ′ ℓp′ or into the weighted ℓ p ℓp -space ℓ p ( { ( 1 + | n | ) p − 2 } ) ℓp({(1+|n|)p−2}) ; we also establish its Lipshitz property on compact sets in L p ( [ 0 , 1 ] ; C 2 × 2 ) Lp([0,1];C2×2) , p ∈ [ 1 , 2 ] p∈[1,2] . The proof of the second estimate involves as an important ingredient inequality that generalizes classical Hardy-Littlewood inequality for Fourier coefficients . It is also shown that the mapping Q → F Q − F 0 Q→FQ−F0 sends L p ( [ 0 , 1 ] ; C 2 × 2 ) Lp([0,1];C2×2) into the space ℓ p ′ ( Z ; C ( [ 0 , 1 ] ; C 2 ) ℓp′(Z;C([0,1];C2) of sequences of continuous vector-functions, and has the Lipshitz property on compacts sets in L p ( [ 0 , 1 ] ; C 2 × 2 ) Lp([0,1];C2×2) , p ∈ [ 1 , 2 ] p∈[1,2] . Certain modifications of these spectral stability results are also proved for balls U p , r 2 × 2 Up,r2×2 in L p ( [ 0 , 1 ] ; C 2 × 2 ) Lp([0,1];C2×2) , p ∈ [ 1 , 2 ] p∈[1,2] . Note also that the proof of the Lipshitz property of the mapping Q → F Q − F 0 Q→FQ−F0 involves the deep Carleson-Hunt theorem for maximal Fourier transform, while the proof of this property for the mapping Q → Λ Q − Λ 0 Q→ΛQ−Λ0 relies on the estimates of the classical Fourier transform and is elementary in character. We apply our previous results to the damped string equation to establish the Riesz basis property and the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues of the corresponding dynamic generator under the assumptions d ∈ L 1 [ 0 , ℓ ] d∈L1[0,ℓ] , ρ ∈ W 1 , 1 [ 0 , ℓ ] ρ∈W1,1[0,ℓ] on the damping coefficient and the density of the string, that are weaker than previously treated in the literature. We also establish Lipshitz dependence on d and ρ in ℓ p ℓp -spaces of the remainders in the asymptotic formula for the eigenvalues.},

Approximate solutions are constructed by adding artificial viscosity . Then the uniform L p Lp estimates of the approximate solutions with respect to the artificial viscosity are established through some subtle analysis on level sets of density and relative velocity. The convergence of approximate solutions to the desired weak solutions is guaranteed by the L p Lp compensated compactness framework.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we analyze the asymptotic behavior of a control problem set by a convection-reaction-diffusion equation with mixed boundary conditions and defined in a tubular thin domain with rough boundary. The control term acts on a subset of the rough boundary where a Robin-type boundary condition and a catalyzed reaction mechanism are set. The reaction mechanism depends on a parameter α ∈ R α∈R . Such parameter establishes different regimes which also depend on the profile and geometry of the tube defined by a periodic function g : R 2 ↦ R g:R2↦R . We see that, if ∂ 2 g ∂2g is not null (that is, when g really depends on the second variable), then three regimes with respect to α are established: α &lt; 2 α&amp;lt;2 , α = 2 α=2 (the critical value) and α &gt; 2 α&amp;gt;2 . On the other hand, if ∂ 2 g ≡ 0 ∂2g≡0 , similar regimes are obtained but now with a different critical value. Indeed, if ∂ 2 g ≡ 0 ∂2g≡0 , then the critical value is achieved at α = 1 α=1 . For each one of these six regimes, we obtain the asymptotic behavior of the control problem when the cylindrical thin domain degenerates to the unit interval. We show that the problem is asymptotically controllable just when α assumes the critical values. Our analysis is mainly performed using the periodic unfolding method adapted to cylindrical coordinates in R 3 R3 .},

We provide a control of the H s Hs -norm over a time interval of order O ( ε − 2 ) O(ε−2) . Due to the lack of conserved quantities controlling high Sobolev norms, the key ingredient of the proof is the construction of a modified energy equivalent to the “low norm” H ρ Hρ (when ρ is sufficiently high) over a nontrivial time interval O ( ε − 2 ) O(ε−2) . This is achieved by means of normal form techniques for quasi-linear equations involving para-differential calculus. The main difficulty is to control the possible loss of derivatives due to the small divisors arising form three waves interactions.

The logarithmic potential is used to ensure the phase field variable stays in the physically relevant interval. Under rather general assumptions on the source term, we first demonstrate a dissipative estimate, leading to uniform-in-time bounds and regularity assertions for previously established weak solutions. Using these, for two spatial dimensions, we prove global strong well-posedness for the model, and demonstrate the existence of the global attractor and exponential attractors with finite fractal dimensions .

One way to control the spread of these diseases is to use the sterile insect technique (SIT), which consists in a massive release of sterilized male mosquitoes. This strategy aims at reducing the total population over time, and has the advantage of being specific to the targeted species, unlike the use of pesticides. In this article, we study the optimal release strategies in order to maximize the efficiency of this technique. We consider simplified models that describe the dynamics of eggs, males, females and sterile males in order to optimize the release protocol. We determine in a precise way optimal strategies , which allows us to tackle numerically the underlying optimization problem in a very simple way. We also present some numerical simulations to illustrate our results.},

  abstract     = {We consider a wave equation with a nonlocal logarithmic damping depending on a small parameter 0 &lt; θ &lt; 1 2 0&amp;lt;θ&amp;lt;12 . This research is a counter part of that was initiated by Charão-D&#39;Abbicco-Ikehata considered in [5] for the large parameter case θ &gt; 1 2 θ&amp;gt;12 . We study the Cauchy problem for this model in R n Rn to the case θ ∈ ( 0 , 1 2 ) θ∈(0,12) , and we obtain an asymptotic profile and optimal estimates in time of solutions as t → ∞ t→∞ in L 2 L2 -sense. An important discovery in this research is that in the case when n = 1 n=1 , we can present a threshold ⁎ θ ⁎ = 1 4 θ⁎=14 of the parameter θ ∈ ( 0 , 1 2 ) θ∈(0,12) such that the solution of the Cauchy problem decays with some optimal rate for ⁎ θ ∈ ( 0 , θ ⁎ ) θ∈(0,θ⁎) as t → ∞ t→∞ , while the L 2 L2 -norm of the corresponding solution never decays for ⁎ θ ∈ [ θ ⁎ , 1 2 ) θ∈[θ⁎,12) and, in particular, in the case ⁎ θ ∈ [ θ ⁎ , 1 2 ) θ∈[θ⁎,12) it shows an infinite time L 2 L2 blow-up of the corresponding solutions. The former (i.e., ⁎ θ ∈ ( 0 , θ ⁎ ) θ∈(0,θ⁎) case) indicates an usual diffusion phenomenon , while the latter (i.e., ⁎ θ ∈ [ θ ⁎ , 1 2 ) θ∈[θ⁎,12) case) implies, so to speak, a singular diffusion phenomenon. Such a singular diffusion in the one dimensional case is a quite novel phenomenon discovered through our new model produced by logarithmic damping with a small parameter θ . It might be already prepared in the usual structural damping case such as ( − Δ ) θ u t (−Δ)θut with θ ∈ ( 0 , 1 / 2 ) θ∈(0,1/2) , however unfortunately nobody has ever just pointed out even in the structural damping case.},

Further, using the Chebyshev criterion, we develop a utilized approach to prove the existence of at most two limit cycles in a piecewise continuous parameter interval. Finally, the existence of double isolated periodic traveling waves for the model is established, and the results are illustrated by numerical simulation.

For this, we study the convergence properties of the trajectories generated by a damped inertial dynamic with Tikhonov regularization . When the time goes to infinity, the Tikhonov regularization parameter is supposed to tend towards zero, not too fast, which is a key property to make the trajectories strongly converge towards the minimizer of minimum norm. According to the structure of the heavy ball method for strongly convex functions , the viscous damping coefficient is proportional to the square root of the Tikhonov regularization parameter. Therefore, it also converges to zero, which will ensure rapid convergence of values. Precisely, under a proper tuning of these parameters, based on Lyapunov&#39;s analysis, we show that the trajectories strongly converge towards the minimizer of minimum norm, and we provide the convergence rate of the values. We show a trade off between the property of fast convergence of values, and the property of strong convergence towards the minimum norm solution. This study improves several previous works where this type of results was obtained under restrictive hypotheses.},

In our mathematical setting, the spatial domain where the partial differential equation evolves is an open bounded subset of R 2 R2 and the wave speed is assumed to be constant in each one of two sub-domains, separated by a smooth and possibly non-convex interface. This article is concerned with the construction of Carleman weights for this wave operator , allowing generalizations of previous results to the case of an interface that is not necessarily the boundary of a convex set . Indeed, using the orthogonal projection onto this interface, we define convex functions satisfying the transmission conditions imposed by the equation, such that, under usual hypothesis on the sign of the jump of the wave speed, can be used as Carleman weights.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the dynamics of a delay differential equation obtained by perturbing a vector field f : R n → R n f:Rn→Rn , admitting a stable periodic orbit, by using a delayed feedback control term η g ( x , x ( t − τ ) ) ηg(x,x(t−τ)) of same regularity, where η is small and τ large so that ητ be bounded but non small. We prove that trajectories starting in a neighborhood (of size independent of the parameters η , τ η,τ ) of this original periodic orbit enter asymptotically a periodic regime, and that the number of such distinct periodic regimes increases (almost) linearly when ητ increases infinitely. Our result is based on the construction of an invariant manifold via a process inspired by the Lyapunov-Perron method for integral operators associated to ordinary differential equations , and on the persistence of normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds for semi-flows on Banach spaces . The statement we provide here complements already known results on periodic orbits of delay differential equations.},

  abstract     = {Chemotaxis is a fundamental mechanism of cells and organisms, which is responsible for attracting microbes to food, embryonic cells into developing tissues, or immune cells to infection sites. Mathematically chemotaxis is described by the Patlak–Keller–Segel model. This macroscopic system of equations is derived from the microscopic model when limiting behaviour is studied. However, on taking the limit and passing from the microscopic equations to the macroscopic equations , fluctuations are neglected. Perturbing the system by a Gaussian random field restitutes the inherent randomness of the system. This gives us the motivation to study the classical Patlak–Keller–Segel system perturbed by random processes . We study a stochastic version of the classical Patlak–Keller–Segel system under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions on an interval O = [ 0 , 1 ] O=[0,1] . In particular, let W 1 W1 , W 2 W2 be two time-homogeneous spatial Wiener processes over a filtered probability space A A . Let u and v denote the cell density and concentration of the chemical signal. We investigate the coupled system { d u − ( r u Δ u − χ div ( u ∇ v ) ) d t = u ∘ d W 1 , d v − ( r v Δ v − α v ) d t = β u d t + v ∘ d W 2 , {du−(ruΔu−χdiv(u∇v))dt=u∘dW1,dv−(rvΔv−αv)dt=βudt+v∘dW2, with initial conditions ( u ( 0 ) , v ( 0 ) ) = ( u 0 , v 0 ) (u(0),v(0))=(u0,v0) . The positive terms r u ru and r v rv are the diffusivity of the cells and chemoattractant, respectively, the positive value χ is the chemotactic sensitivity, α ≥ 0 α≥0 is the so-called damping constant. The noise is interpreted in the Stratonovich sense. Given T &gt; 0 T&amp;gt;0 , we will prove the existence of a martingale solution on [ 0 , T ] [0,T] .}}},

This approach avoids the use of the Duhamel&#39;s principle for the SPDE and the related measurability issues that appear in the stochastic framework. Our results are new even for the deterministic equation in that we prove existence and gradient estimates for the fundamental solution of equations whose coefficients are merely measurable with respect to the time variable.

The second is, from the perspective of stochastic stability, to prove that the zero-noise limits of stationary measures for the perturbed stochastic systems are invariant for the deterministic system and their supports are concentrated on the Birkhoff center.},

In this paper we focus on the solitary wave solutions to such a system. In particular we work in two parameter regimes where the system does not admit a Hamiltonian structure (corresponding to b ≠ d b≠d ). We prove via analytic global bifurcation techniques the existence of solitary waves in such parameter regimes. Some qualitative properties of the solutions are also derived, from which sharp results can be obtained for the global solution curves. Specifically, we first construct solutions bifurcating from the stationary waves, and obtain a global continuous curve of solutions that exhibits a loss of ellipticity in the limit. The second family of solutions bifurcate from the classical Boussinesq supercritical waves. We show that the curve associated to the second class either undergoes a loss of ellipticity in the limit or becomes arbitrarily close to having a stagnation point.},

For this kind of characteristic initial-boundary-value problems (IBVPs), we introduce a three-scale asymptotic expansion to analyze the boundary-layer behaviors of the general multi-dimensional linear relaxation systems. Moreover, we derive the reduced boundary condition under the Generalized Kreiss Condition by resorting to some subtle matrix transformations and the perturbation theory of linear operators . The reduced boundary condition is proved to satisfy the Uniform Kreiss Condition for characteristic IBVPs. Its validity is shown through an error estimate involving the Fourier-Laplace transformation and an energy method based on the structural stability condition.},

This enables us to derive necessary and sufficient conditions for (anti-)maximum principles in a very general setting. Consequently, we are able to either prove or disprove (anti-)maximum principles for a large variety of concrete differential operators .

  abstract     = {We study well-posedness for fluid-structure interaction driven by stochastic forcing. This is of particular interest in real-life applications where forcing and/or data have a strong stochastic component. The prototype model studied here is a stochastic viscous wave equation, which arises in modeling the interaction between Stokes flow and an elastic membrane. To account for stochastic perturbations, the viscous wave equation is perturbed by spacetime white noise scaled by a nonlinear Lipschitz function, which depends on the solution. We prove the existence of a unique function-valued stochastic mild solution to the corresponding Cauchy problem in spatial dimensions one and two. Additionally, we show that up to a modification, the stochastic mild solution is α -Hölder continuous for almost every realization of the solution&#39;s sample path, where α ∈ [ 0 , 1 ) α∈[0,1) for spatial dimension n = 1 n=1 , and α ∈ [ 0 , 1 / 2 ) α∈[0,1/2) for spatial dimension n = 2 n=2 . This result contrasts the known results for the heat and wave equations perturbed by spacetime white noise, including the damped wave equation perturbed by spacetime white noise, for which a function-valued mild solution exists only in spatial dimension one and not higher. Our results show that dissipation due to fluid viscosity, which is in the form of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator applied to the time derivative of the membrane displacement, sufficiently regularizes the roughness of white noise in the stochastic viscous wave equation to allow the stochastic mild solution to exist even in dimension two, which is the physical dimension of the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on well-posedness for a stochastically perturbed fluid-structure interaction problem.},

  abstract     = {We study the nonlinear Schrödinger equation with δ s ′ δs′ coupling of intensity β ∈ R ∖ { 0 } β∈R∖{0} on the star graph Γ consisting of N half-lines. The nonlinearity has the form g ( u ) = | u | p − 1 u , p &gt; 1 g(u)=|u|p−1u,p&amp;gt;1 . In the first part of the paper, under certain restriction on β , we prove the existence of the ground state solution as a minimizer of the action functional S ω Sω on the Nehari manifold. It appears that the family of critical points which contains a ground state consists of N profiles (one symmetric and N − 1 N−1 asymmetric). In particular, for the attractive δ s ′ δs′ coupling ( β &lt; 0 β&amp;lt;0 ) and the frequency ω above a certain threshold, we managed to specify the ground state. The second part is devoted to the study of orbital instability of the critical points. We prove spectral instability of the critical points using Grillakis/Jones Instability Theorem. Then orbital instability for p &gt; 2 p&amp;gt;2 follows from the fact that data-solution mapping associated with the equation is of class C 2 C2 in H 1 ( Γ ) H1(Γ) . Moreover, for p &gt; 5 p&amp;gt;5 we complete and concertize instability results showing strong instability (by blow up in finite time) for the particular critical points.},

The GHP enables us to solve a longstanding inverse scattering problem of determining a polygonal elastic obstacle of general impedance type by at most a few far-field measurements. In this paper, we include all the possible physical boundary conditions from linear elasticity into the GHP study with the soft-clamped, simply-supported as well as the associated impedance-type conditions. We derive a comprehensive and complete characterization of the GHP associated with all of the aforementioned physical conditions. As significant applications, we establish novel unique identifiability results by a few scattering measurements not only for the inverse elastic obstacle problem but also for the inverse elastic diffraction grating problem within polygonal geometry in the most general physical scenario. We follow the general strategy from [14] in establishing the results. However, we develop technically new ingredients to tackle the more general and challenging physical and mathematical setups. It is particularly worth noting that in [14] , the impedance parameters were assumed to be constant whereas in this work they can be variable functions.},

We derive explicit formulas of the normal form, that can be applied for both functional differential equations and partial differential equations with or without nonlocal effects in a bounded spatial domain. This provides an effective tool to establish existences of multi-periodic and quasi-periodic oscillations of a double-Hopf singularity for such equations. As an example, the Holling-Tanner predator-prey model with the nonlocal intraspecific competition of prey is considered. It turns out that double-Hopf bifurcation will occur because of the nonlocal interaction. Many spatio-temporal dynamics are found, including stable spatially homogeneous or nonhomogeneous periodic solutions, and stable spatially nonhomogeneous quasi-periodic solutions.},

In particular, nilpotent cusp singularity of order 3 and degenerate Hopf bifurcation of codimension 3 are completely analyzed. Remarkably it is the first time that three limit cycles are discovered in predator-prey models with multiplicative Allee effects. Moreover, a new unfolding of nilpotent saddle of codimension 3 with a fixed invariant line is discovered and fully developed, and the existence of codimension 2 heteroclinic bifurcation is proven. Our work extends the existing results of predator-prey systems with Allee effects. The bifurcation analysis and diagram allow us to give biological interpretations of predator-prey interactions.},

The considered system couples a Navier-Stokes type equation with a dissipative equation for the deformation tensor and a Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert type equation for the magnetization field. The main purpose is to establish a well-posedness theory in a two-dimensional periodic domain under standard assumption of critical regularity for the (possibly large) initial data . We prove that the considered weak solutions are everywhere smooth, except for a discrete set of time values. The proof of the uniqueness is based on suitable energy estimates for the solutions within a functional framework which is less regular than the one of the Struwe energy level. These estimates rely on several techniques of harmonic analysis and paradifferential calculus.},

In this paper, we derive a four-species reaction-diffusion system using the energetic variational approach based on the law of mass action . This is a reversible Gray-Scott type model, which has a natural entropy structure. We establish the local well-posedness of this system, and justify the limit to the corresponding irreversible Gray-Scott type system as some backward coefficients tend to zero. Furthermore, under some smallness assumption on the initial data , we obtain the global-in-time existence of classical solution of the reversible system.},

  abstract     = {In this article a fractional cross-diffusion system is derived as the rigorous many-particle limit of a multi-species system of moderately interacting particles that is driven by Lévy noise. The form of the mutual interaction is motivated by the porous medium equation with fractional potential pressure. Our approach is based on the techniques developed by Oelschläger (1989) and Stevens (2000), in the latter of which the convergence of a regularization of the empirical measure to the solution of a correspondingly regularized macroscopic system is shown. A well-posedness result and the non-negativity of solutions are proved for the regularized macroscopic system, which then yields the same results for the non-regularized fractional cross-diffusion system in the limit.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a free boundary problem modeling tumor growth in the presence of drugs with high molecular mass. This model is an improvement of a similar model proposed by Byrne and Chaplain ((1995) [1] ). The novelty in our model is to better account for the fast diffusion coefficient of nutrients and the slow diffusion coefficient of drugs with high molecular mass, which is more realistic. The introduction of these terms, however, makes the analysis of linear stability more challenging in the spectral analysis of the linearized operator. A significant challenge is the lack of explicit expressions for their locations. We shall give a complete classification of parameters λ σ λσ , λ β λβ , τ , σ ‾ σ‾ , β ‾ β‾ and σ ˜ σ˜ under which either (i) there exist exact one radially symmetric stationary solution ( σ S , β S , p S ) (σS,βS,pS) with the boundary r = R 2 r=R2 , or (ii) exact two solutions ( σ S , β S , p S ) (σS,βS,pS) with the boundary r = R 1 r=R1 or r = R 2 r=R2 ( R 1 &lt; R 2 R1&amp;lt;R2 ), or (iii) no solutions. We further show that for all γ μ &gt; 0 γμ&amp;gt;0 , ( σ S , β S , p S , R 1 ) (σS,βS,pS,R1) is linearly unstable under non-radially symmetric perturbations, while there exists a threshold value ⁎ c ⁎ ⩾ 0 c⁎⩾0 such that ( σ S , β S , p S , R 2 ) (σS,βS,pS,R2) is linearly stable for ⁎ γ μ &gt; c ⁎ γμ&amp;gt;c⁎ and linearly unstable for ⁎ γ μ ∈ ( 0 , c ⁎ ) γμ∈(0,c⁎) . As a biological implication, we discuss the positive and negative effects of drugs with high molecular mass on tumor growth and get a high risk region for drugs.

Such a system covers various models arising from mathematical biology, in particular a West Nile virus model and an epidemic model considered recently in [16] and [44] , respectively, where a “spreading-vanishing” dichotomy is known to govern the long time dynamical behaviour, but the question on spreading speed was left open. In this paper, we develop a systematic approach to determine the spreading profile of the system, and obtain threshold conditions on the kernel functions which decide exactly when the spreading has finite speed, or infinite speed (accelerated spreading). This relies on a rather complete understanding of both the associated semi-waves and travelling waves. When the spreading speed is finite, we show that the speed is determined by a particular semi-wave. This is Part 1 of a two part series. In Part 2, for some typical classes of kernel functions, we will obtain sharp estimates of the spreading rate for both the finite speed case, and the infinite speed case.},

Our system is the converted form under inverse Hopf-Cole transformation of a Keller-Segel type chemotaxis model with logistic growth, logarithmic sensitivity, non-diffusive chemical signal and density-dependent production/consumption rate. We study Cauchy problem when the Cauchy data are near a diffusive contact wave. The contact wave connects two different end-states as x → ± ∞ x→±∞ , reflecting the situation when the logarithmic singularity plays an intrinsic role in the original chemotaxis model. We establish global existence of solution and study time asymptotic behavior of the solution. Consequently, we obtain nonlinear stability of the diffusive contact wave. Our result shows a significant difference when comparing our model to Euler equations with damping. In our case, there exists a secondary wave in the asymptotic ansatz. Therefore, the solution to Cauchy problem converges to the diffusive contact wave slower than in the case of Euler equations with damping. Besides its own physical relevance, our model is a prototype of a general system of hyperbolic-parabolic balance laws. Our results shed light on the future study of nonlinear stability of elementary waves for a general system.},

To carry out the improvement of previous results in the literature we present in this paper a careful revision of the existence and regularity of weak solutions under very general assumptions on the data. We prove that the problem can be solved in the very general framework of the maximal monotone operators theory, even under a lack of regularity of the damping term. This allows us to consider, among other things, the singular case m = 0 m=0 . We replace the above approximation of the damping term by a different one which keeps the monotonicity for any ε ⩾ 0 ε⩾0 . We prove that, when m = 0 m=0 , the finite extinction time of the solution arises for merely bounded right hand side data f ( t , x ) f(t,x) .

In particular, this equation appears in the field of nonlinear optics, where it is used to describe pulses in optical fibers near a zero dispersion wavelength. It has been shown formally and numerically that the perturbed NLS equation has one- or multi-hump solutions with small oscillations at infinity, called generalized one- or multi-hump solutions. The main purpose of the paper is to provide the first rigorous proof of the existence of generalized one- or two-hump solutions of the singularly perturbed NLS equation. The several invariant properties of the equation, i.e., the translational invariance , the gauge invariance and the reversibility property, are essential to obtain enough free constants to prove the existence. The ideas and methods presented here may be applicable to show existence of generalized 2 k 2k -hump solutions of the equation.},

We prove that if the solutions to the Kuramoto system with all-to-all coupling have the same total phase, then their phase differences θ i j θij for any corresponding initial data converge to the same periodic state θ i j T θijT as t goes to ∞. Finally, by combining the total phase formula and this stability, we present a sharp asymptotic formula consisting of the time-periodic state, drift term, and exponentially decaying error term.

In the case where the velocity field is either nonnegative or nonpositive, one can rely on similar techniques as in the case of the Cauchy problem. Conversely, in the general case we introduce a new and more technically demanding construction, which heuristically speaking relies on a “lagrangian formulation” of the problem, albeit in a highly irregular setting. We also establish stability of the solution in weak and strong topologies , and propagation of the BV regularity. In the case of either nonnegative or nonpositive velocity fields we also establish a BV -in-time regularity result, and we exhibit a counterexample showing that the result is false in the case of sign-changing vector fields. To conclude, we establish a trace renormalization property.},

In the degenerate drift-diffusion equation, it is known that large time behavior of solutions converges to the Zel&#39;dovich–Kompaneetz–Barenblatt (ZKB) function. For a fast-diffusion case, we show that the asymptotic profile for a solution is the generalized ZKB function such as the Talenti function. We use the entropy dissipation method combining the logarithmic Sobolev and the Shannon inequalities for the Rényi entropy that is known as an extension of the Boltzmann–Shannon entropy.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we are concerned with the approximate controllability results for a class of impulsive functional differential control systems involving time dependent operators in Banach spaces . First, we show the existence of a mild solution for non-autonomous functional impulsive evolution inclusions in separable reflexive Banach spaces with the help of the evolution family and a generalization of the Leray-Schauder fixed point theorem for multi-valued maps. In order to establish sufficient conditions for the approximate controllability of our problem, we first consider a linear-quadratic regulator problem and obtain the optimal control in the feedback form, which contains the resolvent operator consisting of duality mapping. With the help of this optimal control, we prove the approximate controllability of the linear system and hence derive sufficient conditions for the approximate controllability of our problem. Moreover, in this paper, we rectify several shortcomings of the related works available in the literature, namely, proper identification of resolvent operator in Banach spaces, characterization of phase space in the presence of impulsive effects, and lack of compactness of the operator h ( ⋅ ) ↦ ∫ 0 ⋅ U ( ⋅ , s ) h ( s ) d s : L 1 ( [ 0 , T ] ; Y ) → C ( [ 0 , T ] ; Y ) h(⋅)↦∫0⋅U(⋅,s)h(s)ds:L1([0,T];Y)→C([0,T];Y) , where Y Y is a Banach space and U ( ⋅ , ⋅ ) U(⋅,⋅) is the evolution family, etc. Finally, we provide a concrete example to illustrate the efficiency of our results.},

More precisely, when the initial energy is subcritical, a sufficient condition for the solutions to blow up in finite time is derived, by combining the Nehari manifold with concavity argument. When the initial energy is supercritical, some new skills are invented to establish another finite time blow-up criterion for this problem. Meanwhile, for each of the above two cases, the lifespan of the weak solutions is estimated from above. Moreover, by making full use of the strongly damping term and choosing appropriate parameters, a lower bound for the blow-up time is given.},

Setting ε &gt; 0 ε&amp;gt;0 to be the small aspect ratio of the vertical to the horizontal scales of the domain, we investigate the case when the horizontal and vertical viscosities in the incompressible three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations are of orders O ( 1 ) O(1) and O ( ε α ) O(εα) , respectively, with α &gt; 2 α&amp;gt;2 , for which the limiting system is the primitive equations with only horizontal viscosity as ε tends to zero. In particular we show that for “well prepared” initial data the solutions of the scaled incompressible three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations converge strongly, in any finite interval of time, to the corresponding solutions of the anisotropic primitive equations with only horizontal viscosities, as ε tends to zero, and that the convergence rate is of order O ( ε β 2 ) O(εβ2) , where β = min ⁡ { α − 2 , 2 } β=min⁡{α−2,2} . Note that this result is different from the case α = 2 α=2 studied in Li and Titi (2019) [38] , where the limiting system is the primitive equations with full viscosities and the convergence is globally in time and its rate of order O ( ε ) O(ε) .},

In this framework, the fluid density could decay fast at infinity, and the Euler–Poisson system can be covered as a special case. Moreover, we prove local well-posedness for the pressureless Euler–Riesz system when the potential is repulsive, by observing hyperbolic nature of the system. Finally, we present sufficient conditions on the finite-time blowup of classical solutions for the isentropic/isothermal Euler–Riesz system with either attractive or repulsive interaction forces. The proof, which is based on estimates of several physical quantities , establishes finite-time blowup for a large class of initial data ; in particular, it is not required that the density is of compact support.},

At least to our knowledge, for p &gt; 1 , this is the first result about the uniqueness for a domain which is not a two-dimensional ball and in particular the very first result about the monotonicity of solutions, which seems to be new even for p = 1 . The threshold, which is sharp for p = 1 , yields a new condition which guarantees that there is no free boundary inside Ω. As a corollary, in the same range, we solve a long-standing open problem (dating back to the work of Berestycki-Brezis in 1980) about the uniqueness of variational solutions. Moreover, on a two-dimensional ball we describe the full branch of positive solutions, that is, we prove the monotonicity along the curve of positive solutions until the boundary density vanishes.},

  abstract     = {Rotational smoothing is a phenomenon consisting in a gain of regularity by means of averaging over rotations. This phenomenon is present in operators that regularize only in certain directions, in contrast to operators regularizing in all directions. The gain of regularity is the result of rotating the directions where the corresponding operator performs the smoothing effect. In this paper we carry out a systematic study of the rotational smoothing for a class of operators that includes k -vector-space Riesz potentials in R n Rn with k &lt; n k&amp;lt;n , and the convolution with fundamental solutions of elliptic constant-coefficient differential operators acting on k -dimensional linear subspaces . Examples of the latter type of operators are the planar Cauchy transform in R n Rn , or a solution operator for the transport equation in R n Rn . The analysis of rotational smoothing is motivated by the resolution of some inverse problems under low-regularity assumptions.},

The time-exponential convergence rate is also derived.

These new equations unify and generalize the Riemann-Liouville, modified Caputo and Caputo fractional differential equations. The equivalences between the fractional differential equations and the corresponding perturbed Abel&#39;s integral equations are obtained. These results are useful not only to study the initial or boundary value problems for nonlinear first order Riemann-Liouville fractional differential equations but also to study the solutions of the perturbed Abel&#39;s integral equations arising in a problem of mechanics and many other physical problems . The well-known Tonelli&#39;s result on solvability of the Abel&#39;s integral equation is generalized. We exhibit that there are nonconstant equilibria for some first order Caputo fractional equations. This is different from nonlinear first order ordinary differential equations which have only constant equilibria . The equivalence results are applied to generalize the classical Mean Value Theorem to the first order Riemann-Liouville fractional derivatives.},
