  abstract     = {Inpatient beds represent one of the most critical resources in hospitals, of which the availability has been under increasing pressure in China. Such beds are usually to be either used exclusively (“dedicated”) by each department or shared (“pooled”) among departments. This paper considers a generalized bed configuration known as the clustered overflow configuration. The departments are partitioned and managed as clusters. Each department has its dedicated beds and can also admit patients to overflowed beds shared among the departments in the same cluster. A mixed-integer stochastic programming model is developed to optimize the partition and bed-allocation decisions. The objective is to minimize the weighted total cost of rejecting patients, holding patients waiting, nursing cost, and partitioning cost. A simulation-based metaheuristic approach (SMA) is proposed to solve the problem. A niching genetic algorithm (NGA) framework is first proposed to optimize the partitions, and then each partition is evaluated by optimizing the underlying bed-allocation plan through adaptive hyperbox algorithm-based local search (AHA-LS). In AHA-LS, two speeding mechanisms are proposed to effectively identify promising partitions and discard the worst ones. One is an original sequential simulation budget allocation (SSBA) mechanism to sequentially allocate the simulation iteration to evaluate the bed allocation decisions for a given partition; the other is optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) to allocate the simulation budget to evaluate the bed-allocation plans. The elite clusters form a cluster pool, based on which a set covering model is proposed and solved to obtain a better solution. Case studies are conducted based on real data collected from a public hospital in Shanghai, China. The numerical results collectively demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed method. Sensitivity analyses are also performed to gain managerial insights.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we present a new iterative exact solution algorithm for a recently introduced NP-hard sequencing problem. In the problem we are given an upper bound on the allowed solution sequence length and a list of symbols. For each symbol, there is a positive weight and a number, which gives the minimum amount of times the symbol has to occur in a feasible solution sequence. The goal is to find a feasible sequence, which minimizes the maximum weight-distance product, which is calculated for each consecutive appearance of each symbol in the sequence, including the last and first appearance in the sequence, i.e., the sequence is considered to be circular for the calculation of the objective function. Our proposed solution algorithm is based on a new mixed-integer programming model for the problem with a fixed sequence length. We also present various enhancements for our algorithm. We conduct a computational study on the instances from literature to assess the efficiency of our newly proposed solution approach. Our approach solves 404 of 440 instances to optimality within the given time limit, most of them within five minutes. The previous best existing solution approach for the problem only solves 229 of these instances and its exactness depends on an unproven conjecture. Moreover, our approach is up to two orders of magnitude faster compared to this best existing solution approach.},

We investigate a novel and pioneering problem, the one-to-one pickup and delivery problem with multi-trucks and multi-visit drone (OPDP-MTMV). This problem involves multiple trucks, each of which is equipped with a single drone for pickup and delivery services. The drones are capable of carrying multiple packages per drone trip. Pickup and delivery requests can be served by either a truck or a drone, subject to the one-to-one precedence constraints of the requests, the capacity constraints of the truck and the drone, and the endurance constraints of the drone. The energy consumption of a drone is based on the flight time and the varying payload along the multi-visit drone trip. The objective is to minimize the sum of the fixed cost and the variable duration cost. We formulate this problem using a mathematical model and propose an iterated local search (ILS) algorithm based on the distinct features of the problem. Finally, we conduct comprehensive computational experiments using test instances of various sizes to analyze the characteristics of the solution, the applicability of the algorithm, and the impact of different drone configurations.},

The printing pattern should comply with guillotine cuts having three stages. The objective is to minimize the total printing cost composed of paper and plate costs. For plates containing orders with print on both sides, two printing options exist. With the printing options and the option of placing copies of orders in only one pattern, the problem differs from previous studies and becomes challenging to be solved by a mathematical model . We develop a nonlinear integer programming (NIP) model to obtain exact solutions for small-sized instances and an efficient Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve real-sized problems. We design packing routines that generate balanced printing patterns by putting multiple copies of items in one pattern. The GA also takes advantage of complex heuristics for production scheduling and pattern reduction. We evaluate the performance of the GA against the NIP model.

These bound sets are used as a supplement to the classical dominance test to improve the computational time by imposing inequalities derived from (partial) dominance in the objective space. This process is called objective branching since it is mostly applied when generating child nodes. In this paper, we extend the concept of objective branching to multi-objective integer optimization problems with three or more objective functions. Several difficulties arise in this case, as there is no longer a lexicographic order among non-dominated outcome vectors when there are three or more objectives. We discuss the general concept of objective branching in any number of dimensions and suggest a merging operation of local upper bounds to avoid the generation of redundant sub-problems. Finally, results from extensive experimental studies on several classes of multi-objective optimization problems is reported.},

  abstract     = {The distributed no-wait flowshop scheduling problem (DNWFSP) is an extension of the permutation flowshop scheduling problem with multiple factories and no-wait constraints. The DNWFSP consists of two decisions, namely, assigning jobs to the factories and sequencing the set of jobs assigned to the same factory. The no-wait constraints require that jobs have to be processed without any interruption between operations. Since the introduction of the DNWFSP, a number of metaheuristic approaches were developed to solve it. However, there exists no exact solution approach for the DNWFSP to the best of our knowledge. In this regard, a branch-and-cut (BC) algorithm is proposed to solve the DNWFSP. The proposed BC is integrated with a heuristic algorithm to obtain good upper bounds. Moreover, a set of symmetry breaking constraints are employed in the models to strengthen the formulations. The performance of BC is evaluated on a set of benchmark problem instances available in the related literature. The proposed BC is numerically compared with mixed-integer programming formulations of the DNWFSP which are solved by a commercial solver. The results obtained from the computational experiments reveal the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The proposed BC is able to solve all small-size instances, as well as, 206 out of 660 large-size instances to optimality . Besides, it is worth to mention that the average percentage gap for the large-size instances with two factories is only 0.43\%.},

The cost of this system includes major ordering costs, minor ordering costs, and holding costs, and the service level of each item is required to achieve a certain given level. The objective is to optimize the parameters of this policy so that the expected total cost of this system for one period is minimized subject to the service level constraints.

Caregiver-patient compatibility is another pivotal aspect of the problem, which the present study addresses for the first time. This concept refers to the desirability of the personal relationship between a caregiver and a patient, which plays a key role in fulfilling their satisfaction. The first stage minimizes the Total Planning Distance (TPD), while the second stage maximizes the total compatibility and deals with unexpected events. A health center located in Tehran is considered a case study to assess the validity of the suggested model and analyze the sensitivity of the objectives with the structural parameters, which in turn leads to some practical managerial insights. Due to the NP-hardness of the studied problem, a matheuristic-based algorithm is applied to reduce the computational time.

  abstract     = {Job-shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) with conveyor-based Continuous Flow Transporters (CFTs) is a general production scheduling problem in the flexible manufacturing systems in practical electronics manufacturing industry . In such a problem setting, the jobs are processed on the machines which are connected in series via the conveyor, and the conveyor segments serve as CFTs by transferring the jobs to the machines automatically. The jobs have to obey First In First Out (FIFO) constraint and limited buffer constraint during their transportation and processing in the system. The objective of scheduling is to find an order in which the jobs enter into the system such that the makespan is minimized. This paper investigates the optimization of the problem by the mathematical modelling and heuristic approaches . The Mathematical Programming (MP) model of the problem is presented and it is used as an exact solution approach for solving small instances optimally. To solve larger problem, the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm with a solution perturbation Neighbourhood Generation Scheme (NGS) is proposed to generate near-optimal solutions. The performance of the two approaches to the problem is evaluated by conducting computational experiment. The performance of the MP approach to the problem is numerically investigated, and the performance of the proposed SA algorithm with the solution perturbation NGS is evaluated by comparing against the SA algorithm with two conventional NGSs. The computational results show the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the conventional ones. Furthermore, a comparative study on the performance of the MP approach and the heuristic approach to the problem is implemented. In addition, sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the effects of buffer capacity on the performance of the manufacturing system.},

We propose a two-stage integer programming model that maximizes the proportion of unaltered transactions in the sanitized database and protects sensitive itemset relationships. The model exploits the concept of transactional equivalence and significantly reduces the size of the FIH problem. In addition, our model enables the identification of solutions with minimal side effects. We conduct an experimental evaluation on both real and synthetic databases to show that our approach is scalable and produces a sanitized database with maximum accuracy. The generated solution is also found to have lower side effects (itemset information loss) compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments on very large problem instances show problem size reductions of one to three orders of magnitude. The proposed approach is quite attractive and practically useful for solving large-scale FIH problem instances and preserving privacy in increasingly shared and big data-driven organizational environments.},

It is often used to collect large amounts of manually created labels that form datasets for training and evaluating supervised machine learning models. When designing a (micro-task) crowdsourcing experiment, it is often desirable to combine different types of items (e.g., images of both cats and dogs for an image classification task) together into the same task and to have diverse contributors (e.g., male and female crowd workers ) providing labels for the same item so as to mitigating existing bias in the collected labels. Setting up such a crowdsourcing experiment, i.e., constructing a human intelligence task containing the right mix of items and assigning it to the right mix of crowd workers, becomes a complex problem. In this paper we address the problem of optimizing human intelligence task construction by providing its formal definition and by applying a local search method initialized by a greedy construction to solve it. We experimentally show the flexibility of the proposed solution in addressing different type of constraints, both on the item and on the worker side, and demonstrate its scalability to complex crowdsourcing setups.

At the beginning of a finite selling horizon, a fixed amount of inventory is available for sale in future periods. In each period, the decision-maker observes the current market price and makes the retrieval decision, and only at the beginning of the last period, he knows that it is the last period. The objective is to maximize the expected total revenue and the difficulty stems from the lack of information on probability distributions of both the selling duration and future market prices, which also causes uncertainty in the random demands. Proposing an online algorithm ALG-IR to solve the problem based on competitive analysis theory, we derive its constant competitive ratio , which is optimal under certain conditions, showing the robust performance of the algorithm. We further indicate that, when applying other price-dependent demand models or considering the impact of reference prices on the current demand, the adjusted algorithm ALG-IR-M retains all the theoretical properties. When considering the holding cost of inventory, a similar algorithm ALG-IR-H is proposed to solve the problem.

  abstract     = {The controllable processing times (CPTs) have many practical applications, enabling the length of the job processing to vary within an interval flexibly with additional costs. In this paper, we study an unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem with machine- and sequence-dependent setup times and a special case of CPTs without extra costs. The objective is to maximize the difference between the sum of realized state of processing of all jobs and makespan. To solve the problem, a mixed integer programming (MIP) model is formulated first and then a logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD) method is developed, in which the master problem is for job assignments and the subproblem is furthered decomposed into a sequencing problem for minimum total setup times on each machine and a processing time determination problem. Several LBBD-based heuristics are also employed by imposing different optimality gaps for the master problem. The performance of the MIP formulation, the exact LBBD method and the LBBD-based heuristics is compared through extensive computational experiments. The results demonstrate that the exact LBBD method with the preprocessing procedure which generates initial feasible solutions and cuts is effective and the proposed LBBD-based heuristics reduce the computation time significantly at the expense of slightly solution quality reduction.},

  abstract     = {The capacitated vehicle routing problem is a much studied combinatorial optimization problem , reflecting its practical importance within areas such as logistics. The problem is computationally intractable, and heuristics are commonly applied for solving large instances. Among the best heuristics available is a hybrid genetic search that consists of mechanisms from evolutionary algorithms and a range of local search operators. This heuristic applies an order crossover operator that takes as input two existing solutions and produces as output a new solution for the search to explore. An open-source implementation of the heuristic is available, in which the order crossover operator represents 1.4\% of the code. This work discusses potential short-comings of the traditional order crossover operator and proposes an adjusted operator. The new operator is evaluated on standard benchmark test instances, and is shown to reduce the gaps to best-known solutions by 4.2\%.},

  abstract     = {Choice-based optimization problems are the family of optimization problems that incorporate the stochasticity of individual preferences according to discrete choice models to make planning decisions. This integration brings non-convexity and nonlinearity to the associated mathematical formulations. Previously, the authors have tackled these issues by introducing a simulation-based approximation of the choice model with the aim of linearizing it. Nevertheless, already existing exact methods and state-of-the-art commercial solvers fail to solve relevant instances. In this paper, we propose a novel Lagrangian decomposition method inspired by scenario decomposition and scenario grouping in the stochastic programming framework for the purpose of solving choice-based optimization problems. In addition, we develop a tailored algorithm to generate feasible solutions to the original problem from the solution of the Lagrangian subproblem . Hence, at each iteration of the subgradient method, which is used to solve the Lagrangian dual, we provide both an upper and a lower bound to the original problem. This enables the calculation of the duality gap to assess the quality of the generated solutions. Computational results show that the decomposition method provides solutions with optimality gaps below 0.5\% and restricted duality gaps within low computational times. We also show that scenario grouping leads to high-quality feasible solutions and lower duality gaps.},

Most of them continuously work to improve the use of mega-vessels and form alliances to lower their operation costs and enhance their service network. International liners run long-haul services and fill their vessel slots with shipments from multiple trade lanes, chosen on the basis of shipment yields and empty repositioning from the perspective of local, regional and global slot planning operations. Here, a novel model for multi-echelon slot allocation was developed that accounts for the dynamics among local, regional-hub and global scales in terms of container loading and discharge at various vessels in multiple ports. A two-stage optimisation was proposed to improve usage and yield via slot exchange amongst liner companies in an alliance and cargo shifting amongst multiple trade lanes and service loops. Four optimisation methods for the three-echelon slot allocation were developed based on branch-and-bound search, genetic algorithm and deep neural network theories. The simulation results and model sensitivity of the developed algorithms were evaluated. Single-, two- and multiple-service routes with cargo shifting cases were simulated and analysed. The developed slot allocation model will assist trade and traffic planners in various echelons to coordinate and maximise slot usage and yield and ensure that cargo dimensions and weight fall within the cargo payload capacity and verified gross mass requirements, which further prevent vessel damage, excessive fuel usage and the unnecessary emission of greenhouse gases.},

We present an integer programming model for this problem, which is denoted by Italian High School Timetabling Problem (IHSTP). However, requirements (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) cannot be expressed according to the current XHSTT standard. Since the IHSTP model is very hard to solve by an off-the-shelf solver, we present a two-step optimization method: the first step optimally assigns teachers to lesson times and the second step assigns classes to teachers. An extensive experimentation is performed on the model by realistic and real instances from Italian schools, as well as benchmark instances from the literature. Finally, the experiments show that the method is effective in solving both this new problem and the simplified problem without the new requirements.},

We address the complex problem of optimizing decisions in a multi-period one-warehouse multi-retailer inventory system with stochastic continuous demand and an option of delayed distributions. At the beginning of each period, the DM determines each retailer’s target stock levels, as well as the number of items to be held back at a central location for later distribution(s). Such a policy offers partial inventory pooling through the holdback quantity. The decisions in each period are data-driven, i.e., made based on sales data available through an information system up to that point in time. We model the problem as a multi-stage stochastic program with recourse. For the general case, we develop a new recursive solution algorithm, which is based on subgradient optimization and an analysis of system dynamics. For the special case of two identical retailers and two periods, we provide explicit optimality conditions based on the subgradients. Using a large numerical study , we evaluate the performance of our proposed policy and compare it to two benchmark policies. We also demonstrate the impact of various problem parameters on the optimal solution and objective value.},

The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) and solved within an outer approximation (OA) framework where the primal and master problems are solved iteratively. In order to solve the computationally expensive master problem, which is a mixed-integer program (MIP), four different rolling horizon-based heuristics are developed. The efficiency of the proposed heuristic algorithms is benchmarked against the existing methods in the literature to solve the PRP-PD for both linear and nonlinear demand functions. Our results show that by adopting proper freezing and simplification strategies, the rolling horizon-based heuristic can solve the large problem instances significantly faster than the existing methods in the literature, with little to no reduction in solution quality. For large problem instances with linear demand functions, the proposed heuristic provides solutions within 1.5–3 min. The quality of these solutions deviates at most 3.5\% from the solutions provided by the existing exact methods, which take more than 2 h. Our solutions are also higher in quality compared to the near-optimal solutions provided in the literature, and they are achieved with a 90\% reduction in computational time. With nonlinear demand functions, one-third of the instances require more than 2 h to be solved by the exact methods in the literature, while they are solved within 0.5–3.5 min using our heuristic, with less than 2\% deviation in solution quality.},

The long timespan of these treatment routes leads to several patients’ complaints and results in negative effects. However, scheduling the treatment routes for patients is a complex task for hospital managers. This study investigates a rehabilitation patient scheduling and routing problem , which focuses on reducing the timespan of patients’ treatment routes. This real-life motivated problem can be described as a combination of several interrelated traveling salesman problems with time windows (TSPTWs) and is difficult to solve. We formulate the problem as an integer linear program (ILP) and we develop a greedy heuristic called “route-first, schedule-second”. Then a column generation solution method is proposed on a set partitioning-based reformulation of the original model. Specifically, a tailored genetic algorithm and several effective accelerating strategies are developed within the column generation method. Numerical experiments are conducted on 30 instances devised from real data to validate the efficiency of the proposed solution approaches. Experimental results show that our methodology can generate high-quality solutions efficiently and is therefore suitable to be applied in practice.},

Robust optimization , with both budget and ball uncertainty sets, is used when the demand rate is unknown, but the arrival pattern can still be reasonably approximated as a Poisson process. Furthermore, we use distributionally robust optimization with a Wasserstein ambiguity set to address the case when the demand distribution is estimated from a limited sample.

Crowdsourcing is a concept that has been gaining momentum over the last few years as a highly potential tool for improving disaster response. This paper defines a crowdsourced humanitarian relief vehicle routing problem and proposes a heuristic to generate good quality solutions in reasonable time. The algorithm is based on an Iterated Local Search (ILS) scheme. Extensive computational studies are done on randomly generated instances to gain insights on the performance of the heuristic and on the impact of the problem features on solution quality. In addition, instances mimicking the shape of real cities are generated and results are analyzed.},

  abstract     = {Hyper-heuristics (HH) emerged as more generalized and robust solutions for combinatorial optimization , being successfully addressed to solve several real-world problems. Implemented within an association of MOEA/DD and Differential Evolution, four selection hyper-heuristics (high-level heuristics) are studied in this work: Thompson Sampling, Probability Matching, Adaptive Pursuit and Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution. In the proposal, low-level heuristics rely on crossover performed by operators taken from a candidate pool. The HH selection is based on operators’ previous performance during the evolutionary process, using a warm-up phase necessary to provide proper information regarding the most efficient operators. A discard mechanism is also considered to eliminate from the pool operators with similar performance. To evaluate the proposed approach, Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) instances are considered with 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 objectives, totaling 148 instances with different dimensions and correlations between the flow matrices. Statistical tests indicate that the best version of the proposed approach, named HHMOEA/DD, outperforms those with fixed crossover operator and different literature approaches. In addition, the experiments indicate results’ improvement by the joined inclusion of the warm-up and operator discard mechanisms.},

The incentives influence the capacities of the spoke links, which in turn affect the hub selections and flow assignment. A mixed integer convex programming model is developed to optimize the proposed HS network. The model minimizes total transport cost by locating p hubs, routing flows between origin–destination (OD) pairs and determining the incentives on spoke links. A customized outer-approximation algorithm is presented to provide exact solutions to the developed model, which is difficult to solve optimally within acceptable computational times for large-scale instances. An approximation algorithm based on the stepwise linearization method is then developed to provide suboptimal solutions. The developed model and algorithms are validated in computational experiments with different problem scales. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed HS network tends to route the flows on more spoke links, balance the transport costs on the potential paths between OD pairs and serve more demands with lower transport costs, when compared with the HS network with fixed capacities.},

However, existing studies for disassembly line balancing have not simultaneously considered multiple EOL products, the identical parts of these products and uncertainty during disassembly, which are important characteristics of flexible disassembly lines. The present study addresses a new flexible multi-product disassembly line balancing problem in which (1) disassembly schemes need to be selected, (2) a workstation can disassemble multiple EOL products, (3) identical parts of multiple products can be treated as identical tasks, and (4) only partial probability distribution information of processing times is known. For the problem, an integrated approach is developed, which is composed of a chance-constrained program, a distribution-free model, efficient valid inequalities and an exact lifted cut-and-solve method. Numerical experiments are conducted on an illustrative example, 10 instances based on realistic products and 480 randomly generated instances with up to 20 products, 400 tasks and 86 workstations. Computational results show that the proposed valid inequalities can reduce about 75\% computational time of the original model, and the lifted cut-and-solve method needs only 17.53\% and 40.65\% of the computational times required by the CPLEX and the classic cut-and-solve method, respectively.},

  abstract     = {This study develops intelligent inventory management (IIM) approaches for managing perishable pharmaceutical products in a healthcare supply chain consisting of multiple regional hospitals and a central warehouse. The purchase price of the product is assumed to be age dependent, and the age distribution of the product is assumed to be known and is shared among all the supply chain members. Each agent representing a regional hospital or the central warehouse in the supply chain replenishes its stocks from its upstream agent. In IIM approaches, reinforcement learning methods, specifically Q-learning and Deep Q-network, are used to construct inventory policies. The IIM policies provide hospitals with near-optimal order quantities and remaining life distributions for products they order. Through many test instances, the performance of the IIM policies is compared to that of periodic review ( R , s , S ) (R,s,S) policies obtained through a stochastic mixed integer programming model, solved using CPLEX and a genetic algorithm. The computational results demonstrate that the IIM policies are more cost-effective than the R , s , S R,s,S policies, although the genetic algorithm has a speed advantage. Moreover, as compared with the R , s , S R,s,S polices, the IIM polices have a lower possibility of product shortage, and thereby a higher service level for the patients, and a lower risk of product expiration. By implementing the IIM approaches, a healthcare system may also save storage space, in addition to having a lower total inventory cost. Sensitivity analyses are performed to derive managerial insights on the performance of the policies when the values of the key cost parameters change.},

In recent years, the use of background knowledge to improve the cluster quality and promote interpretability of the clustering process has become a hot research topic at the intersection of mathematical optimization and machine learning research. The problem of taking advantage of background information in data clustering is called semi-supervised or constrained clustering. In this paper, we present branch-and-cut algorithm for semi-supervised MSSC, where background knowledge is incorporated as pairwise must-link and cannot-link constraints. For the lower bound procedure, we solve the semidefinite programming relaxation of the MSSC discrete optimization model, and we use a cutting-plane procedure for strengthening the bound. For the upper bound, instead, by using integer programming tools, we use an adaptation of the k k -means algorithm to the constrained case. For the first time, the proposed global optimization algorithm efficiently manages to solve real-world instances up to 800 data points with different combinations of must-link and cannot-link constraints and with a generic number of features. This problem size is about four times larger than the one of the instances solved by state-of-the-art exact algorithms.},

The anticipatory policies reported in the literature are typically unsuitable for the large instances often encountered in the real-world, where the inter-arrival time can be as little as a few seconds. In this article, we present a new scalable anticipatory policy for the Dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem which amounts to design routes for a fleet of vehicles that must service a set of pickup and delivery requests, characterized by different priority classes, arriving according to an unknown (possibly time-varying) stochastic process . The algorithm utilizes a parametric policy function approximation in which the best parameter setting is chosen on-line on the basis of a mapping between instance features and policy parameters learned off-line by using simulation experiments. Computational results on large-scale randomly-generated instances indicate that our anticipatory procedure outperforms two reactive approaches while keeping the computational burden at a level suitable for real-world usage.},

  abstract     = {The real-time on-demand bus routing problem (ODBRP) supports the online routing of buses in a large-scale ride-sharing system. Given are a set of buses with fixed capacity, a set of bus stations and a set of transportation requests, only part of which are known before the planning horizon. A request consists of a set of possible departure and arrival stations, as well as an earliest departure and latest arrival time. The aim is to (1) assign each passenger to a departure and arrival bus station and (2) develop a set of bus routes to fulfill each request within its time window while minimizing the sum of the total waiting time and the total user ride time. Including the possibility for requests to be issued after the start of the planning horizon, i.e., when buses have already started servicing other requests, requires a dynamic re-optimization of a partially executed solution. Compared to the case in which all requests are known beforehand, the solution quality, expressed as the total waiting and user ride time, is expected to decline. This decline in objective function value can be seen as the “cost” of the dynamic requests. In this paper, we introduce the real-time ODBRP as an extension of its static problem variant and present a heuristic to deal with dynamic requests. In addition, an extensive set of experiments allows us to conclude that dynamic requests indeed lead to higher waiting and user ride times, especially for passengers who submit their request at the last minute. Passengers are therefore encouraged, if possible, to send their request well in advance, as this results in lower and more stable service promises, higher customer satisfaction, and higher revenues for the operating on-demand bus company.},

  abstract     = {While finding a path between two nodes is the basis for several applications, the need for alternative paths also may have various motivations. For instance, it can be of interest to ensure reliability in a telecommunications network , to reduce the consequences of possible accidents in the transportation of hazardous materials or to decrease the risk of robberies in money distribution. All these applications involve the search for a set of paths that are as dissimilar as possible, with respect to the arcs in them. In this work, we present linear integer programming formulations that intend to find K K dissimilar paths. The new models derive from a straightforward single-commodity flow formulation of the K K paths problem, to which extra constraints are added to account for the concept of dissimilarity. In particular, in each formulation a different measure of the similarity between the K K paths is minimized: the number of repeated arcs, the number of arc reuses and the number of pairwise arc overlaps. The third measure originates a non-linear model that is linearized through a discretized model reformulation technique. These formulations are complemented by a polynomial algorithm that allows to extract K K loopless paths from the solutions output by each of them. The formulations are tested for random and grid networks with respect to the solutions’ average and minimum dissimilarity and the run time. Two of them stand out in terms of both those measures, when compared to an iterative approach from the literature. The best one regarding the average dissimilarity finds 20 paths with average dissimilarity of 99.5\% in about 168 s for random networks of 5 000 nodes and 100 000 arcs. The same approach finds 20 paths for grid instances of size 100 × 100 in less than 18 s. The other formulation requires about 11 s for the same random instances, with a 0.7\% deviation from the best known average dissimilarity; while it requires less than 7 s to compute 20 paths in 100 × 100 grids with a 0.6\% deviation to the optimal dissimilarity.},

The problem is modeled as a time-dependent profitable dial-a-ride problem (TD-PDARP) with a single-vehicle using a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. We propose a tailored feasibility evaluation procedure to handle the complicated maximum ride-time constraint under the time-dependent travel time model, which is then embedded in a hybrid algorithm to solve the proposed problem. This hybrid algorithm leverages an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) for large-scale exploration together with local search (LS) techniques to exploit local regions comprehensively. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm on newly generated TD-PDARP instances. The experiments show that our ALNS-LS algorithm can solve large instances that cannot be solved by commercial solvers in a reasonable time. Furthermore, for all instances that can be solved by the solver within 12 h, our proposed heuristic algorithm is able to obtain the optimal solutions and takes only 1.03\% of the average run time required by the solver.},

  abstract     = {The scheduling and location (ScheLoc) problem is a new and important research topic with a wide range of practical applications. It jointly optimizes machine locations, job assignments, and sequence decisions to yield a globally optimal solution . Current studies on the ScheLoc problem are limited, and most have focused on makespan minimization. This paper investigates a new variant of the parallel-machine ScheLoc problem with job delivery time and due date considerations. This is motivated by practical situations where jobs must be transported back to their original locations upon completion of processing, and a specific due date is associated with each job. The objective is to minimize the total weighted sum of location, transportation, and tardiness penalty costs incurred if a job is delivered after its due date. We propose three models adapted from classic ones for scheduling problems. We then develop an exact logic-based Benders decomposition method, which decomposes the problem into a master problem (MP) for determining machine locations and job assignments, and a subproblem (SP) for determining job sequences on each machine. The MP is augmented by dynamically adding optimality cuts generated by solving the SP. We also develop a matheuristic (MH) and its variant to achieve near-optimal solutions. An approximate model with predetermined job processing sequences on each machine is formulated and solved to determine the machine locations and job assignments. The obtained solutions are further improved by solving a series of single-machine scheduling problems. The variant combines a kernel search framework to make MH more efficient. Computational experiments on 720 randomly generated instances show the effectiveness and efficiency of both the exact and matheuristic methods.},

The MCARP is known to be NP-hard. The proposed methodology uses: i) a GIS (geographic information system), for input/output and to reduce problem dimensions; ii) a matheuristic that iteratively solves a new hybrid model; and iii) two versions of a two-phase matheuristic. The latter pursues the generation of connected and compacted trips. During the first phase, called initial assignment, some links requiring service are assigned to vehicle services. In the second phase, the hybrid model finishes the assignment and generates a feasible set of trips. The quality of the generated solutions is assessed through the total time, as well as by some attractiveness measures. These measures evaluate the adequacy of the solutions for the real case-study, a crucial aspect for trips that need to be accepted by practitioners. With this purpose, a new attractiveness measure that introduces space dependent penalisation of overlaps, named weighted hull overlap, is also proposed. Computational results with 18 Seixal instances, with 265–1223 nodes and 492–2254 links, point to the good performance of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {Dial-a-ride problems aim to design the least-costly door-to-door vehicle routes for transporting individual users, subject to several service constraints like time windows, service and route durations, and ride-time. In some cases, providers cannot meet the demand and may outsource some requests. In this paper, we introduce, model, and solve the dial-a-ride problem with private fleet and common carrier (DARP-PFCC) that makes it possible to transfer the demand unmet by the provider to mobility-on-demand services and taxis. All outsourced vehicles are assumed to be available at any instant of the day and have unlimited capacity, enabling to satisfy all user requests, particularly during peak times. We implement a branch-and-cut (B&amp;C) algorithm based on an exact method from the literature to solve the DARP-PFCC, and we develop a near parameter-free parallel metaheuristic to handle large instances. Our metaheuristic combines the Biased Random-key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA) and the Q Q -learning (QL) method into the same framework (BRKGA-QL), in which an agent helps to use feedback information to dynamically choose the parameters of BRKGA during the search to select the most appropriate configuration to solve a specific problem instance. Both algorithms are flexible enough to solve the classical DARP, and extensive computational experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our methods. For the DARP instances, the B&amp;C proved optimality for 41 of the 42 instances tested in a reasonable computational time, and the BRKGA-QL found the best-known solution for these instances within a matter of seconds. These results indicate that our metaheuristic performs equally well than state-of-the-art DARP algorithms. In the DARP-PFCC experiments on a set of 504 small-size instances, B&amp;C proved optimality for 497 instances, while BRKGA-QL found 452 optimal solutions, totaling 90.94\% of the instances solved to optimality. Finally, we present the results for a real case study for the DARP-PFCC, where BRKGA-QL solved very large problem instances containing up to 713 transportation requests. We also derive some managerial analyses to assess the effects of vehicle capacity reduction, for example due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on shared transportation. The results point to the benefits of combining the private fleet and common carriers in dial-a-ride problems, both for the provider and for the users.},

Traditional classification algorithms assume that the training data points are always known exactly. However, real-life data are often subject to noise. To handle such uncertainty, we formulate robust models with uncertainty sets in the form of hyperrectangles or hyperellipsoids, and propose a moment-based distributionally robust optimization model enforcing limits on first-order deviations along principal directions. All the formulations reduce to convex programs . The efficiency of the new classifiers is evaluated on real-world databases. Experiments show that robust classifiers are especially beneficial for data sets with a small number of observations. As the dimension of the data sets increases, features behavior is gradually learned and higher levels of out-of-sample accuracy can be achieved via the considered distributionally robust optimization method. The proposed formulations, overall, allow finding a trade-off between increasing the average performance accuracy and protecting against uncertainty, with respect to deterministic approaches .},

Each worker drives a vehicle and so the task allocation problem is often solved as a vehicle routing problem . However, unlike delivery services, the workers spend the majority of their time working on the service tasks leaving the vehicles idle. This creates a possibility of sharing vehicles among the workers to save vehicles used and reduce the total carbon emissions. This paper studies this new problem of vehicle sharing and task allocation. Given the team of workers and a set of customer tasks with their locations and time requirements, decisions need to be made on the scheduling of workers to tasks, workers sharing each vehicle and the routing of the vehicles. We first formulate the problem as an integer programming model. To solve larger problem instances, a three-phase heuristic algorithm is then developed. Computational experiments are carried out to demonstrate the benefits of sharing vehicles. The effects of problem parameters on the solution are also investigated.},

Constructive heuristics are known to be the most intuitive and fastest methods for finding good feasible solutions for the CLSPs and therefore are often used as a subroutine in building more sophisticated exact or metaheuristic approaches. Classical constructive heuristics, such as period-by-period heuristics and lot elimination heuristics, are widely used by researchers. This paper introduces four perturbation strategies to the period-by-period and lot elimination heuristics to further improve the solution quality. We propose a new procedure to automatically adjust the parameters of the randomized period-by-period (RPP) heuristics. The procedure is proved to offer better solutions with reduced computation times by improving time-consuming parameter tuning phase . Combinations of the self-adaptive RPP heuristics with Tabu search and lot elimination heuristics are tested to be effective. Computational experiments provided high-quality solutions with a 0.88\% average optimality gap on benchmark instances of 12 periods and 12 items, and an optimality gap within 1.2\% for the instances with 24 periods and 24 items.},

As a typical category of data scarcity, small sample with high dimensionality often leads to the failure to build an effective credit risk assessment model. To solve this issue, a Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGAN)-based data augmentation and hybrid feature selection method is proposed for small sample credit risk assessment with high dimensionality. In this methodology, WGAN is first used to produce the virtual samples to overcome the data instance scarcity issue, and then a kernel partial least square with quantum particle swarm optimization (KPLS-QPSO) algorithm is proposed to solve the high-dimensionality issue. For verification purposes, two small sample credit datasets with high dimensionality are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Empirical results indicate that the proposed methodology can significantly improve the prediction performance and avoid possible economic losses in credit risk assessment. This implies that the proposed methodology is a competitive approach to small sample credit risk assessment with high dimensionality.},

Specifically, elective surgeries can be scheduled weeks or months in advance. In contrast, an emergency surgery arrives randomly and must be performed on the day of arrival. Probability distributions of the actual durations of elective and emergency surgeries are unknown, and only a possibly small set of historical realizations may be available. To address distributional uncertainty, we first construct an ambiguity set that encompasses all possible distributions of surgery durations within a 1-Wasserstein distance from the empirical distribution. We then define a d istributionally r obust s urgery a ssignment (DSA) problem to determine optimal elective surgery assignment decisions to available surgical blocks in multiple ORs, considering the capacity needed for emergency cases. The objective is to minimize the total cost consisting of the fixed cost related to scheduling or rejecting elective surgery plus the maximum expected cost associated with OR overtime and idle time over all distributions defined in the ambiguity set. Using the DSA model’s structural properties, we derive an equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) reformulation that can be implemented and solved efficiently using off-the-shelf optimization software. In addition, we extend the proposed model to determine the number of ORs needed to serve the two competing surgery classes and derive a MILP reformulation of this extension. We conduct extensive numerical experiments based on real-world surgery data, demonstrating our proposed model’s computational efficiency and superior out-of-sample operational performance over two state-of-the-art approaches.

Given the scale of the research phenomena in terms of the data volumes and geospatial extent, it is surprising that current processes still require much human intervention. The lack of automation and large scale data processing remains a challenge to routine decision support and more flexible research application. The work reported here contributes towards both these aspects. Through the use of a configurable, large-scale evolutionary algorithm , applying an expert-provided gold standard measure of expected clustering behaviour, a near-optimal clustering configuration is achieved while avoiding over-fitting. The optimisation workflow provides improved automation for repeatable and reproducible results. The workflow is even adaptable to clustering experiments with different optimisation configurations.},

  abstract     = {The general lack of first/last mile connectivity is one of the main challenges encountered by intercity transport systems. New transportation alternatives called flexible transit systems, which combine on-demand service adjustment capabilities to the regular route and master schedule characteristics of the conventional transit, are therefore increasingly proposed. Feeder transit services can run as one type of flexible transit services, connecting a service area to a major intercity transport network through a transfer hub. Considering the unstable and constantly changing characteristics of daily passenger demand, a dynamic scheduling methodology for feeder transit services is proposed to minimize passenger crowding in vehicles. Deviations in the base route are allowed for accommodating optional requests or visiting potential transfer locations, which further offer a new type of flexible scheduling operation called synchronized passenger transfer. Operators can dynamically expand the spatial coverage of vehicles out of their regular routes to meet each other at appointed locations and times. Then, passengers can transfer between vehicles to minimize or even avoid passenger crowding. In this study, a multi-commodity network flow optimization model with side constraints in a three-dimensional space–time–state network is proposed for this type of dynamic scheduling problem. Additionally, a coordinate descent-based solution framework consisting of three steps (augmentation, decomposition, and linearization) is developed. The proposed model and solution approach are investigated using an eight-node simple network and the Sioux-Falls network, and the Chicago sketch network was adopted to demonstrate the practicability of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Pre-runtime scheduling of large-scale electronic systems, as those in modern aircraft, can be computationally challenging. In this paper, we study a distributed integrated modular avionic system of practical relevance where the scheduling includes to assign communication messages to time slots and to sequence tasks on modules. For this problem, the challenge is the huge number of tasks to be scheduled and the intricate interaction between the communication and task scheduling . We present a method based on Logic-Based Benders Decomposition (LBBD) to solve this problem. In a master problem, formulated as a mixed-integer program, communication messages are assigned to time slots and in a subproblem , formulated as a constraint program, tasks are scheduled. Our LBBD scheme is accelerated by using cut strengthening, a subproblem relaxation, and components for preprocessing and initialisation of the scheme. The cut strengthening is of the kind that systematically investigates subsets of variables to include in the cut by solving additional subproblems. To further enhance the efficiency of the scheme, we propose a new strategy that extends cut strengthening to also try to construct feasible solutions by using information from solving the additional subproblems. Our computational evaluation is based on publicly available instances with up to 2530 messages and 54,731 tasks. It shows that our method outperforms previous methods for the problem with respect to both solution times and RAM usage. A further evaluation of the different components in the method shows that our new acceleration strategy is important to achieve these results.},

These recycling processes include the dismantling of the products using the disassembly lines. Disassembly line balancing problems contribute to these processes by ensuring that products are disassembled efficiently and at minimum cost. Therefore, these problems have started to attract more attention in the literature. This study considers the disassembly line balancing problem, with sequence-dependent setup time and complex AND/OR precedence relations between tasks. The managerial impacts highlighted by the proposed problem are of great importance both from environmental and industrial sustainability due to the recycling process of the life-threatening wastes. The study aims to disassemble the products using a minimum number of workstations. Mixed-integer linear programming and constraint programming models have been developed for the considered problem in question. As far as is known, the sequence-dependent disassembly line balancing problem, which has complex precedence relations, has not been studied in the literature before, and the constraint programming model developed is also novel. The study also compares the constraint programming model with/without an initial solution. In addition, a simulated annealing metaheuristic is proposed to solve the problem, and its results are compared with the results of the models. Setup times were generated for well-known instances obtained from the literature. The results obtained using these instances showed that the constraint programming model successfully solved the problem under consideration.},

  abstract     = {The recent Covid-19 outbreak put healthcare resources under enormous pressure. Governments and healthcare authorities faced major challenges in securing and delivering critical supplies such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and test kits. As timely distribution of critical supplies exceeded government resources, certain sectors, negatively impacted by the pandemic, offered their storage and distribution capabilities; both helping with the crisis and creating economic revenue. We investigate the problem of optimally leveraging the capacity and efficiency of underutilized distribution networks to enhance the capability of government supply networks to meet healthcare needs for critical supplies. We model the problem as a dynamic distribution planning problem that decides on the re-purposing of storage facilities, the allocation of demand, and the timely distribution of limited PPE supplies to different jurisdictions. From a resource provider’s perspective, the goal is to maximize demand fulfillment based on priorities set out by the government, as well as maximize economic value to participating networks. As uncertainty is a prevalent feature of the problem, we adopt a robust framework due to the lack of historical data on such supply uncertainties. We provide a mixed integer programming formulation for the adversarial problem and present a cutting plane algorithm to solve the robust model efficiently under both polyhedral and ellipsoidal uncertainty sets. We build a case study for the province of Ontario, Canada, and run extensive analysis of the service and economic value trade-off, and the effects of modeling demand priorities and supply uncertainties.},

The aim of the research is to construct a multi-objective mathematical model of emergency supplies distribution for large cities in case of an epidemic outbreak. Based on the multi-verse optimization algorithm and the differential evolution algorithm , a hybrid multi-verse optimizer algorithm based on differential evolution (DE-IMOV) is proposed. A simulation experiment is then carried out to verify the model. The calculation results show that the developed algorithm can effectively reduce the distribution cost and improve the full load rate of vehicles on the basis of considering the urgency of emergency supplies demand, which provides a solution for the optimization of heterogeneous vehicle distribution paths for urban emergency supplies in response to epidemic outbreaks.},

  abstract     = {We study a single trade ship routing and scheduling problem for a roll-on roll-off shipping company . Along the given trade, there is a number of contracts for transportation of cargoes between port pairs. Each contract states a minimum service frequency where the services should be evenly separated in time and possibly transit time requirements. Current planning practice is to visit all ports along the trade every time it is serviced. Here, we aim instead at determining the sailing route and schedule of each voyage along the trade, i.e., which ports to visit when, which contracts to serve, and the sailing speeds, so that all contract requirements are satisfied at minimum cost. To solve this problem, we have developed a three-phase MIP-based heuristic, where each phase consists of solving dedicated a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model. The heuristic constructs solutions by first identifying the most promising candidate routes along the trade. Next, a candidate route is allocated to each available vessel. Finally, the heuristic determines the allocation of cargoes between the vessels, as well as sailing speeds and arrival times. Computational tests show that the heuristic outperforms a commercial MIP-solver and provides high-quality solutions to realistically sized instances in reasonable time.},

Firstly, the upper model is constructed minimize the movable link lengths of the target vehicle, the path risk of rescue vehicles according to robust optimization theory. Secondly, the lower model is formed by the user equilibrium (UE) model for traffic assignment problems by using mutual and positioning information. Thirdly, the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA Ⅱ), the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, and the method of two-stage coding are comprehensively applied in this paper for the NP-hard problem of the MMR model. Finally, the mutual information and O-D flows of links on the 4th Ring Road of Beijing are utilized to examine the MMR model, and analyzed the utility of the hybrid algorithm and the MMR model. The experimental result indicates that when the robust control parameters are set to 0, 30, and 60, then 3, 2, and 3 groups of the MMR schemes with different sensitivity to the uncertain environment can be obtained. The algorithm utility analysis results indicate that the hybrid algorithm with intimacy calculation can significantly enhance the convergence of the algorithm. Compared with the traditional convex hull algorithm, the model utility analysis results indicate that, in addition to effectively making up for the application defects of the traditional algorithm, the MMR model adopts the mutual rescue strategy that is superior to the traditional algorithm in the Target encirclement nodes selection of target vehicle, the paths planning of rescue vehicles, the collaborative scheduling of ride-hailing platform, and can well complete the mutual rescue task under an uncertain environment for driver-hijacking-passengers event.},

The goal is to find the location and attractiveness of each facility going to be established by the leader who seeks to maximize its profit while also taking the follower’s response into account. The attractiveness of each facility is a function of integer variables related to the facility’s characteristics. Customer behavior is considered to be probabilistic based on the Huff gravity-based rule. To globally optimize the model, a procedure that handles the discrete decisions of the follower’s problem is proposed. Afterward, by replacing the inner level convex program with its corresponding Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions, the bi-level MINLP is converted into a single-level MINLP model, optimized by an improved branch-and-refine algorithm. Numerical experiments on randomly generated instances are conducted to illustrate the model’s applicability. Moreover, through a computational analysis of the proposed model, the amount of gain the leader makes and the follower loses due to foresight in the competition are calculated.},

  abstract     = {We propose a revision of the classical column generation algorithm for solving Dantzig–Wolfe decompositions of mixed integer programs . It is meant to fully exploit the availability of distributed computing resources, making optimization algorithms in general purpose solvers to scale better. The main idea is to trigger massive parallelism by fully decoupling the computing flow of each component, including the resolution of the master problem, thus allowing different pricing algorithms to concurrently work on different sets of dual variables, and the master algorithm to asynchronously update dual information as soon as new columns are available. Our algorithms ensure the same optimality convergency properties of the classical method. Experiments on mixed integer programs for three benchmark problems from the combinatorial optimization literature prove our approach to be one order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art general purpose solvers in computing high quality root node dual bounds. Even if devised to exploit clusters of machines which do not share memory space, our algorithms show to be faster than earlier attempts from the literature also when run on virtual machines hosted on a single physical one, proving this improvement to derive from our algorithmic methodology rather than technological factors.},

  abstract     = {Since the 1960s, several approaches have been proposed to prevent the redrawing of electoral districts so that they are beneficial to a particular party or political faction (gerrymandering). In order to avoid gerrymandering, most approaches focus solely on redrawing electoral maps that try to maximize the compactness of the electoral districts. However, this problem is computationally hard, and several criteria must be satisfied when drawing electoral maps. In this work we focus on drawing electoral districts for Portugal. For that, a new compact Boolean formulation is proposed for solving the electoral districting problem. This formulation satisfies all standard criteria for building electoral maps, particularly the contiguity and representation criteria. Moreover, a new compactness measure is also proposed that does not depend on geographic centers. Additionally, a heuristic formulation is also devised for problem instances where the optimum values are hard to find. The new compactness measure and formulations are applied in the context of Portuguese parliament elections, assuming a change in the Portuguese electoral system. Experimental results on drawing electoral maps show that the proposed formulations are more effective than previous ones in drawing the electoral districts in the Portuguese context. Moreover, based on results from the last elections, gerrymandering scenarios are devised, showing that electoral outcomes can change depending on the drawing of the electoral maps.},

The present work focuses on deploying a network function virtualization based architecture to secure a network against an on-going DDoS attack. We assume that the target, sources and volume of the attack have been identified. However, due to 5G network slicing, the exact routing of the illegitimate flow in the network is not known by the internet service provider. We seek to determine the optimal number and locations of virtual network functions in order to remove all the illegitimate traffic while minimizing the total cost of the activated virtual network functions. We propose a robust optimization framework to solve this problem. The uncertain input parameters correspond to the amount of illegitimate flow on each path connecting an attack source to the target and can take values within a predefined uncertainty set. In order to solve this robust optimization problem, we develop an adversarial approach in which the adversarial sub-problem is solved by a Branch &amp; Price algorithm . The results of our computational experiments, carried out on medium-size randomly generated instances , show that the proposed solution approach is able to provide optimal solutions within short computation times.},

  abstract     = {Multistage-stochastic programming (MSSP) problems under both endogenous and exogenous uncertainties with gradual realization have been gaining attention in the literature, particularly, in chemical engineering applications. Recently several approaches have been introduced to generate the minimum cardinality non-anticipativity constraint (NAC) set for stochastic programs with various scenario set structures. However, they have been limited to uncertain parameters where the realizations occur instantaneously or the full set of scenarios is required, and may require reformulating the problem. This paper proposes an algorithm for generating a minimum cardinality set of NACs for MSSP problems under both endogenous and exogenous uncertainties with gradual realization without the need for (often non-trivial) reformulations. In addition, a heuristic version of this algorithm, which does not guarantee minimum NAC set, but allows for an efficient decomposable implementation, is developed. A thorough computational study demonstrates the benefit of reducing the NAC set, and compares the case of minimum vs near-minimum NAC sets, which has not been widely studied before.},

However, solving the MVRPSD through traditional methods, such as a priori optimization or rollout-algorithm-based dynamic programming is generally limited by the issues of computation efficiency and solution quality. Under increasing demand for efficient real-time logistics, we propose a novel offline approximate value iteration (OAVI) algorithm for dynamic solutions to the MVRPSD. Our algorithm benefits from offline training and thus can provide fast and effective online dynamic routing solutions. Adopting such a novel and effective algorithm presents two challenges: first, we must define a proper cost structure for the dynamic routing decision; second, we must efficiently address the curse of dimensionality of the multivehicle problem. To solve these problems, we first describe the cost structure through the value function approximation (VFA) with basis functions involving a priori cost and a priori credibility; we then design two strategies, recourse reduction (RR) and neighborhood reduction (NR), to prune the action space. The numerical experiments show that our algorithm can substantially enhance computation efficiency and solution quality compared to traditional methods.},

These variants determine the respective depot locations from which customers are supplied, i.e., the two-echelon VRP (2E-VRP), the location routing problem (LRP), and the multi-depot VRP (MDVRP). Both the LRP and the MDVRP can be formulated as special cases of the 2E-VRP, so that all three problem classes can be readily solved via a single solution approach. We develop such a unified solution approach for all three problem classes based on the recently proposed hybrid adaptive large neighborhood search (HALNS). The HALNS uses a population of solutions generated by an efficient ALNS. Individuals of this population are subject to a crossover and selection phase, using elements of genetic algorithms resulting in a hybrid heuristic. Computational experiments on several sets of instances from literature demonstrate the competitive performance of the HALNS. The HALNS outperforms all approaches for solving the 2E-VRP and is on par with heuristics that are dedicated either to the LRP or the MDVRP. Furthermore, the HALNS shows superior robustness, i.e., the variance of results from several runs is comparatively low. The HALNS especially outperforms all existing pure ALNS implementations on these problem classes, demonstrating the value of hybridization. Additionally, the HALNS finds three new best-known solutions for LRP instances.},

There are multiple trajectory alternatives between the target pairs with different travel time and threat attributes. A route plan involves the selection of the targets to visit, the order of visit to the targets, and the trajectories to follow between the targets. Multiple routing objectives, information collection, mission duration and mission safety, are considered to present the trade-offs among the objectives to the route planner. The problem is classified as a multi-objective orienteering problem with time-dependent prizes and multiple connection options. A mixed integer programming model that can be used for small-sized problems is formulated. Larger problems are addressed with a hybrid algorithm involving heuristics and exact approaches.

Furthermore, there is a limit in the maximum amount of the resource that can be consumed, so the problem serves to model either a constraint on the energy or raw material employed in the process, or on the maximum amount of pollutant that can be emitted. In contrast to the classical permutation flowshop scheduling problem, in the variant under study the processing times are controllable, there is an specific resource consumption, and each job has a due date. The objective function considered is the minimization of the total tardiness of the jobs. Given the NP-hard nature of this problem, we focus onto developing approximate solution procedures that can yield high-quality solutions with a reasonable CPU effort. More specifically, we develop a fast solution procedure to build an initial solution and two hybrid matheuristics based on mixed-integer linear programming formulations of the problem. The first one combines a relax-and-fix approach with the generation of heuristic cutting planes, while the second one relaxes some decision variables in the first stage and fixes other decision variables in the final stage. The computational experience carried out show that our proposals outperform the mathematical models as well as an approximate procedure proposed for a related problem.},

  abstract     = {The Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows, Piecewise-Linear Recharging and Capacitated Recharging Stations aims to design minimum-cost routes for a fleet of electric vehicles subject to intra-route and inter-route constraints. Every vehicle is equipped with a rechargeable battery that depletes while it transports goods along its route. A vehicle must detour to a recharging station to recharge before draining its battery. To approximate a real recharging process, the amount of energy restored is modeled as a piecewise-linear function of the time spent recharging. Furthermore, each station has a small number of chargers, and hence, when and where a vehicle can recharge must be scheduled around the availability of a charger. This interaction between vehicles does not appear in classical vehicle routing problems and motivates the development of new methods that can exploit the joint routing and scheduling structure. This paper proposes a branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm that designates the routing to integer programming using Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition and the scheduling to constraint programming using logic-based Benders decomposition . Experimental results indicate that this hybrid method solves 34\% of the instances with 100 customers.},

We present a mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the problem with the objective to maximize the overall profit, which can be solved to the optimum for instances with up to 50 rental orders by CPLEX within an hour. To deal with large-scale problems, we apply the Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition technique and propose an approach which hybridizes the ant colony optimization (ACO) metaheuristics into the column generation framework to quickly solve the pricing subproblems . The evaluation experiments using randomly generated instances of different scales have shown that, the proposed hybrid approach is both efficient and efficacious: (1) the gap between the solutions by the hybrid approach and the optimal solutions is below 5\% in average for small instances; (2) for large instances with over 100 rental orders, the overall performance of the hybrid approach is significantly better than those of CPLEX and ACO metaheuristics , with rather short time consumption. Furthermore, a case study is conducted based on practical transportation data of Beijing, using the net profit and order fulfillment rate as performance criteria.

These problems have been widely addressed from a single-objective point of view to look for a solution with the most profitable set of requests while respecting a set of constraints. Handling simultaneously profit maximization and travel cost minimization poses a challenging optimization task in this class of routing problems . We propose a two-phase framework based on the decomposition of the search space in several linearly aggregated sub-problems. The aggregated problems are first optimized by an efficient local search with dedicated removal and insertion operators. An update is then applied on the weights of the least efficient sub-problems. We show that the perturbation of these weighted sum problems enables the exploration of more regions of the search space, and thus ensures the diversification of the Pareto front approximation . The obtained results on the selective variants of the Pickup and Delivery Problem show the effectiveness of our algorithm based on solutions quality and computational time. The proposed algorithm strictly improves 36 best known solutions of the single-objective problem and achieves the best results on all the instances of the lexicographic variant. Its performance is also confirmed on the bi-objective variant since we obtain better Pareto front approximation in terms of hyper volume, set cover, and computational time indicators. We discuss the results and explain the positive contribution of each component based on statistical tests.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces the Territory Design for the Multi-Period Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (TD-MPVRPTW) problem, motivated by a real-world application at a food company’s distribution center. This problem deals with the design of contiguous and compact territories for delivery of orders from a depot to a set of customers, with time windows, over a multi-period planning horizon. Customers and their demands vary over time. The problem is modeled as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and solved by a proposed heuristic. The heuristic solutions are compared with the proposed MILP solutions on a set of small artificial instances and the food company’s solutions on a set of real-world instances. Computational results show that the proposed algorithm can yield high-quality solutions within moderate running times. A methodology is proposed in which the territories computed by the proposed heuristic on the past demand of one month are used for the operational routing during the following month, in which the demand is known only one day in advance. An evaluation shows that the territories obtained with our methodology would have led to levels of service significantly better than the ones that were experienced by the company, using a significantly lower number of vehicles to execute the deliveries.},

While the first operation of jobs can be either processed in-house or outsourced to subcontractors, the second operation of jobs must be processed in-house. Outsourcing a job incurs a job-dependent outsourcing cost as well as outsourcing lead-time, which implies that the outsourced job becomes available for the second operation after its outsourcing lead-time. The objective is to minimize the weighted sum of the outsourcing costs and the scheduling costs which is either makespan or total completion time. The problems are shown to be NP-hard, and both exact and heuristic algorithms are developed for the problems.

  abstract     = {Although a large amount of intelligent handling equipment has been widely used in automated container terminals, few studies have explored the coordination optimization among them, which is critical to the overall operational efficiency of terminals. This paper investigates the integrated scheduling of intelligent handling equipment at automated container terminals, with challenging characteristics such as bidirectional flows and limited buffers. Besides, other characteristics such as blocking, machine eligibility, and separable sequence-dependent setup times also complicate the problem, making it difficult to find an optimal or near-optimal solution. This study formulates the problem as the blocking hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with bidirectional flows and limited buffers, and then develops a compact mixed-integer linear programming model that can obtain the optimal scheme on small-scale cases. To increase the size of solvable problems and improve the performance of the solution, an adaptive large neighborhood search is presented, which takes a high-quality coding scheme that specifies the equipment used by each job in various stages. Experiments have been conducted and computational results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of solution quality and convergence speed.},

We suppose that only a fixed proportion of demand during the stock-out period is backordered. The decision variables are the inventory cycle and the ratio between the initial stock and the total quantity demanded throughout the inventory cycle. The objective is to maximize the Return on Inventory Investment (ROII) defined as the ratio of the profit per unit time over the average inventory cost . After analysing the objective function, the optimal global solutions for all the possible cases of the inventory problem are determined. These optimal policies that maximize the ROII are, in general, different from those that minimize the total inventory cost per unit time. Finally, a numerical sensitivity analysis of the optimal inventory policy with respect to the system input parameters and some useful managerial insights derived from the results are presented.},

Due to unreasonable location and regional scale, the satisfaction of residents has been seriously affected. This paper develops a bi-level multi-objective programming (BLMOP) to optimize both facility location and size. Three major problems have been addressed: (1) solving the contradiction between supply and demand; (2) keeping a balance of social, economic, and environmental benefits; and (3) designing a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm by modifying the parameters and learning strategies. To obtain feasible solutions, a combination of optimistic and pessimistic approaches is adopted. Taking the rural areas of Southwest China as an example, the results find that the proposed model enables to provide objective-oriented optimization schemes depending on the decision-maker’s (DM) preferences. Furthermore, the MOPSO algorithm can solve the BLMOP and provide Pareto-optimal solutions separately.},

  abstract     = {The real-time Railway Traffic Management Problem (rtRTMP) is the problem of detecting and solving time-overlapping conflicting requests made by multiple trains on the same track resources. This problem consists in retiming, reordering and rerouting trains in such a way that the propagation of disturbances in the railway network is minimized. The rtRTMP is an NP-complete problem and finding good strategies to simplify its solution process is paramount to obtain good quality results in a short computation time. Solving the Train Routing Selection Problem (TRSP) aims to reduce the size of rtRTMP instances by limiting the number of routing variables: during the pre-processing, the most promising routing alternatives among the available ones are selected for each train. Then, the selected alternatives are the only ones used for the rtRTMP. A first version of the TRSP has been recently proposed in the literature. This paper presents an improved TRSP model, where rolling stock re-utilization timing constraints and estimation of train delay propagation are taken into account. Additionally, a parallel Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is proposed. We analyze the impact of the TRSP model and algorithm on the rtRTMP through a thorough computational campaign performed on a French case study with timetable disturbances and infrastructure disruptions. The presented model leads to a better correlation between TRSP and rtRTMP solutions, and the proposed ACO algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm.},

This is an NP-hard problem with applications in communication and water supply networks. In this paper, we propose a heuristic algorithm to provide high-quality solutions (spanning trees with low number of leaves) for an input graph. Our heuristic is based on the scatter search methodology, and it combines different elements to perform an efficient search of the solution space. In particular, it applies both randomized and deterministic strategies in the construction methods to generate an initial set of solutions. A combination method specifically designed for trees coupled with two local searches with a diversity evaluation function, provides a good balance between search intensification and diversification. Experiments conducted on a large set of graphs indicate that our algorithm is able to generate spanning trees with a lower number of leaves than previous methods. Additionally, it is able to match the optimal solution in most of the instances for which it is known, outperforming the existing methods.},

In addition to reviewing various drivers, the paper makes theoretical contributions by quantifying some drivers and/or verifying these drivers empirically by carrying out experiments on multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (multi-objective NK-landscapes).

Subcontracting divisible jobs means that a job can be partially processed by an in-house machine and the remaining of it can be processed by a subcontractor’s machine. Considering three subcontracting pricing strategies: non-increasing, non-decreasing and constant over time, this paper studies a scheduling problem with divisible jobs and subcontracting option in which both the manufacturer and the subcontractor are in single-machine environment. The objective is to minimize the sum of total weighted tardiness and total subcontracting costs. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model is formulated. Then a Lagrangian-based Benders Dual Decomposition (denoted by LB-BDD) method is developed based on the MIP formulation. Extensive computational experiments are conducted on five groups of randomly generated problem instances, and the results show that the proposed LB-BDD method outperforms the basic Benders Decomposition (denoted by BD) method and solving the MIP model directly in Gurobi solver.},

  abstract     = {Utility companies collect usage data from meters on a regular basis. The usage data are collected automatically using radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology. Each meter transmits signals from an RFID tag that are read by a vehicle-mounted reading device within a specified distance. Routing the vehicles can be modeled by a close-enough vehicle routing problem on a street network. In practice, there is uncertainty while reading meters. The signal transmitted by an RFID tag is discontinuous, and the range that each meter can be read is different and stochastic due to weather conditions, surrounding obstacles, interference, and decreasing battery life of the RFID tags. These factors can lead to meters not being read. A vehicle has to be sent at a later time to read the missed meters, and this leads to increased costs for a utility company due to additional operational costs and overtime payments to drivers. Our aim is to address the uncertainty issues of the RFID technology by generating routes that are both cost-effective and robust (we seek to minimize the number of missed reads). We use data analytics , optimization, and Bayesian statistical models to address the uncertainty. Simulation experiments using real data show that the hierarchical Bayesian statistical model gives better results compared to other Bayesian statistical models. Utility companies can potentially integrate the results from the hierarchical Bayesian statistical model into their route generating software as a decision-support tool to produce routes that are more cost-effective and robust than the routes that they currently generate.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses a variant of the classical Traveling Salesman Problem known as Close-Enough Traveling Salesman Problem . In this problem, there is a set of nodes (customers, targets), each of them associated with a region, denoted as neighborhood, that contains it. The goal is to determine the shortest tour that visits all the nodes, where a node is visited when the tour traverses or reaches the region associated with the node. We propose a genetic algorithm (GA), which uses several strategies to optimize the tour, such as 2opt, second-order cone programming, and a bisection algorithm . The proposed approach is tested on 62 benchmark instances. The results show that GA produces better or similar solutions compared to the ones produced by state-of-the-art algorithms in a reasonable computing time. Besides, GA found 32 new best solutions out of 62 instances. Furthermore, we propose different metrics to classify problem instances with the goal of detecting which problem characteristics have a larger impact on the difficulty of solving the problem. We also revised the already proposed metric, called Overlap Ratio , and correct its calculation done in previous contributions. Finally, we present a case study related to the diagnostic reconnaissance of solar panels. The case study is related to a research project developed at the University of Molise in collaboration with private IT companies. We show that the problem under study is properly modeled as a Close-Enough Traveling Salesman Problem  and apply the GA to solve it, focusing on the benefits obtained by applying this solution approach.},

At the lower level, both the primary and secondary facilities serve customers within a coverage distance over star networks. The problem has wide applications especially in the spatial planning of energy distribution networks, where the coverage distance constraints may be associated with the loss of electric power over distance. The facilities can be located anywhere on the continuous space in our greenfield development problem. We formulate an optimization problem that determines the number, types, and locations of the facilities as well as the lower and higher-level networks to minimize a distribution cost. We also propose a heuristic solution method that solves a discrete counterpart and then improves its solution by moving facilities around on the continuous space. When the number of demand points is large, the discrete counterpart is also hard to solve. Therefore, we propose a decomposition method for its solution: We first solve a decentralized single-level problem with secondary facilities and then form the higher-level network. We perform numerical experiments to demonstrate the benefits of our discrete problem decomposition and facility location adjustments on the continuous space.},

  abstract     = {In the context of Industry 4.0 and COVID-19 pandemic, additive manufacturing (AM), the technology of rapid prototyping directly from digital models, has received rapid development and makes it possible to achieve the need of companies in terms of customized production and limited human resources. Consequently, the growing demands and potential applications necessitate the careful investigation on the associated AM machine scheduling problems to improve productivity. This paper is the first time to study a new AM scheduling problem, which considers unrelated parallel machines and two practical constraints, two-dimensional packing constraints and unequal part release times. Additionally, during the scheduling process, there exist multiple orientation candidates for each part, which potentially influences the processing time and increase the complexity of packing. To solve this problem, we first present a mixed integer linear programming model with the objective to minimize the makespan. Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, we propose an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm for large instances where the skyline packing pattern is adopted for the packing procedure. Several destroy and repair operators are designed based on the characteristics of the AM scheduling problem. Finally, three types of datasets with different ranges of release times are generated to verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Some interesting insights on the effects of release times and orientation selection are also revealed and discussed.},

This article deals with a pollution sensitive production–transportation supply chain (SC) model based on Binomial (via Bernoulli trials) and Gaussian (standard normal) strategic fuzzy game approach. We develop an average inventory cost minimization problem in a SC model with the effect of pollution due to production and transportation. In fact, we discuss the emissions of pollutants like carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), Sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ) etc. during industrial manufacturing and various types of transportation. The amount of pollution exhausted from production plant is estimated by the percentage via some pollution function. We split the original problem into equivalent game problem in which the producer plays the role of player I in one side and the customer plays the role of player II in the other side exclusively. The general fuzzy and fuzzy game theoretical approach have also been incorporated for comparative study. The numerical illustrations are done with the help of a solution algorithm. A comparative study reveals that Gaussian strategy suppresses the Binomial strategy to optimize the proposed SC problem. Finally, sensitivity analysis and graphical illustrations are made to justify the novelty of the proposed model.},

The paper focuses on the introduction of an efficient greedy-type heuristic, and performing an extensive numerical study. For makespan minimization, the heuristic is proved to be asymptotically optimal under very general conditions. For each of the problems, a pseudo-polynomial dynamic programming algorithm is introduced, and consequently, the results obtained by the greedy heuristic are compared to the optimum. We show that the greedy heuristic leads to very small optimality gaps in all our tests, and that the dynamic programming algorithms can solve medium and large size instances in reasonable times.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a new bin packing problem , termed the circle bin packing problem with circular items (CBPP-CI). The problem involves packing all the circular items into multiple identical circle bins as compact as possible with the objective of minimizing the number of used bins. We first define the tangent occupying action (TOA) and propose a constructive greedy algorithm that sequentially packs the items into places tangent to the packed items or the bin boundaries. Moreover, to avoid falling into a local minimum trap and efficiently judge whether an optimal solution has been established, we continue to present an adaptive simulated annealing with greedy search (ASA-GS) algorithm that explores and exploits the search space efficiently. Specifically, we offer two novel local perturbation strategies to jump out of the local optimum and incorporate the greedy search to achieve faster convergence. The parameters of ASA-GS are adaptive according to the number of items so that they can be size-agnostic across the problem scale. We design two sets of new benchmark instances, and the empirical results show that ASA-GS completely outperforms the constructive greedy algorithm . Moreover, for the problem of packing unequal circles to a fixed size circular container to maximize the area of circles packed, ASA-GS outperforms the advanced formulation space search (FSS) algorithm in terms of solution quality and computational cost, inferring that our approach is not only adapted to CBPP-CI but also works well when the number of bins is reduced to one to become a typical circle packing problem.},

An optimisation model of the problem is first developed based on mixed-integer nonlinear programming to minimise the total maintenance cost. Given the limitations of this method, a novel algorithm that integrates a genetic algorithm, variable neighbourhood search , and a Weiszfeld-based algorithm is presented. To assess the performance of the proposed technique, a guided multi-start approach and a hybrid technique based on particle swarm optimisation are introduced. Moreover, our proposed method is shown to be easily adaptable to produce results that compete with those of state-of-the-art methods when it comes to solving a related continuous location routing problem .

  abstract     = {Dynamic scheduling methods are essential and critical to manufacturing systems because of uncertain events in the production process, such as new job insertions, order cancellations, worker absences, and machine breakdowns. Emerging digital twin (DT) technology can help detect disturbances by continuously comparing physical space with virtual space and triggering a rescheduling policy immediately after a disturbance. This enables dynamic scheduling and greatly reduces the deviation between preschedules and actual schedules. This study focuses on a DT-enabled integrated optimisation problem of flexible job shop scheduling and flexible preventive maintenance (PM) considering both machine and worker resources. A double-layer Q-learning algorithm (DLQL) is designed as the underlying key optimisation method to simultaneously learn the selection process of machines and operations to achieve efficient real-time scheduling. The superior solution performance of DLQL was verified by comparing it with two well-known metaheuristic algorithms and a single-layer Q-learning algorithm under several benchmarks. Furthermore, different disturbance settings were designed to illustrate the DLQL-based dynamic scheduling process in detail. The proposed reinforcement learning (RL)-driven DT enables efficient collaborative scheduling between production and maintenance departments and helps manufacturing companies improve the real-time decision-making process under uncertain perturbations.},

This paper investigates a fundamental issue of economics in tournament design: what is the best usage of limited resources, that is, how should the alternatives be compared pairwise to best approximate their true but latent ranking. We consider various formats including knockout tournaments, multi-stage championships consisting of round-robin groups followed by single elimination, and the Swiss-system. They are evaluated via Monte-Carlo simulations under six different assumptions on winning probabilities. Comparing the same pair of alternatives multiple times turns out to be an inefficacious policy. While seeding can increase the efficacy of the knockout and group-based designs, its influence remains marginal unless one has an unrealistically good estimation on the true ranking of the players. The Swiss-system is found to be the most accurate among all these tournament formats, especially in its ability to rank all participants. A possible explanation is that it does not eliminate a player after a single loss, while it takes the history of the comparisons into account. The results can be especially interesting for emerging esports, where the tournament designs are not yet solidified.},

Operations Research (OR) techniques have been widely used in the past for protecting tabular data, but not microdata (i.e., files of individuals and attributes). Few papers apply OR techniques to the microaggregation problem, which is considered one of the best methods for microdata protection and is known to be NP-hard. The new heuristic approach is based on a column generation scheme and, unlike previous (primal) heuristics for microaggregation, it also provides a lower bound on the optimal microaggregation. Using real data that is typically used in the literature, our computational results show, first, that solutions with small gaps are often achieved and, second, that dramatic improvements are obtained relative to the literature’s most popular heuristics.},

  abstract     = {Rescheduling problems typically arise from production facilities that have to deal with incoming new orders for which it is not optimal to be simply scheduled at the end of an existing schedule of old jobs. A rescheduling of all jobs, old and new, is therefore allowed without disrupting too much the existing schedule. This kind of approach enables flexibility in the system while not disturbing too much the commitments with the customers. In this paper, we provide structural properties and a Branch &amp; Memorize algorithm to solve a rescheduling problem on a single machine, where no idle times are allowed. To the authors knowledge, this is the first exact algorithm that solves a rescheduling problem with a constraint on the total absolute time-based disruption over all old jobs. The algorithm uses a fast heuristic to compute an initial upper bound and then exploits memorization techniques to cut dominated schedules. This solution method is shown to outperform an Integer Programming formulation solved by CPLEX and it is able to solve within 900 CPU seconds all instances with 10, 20, 30 jobs and most of those with 40 jobs.},

  abstract     = {Critical infrastructure networks (CINs), such as power grids, water distribution systems, and telecommunication networks , are essential for the functioning of society and the economy. As these infrastructure networks are not isolated from each other, their functions are not independent and may be vulnerable to disruptive events (e.g., component failures, terrorist attacks, natural disasters). For decision makers , how to restore the functions of CINs while accounting for interdependencies and various uncertainties becomes a challenging task. In this work, we study the post-disruption restoration problem for a system of interdependent CINs under uncertainty. We propose a two-stage mean-risk stochastic restoration model using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) with the goal of minimizing the total cost associated with unsatisfied demands , repair tasks, and flow of interdependent infrastructure networks. The restoration model considers the availability of limited time and resources and provides a prioritized list of components to be restored along with assigning and scheduling them to the available network-specific work crews. Additionally, the model features flexible restoration strategies including multicrew assignment for a single component and a multimodal repair setting along with the consideration of full and partial functioning and dependencies between the multi-network components. The proposed model is illustrated using the power and water networks in Shelby County, Tennessee, United States, under two hypothetical earthquake scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Along with the rising prevalence of chronic diseases and the increasing complexity of pharmaceutical care, pharmacy automation dispensing systems (PADS)s are utilized to improve the quality of patient care, reduce dispensing-related medication errors, and cut down medication-related expenses. After PADSs fulfill prescription orders, patients still have to dispense medications for each meal by themselves. It is well known that dispensing medications is time-consuming and exhausting, especially for chronic patients. During the manual dispensing process, some unexpected medical errors might appear, which would result in discomfort, harm, and even death. To provide efficient and patient-centered pharmacy care, we proposed automatically dispensing prescriptions by meal orders in PADS. Specifically, we formulated a novel three-stage assembly flowshop problem to fulfill prescription orders at the level of meal orders to minimize the total completion times of packing prescription orders. In our studied PADS, there are fully flexible parallel machines dispensing medication jobs and collating sub-orders (meal prescription orders) in the first and second stages, and one assembly machine packing prescription orders in the third stage. Based on the properties of the optimal schedule, we proposed a branch-and-bound ( B &amp; B B&amp;#x26;B ) algorithm embedded with a constructive heuristic (CH) to obtain a tight upper bound. Since the three-stage assembly flowshop problem in PADS is strongly NP-hard, we also presented an improved tabu search (iTS) heuristic for the practical data size. Finally, we conducted a series of numerical experiments based on artificial data sets guided by characteristics obtained from practical pharmacy data sets. The computational results showed that the proposed CH algorithm is efficient, and when the computational time was allowed, the iTS algorithm could further enhance the performance. Moreover, the efficiency of collating sub-orders has a significant impact on the overall performance of PADS.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a bilevel programming model to aid decision-making for two players who interact strategically in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply chain, possibly with conflicting interests. In the proposed model, an LNG operator is the leader and a natural gas (NG) producer is the follower. The LNG operator attempts to optimally locate LNG export terminals, purchase gas from the NG producer, and export it as LNG. The NG producer aims to optimize production, pipeline investments, and sales to domestic consumers and the LNG operator. To solve the bilevel problem, we first reformulate it as a single-level problem by exploiting the convexity of the lower-level problem. Then, we use disjunctive reformulations of complementarity constraints and piecewise linear approximations of objective function terms to convert the problem into a convex quadratic mixed-integer program (MIQP). Computational experiments confirm that the MIQP is tractable and can be solved efficiently. We apply our bilevel framework to a case study of the Gulf-Southwest region of the United States and evaluate several decision-making scenarios. The scenario results emphasize the importance of using the bilevel methodology to anticipate the effects of new LNG export facilities on NG prices across the domestic gas network. Adding these large gas-consuming facilities at specific locations puts upward pressure on domestic gas prices, although this is somewhat mitigated by the NG producer’s optimal production response to the increased demand.},

The FFPRP is comprised of a production scheduling problem and a rich vehicle routing problem (VRP) and thus denotes a variant of the integrated production scheduling and vehicle routing problem. We present a discrete time mixed integer programming (MIP) model of the FFPRP. Specifically, the model incorporates a multi-product, multi-trip, and multi-depot setting, where orders are produced at production lines at factories, and delivered within their respective time windows to customers by a heterogeneous fleet of vessels. The main objective is to minimize total costs, including production costs, routing costs, and costs of not delivering orders. We propose a heuristic, combining decomposition and the adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) heuristic, to solve the FFPRP. The decomposition-based ALNS heuristic is tested on a number of test instances which are generated based on vessel, factory, and order data from two of Norway’s largest fish feed producers. For small problem instances, for which the commercial MIP solver often is able to prove optimality , the average optimality gaps of the proposed heuristic are relatively small, while for the larger problem instances, the heuristic significantly outperforms the commercial MIP solver both in terms of solution quality and run time.},

Tests on artificial instances based on the city of Milan illustrate that the method can solve, or find good solutions to, moderately sized instances for which a commercial solver fails. Furthermore, our results suggest that, by adjusting prices between different zones of the city, the operator can attract significantly more demand than with a fixed pricing scheme and that such a pricing scheme, coupled with a sufficiently large fleet, significantly reduces the relevance of staff-based relocations.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of Robo-adviser, behavioral portfolio theory (BPT) has been drawing good attention. However, the existing BPT models always assume the assets’ returns are normally distributed and cannot be solved efficiently when the number of assets is large. To circumvent these limitations, this paper proposes a new portfolio selection model with two mental accounts in which the lower-level (safety) is set up to avoid loss while the upper-level (self-actualization) need corresponding to the mental account is set up to get a good profit. To relax the normality assumption, we formulate our proposed model by replacing the probability terms with the expectation of indicator function and designing a sequential convex approximation algorithm to solve the proposed model. Also, we prove that the optimal portfolio obtained by our proposed algorithm converges when analyzing data with small dimensions. Last, we carry out empirical studies by using trading data with 30 stocks from the American stock market to demonstrate the superiority, effectiveness, and robustness of our proposed portfolio selection in a smaller dimension case because our method is suitable only for small dataset. By comparing the characteristics of the optimal portfolio and the out-of-sample performance of our proposed portfolio selection model with the corresponding traditional portfolio selection models, we find that our new model not only derives the optimal portfolio with moderate diversification, but also obtain the highest average return and the highest Omega ratio in the out-of-sample testing period. Extensive experiment results by using different sample sizes, different frequencies, and employing the rolling-time window approach also confirm that our proposed portfolio selection model performs the best when we compare both the highest cumulative return and the Omega ratio in the out-of-samples.},

Given a central node and a set of remote terminal nodes with specified demands for traffic, the goal of CMST is to find a minimum cost spanning tree (network) such that the traffic on any arc of the network satisfies the capacity constraint. To tackle this NP-hard problem, we propose an effective hybrid evolutionary algorithm that integrates a backbone-based crossover operator , a destroy-and-repair mutation operator to generate meaningful offspring solutions, and an intensification-driven adaptive tabu search procedure that considers both feasible and infeasible solutions in search of high-quality local optima. Extensive computational results on a set of 126 well-known CMST benchmark instances from the literature indicate that the proposed algorithm competes favorably with the state-of-the-art heuristics. For a selection of 25 most challenging CMST instances with unknown optimal solutions, the proposed algorithm reports new upper bounds (improved best-known solutions) in 9 cases, while reaching the best-known result for 12 instances. Furthermore, we provide experimental analyses to identify the key algorithmic features of the proposed approach.},

Moreover, a prize is also collected if the vertex is covered, where an unvisited vertex is covered by a visited one if the latter belongs to the former’s covering set. A capacity limit is imposed on the number of vertices that can be covered by the same visited vertex. Potential application areas include network design and intermodal transportation. We develop a branch-and-cut framework and a Benders decomposition for the exact solution of the problems in this class. We observe that the former algorithm results in shorter computational times on average, but also that the latter can outperform the former for specific instance settings.

  abstract     = {Mainly motivated by the massification of flows in inland shipping, where several barges can be assembled in convoys to transport a large number of containers to and from the hinterland, we introduce an original extension of the Container Stowage Planning Problem (CSPP) (which we denote the 3D – barge Convoy Container Stowage Planning Problem (3D –CCSPP)). The requirements for stowing all containers in a barge convoy entail additional constraints related to both the containers and the convoy. In this paper, the 3D –CCSPP is dealt with, on the basis of its relation to the 3D Bin-Packing Problem (3D-BPP), in which the filled objects represent the containers, and the bins indicate the convoy barges. We consider the multi-objective aspect of the problem with three realistic functions to be optimized: shifting movements, the convoy stability and the number of real-used barges. This is a new and effective aspect considering the state of the art of CSPP in inland shipping. We develop a multi-objective mathematical formulation of the 3D-CCSPP and propose a novel adaptation of the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm NSGA-II (Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II) based on a set of heuristics introduced by the BPP resolution methods.

  abstract     = {It is interesting and challenging to study double-ended queues with First-Come-First-Match discipline under customers’ impatient behavior and non-Poisson inputs. The system stability can be guaranteed by the customers’ impatient behavior, while the existence of impatient customers makes analysis of such double-ended queues more difficult or even impossible to find an explicitly analytic solution , thus it becomes more and more important to develop effective numerical methods in a variety of practical matching problems . This paper studies a block-structured double-ended queue, whose block structure comes from two independent Markovian arrival processes (MAPs), which are non-Poisson inputs. We show that such a queue can be expressed as a new bilateral quasi birth-and-death (QBD) process which has its own interest. Based on this, we provide a detailed analysis for both the bilateral QBD process and the double-ended queue, including the system stability, the queue size distributions, the average stationary queue lengths, and the sojourn time of any arriving customers. Furthermore, we develop three effective algorithms for computing the performance measures (i.e., the probabilities of stationary queue lengths, the average stationary queue lengths, and the average sojourn times) of the double-ended queue with non-Poisson inputs. Finally, we use some numerical examples in tabular and graphical to illustrate how the performance measures are influenced by some key system parameters. We believe that the methodology and results described in this paper can be applicable to deal with more general double-ended queues in practice, and develop some effective algorithms for the purpose of many actual uses.},

We provide a new property and solution approach to enhance existing methods in the literature. First, we provide an overview of the optimal cases for some specific ToU pricing structures that consist of only two pricing intervals. When the electricity price decreases, Johnson’s rule and dynamic programming give rise to an optimal solution. On the other hand, when the electricity price increases, we provide a condition of optimality for Johnson’s rule. Second, we develop a property based on Johnson’s rule to determine the optimal sequence for general ToU pricing structures. Third, we propose a new mixed-integer linear programming. Then, we design an exact method based on “Logic-based Benders decomposition” to solve the problem. Finally, the numerical tests show that our proposed approach significantly improves the quality of existing results in the literature.},

This problem has been classically modeled using an extended space–time network which captures the staging of the decision-making process. The present paper proposes a new integer linear programming (ILP) model based on the idea of representing the demands to be met as nodes on a graph. We also derive a Dantzig–Wolfe reformulation which is solved with a branch-and-price (BP) method. The proposed BP uses a stabilized interior-point column generation approach and a branching procedure that imposes constraints in the master problem, thus not damaging the structure of the subproblems . Additionally, we show that these subproblems can be solved efficiently using a shortest path algorithm on directed acyclic graphs (DAG). Computational experiments are carried out on realistic-sized benchmark instances commonly used in the literature. The results show the efficacy of the proposed strategies. In particular, the BP method solved the whole set of instances to proven optimality for the first time and in faster competitive times.},

  abstract     = {Natural disasters such as earthquakes can severely impact road networks. Depending on the disaster intensity and the size of the affected area, the network may be divided into multiple disconnected parts. In a disaster response context, decision-makers need to determine the roads that should be unblocked to facilitate relief activities such as search and rescue, evacuation, and distribution of emergency supplies. The multi-vehicle prize collecting arc routing for connectivity problem (KPC-ARCP) is a well-known problem dealing with such a scenario. A matheuristic to solve the KPC-ARCP was proposed in previous research, which tested instances with fewer than 400 vertices and 700 edges. However, it is unknown whether the matheuristic can handle larger instances. This article proposes a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) metaheuristic with the hypothesis that GRASP is faster and can solve more extensive networks. Two sets of tests are performed on randomly generated instances with increasing size. The gap in the objective function values and the execution times of GRASP versus the matheuristic are compared. The results indicate that GRASP can achieve objective function values as good as the matheuristic and is significantly faster depending on the parameter settings.},

In this paper, we propose a quadratic multiple constraint variable sized bin-packing problem (QMC-VSBPP), which is a generalization of the variable sized bin-packing problem (VSBPP). In QMC-VSBPP, each bin type has multiple capacities, each item has multiple weights, and the items in different bins have joint costs. The objective of QMC-VSBPP is to minimize the sum of costs of used bins and the joint costs of items in different bins. QMC-VSBPP is a new combinatorial optimization problem. Herein, a variable neighborhood search (VNS) heuristic is proposed to solve QMC-VSBPP. The proposed VNS uses a special hierarchical clustering algorithm to generate the initial solution, in which three neighborhood operators are presented to expand solution space, and a local search algorithm based on a combination of two local operators is presented to find a local optimal solution. To evaluate the performance of the proposed VNS for QMC-VSBPP, a genetic algorithm and a variable neighborhood search for VSBPP were adapted for the state-of-the-art QMC-VSBPP, and the commercial solver CPLEX was also applied to QMC-VSBPP. Results of computational experiments on 96 test instances show that the proposed VNS could yield better solutions than those of the adapted genetic algorithm (GA), the adapted VNS, and CPLEX.},

Nine free slack-based measures are adopted as surrogate measures of solution robustness, and a two-stage algorithm based on differential evolution (DE) and the time buffering approach are proposed to deal with the robust model based on the proposed nine different surrogate measures. The computational results show that the three robust models based on a free slack utility function have been proven to be more effective and could generate more robust baseline schedules in most projects with excellent performance, i.e. a low stability cost, a low average project length and a high timely project completion probability.},

In the TDOPTW-STP, each vertex is assigned a minimum and a maximum service time and the profit collected at each vertex increases linearly with the service time. The goal is to maximize the total collected profit by determining a subset of vertices to be visited and assigning appropriate service time to each vertex, considering a given time budget and time windows. Moreover, travel times are dependent of the departure times. To solve this problem, a mixed integer linear model is formulated and a metaheuristic algorithm based on variable neighborhood search (VNS) is developed. This algorithm uses three specifically designed neighborhood structures able to deal with the variable service times and profits of vertices. Extensive computational experiments are conducted on test instances adapted from the TDOPTW benchmarks, to validate the performance of our solution approach. Furthermore, a real instance for the city of Shiraz (Iran) is generated. Experimental results demonstrate the suitability of the TDOPTW-STP in practice, and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to obtain high-quality solutions in real-time. Sensitivity analyses clearly show the significant impact of the service time dependent profits on the route plan, especially in the presence of travel time dependency and time windows.},

These methods have been shown to solve the timber harvest problem in a timely and computationally efficient manner. However, solutions provided by any heuristic are often suboptimal, and inquiries often arise regarding the quality of those solutions. One way to assess the quality of the solutions is to compare them against a minimum solution estimated using probability functions associated with the theoretical distribution of the solution space. A thorough theoretical framework is proposed to estimate the parameters of the probability distribution of the solution space based on the noncentral chi-square ( χ 2 ) distribution as an underlying distribution for the instances. A case study using the Lincoln Tract dataset suggests that the best objective function out of six thousand solutions was 0.26, whereas the theoretical minimal solution was 2 × 1 0 − 6 .},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a dual resource constrained scheduling problem prevalent in high-capital cost manufacturing industry such as the photolithography area in the semiconductor industry. Specifically, the problem consists of assigning jobs to parallel machines that use common and constrained auxiliary resources such as lithography lens. Very often these auxiliary resources require heavy capital investment and setup times further complicates an already complex dual resource constrained scheduling problem. This paper advocates for the use of deterministic scheduling theory for the design and development of more efficient scheduling strategies. An Integer Programming (IP) model, a heuristic and a hybrid model were developed to schedule identical parallel machines with shared, constrained, auxiliary resources, with sequence-dependent setups, and job release dates with the goal of minimizing the sum of completion times. An IP model primed with a heuristic can add value to practitioners looking to solve real world resource constrained parallel machine scheduling problems with sequence-dependent setups. It is extremely important to control problem instance size and time horizon in order to obtain near-optimal or efficient solutions within acceptable run times. The proposed heuristic provides an initial feasible solution for the IP model which reduces the space search by decreasing the time horizon and eliminates the time needed to find an initial feasible solution. A tighter formulation is also proposed by reducing the time horizon formulation.},

Virtually all of the research conducted in the last 50 years related to Weber’s construct has overlooked major elements of his work. This includes the issue of sourcing needed raw materials, which can be limited, as an integral part the location problem. This paper explores one form of raw material sourcing first described by Weber in which each raw material source is limited by a fixed capacity. We show that most instances of this location problem are non-convex as well as propose a solution procedure. We also explore a related problem where the facility itself can be of limited capacity and not all demands can be served.

  abstract     = {The risk of infection in a pandemic increases with duration of close contact with an infected person. Since the application of social distancing in public transit vehicles is challenging, minimization of in-vehicle time can help to protect passengers from getting infected. Skip-stop operation is a viable strategy to reduce in-vehicle time as opposed to the conventional all-stop operation, and therefore can provide safer mobility for passengers. In this paper, a mixed integer linear programming model is formulated to minimize the in-vehicle time of passengers while operating an A/B stopping pattern (one of the most popular skip-stop strategies in the literature and in practice). Since the number of direct trips is necessarily decreased when using such a skip-stop operation, this paper quantifies the tradeoff between the in-vehicle time of passengers as a pandemic-based safety measure and the number of direct trips as a measure of passenger satisfaction. In order to efficiently solve problems with a large number of transit stops, a multi-start genetic algorithm is developed. Rigorous numerical experiments indicate that the proposed approach can reduce in-vehicle time by up to 34\%. Furthermore, Pareto optimal solutions are obtained to exhibit the tradeoff between in-vehicle time savings and percentage of direct trips.},

  abstract     = {This paper emphasises the parallel adjacent U-shaped assembly line balancing problem in which the collaborative work forces in the system comprise human workers and robots. Apart from normal workers, disabled workers are also hired to enable the company to enjoy corporate tax benefits from the government. Five objectives related to the system as a whole and another three interacting entities are optimised simultaneously. A mathematical model is formulated for the first time for this type of layout. Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, a reference point based evolutionary algorithm, namely non-dominated sorting teaching-learning-based optimisation (NSTLBO III), is proposed to solve medium- and large-sized problems. The performances of NSTLBO III are benchmarked in the sense of Pareto efficiency with two well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, i.e. non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA III) and multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). The experimental results show that NSTLBO III surpasses its contestants significantly concerning the convergence to the true Pareto front.},

  abstract     = {The Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) is among the major points of contention in multi-core systems. We consider a challenging optimization problem arising in worst-case performance analysis of systems architectures : computing the worst-case delay (WCD) experienced when accessing the DRAM due to the interference of contending requests. The WCD is a crucial input for micro-architectural design of systems with reliable end-to-end performance guarantees, which is required in many applications, such as when strict real-time requirements must be imposed. The problem can be modeled as a mixed integer linear program (MILP), for which standard MILP software struggles to solve even small instances. Using a combination of upper and lower scenario bounding , we show how to solve realistic instances in a matter of few minutes. A novel ingredient of our approach, with respect to other WCD analysis techniques, is the possibility of computing the exact WCD rather than an upper bound, as well as providing the corresponding scenario, which represents crucial information for future memory design improvements.},

In this paper, we address the m m TSP with both the minsum objective and minmax objective, which aims at minimizing the total length of the m m tours and the length of the longest tour among all the m m tours, respectively. We propose an iterated two-stage heuristic algorithm called ITSHA for the m m TSP. Each iteration of ITSHA consists of an initialization stage and an improvement stage. The initialization stage aims to generate high-quality and diverse initial solutions. The improvement stage mainly applies the variable neighborhood search (VNS) approach based on our proposed effective local search neighborhoods to optimize the initial solution. Moreover, some local optima escaping approaches are employed to enhance the search ability of the algorithm. Extensive experimental results on a wide range of public benchmark instances show that ITSHA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms in solving the m m TSP on both the objectives.},

However, due to the limited AFV driving range and since the Alternative Fuel Stations (AFSs) are usually not widespread on the territory , the routes of AFVs have to be properly planned in order to prevent them from remaining without the sufficient fuel to reach the depot or the closest station. The Green Vehicle Routing Problem (G-VRP) aims at determining the AFVs routes, each one serving customers within a maximum duration, minimizing the total travel distance and, if necessary, including stops at AFSs. Contrary to G-VRP, G-VRP with Capacitated AFSs (G-VRP-CAFS) more realistically assumes that each AFS has a limited number of fueling pumps and therefore prevents overlapping in refueling operations. In this paper, we propose a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP), which properly uses some theoretical results and efficiently solves large-sized instances of G-VRP-CAFS. Computational results carried out on both benchmark instances and large-sized instances show the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed GRASP.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces an enhanced meta-heuristic (ML-ACO) that combines machine learning (ML) and ant colony optimization (ACO) to solve combinatorial optimization problems . To illustrate the underlying mechanism of our ML-ACO algorithm, we start by describing a test problem, the orienteering problem . In this problem, the objective is to find a route that visits a subset of vertices in a graph within a time budget to maximize the collected score. In the first phase of our ML-ACO algorithm, an ML model is trained using a set of small problem instances where the optimal solution is known. Specifically, classification models are used to classify an edge as being part of the optimal route, or not, using problem-specific features and statistical measures. The trained model is then used to predict the ‘probability’ that an edge in the graph of a test problem instance belongs to the corresponding optimal route. In the second phase, we incorporate the predicted probabilities into the ACO component of our algorithm, i.e., using the probability values as heuristic weights or to warm start the pheromone matrix . Here, the probability values bias sampling towards favoring those predicted ‘high-quality’ edges when constructing feasible routes. We have tested multiple classification models including graph neural networks , logistic regression and support vector machines , and the experimental results show that our solution prediction approach consistently boosts the performance of ACO. Further, we empirically show that our ML model trained on small synthetic instances generalizes well to large synthetic and real-world instances. Our approach integrating ML with a meta-heuristic is generic and can be applied to a wide range of optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {The Latency Location Routing Problem (LLRP) belongs to a relatively new branch of routing problems, where latency, defined as the sum of the arrival times at customers, is the objective function to be minimized. Introduced by Moshref-Javadi and Lee (2016), this problem optimizes the location of depots, the vehicles allocation to open depots, the customers’ assignment to vehicles and the routing strategy in a customer-oriented framework. In this paper, we address the problem from a modeling and computational viewpoint. From a modeling point of view, we propose two new mixed-integer formulations and introduce a general variant of the problem, which considers the presence of opening costs associated to the depots. Under this assumption, the optimal selection of suitable locations for depots is driven not only by the total latency but also by fixed costs related, for instance, to the construction/renting cost of depots. From a methodological standpoint, we propose different exact solution methods and a metaheuristic algorithm able to obtain near-optimal solutions for both variants, with and without opening costs. Extensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed models and the efficiency of the solution approaches. As a byproduct of the research, by slightly adapting our models, we obtained an effective mathematical formulation for the multi-depot cumulative capacitated vehicle routing problem, which outperformed the state-of-the-art model, providing new optimal solutions in the benchmark dataset.},

In such an application, a node cannot be visited before its AND-type predecessors, while at least one of its OR-type predecessors needs to be reached before that. We propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to formulate the problem. In addition, a meta-heuristic algorithm based on the hybridization of Iterated Local Search and Simulated Annealing approach is developed, which lead to reasonable results in terms of CPU time and solutions accuracy for a set of instances extended from the well-known Solomon benchmark. A different perturbation procedure and several simple and fast neighborhoods are applied to make a good balance between the diversification and intensification of the search. To improve the hybrid algorithm’s performance, Taguchi’s method (Peace, 1993) is used to tune the algorithm parameters. A comprehensive computational analysis is conducted to assess the performance of the developed algorithm.},

Our approach is based on the adaptation of SVR in a multi-response framework for dealing with standard microeconomic assumptions, such as free disposability and convexity of the underlying technology. This adaptation allows us to introduce a more robust notion of technical efficiency, linked to the concept of ɛ-insensitivity in standard SVR. Due to computational reasons, we also introduce a simplified version of the initial approach, whose validity is checked through simulation. By resorting to a computational experience, we also show that the new approach, called multi-output Support Vector Frontiers, outperforms FDH and DEA with respect to mean squared error and bias, avoiding the overfitting problem associated with the assumption of the principle of minimal extrapolation in the case of FDH and DEA. We finally show how to implement some usual efficiency measures under the new approach and illustrate their performance through an empirical example.},

Moreover, to accelerate the performance of the chosen scalarization approaches, a warm start strategy is proposed. Numerical experiments are performed on 30 road samples for Caterpillar 793D off-highway trucks to determine the most robust approach for the proposed problem. The results are analyzed using the commonly-used performance indicators: hypervolume (to assess the convergence of solutions), spacing (to assess the diversity of solutions), and CPU time (to assess the speed). The research finds that the warm start strategy improves the performance of all the scalarization techniques and concludes that the most promising method for the proposed problem is the ɛ ɛ ɛ -constraint method with a warm start.},

To facilitate transportation providers expanding their product portfolio with alternative concepts, we consider the pickup and delivery problem (PDP) with alternative locations and overlapping time windows. The transportation requests have to be served by a fleet of homogeneously capacitated vehicles. Each request may have multiple roaming pickup locations throughout the day with non-overlapping time windows (since the product cannot be in two places at once). A request may also have many roaming delivery locations, and additionally an alternative recipient with their own set of roaming locations. As such, several persons in different locations can be available simultaneously to accept a delivery. Recipients could also use 24-hour locker boxes if these are conveniently located. We propose a solution approach based on a multi-start, adaptive, large neighborhood search with problem specific operators, to solve the pickup and delivery problem with alternative locations. We compare our algorithm with similar problems from the literature and examine in detail different scenarios based on real data provided by an Austrian logistics provider. In particular, we explore the benefits of locker boxes, roaming locations, alternative recipients, and mixed customer profiles based on different preferences concerning data sharing and convenience. We found that an increase in flexibility and convenience for the customers translates into cost savings up to almost 30\% for the carriers.},

Our algorithm is based on the network reduction approach in which the project is reduced to a singular activity. We develop the reduction tree, a new datastructure that tracks the modular decomposition structure of an instance at each iteration of the reduction sequence. We show how it is related to the complexity graph of the instance. Several exact and heuristic algorithms to construct a good reduction tree are proposed. Our computational experiments show that the use of the reduction tree provides significant speedups when compared to the existing reduction plan approach. Although the new approach does not outperform the best performing branch-and-bound procedure from the literature, the experiments show that incorporating modular decomposition can provide significant performance improvements for solution algorithms, showing potential for developing improved hybridized procedures to solve this challenging problem type.},

  abstract     = {In an online retail environment, the e-tailer is required to serve both delivery- and return-orders. The e-tailer aims to search for a cost-economical fulfillment plan, through flexible sharing, coordination and synchronization of fulfillment resources, while meeting customers’ service time window promises. The resulting order fulfillment problem addresses the allocation of fulfillment centers’ inventory to meet each delivery-order, the selection of fulfillment centers for receiving return-orders, the selection of routes and the scheduling of departures for different vehicles, the selection of itineraries for delivery-orders, as well as the selection of reverse movements of return-orders. We first present a flow-based formulation, which poses significantly methodological challenges. We then develop a hybrid algorithm combining variable neighborhood search heuristic and adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic . Extensive experiments are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Finally, we numerically show effects of order distribution, the ratio of the number of delivery-orders to the number of return-orders, and order fulfillment modes on e-tailers’ fulfillment performance.},

  abstract     = {In the traveling salesman problem (TSP), one has to find the shortest tour through a number of locations in a region. Since the objective is to minimize the length of a tour, edges in the optimal tour may be far away from the geometric center of the region. However, for some practical applications such as police patrol, we prefer to obtain a tour that is short in length and stays close to a high-crime (centrally located) neighborhood. We formulate this problem as the Traveling Salesman Problem with a Center (TSPC), in which we minimize an energy function including L L (the length of a tour) and C C (the distance from a tour to the center, defined by some metric). To address the TSPC, we propose a metric to measure C C rather accurately and also introduce the idea of a triangular path, in which the vehicle no longer travels in a straight line between two nodes. Finally, we show that under identical circumstances, the tour with triangular paths remains closer to the center than a tour using all direct edges both in a Euclidean graph and in a grid network.},

  abstract     = {We develop stochastic programming models for project portfolio selection under the plan-driven waterfall approach and the more flexible agile approach. The models account for the requirement to earn return fast and to generate a certain return with high probability . The models take the form of static (waterfall) and dynamic (agile) disjunctive integer nonconvex chance-constrained problems. To make the models computationally tractable, we devise model strengthening approaches and decomposition methods . We also develop an algorithm to obtain an ideal investment plan that provides the targeted probabilistic return as quickly as possible whilst maximizing the excess return. Using a representative US-based software company data, we show the significance of the benefits given by the ideal plan. Our results show that the probabilistic return can be reached faster under the agile, as compared to the waterfall, approach. This can partially explain why agile approaches are popular in new product development . Counterintuitively, the results show that the agile approach, which includes more stochasticity sources than the waterfall approach , leads to less uncertainty regarding the time to reach a certain return than the waterfall approach . The reason for this outcome is the dynamic abandoning and re-starting of new projects protecting from downside risks, and hence, from outcomes that would result in longer time to reach the required return level. Furthermore, we introduce a visualization tool to guide a venture capitalist’s investment. The visualization tool highlights the company’s performance regions derived with the proposed models. The numerical tests show that the developed models are robust and computationally tractable and can be used for larger problems, with more projects, time periods, and uncertainties.},

  abstract     = {The milk collection problem (MCP) is concerned with the collection of raw milk of varying quality at dairy factories via tankers under problem-specific constraints. During this collection process, keeping milk of different levels of quality separate is at least as critically important as production quality because when the milk of different qualities is mixed together, the worst quality determines the final milk quality. In MCP, decisions such as which farms/milk collection centers, quality of milk, types of tankers, storage tanks, and visiting sequences will be used are made. In this study, an integrated mathematical model is proposed for the first time that aims to minimize the total distance and total network costs for tanker assignments and routing problems by simultaneously considering realistic routing, incompatibility, and loading constraints. The problem was formulated as a mixed-integer linear program and the small instances were solved using CPLEX. To solve the larger-scale real-life problems, a variable neighborhood search (VNS) metaheuristic optimization framework is developed. The proposed mathematical model and the VNS framework were evaluated on scenarios based on real-life data from a dairy company. Computational results show that the proposed VNS framework solves the realistic MCP problem efficiently.},

The two main articles on cuckoo search have now been cited almost 8 700 times (according to Google scholar ), there are books and chapters published about this algorithm, and a special issue has been organized to celebrate its first decade of existence. Given the popularity of the algorithm and its widespread use, it is quite surprising that no one has ever formally investigated its obvious resemblance to evolutionary algorithms. In this article, we conduct a rigorous analysis of cuckoo search in which we identify the concepts used in the algorithm and show that these are the exact same concepts proposed in the ( μ + λ μ+λ )–evolution strategy, a well-known evolutionary algorithm introduced originally in 1981, and in the classic differential evolution algorithm introduced in 1997. We analyze the “cuckoos’ parasitic behavior” metaphor that inspired the algorithm according to three criteria—usefulness, novelty and sound motivation—that allow to clarify whether the use of the metaphor is justified or not. The result is that cuckoo search does not comply with any of these criteria. Surprisingly, we found that the algorithm the authors proposed for cuckoo search does not match the publicly available implementation they provided; moreover, neither of them really follows the metaphor of the cuckoos that inspired the algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we present a method to construct a periodic timetable from a tactical planning perspective. We aim at constructing a timetable that is feasible with respect to infrastructure constraints and minimizes total perceived passenger travel time. In addition to in-train and transfer times, our notion of perceived passenger time includes the adaption time (waiting time at the origin station). Adaption time minimization allows us to avoid strict frequency regularity constraints and, at the same time, to ensure regular connections between passengers’ origins and destinations. The combination of adaption time minimization and infrastructure constraints satisfaction makes the problem very challenging. The described periodic timetabling problem can be modelled as an extension of a Periodic Event Scheduling Problem (PESP) formulation, but requires huge computing times if it is directly solved by a general-purpose solver for instances of realistic size. In this paper, we propose a heuristic approach consisting of two phases that are executed iteratively. First, we solve a mixed-integer linear program to determine an ideal timetable that minimizes the total perceived passenger travel time but neglects infrastructure constraints. Then, a Lagrangian-based heuristic makes the timetable feasible with respect to infrastructure constraints by modifying train departure and arrival times as little as possible. The obtained feasible timetable is then evaluated to compute the resulting total perceived passenger travel time, and a feedback is sent to the Lagrangian-based heuristic so as to possibly improve the obtained timetable from the passenger perspective, while still respecting infrastructure constraints. We illustrate the proposed iterative heuristic approach on real-life instances of Netherlands Railways and compare it to a benchmark approach, showing that it finds a feasible timetable very close to the ideal one.},

Often assuming perfectly competitive players, these models attempt to provide guidance for system planners without necessarily ensuring that individual generators recover all of their costs from market revenues during their lifetime. In this work, we incorporate revenue adequacy constraints in a two-stage generation expansion planning model. After making generation investment decisions in the first stage, day-ahead unit commitment (UC) and dispatch decisions are made in the second stage, along with market-clearing pricing decisions. To approximate a market equilibrium, the duality gap between the second-stage non-convex UC problem and its linearly-relaxed dual is used as a regularizer. Case studies are presented to contrast a traditional planning model with our revenue adequacy-constrained model, which find that our model leads to different planning decisions. More specifically, our model invests in more renewable generation capacity by incurring a small increase in the total costs.},

The new relaxation is based on the Boolean Quadric Polytope and is solved via a Dantzig–Wolfe Reformulation in matrix space. For block-decomposable problems, we extend the relaxation and analyze the theoretical properties of this novel approach. If overlapping size of blocks is at most two (i.e., when the sparsity graph of any pair of intersecting blocks contains either a cut node or an induced diamond graph ), we establish equivalence to the one based on the Boolean Quadric Polytope. We prove that this equivalence does not hold if the sparsity graph is not chordal and we conjecture that equivalence holds for any block structure with a chordal sparsity graph. The tailored decomposition algorithm in the matrix space is used for efficiently bounding sparsely structured problems. Preliminary numerical results show that the proposed approach yields very good bounds in reasonable time.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a distributed permutation flowshop scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times (DPFSP-SDST) to minimize the maximum completion time among the factories. The global economy has enabled large companies to have distributed production centers to become widespread, and effective production scheduling between these centers plays a vital role in the competitiveness of companies. To provide effective scheduling for the DPFSP-SDST, we propose a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model and a new constraint programming (CP) model, which is presented for the first time in literature to the best of our knowledge. As the CP has become a solid competitor to the MILP in the literature, this study aims to exploit the effectiveness of CP to solve such a complex DPFSP-SDST. Since the problem is NP-hard, we also offer an evolution strategy (ES_en) algorithm that employs a self-adaptive scheme to obtain high-quality solutions in a short time. A ruin-and-recreate procedure is also embedded into the developed ES_en. We calibrate the parameters of the proposed ES_en using a design of experiment approach. We also compare the proposed ES_en algorithm&#39;s performance with three state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms from the literature, i.e., the IG2S (a variant of an iterated greedy algorithm with NEH2_en initialization), IGR (another variant of an iterated greedy algorithm with a restart scheme), and discrete artificial bee colony (DABC) algorithm. A detailed computational experiment is carried out to evaluate the performance of the mathematical models (MILP and CP) and the heuristic algorithms (ES_en, IG2S, IGR, and DABC). A comprehensive benchmark set is generated for the DPFSP-SDST from the well-known PFSP instances from the literature, considering various combinations of jobs, machines, factories, and SDST settings, resulting in 2880 benchmark instances. For 216 out of 240 small-size instances, optimal results are reported by solving the proposed MILP and CP models, whereas time-limited model results are reported for the rest. The computational results show that the CP model outperforms the MILP model in terms of the solution time for small-size instances. Initially, the performance of the heuristic algorithms is verified concerning the optimal results on small-size instances. Then, the performance of the heuristic algorithms is evaluated for large instances. ES_en algorithm significantly outperforms the IG2S, IGR, and DABC algorithms for solving large instances. The computational results show that the proposed ES_en algorithm is robust and provides good-quality solutions for the DPFSP-SDST in a short computational time.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays there exists a wide variety of automatic machines that perform analytical tests on liquid samples, such as water, blood, urines, saliva, etc. A test can be modelled as a set of activities with given precedences and through sharing a set of limited resources. A scheduling process is therefore required to find a feasible or optimal execution of a set of tests. An important particularity of the machines performing tests are their storage areas of limited capacity. For instance, one activity may require a sample to be moved to an observation area, while another activity may later remove this sample from that observation area. In this paper, we introduce a real problem encountered in the analytical instrument industry known as the Sample Analysis Machine Scheduling Problem (SAMSP). We show that the SAMSP is a particular case of the Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem with Cumulative Resources (RCPSP-Cu), and present a successful application of optimization techniques for it. We are interested in exact approaches, since the models presented will be used to prove the maximum throughput of the selected machine layouts. In particular, we compare the performance of approaches based on Constraint Programming (CP), Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), and Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), on real instances of SAMSP.},

We introduce three properties that enable us to fully formulate all aspects of the type-2 IPPS problem with a mathematical programming model for the first time. To solve our model, we develop a logic-based Benders decomposition method hybridized with constraint programming . We decompose the problem into two smaller ones such that we can use the best solution technique for each one, master problem and subproblem . To enhance our solution approach, we incorporate a combinatorial relaxation of subproblem into the master problem. We evaluate our method using a well-known benchmark including 24 instances and compare its performance with six existing solution methods solving the same benchmark. We solve all the 24 instances of this benchmark to optimality where seven of these 24 instances are solved to optimality for the first time. We also generate a new set of 144 larger instances to further evaluate our solution methods and provide insights on when each method performs better.},

This problem aims to optimize one of the two objectives: to minimize the total traveling distance (the minsum mTSP) or to minimize the longest tour (the minmax mTSP). The proposed algorithm hybridizes inter-tour optimization with an efficient neighborhood search based on tabu search and intra-tour optimization using the traveling salesman heuristic EAX. A dedicated neighborhood reduction strategy is introduced to avoid the examination of non-promising candidate solutions and thus speed up the neighborhood search. Results of extensive computational experiments are shown on 41 popular instances from several sources and 36 new large instances. Comparisons with five state-of-the-art methods in the literature demonstrate a high competitiveness of the proposed algorithm. Additional experiments on applying a classical TSP heuristic to the minsum mTSP instances show excellent results.},

Therefore, integration of production, inventory, and routing decisions is essential. In this study, a new production routing model for perishable products with uncertain demand is presented. The aim is to minimize the costs of production, inventory, routing, wasted products, and penalties for non-fresh products. The model is more applicable for perishable products with limited, discrete shelf life with a high freshness value. A five-phase matheuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the stochastic mathematical model . Computational experiments show that the proposed mathematical model can result in a significant reduction of wasted products, particularly when consumer buying patterns change due to various occurrences, such as a pandemic. Also, numerical analysis for small, medium, and large instances confirms the validity and efficiency of the proposed matheuristic algorithm when compared with an exact solver.},

  abstract     = {This study addresses one of the most challenging issues in designing a sustainable and efficient ride-sharing service. This paper uses an extensive computational study to quantify the behavior of carpooling in customized bus routing problems . This mechanism allows organizations to draw on the potential of their employees’ private cars to provide convenient alternative rides for other employees, thereby reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions as well as increasing overall satisfaction with the transportation system offered. The objective functions minimize: ( i ) total transportation costs and incentives paid to drivers of private cars, ( ii ) dissatisfaction as determined by staff walking distance, travel time, and delays in arriving at work, and ( iii ) total carbon emissions generated by commuting. We propose a resolution algorithm based on Pareto Strength Ant Colony Optimization (PSACO) as an effective meta-heuristic method for solving the multi-objective mathematical model and compare it with the results obtained by an exact method. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed problem have been evaluated by performing computational experiments on a real case study in Paris using a number of comparative metrics with appropriate assumptions. Different parameters affecting the performance of the algorithm are also investigated. The concluding section presents a comparison of the results achieved. The test outcomes confirm that the formulation and the solution methods can be useful references for practice. The insights obtained from the research could provide the basis for designing incentive schemes and information campaigns aimed at making ride-sharing systems more successful and improving their performance.},

A planner must identify which deliveries to offer, knowing that all deliveries need fulfilment, either via crowdsourcing or using the retailer’s own vehicle. We formalise the problem and position it in both the literature about crowdsourcing and among routing problems in which not all customers need a visit. We show that to evaluate the objective function of this stochastic problem for even one solution, one needs to solve an exponential number of Travelling Salesman Problems. To address this complexity, we propose Machine Learning and Monte Carlo simulation methods to approximate the objective function, and both a branch-and-bound algorithm and heuristics to reduce the number of evaluations. We show that these approaches work well on small size instances and derive managerial insights on the economic and environmental benefits of crowdsourcing to customers.},

These games involve the optimization problems of multiple players in which the players can affect each other in their objective functions. In generalized Nash equilibrium problems (GNEPs), a player’s set of feasible actions is also impacted by the actions taken by other players in the game. We extend the framework of Ratliff et al. (2014) to find inverse optimization solutions for a specific class of GNEPs known as jointly convex GNEPs. The resulting formulation is then applied to a simulated multi-player transportation problem on a road network . We see that our model recovers parameterizations that produce the same flow patterns as the original parameterizations and that this holds true across multiple networks, different assumptions regarding players’ perceived costs, and the majority of restrictive capacity settings and the associated numbers of players.

  abstract     = {Train timetable rescheduling — the practice of changing the routes and timings of trains in real-time to respond to delays — can help to reduce the impact of reactionary delay. There are a number of existing optimisation models that can be used to determine the best way to reschedule the timetable in any given traffic scenario. However, many of these models do not adequately account for the acceleration and deceleration required for trains to achieve the rescheduled timetable. The few models that do account for this are overly complex and cannot be solved to optimality in sufficiently short times. In this study, we propose a new model for train timetable rescheduling that uses statistical methods and historical data to parsimoniously take train speed into account. The model is tested using a new set of instances based on real data from Derby station in the UK. We show that the improved accuracy of the proposed model comes with little to no trade-off in terms of run time compared to fixed-speed timetable rescheduling models.},

  abstract     = {One of the most efficient tools for limiting the disease spread during a pandemic is to limit the contacts between people. However, too strict restrictions may seriously affect the economy, health, education, and well-being of people. Hence, in this paper we study the use of individualized strategies instead of uniform restrictions for the organisation of activities that include close contacts. Concretely, we study how to schedule a set of activities where the participants meet, and hence can spread infection. Those could be classroom teaching, sports activities, work shifts, etc. Formulating the contacts resulting from the assignment of participants to scheduled activities as a graph, we propose to search for graph structures that limit the disease spread. We develop a mathematical algorithm for identifying such favourable graphs by limiting the distinct contacts the individuals meet during an activity. The quality of a contact graph is evaluated using an agent-based model where individual disease progress is defined according to the so-called SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious or Removed) model. A computational study targeted towards the re-opening of physical lecturing at a major university, using real-life data from a course database, demonstrates the ability of this algorithm to limit the spread of a disease under several realistic setups, and shows that the infection can be significantly reduced while also limiting the part of population in quarantine when using this algorithm versus just a general group size limitation. Specifically, it shows that individualized re-opening strategies that limit the mixing of populations can be more powerful in reducing disease spread than limiting group size.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses a profit maximizing multiple allocation hub network design problem , which is a hub location problem with incomplete hub network, aiming to determine the quantity and location of the hubs, allocate demand nodes to these hubs, establish the network topology , and route the demand flows to satisfy the demands between the origin and destination pairs that were selected to be served in order to obtain the highest profit. This problem also considers the multiple allocation strategy, does not allow direct connections between non-hub nodes, does not impose capacity constraints, and assumes that there are fixed costs involved in installing hubs and installing hub arcs. A new formulation for the problem is presented and it is proved that this formulation is stronger than another one in the literature, which models the same problem. Several versions of the Benders decomposition method, combining the generation of Pareto-optimal cuts, multiple cuts strategies, and Benders branch-and-cut scheme, are proposed and analyzed through extensive computational experiments on benchmark instances. The best-proposed Benders decomposition versions were compared with the CPLEX solver, with and without the activation of its Benders decomposition algorithm. The results showed that these algorithms perform much better than the solver versions. The proposed Benders decomposition approach can solve benchmark instances with up to 150 nodes.},

Upon reaching each target, the UAV collects information and if the operator of the UAV deems that the information collected is not of sufficient fidelity, then the UAV has to visit all the supplemental targets corresponding to that target to collect additional information before proceeding to visit the next target.

  abstract     = {Recent studies stressed the fact that covariance matrices computed from empirical financial time series appear to contain a high amount of noise. This makes the classical Markowitz Mean–Variance Optimization model unable to correctly evaluate the performance associated to selected portfolios. Since the Markowitz model is still one of the most used practitioner-oriented tool, several filtering methods have been proposed in the literature to overcome the problem. Among them, the two most promising ones refer to the Random Matrix Theory and to the Power Mapping strategy. The basic idea of these methods is to transform the estimated correlation matrix before applying the Mean–Variance Optimization model. However, experimental analysis shows that these two strategies are not always effective when applied to real financial datasets. In this paper we propose a new filtering method based on Quadratic Programming . We develop a Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming model, which is able to filter those observations that may affect the performance of the selected portfolio. We discuss the properties of this new model and test it on some real financial datasets. We compare the out-of-sample performance of our portfolios with the one of the portfolios provided by the two above mentioned alternative filtering methods giving evidence that our method outperforms them. Although our model can be solved efficiently with standard optimization solvers, the computational burden increases for large datasets. To solve also these problems, we propose a heuristic procedure, which, on the basis of our empirical results, shows to be both efficient and effective.},

  abstract     = {The non-additive traffic equilibrium problem (NaTEP) overcomes the inadequacies of the additivity assumption in traditional traffic equilibrium models by relaxing the cost incurred on each path that is not a simple sum of the link costs on that path. The computation of the NaTEP heavily depends on the efficiency of the step size determination. This paper aims to accelerate the path-based gradient projection (GP) algorithm for solving the NaTEP using the Barzilai-Borwein (BB) step size scheme. The GP algorithm with the BB step size scheme uses the solution information of the last two iterations to determine a suitable step size and avoids extra evaluations of the mapping value. The proposed algorithm only needs to perform one-time projection onto the nonnegative orthant at each iteration. Two approaches with and without column generation are considered in the GP algorithm implementation. A non-additive shortest path algorithm is adopted for the column generation approach. Numerical results on four transportation networks demonstrate the superior efficiency and robustness of the GP algorithm with the BB step size scheme over the self-adaptive GP method.},

We show that instances produced by such a generator differ from real-world instances across a number of important parameters, including the average number of recipients that are compatible with a certain donor. We exploit these differences to devise powerful upper and lower bounds and we demonstrate their effectiveness by optimally solving a benchmark set of Saidman instances in seconds; this set could not be solved in under thirty minutes with previous algorithms. We then present new techniques for generating random kidney exchange instances that are far more consistent with real-world instances from the UK kidney exchange programme. This new process for generating random instances provides a more accurate base for comparisons of algorithms and models, and gives policy-makers a better understanding of potential changes to policy leading to an improved decision-making process.},

  abstract     = {The outbreak of COVID-19 dramatically impacts the global economy. Mass COVID-19 vaccination is widely regarded as the most promising way to fight against the pandemic and help return to normal. Many governments have authorized certain types of vaccines for mass vaccination by establishing appointment platforms. Mass vaccination poses a vital challenge to decision-makers responsible for scheduling a large number of appointments. This paper studies a vaccination site selection, appointment acceptance, appointment assignment, and scheduling problem for mass vaccination in response to COVID-19. An optimal solution to the problem determines the open vaccination sites, the set of accepted appointments, the assignment of accepted appointments to open vaccination sites, and the vaccination sequence at each site. The objective is to simultaneously minimize 1) the fixed cost for operating vaccination sites; 2) the traveling distance of vaccine recipients; 3) the appointment rejection cost; and 4) the vaccination tardiness cost. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). Given the NP-hardness of the problem, we then develop an exact logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD) method and a matheuristic method (MH) to solve practical-sized problem instances. We conduct numerical experiments on small- to large-sized instances to demonstrate the performance of the proposed model and solution methods. Computational results indicate that the proposed methods provide optimal solutions to small-sized instances and near-optimal solutions to large ones. In particular, the developed matheuristic can efficiently solve practical-sized instances with up to 500 appointments and 50 vaccination sites. We discuss managerial implications drawn from our results for the mass COVID-19 vaccination appointment scheduling, which help decision-makers make critical decisions.},

  abstract     = {The traveling purchaser problem (TPP) is a generalization of the well-known traveling salesman problem , in which a list of products with different quantities has to be purchased from a subset of markets selling various products with different prices. The aim of the problem is to minimize total traveling and purchasing costs while satisfying the products demand in a unique tour. This study introduces a new variant of the TPP, in which the tour has to be completed within a duration time limit by taking into account the traveling and purchasing times of the purchaser. For the purchasing operations, two types of service options are allowed for the purchaser: standard and fast service. The fast service option of a market gives opportunities to the purchaser to complete the purchasing process in a shorter time with an additional cost. This problem is called the traveling purchaser problem with fast service option (TPP-FSO). In addition to presenting a new TPP variant to the literature, this paper proposes an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm for the TPP-FSO. The proposed ALNS is enriched by a local search procedure, which consists of a set of route-change-based and procurement-change-based heuristics. To evaluate the performance of the ALNS on TPP-FSO, different-sized benchmark problems are generated by using a well-known TPP benchmark problem set. The results of the computations demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm by introducing better results in shorter computational times.},

The problem minimizes energy consumption and maximizes customer satisfaction. The subsequent stochastic multi-objective mixed integer programming model is solved using a hybrid approach based on chance- and epsilon-constraint methods. Given the NP-hard quality of the model, we introduce a hybrid meta -heuristic method based on genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA). This novel technique, named MOGASA, combines the global and local search capacities of both meta -heuristic algorithms, providing an intuitive solution approach that allows to solve problem instances considering large distribution networks with multiple types of vehicles in reasonable CPU time. We illustrate how MOGASA improves upon the hybrid chance- and epsilon-constraint exact solution method, particularly when dealing with large problem instances that cannot be solved by the latter. A medium instance scenario is used to analyze the reaction of the objective functions and the subsequent Pareto frontiers to modifications in the main structural parameters defining the transportation network.

In this problem, trucks and motorcycles have left the depot and served customers. After running out of inventory, at the joint nodes with the trucks, the motorcycles have been reloaded as many as the customers need and finally, returned to the depot. After modeling this problem as a mixed-integer linear programming model, a particle swarm optimization algorithm, as well as a hybrid of particle swarm optimization-simulated annealing (PSO-SA) algorithm, is also proposed. The PSO-SA algorithm employs both PSO and SA sequentially and combines the advantages of PSO’s good exploration capability and SA’s good local search properties. Extensive comparisons have been made to evaluate the performance of the mathematical model and the proposed algorithms using two data groups. The results of small-size instances showed that the outputs of the PSO and PSO-SA algorithms are close to the outputs of the GAMS. Furthermore, these algorithms compared to the ant colony optimization (ACO) and variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithms in terms of objective function value and runtime have satisfactory results for both data groups. In large-size instances, after tuning the parameters of the hybrid algorithm with the Taguchi method, the results of the proposed algorithm are compared with the PSO, ACO and VNS algorithms. The results and statistical analysis show that the PSO and VNS algorithms have better performance compared to the PSO-SA and ACO algorithms in terms of solution quality. Also, according to the average runtime, the performance of the algorithm PSO-SA is more efficient than that of other algorithms. In general, it can be concluded that the hybrid algorithm has better performance with respect to both time and solution quality criteria.},

We formulate a multi-objective multi-period non-linear resource allocation model for this problem with the objectives of minimizing the number of infected health workers, the number of infected patients and minimizing a deprivation cost function defined over shortages. We solve the resulting problem using the ε ε -constraint algorithm so as to obtain the exact Pareto set. We also develop a customized genetic algorithm to obtain an approximate Pareto frontier in reasonable time for larger instances. We provide a comparative analysis of the exact and heuristic methods under various scenarios and give insights on how the suggested allocations outperform the ones obtained through a set of rule-of-thumb policies, policies that are implemented owing to their simplicity and ease-of-implementation. Our comparative analysis shows that as the circumstances get worse, the trade-off between the deprivation cost and the ratio of infections deepens and that the proposed heuristic algorithm gives very close solutions to the exact Pareto frontier , especially under pessimistic scenarios. We also observed that while some rule-of-thumb policies such as a last-in-first-receives type policy work well in terms of deprivation costs in optimistic scenarios, others like split policies perform well in terms of number of infections under neutral or pessimistic settings. While favoring one of the objectives, these policies typically fail to provide good solutions in terms of the other objective; hence if such policies are to be implemented the choice would depend on the problem characteristics and the priorities of the policy makers. Overall, the solutions obtained by the proposed methods imply that more complicated distribution schemes that are not induced by these policies would be needed for best results.},

  abstract     = {We consider the so-called periodically aggregated resource-constrained project scheduling problem. This problem, introduced by Morin et al. (2017), is a variant of the well-known resource-constrained project scheduling problem that allows for a more flexible usage of the resource constraints. While the start and completion times of the activities can be arbitrary moments in time, the limitations on the resource usage are considered on average over aggregated periods of parameterized length. This paper presents new theoretical and experimental results for this problem. First, we settle the complexity status of the problem by proving NP-hardness of a number of special cases of the problem. Second, we propose a new mixed-integer programming formulation of the problem by disaggregating the precedence constraints over the periods. A theoretical comparison shows that the new formulation dominates the previously proposed one in terms of relaxation strength. Finally, we carry out computational experiments on instances from the literature to compare the merits of the different formulations.},

  abstract     = {In time dependent models, the objective is to find the optimal times (continuous) at which activities occur and resources are utilized. These models arise whenever a schedule of activities needs to be constructed. A common approach consists of discretizing the planning time and then restricting the decisions to those time points . However, this approach leads to very large formulations that are intractable in practice. In this work, we study the Continuous Time Inventory Routing Problem with Out-and-Back Routes (CIRP-OB). In this problem, a company manages the inventory of its customers, resupplying a single product from a single facility during a finite time horizon. The product is consumed at a constant rate (product per unit of time) by each customer. The customers have local storage capacity. The goal is to find the minimum cost delivery plan with out-and-back routes only that ensures that none of the customers run out of product during the planning period. We study the Dynamic Discovery Discretization algorithm (DDD) to solve the CIRP-OB by using partially constructed time-expanded networks. This method iteratively discovers time points needed in the network to find optimal continuous time solutions. We test this method by using randomly generated instances in which we find provable optimal solutions.},

This paper brings workforce scheduling and vehicle routing problems together in a way that has never been done before and consequently vehicle routing problem in the presence of shift assignment (VRP_SA) is introduced to the literature. After building the mathematical model of the problem it is verified on a solver and then real large-sized instances taken from a company are solved using a set of evolutionary algorithms . Three novel solution techniques are introduced based on our framework called dynamic neighbour generation. As one of the contributions of this study, dynamic neighbour generation framework may easily be extended to include other multi objective optimization algorithms to increase their exploration capability, and thus it offers an alternative development facility for solving multi objective optimization problems. Results of computational experiments show that the proposed framework definitely offers promising and robust results in large sized problem instances in terms of hypervolume and inverted generational distance indicators.},

To improve the efficiency of urban last-mile logistics, parcel locker has been widely advocated as an innovative alternative to the parcel delivery. In this paper, we concentrate on a multi-objective parcel locker network design problem (MOPLNDP), which is motivated by a real-life network design problem in urban last-mile logistics. The ultimate goal of MOPLNDP is to optimize the total cost of the network and the accessibility of customers to parcel locker stations, which is different from previous network design problems in logistics systems. Firstly, we establish the mathematical model of MOPLNDP based on which relevant problem-specific solution properties and heuristics are presented. Secondly, an active-learning Pareto evolutionary algorithm (ALPEA) is proposed to solve MOPLNDP. The proposed ALPEA relies on an elitist nondominated sorting method to discover promising search regions and a novel active-learning refinement mechanism to intensively find high-quality solutions in given search regions. Finally, experimental results on 70 random instances with different scales and a real-life case study are reported, from which the encouraging numerical results and management insights are obtained.},

  abstract     = {Overparameterization and overfitting are common concerns when designing and training deep neural networks , that are often counteracted by pruning and regularization strategies. However, these strategies remain secondary to most learning approaches and suffer from time and computational intensive procedures. We suggest a multiobjective perspective on the training of neural networks by treating its prediction accuracy and the network complexity as two individual objective functions in a biobjective optimization problem . As a showcase example, we use the cross entropy as a measure of the prediction accuracy while adopting an l 1 l1 -penalty function to assess the total cost (or complexity) of the network parameters. The latter is combined with an intra-training pruning approach that reinforces complexity reduction and requires only marginal extra computational cost. From the perspective of multiobjective optimization , this is a truly large-scale optimization problem . We compare two different optimization paradigms: On the one hand, we adopt a scalarization-based approach that transforms the biobjective problem into a series of weighted-sum scalarizations. On the other hand we implement stochastic multi-gradient descent algorithms that generate a single Pareto optimal solution without requiring or using preference information. In the first case, favorable knee solutions are identified by repeated training runs with adaptively selected scalarization parameters. Numerical results on exemplary convolutional neural networks confirm that large reductions in the complexity of neural networks with negligible loss of accuracy are possible.},

The difficulty in solving this problem arises from the nonlinear objective function and the fact that Bellman’s principle of optimality does not hold. To tackle the LETP-STD, we propose an extension of the pulse algorithm, an exact method based on a recursive search that combines various pruning strategies to avoid complete exploration of the solution space. To accelerate our solution approach, we adapt several strategies that have proved their effectiveness in the deterministic context to the time-dependent stochastic domain, including a bidirectional adjustable search, an effective preprocessing method to remove nodes that are not part of the optimal solution, a lower bound on the objective function, and an upper-bound update procedure that joins the most promising paths. Finally, we derive the theoretical and empirical time complexity expressions of the algorithm. Experiments over a set of real-world transportation networks reveal that the algorithm compares favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Long-term heavy maintenance check schedules are crucial in the aviation industry since airlines need them to prepare the required maintenance tools, workforce, and aircraft spare parts. However, most airlines adopt a manual approach to plan the heavy maintenance check schedules in current practice. This manual process relies on the experience of their maintenance planners, and the resulting heavy maintenance schedules need frequent adjustment because of uncertainty. This paper applies a genetic algorithm (GA) to generate robust aircraft heavy maintenance check schedules. It aims to reduce the workload and the frequency of revising heavy maintenance schedules considering uncertainties associated with heavy maintenance check duration and aircraft daily utilization. A major European airline case study shows that the GA finds robust and efficient multi-year aircraft heavy maintenance schedules for a fleet of 45 aircraft in 30 min. Compared with the current approach followed by the airline, the algorithm reduces the total number of heavy maintenance checks by 7\% while increasing utilization by 4.4\%, which could potentially lead to a reduction of direct annual maintenance costs between $122.5K and $612.5K. Furthermore, when testing the robustness of the 4-years maintenance check schedules produced, a Monte Carlo analysis has shown that all aircraft could be maintained before their check due date for 41\% of the episodes simulated, compared to 0.27\% of the episodes for the single deterministic scenario approach.},

For this purpose, the benchmark instances commonly used in the literature were analyzed and extended by a set of newly generated instances of various sizes with processing times drawn from different probability distributions. A number of different state-of-the-art algorithms were evaluated on the extended instance set to analyze their performance patterns and highlight the differences to the current set of benchmark instances. It was found that the existing instances cover a significantly smaller area than the generated ones and did in fact result in different conclusions regarding the algorithms’ performances. Furthermore, different algorithms have been shown to excel on distinct subsets of the extended instance set. This has been utilized to train machine learning models to predict the best algorithm for a given instance, the best of which was able to obtain the best solution for 90\% of the instances, whereas the best individual algorithm only obtained the best solution for 64\%.},

Our objective is to find metaheuristics that can, within acceptable computational times, provide sizeable improvements in solution quality over the best existing procedure (a dispatching rule followed by an improvement method). We consider four metaheuristics, namely iterated local search (ILS), iterated greedy (IG), variable greedy (VG) and steady-state genetic algorithms (SSGA). These are known for performing well on permutation flowshops and/or on tardiness criteria. For each metaheuristic, four versions are developed, differing on the choice of initial sequence and/or local search. Additionally, four different time limits are considered. Therefore, a total of 64 sets of results are obtained. The results show that all procedures greatly outperform the best existing method. The IG procedures provide the best results, followed by the SSGA procedures. The VG methods are usually inferior to SSGA, while the ILS metaheuristics tend to be the worst performers. The four metaheuristics prove to be robust in what regards initial solution and local search method , since both have little effect on the performance of the metaheuristics. Increasing the time limit does improve the performance of all procedures. Still, a sizeable improvement is obtained even for the lowest time limit. Therefore, even under restrictive time limits, the metaheuristics greatly outperform the best existing procedure.},

We design two priority rules, i.e., earliest due date (EDD) and earliest starting time (EST), to sort jobs. Based on our analysis on the mathematical properties of this scheduling problem, we propose two heuristic algorithms AABF and ITSLS to construct and improve the near-optimal schedules.

This study investigates the assembly line balancing problem (ALBP), considering HRC. This problem, abbreviated ALBP-HRC, arises in advanced manufacturing systems, where humans and collaborative robots share the same workplace and can simultaneously perform tasks in parallel or in collaboration. Driven by the need to solve the more complex assembly line-balancing problems found in the automotive industry, this study aims to address the ALBP-HRC with the cycle time and the number of operators (humans and robots) as the primary and secondary objective, respectively. In addition to the traditional ALBP constraints, the human and robot characteristics, in terms of task times, allowing multiple humans and robots at stations, and their joint/collaborative tasks are formulated into a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. A neighborhood-search simulated annealing (SA) is proposed with customized solution representation and neighborhood search operators designed to fit into the problem characteristics. Furthermore, the proposed SA features an adaptive neighborhood selection mechanism that enables the SA to utilize its exploration history to dynamically choose appropriate neighborhood operators as the search evolves. The proposed MILP and SA are implemented on real cases taken from the automotive industry where stations are designed for HRC. The computational results over different problems show that the adaptive SA produces promising solutions compared to the MILP and other swarm intelligence algorithms, namely genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and artificial bee colony. The comparisons of human/robot versus HRC settings in the case study indicate significant improvement in the productivity of the assembly line when multiple humans and robots with collaborative tasks are permissible at stations.},

We demonstrate through computational experiments that while the ( p − 1 p−1 )-split structure is superior in terms of overall computational time, the p p -split structure provides significant advantage under time/cardinality limited settings in terms of representativeness, especially with adaptive parameter setting and/or a suitably chosen order for regions to be explored.},

  abstract     = {This study is motivated by the need to restore part of the Nepal water distribution network that was destroyed by the Gorkha and Dolakha earthquakes in April and May 2015. The problem consists of two hierarchical subproblems : locating water taps to ensure a good coverage of the population, and connecting these water taps to water sources by means of a pipe distribution network. Both subproblems are subject to a variety of accessibility and technical constraints that make the problem unique and highly complex. Namely, because Nepal is highly mountainous, elevations must be taken into account in the distance calculations, and the distribution network is gravity-fed, meaning that pumps are not used. The problem is solved by means of a two-phase matheuristic : the first subproblem is a constrained location–allocation problem which is solved exactly by integer linear programming , while the second subproblem is tackled by means of a cluster-first, tree-second heuristic. Several variants of the heuristic are developed and compared. The network design problem is of very large scale, being solved on a graph with as many as 29,900 vertices and 75,200 arcs. Tests are performed on real-world data, obtained by satellite imagery, from the Suspa Kshemawati and Lapilang communities in the Dolakha district. Extensive computational results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methodology and enable an identification of the best parameter settings and algorithmic tactical choices.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a data-driven matching algorithm for the problem of ride pooling, which is a transportation mode enabling people to share a vehicle for a trip. The problem is considered as a variant of matching problem , since it aims to find a matching between drivers and riders. Proposed algorithm is a machine learning algorithm based on rank aggregation idea, where every feature in a multi-feature dataset provides a ranking of candidate drivers and weight for each feature is learned from past data through an optimization model. Once weight learning and candidate ranking problems are considered simultaneously, resulting optimization model becomes a nonlinear bilevel optimization model, which is reformulated as a single level mixed-integer nonlinear optimization model. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, a real-life dataset from a mobile application of a ride pooling start-up company is used and company’s current approach is considered as benchmark. Results reveal that proposed algorithm correctly predicts the first choice of riders 17\% to 28\% better compared to the benchmark in different scenarios. Similarly, proposed algorithm offers recommendation lists in which the preferred driver is ranked 0.38 to 1.12 person closer (to the rider’s actual choice) compared to the benchmark.},

In this paper, we tackle a generalization of the Rank Pricing Problem (RPP), a multi-product pricing problem with unit-demand customers and a ranking-based consumer choice model. We generalize the RPP assuming that each product has a limited amount of copies for sale, and we call this extension the Capacitated Rank Pricing Problem (CRPP). We compare the envy-free allocation of the products (a fairness criterion requiring that customers receive their highest-ranked product given the pricing) with the envy version of the problem. Next, we focus on the CRPP with envy. We introduce two integer linear formulations for the CRPP and derive valid inequalities leveraging the structure of the problem. Afterwards, we develop separation procedures for the families of valid inequalities of greater size. The performance of the formulations and the resolution algorithms developed is tested by means of extensive computational experiments.},

The CEARP models the situation in which customers are not necessarily nodes of a network and the associated serviced can be performed from any traversed edge that is close enough to the customer. It consists of finding a minimum cost tour that services all the customers. In the PCEARP, a profit is associated with each customer and it is collected (only once) when the customer is serviced. The goal is to find a tour maximizing the difference between the total profit collected and the travel distance. A formulation for this new problem and some valid inequalities are presented, and a polyhedral study of its feasible solutions is conducted. We propose a heuristic and a branch-and-cut procedure for solving the PCEARP, and their performance has been tested on several sets of instances with different characteristics.},

  abstract     = {Most of real-world problems regarding production and manufacturing contain stochastic parameters. In this research, job shop scheduling problem with stochastic process times and weighted earliness-tardiness objective function is considered. When machines are freed in the course of manufacturing, a job has to be selected from the line and passed on the machine. In deterministic job shop scheduling, the selection process is static. In the stochastic variants however, dynamic or real-time dispatching rules may be used. The goal of this paper is to develop a solution method for stochastic job shop scheduling problem that delivers dynamic and global dispatching rules that use information pertaining to the entire shop floor. In order to achieve this, the problem is converted to a near-Markov decision process that comprises an alternate sequence of states (machines becoming free) and actions (selecting a job). Using simulation and ant colony, a database of states is generated and a meaningful pheromone trail for each state is formed gradually. The pheromones act as a memory mechanism and, in combination with a heuristic based on the Central Limit Theorem , comprise the dispatching rule. Efficiency of this approach is investigated through extensive simulation. Results show an average of 92\% cost reduction in comparison with the random dispatching rule. Moreover, the approach yields better results in congested scheduling systems.},

This paper introduces Extended Fragments to solve the SDARP. Extended Fragments stem from a subclass of vehicle routes which can be directly enumerated. An Extended Fragment formulation for the SDARP is proposed and solved using Combinatorial Benders Decomposition , augmented by a time discretisation and a novel variable-fixing technique. This algorithm, along with other recent ‘fragment’-based methods for PDP, is an a priori column generation method, combined with Combinatorial Benders Decomposition . The new method solves the existing benchmark for the SDARP, including 11 previously-unsolved instances.},

In this paper we consider a brick-and-mortar store that uses its inventory to fulfil both in-store demand as well as online orders. In addition to deciding on replenishment quantities, such a retailer also has to decide how to ration its inventory across the channels. Practically, rationing inventory relates to storing part of the inventory in the backroom to satisfy online demand. The rationing process occurs regularly (e.g. daily) whereas inventory replenishment typically occurs less regular. To analyse this decision process, we model the rationing and ordering decisions as a Markov Decision Problem that maximises the expected profit. Based on the structure of the optimal policies , we determine heuristics that near-optimal results and scale well to retailers with many products.},

The objective is to create cost-efficient routing plans, utilising a fixed fleet of vehicles with heterogeneous operational characteristics , variable and fixed costs, while providing consistent customer service over multiple periods. Service consistency consists in person and visiting time consistency . A mathematical model capturing all the attributes of the problem is developed and utilised to solve small-scale instances to optimality . To address larger instances, a hierarchical Tabu Search framework is proposed. The proposed metaheuristic utilises an upper-level Tabu Search and an underlying Variable Neighbourhood Descent algorithm. Computational experiments conducted on existing and new benchmark instances show the flexibility, effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework. Various managerial insights are derived by examining the cost of imposing customer service consistency as well as customer–vehicle incompatibility constraints.},

  abstract     = {The vehicle routing problem is one of the most studied combinatorial optimization topics, due to its practical importance and methodological interest. Yet, despite extensive methodological progress, many recent studies are hampered by the limited access to simple and efficient open-source solution methods. Given the sophistication of current algorithms, reimplementation is becoming a difficult and time-consuming exercise that requires extensive care for details to be truly successful. Against this background, we use the opportunity of this short paper to introduce a simple – open-source – implementation of the hybrid genetic search (HGS) specialized to the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). This state-of-the-art algorithm uses the same general methodology as Vidal et al. (2012) but also includes additional methodological improvements and lessons learned over the past decade of research. In particular, it includes an additional neighborhood called SWAP* which consists in exchanging two customers between different routes without an insertion in place. As highlighted in our study, an efficient exploration of SWAP* moves significantly contributes to the performance of local searches. Moreover, as observed in experimental comparisons with other recent approaches on the classical instances of Uchoa et al. (2017), HGS still stands as a leading metaheuristic regarding solution quality, convergence speed, and conceptual simplicity.},

In this paper, we coordinate the safety stock level of the retailer with the visit interval and the replenishment policy of the distributor, where the distributor is subject to two types of shelf-life constraints: (1) fixed shelf-life for the product, and (2) minimum remaining shelf life required by the retailer. A fair profit-sharing strategy is developed to coordinate the investigated SC and to encourage both members to participate in a joint decision-making scheme. The results reveal that the proposed coordination policy not only coordinates the SC of products with fixed shelf-life but also significantly improves the customer service level (CSL) and the profits of the entire SC and its agents.

  abstract     = {In real-life applications, neither all the inputs of an algorithm are available at the outset, as in an offline framework, nor do they occur one by one in order, as in an online setup. Semi-online is an intermediate theoretically and practically significant framework with additional information on the successive inputs to address the limitations of online and offline frameworks. One key motivation for studying semi-online algorithms is to investigate how additional information can improve the performance of online algorithms . In online scheduling, jobs are received one by one and each job must be scheduled irrevocably before the availability of the next job. Semi-online scheduling is a relaxed variant of online scheduling, where some Extra Piece Information (EPI) about the whole job sequence is known a priori, or additional algorithmic extensions are allowed. The EPI may include one or more of the following parameter(s) such as the maximum processing time, the total sum of the processing time of all jobs, arrival sequence of the jobs based on processing time, optimum makespan value, or the range of processing time. The design of improved competitive semi-online algorithms for m m -machine scheduling problem has received significant research attention after the seminal works of Liu et al. (1996) and Kellerer et al. (1997). In this survey article, we highlight the scholarly contributions and state-of-the-art results for semi-online scheduling on parallel machine models such as identical, uniformly related, and unbounded batch by considering preemptive and non-preemptive as the processing formats with optimality criteria such as makespan, load balancing, machine cost, L p Lp -norm load balancing, early work maximization, and the sum of completion time plus total penalty cost. The survey begins with a brief introduction to the online and semi-online frameworks for the m m -machine scheduling problem and presentation of a standard well-known algorithmic performance measure, the competitive analysis. Practical applications, preliminary concepts, research motivation, and taxonomy of semi-online scheduling are presented as a foundation for a basic understanding of the area. State-of-the-art results achieved by the deterministic semi-online algorithms are classified and presented based on machine models and known EPI with a special focus on novel intuitions and algorithmic development. We discuss and analyze the impact of EPI on the competitive performance of semi-online algorithms. A classification of the references based on specific EPI is outlined for further research investigation. Finally, we conclude the survey with non-trivial research challenges and open problems.},

  abstract     = {Data driven optimisation has become one of the research frontiers in operations management and operations research . Likewise, the recent academic interest in big data has created a desire for big data driven operations research. A new data driven methodology, which employs the empirical risk minimisation (ERM) principle, has recently been introduced in the inventory management literature. It has been used to formulate data driven inventory models which can take multiple features into account and do not need classical distributional assumptions. However, the research on big data driven inventory models is currently confined to the newsvendor model. In this paper, we aim to generalise the previous results on the big data driven newsvendor model and to expand the research by solving a big data driven dynamic order-up-to level inventory model. We show how the ERM methodology is employed to formulate a big data driven order-up-to level inventory model and design a machine learning algorithm to solve the model. The performance of our big data driven inventory model and solution algorithm is demonstrated by an experimental study based on real business data. The numerical results show that our integrated big data driven model generates up to 60\% cost savings compared to the best performing univariate benchmark model , and up to 6.37\% cost savings compared to the best performing big data driven benchmark model.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the single-machine, parallel batching, total weighted completion time scheduling problem. A new graph-based formulation of the problem is proposed, where such graph has an exponential number of nodes and arcs. The problem is modeled as an integer linear program on this graph, combining features of a minimum cost flow problem and features of a set-partition problem as well. The continuous relaxation of this integer problem is solved via column generation , providing a very tight lower bound. Two different flavors of column generation are tested, leading to two models with identical performances in terms of bound tightness but in practice very different in terms of running time. A simple and effective rounding strategy applied to the faster model allows to generate heuristic solutions with values within a few percentage points from the optimum. Two different variants of the heuristic rounding procedure are tested; one allows to certify the optimality gap, while the other trades the ability to certify the gap with a greater computational speed.},

If the copy of a job fails, the corresponding machine is blocked and cannot perform the subsequently scheduled job copies. We analyze two problems. In the first problem, each job has a certain revenue which is attained if the job is carried out, and the objective is to maximize the expected revenue. We show that for m = 2 m=2 this problem is NP-hard. We propose a mathematical programming formulation and a metaheuristic approach, and we assess their computational behavior on a large set of instances. We also solve the problem for m m machines and two jobs, showing that the marginal benefit of having an additional machine decreases with m m . The second problem is to maximize the probability that all jobs are carried out. We show that the problem can be easily solved when m = 2 m=2 , as well as for m m machines and two jobs.},

  abstract     = {The goal of the portfolio optimization problem is to minimize risk for an expected portfolio return by allocating weights to included assets. As the pool of investable assets grows, and additional constraints are imposed, the problem becomes NP-hard . Thus, metaheuristics are commonly employed for solving large instances of rich versions. However, metaheuristics do not fully account for random returns and noisy covariances, which renders them unrealistic in the presence of heightened uncertainty in financial markets. This paper aims to close this gap by proposing a simulation–optimization approach – specifically, a simheuristic algorithm that integrates a variable neighborhood search metaheuristic with Monte Carlo simulation – to deal with stochastic returns and noisy covariances modeled as random variables. Computational experiments performed on a well-established benchmark instance illustrate the advantages of our methodology and analyze how the solutions change in response to a varying degree of randomness, minimum required return, and probability of obtaining a return exceeding an investor-defined threshold.},

The formulation is based on a time–space network representation of the problem that allows us to track the maintenance status of specific locomotives over the planning horizon and to manage locomotive assignments to trains based on their current maintenance status. It also considers locomotive repositioning, train connections, and utilization of third-party locomotives (i.e., foreign power). Computational experiments on real instances from the Canadian National Railways show that our model is tractable despite its size and can be solved optimally within reasonable computing times. Our methodology performs favorably when compared to historical data supplied by the industrial partner.

In this paper, we propose two new formulations with an exponential number of constraints for the problem, together with effective branch-and-cut procedures for its solution. While the first formulation (cec) is based on constraints that explicitly eliminate cycles, the second one (cut) ensures connectivity via cutset constraints. We compare, both theoretically and experimentally, the newly proposed approaches with a state-of-the-art formulation recently proposed in the literature. More specifically, we show that the polyhedra defined by formulation cut and that of the formulation available in the literature are the same. Besides, we show that these two formulations are stronger in theory than cec. We also propose a new branch-and-cut procedure using the new formulations. Computational experiments show that the newly proposed formulation cec, although less strong from a theoretical point of view, is the best performing approach as it can solve all but one of the 1065 benchmark instances used in the literature within the given time limit. In addition, our newly proposed approaches outperform the state-of-the-art formulation when it comes to the median times to solve the instances to optimality . Furthermore, we perform extended computational experiments considering more challenging and hard-to-solve larger instances and evaluate the impacts on the results when offering initial feasible solutions (warm starts) to the formulations.},

With regard to the individual representation, a novel idea of encoding and decoding is adopted to match the specific request with the corresponding satellite-ground resources, and a conception of conflicting request set is proposed to limit the chromosome length, thereby reducing the algorithmic time complexity. For the trade-off between diversity and convergence, several effective operators are introduced, including the population initialization based on the way of uniform design, the multi-point greedy mutation and the adaptive selection. Evaluations with two test cases demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm and show its ability to obtain high-quality solutions within an acceptable time period for the large scale optimization instances.},

Configuration is costly, because it is necessary to evaluate many configurations on different instances. For decision problems, when the objective is to minimize the running time of the algorithm, many configurators implement capping methods to discard poor configurations early. Such methods are not directly applicable to optimization problems , when the objective is to optimize the cost of the best solution found, given a predefined running time limit. We propose new capping methods for the automatic configuration of optimization algorithms. They use the previous executions to determine a performance envelope, which is used to evaluate new executions and cap those that do not satisfy the envelope conditions. We integrate the capping methods into the irace configurator and evaluate them on different optimization scenarios. Our results show that the proposed methods can save from about 5\% to 78\% of the configuration effort, while finding configurations of the same quality. Based on the computational analysis, we identify two conservative and two aggressive methods, that save an average of about 20\% and 45\% of the configuration effort, respectively. We also provide evidence that capping can help to better use the available budget in scenarios with a configuration time limit.},

Some of these machines are multifunctional that can do several processes on jobs. Therefore, the jobs assigned to these machines do not require processing in some of the next stages. Although the majority of the traditional scheduling problems deal with machines as the only resource, there are usually unavailability constraints to auxiliary resources such as labor, tools, pallets, industrial robots, and so on. This challenge with inspiration from a spring manufacturing plant is tackled in the considered problem with machine eligibility and sequence-dependent setup times. This problem is described with a numeric example, and its parameters and decision variables are defined. Then, to formulate the problem, a mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to minimize the makespan and determine the number of required auxiliary resources. Then the genetic algorithm is calibrated for all aforementioned features of the problem at hand as the main solution approach. Furthermore, two other well-known metaheuristics i.e., simulated annealing and enhanced particle swarm optimization are modified and employed for computational comparisons. The result shows that the proposed algorithm provides accurate results regarding the number of required auxiliary resources to achieve the minimum makespan. Moreover, supplementary analysis is presented considering practical constraints such as budget and desired efficiency of machines. The result indicates that the solution approach could provide proper alternatives for managers in various conditions.},

To restore the feasibility, the personnel task rescheduling problem should be solved, which considers two conflicting objectives, i.e. the maximisation of the service level and the minimisation of the resource schedule deviations. To facilitate the decision-making process and decrease the subjectivity of the decision-maker, a multi-objective optimisation approach is designated to offer a set of alternative solutions to the different stakeholders, making an adequate trade-off between both objectives to improve schedule acceptance. To that purpose, we present a two-stage multi-objective decomposition approach targeted at generating a set of evenly spaced non-dominated solutions that compose a representative Pareto front. The first stage comprises an adaptive weight-based method to construct an initial set of solutions. The second stage of our approach further explores the solution space by inducing a constraint-based method to improve the distribution of the solution points. Several computational experiments are conducted to evaluate the solution quality and computational efficiency of the proposed method. We benchmark the performance of the two-stage approach with other multi-objective solution approaches constructing a Pareto front and validate the design choices made in both stages.},

  abstract     = {One of the most crucial issues in the tourism industry that can help attract more tourists is to design optimal travel routes for tourists. The Team Orienteering Problem with Time Windows (TOPTW) is one of the approaches that can solve Tourist Trip Design Problem (TTDP). In this study, TOPTW has been applied to design a multi-objective model to determine the optimal travel routes, considering the accessibility. The present study aims 1) to maximize the profit from visiting the Points of Interest (POIs) to increase the satisfaction level of the travel agency, and 2) to maximize the number of visited POIs to improve the satisfaction level of the tourists. Two concepts of “indirect coverage” and “neighborhood radius” are applied to increase the accessibility of the tourist attractions and POIs. Thus, around each POI, a small radius and a large radius are considered, and if the points are in the radius coverage of the points located in the main routes, they can receive indirect coverage from those points. Also the time-window overlap issue for POIs is vital to determine the possibility of indirect coverage and makes the conceptual model of the research closer to reality. Also, several indicators are proposed for calculating accessibility. A multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is formulated to solve the studied problem, and the results obtained by the proposed algorithm are compared with those of CPLEX software (for small-scale) and NSGA-II algorithm (for large-scale). The findings indicate that the genetic algorithm outperforms the NSGA-II algorithm. A sensitivity analysis is also performed to evaluate the effects of the proposed model parameters on the optimization process. Finally, the model applicability in practice is examined based on a case study in Tehran, the capital of Iran.},

  abstract     = {The classical inventory model considers that products that are produced meet specified standards. However, some products in a lot may not meet defined standards but can be sold at a discount. The variation in the quality of products may arise due to randomness in production systems. The present research explores the effects of deterioration and trade credit policy on inventory control of imperfect quality items. In the current study, the authors develop a two-warehouse based inventory control model that studies deterioration in quality and two-level trade credit. The authors analytically find the lot size that optimizes total profit per cycle. Further, the differential based calculus method is used to determine the optimal solution. To further study the behaviors and real-life applications of the proposed inventory model, a numerical case problem has been solved and performed a comprehensive analysis. The result for presented examples indicates that combining trade credit policies with imperfect quality items in the presence of deterioration leads to savings in the supply chain. The suggested inventory control model is a generalized framework as it involves several existing inventory models.},

This study proposes a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model and a new constraint programming (CP) model for the NIPFSP with makespan criterion. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents a CP model for the NIPFSP for the first time in the literature. We also compare the performance of the proposed MILP and CP models with a well-known MILP model from the literature. Since the studied problem is NP-hard, we also develop a new iterated greedy algorithm with restart and learning mechanisms (IG_RL) and a new iterated local search with restart and learning mechanisms (ILS_RL) as metaheuristics for the problem. In the proposed algorithms, all the parameters are determined by a learning mechanism in a self-adaptive way. Furthermore, a restart mechanism is employed in the proposed IG_RL and ILS_RL algorithms to guarantee the variety of the initial solutions and to assist the algorithm in avoiding the local optima. A variable neighborhood descent procedure is also embedded in the proposed algorithms. We use two well-known benchmark sets, i.e., VRF and Ruiz benchmark suites, to evaluate the performance of proposed solution methods. For almost half of the 240 small VRF instances, optimal results are reported by the MILP and CP models, whereas time-limited model results are reported for the rest. The results on small instances show that the proposed MILP and CP models outperform the MILP model from literature, where the CP model performs better than both MILP models. We compare the performance of the proposed IG_RL and ILS_RL algorithms with the state-of-the-art metaheuristics from the literature on both large VRF instances and Ruiz benchmark instances. The computational results show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed ILS_RL and IG_RL algorithms for solving the NIPFSP. Primarily, this study improves the current best-known solutions for 102 out of the 250 Ruiz benchmark instances.

  abstract     = {With rapid advancement in aerial vehicle technologies, air taxi is drawing keen interest as a new type of transportation service. One of the necessary elements for air taxi-based transportation service system is a skyport, which is a designated area for take-off and landing of air taxis. In planning a skyport network for air taxi transportation system, it is important to consider midair congestion between air taxis. Severe congestion increases the risk of collisions, which in turn increases the complexity in scheduling and routing in the subsequent operations phase. In this study, we propose a novel hub location problem (HLP) that incorporates traffic congestion caused by intersecting vehicles along hub-to-hub arcs. Modeling congestion in an HLP formulation involves nonconvex bilinear terms, which makes it difficult to solve. We tackle this challenge by exploiting a property of an optimal solution and reformulating the original model to obtain a linear formulation. We also develop a heuristic algorithm based on a genetic algorithm to handle large-size problems for practical applications. Using the proposed model and solution methods, extensive experiments have been conducted to study optimal design of air taxi network under various environments. Our analyses demonstrate that viability of air taxi service is a complicated function of many factors including collision risk, system cost, airspace design, to name a few. Our model can offer quantitative understanding of such complex relationships to assess and develop strategies to improve the viability of an air taxi transportation system.},

In this problem, the objective is to optimize assigning a group of arriving items to empty slots of parallel stacks in a storage bay. The PSLP aims to find a bay configuration that minimizes the future retrieval effort of these items. The retrieval effort is generally represented by the number of relocations needed during retrieval. These relocations are obligatory when an item not located at the top of a stack is to be retrieved. The number of relocations for a given bay configuration is minimized by another NP-hard problem, called the block relocation problem (BRP). The simultaneous solution of the PSLP and the BRP is complicated. As an alternative, previous literature studies proposed using a surrogate objective function (SOF) to approximate the number of relocations in the PSLP. This paper proposes two new SOFs which result in bay configurations with a minimized retrieval effort. Also, this paper introduces a new method to represent the retrieval effort. The new method considers the number of empty slots needed for relocations as well as the number of relocations. Extensive computational studies are provided to verify the proposed SOFs, and illustrate that they outperform other SOFs from the literature.},

  abstract     = {The Nonsmooth and Discontinuous Optimal Power Flow (ND-OPF) is a large-scale, nonsmooth, discontinuous, nonconvex and multi-modal problem. In this problem, discontinuity is related to the representation of Prohibited Operating Zones (POZ), whereas nonsmoothness is related to the representation of Valve-Point Loading Effect (VPLE) in the fuel costs. Due to such features, all approaches that have been proposed for solving this problem are based on heuristics or on mixed integer nonlinear programming reformulations. In this paper, we propose the Piecewise Polynomial Interpolation (PPI) function approach for handling discontinuities related to the POZ constraints, which consists in replacing such constraints by an equivalent set of smooth and continuous equality and inequality constraints. The PPI function is of class C1 and assumes null values at all allowed operating zones and non-null values at all forbidden zones. The model resulting from the PPI approach is the Equivalent Intermediate Model (EIM). For handling nonsmoothness on the EIM, we recast it as an equivalent model, where the VPLE term in the objective function becomes linear, and nonlinear box inequality constraints are introduced. The optimization model that results from such recasts is the Equivalent Smooth and Continuous OPF(ESC-OPF) model proposed, which can be solved by strictly gradient-based methods. Finally, we propose a primal–dual interior point ℓp -penalty approach (with 0&amp;lt;p≤1 ) for solving the ESC-OPF model, where inequality constraints are penalized by using the modified log-barrier function of Jittortrum–Osborne–Meggido and the equality constraints associated with the PPI function approach are penalized via ℓp lower-order exact penalty functions. Numerical results involving systems with up to 2007 buses, with 282 generating units and 846 POZ have shown that the proposed approach has been able to solve large-scale ND-OPF problems, with acceptable computation times.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel approach to incorporate the aircraft turnaround, which has recently been identified as one of the major contributors to airline delay, into existing concepts for integrated aircraft, crew, and passenger recovery. We aim to fill the research gap on how to holistically model network delay propagation as tactical decision support for airline schedule recovery. Our model introduces a heterogeneous vehicle routing problem with time windows for the assignment of aircraft to flight routes and integrates it with an extended version of the resource-constrained project schedule problem for the allocation of scarce resources to turnarounds at the central hub airport, such that we can proactively estimate delay propagation in an airline network. Passenger and crew itineraries are modelled as links between flights, such that needed transfer times influence the stand allocation and resource assignment. These links may only be broken if reserve capacities are available and the related rebooking and compensation costs are more efficient than accepting departure delays to maintain transfers. With this approach, we are able to calculate flight-specific delay cost functions and find substantial dependencies about the time of the day, the number of succeeding flight legs and particular downstream destinations. The integrated recovery model is implemented into a rolling horizon algorithm and applied to a case study setting to analyse its performance in comparison to the individual turnaround and aircraft recovery models. Within different delay scenarios, we find that the incorporation of turnaround recovery options significantly improves the resilience of the airline network. Especially in low and moderate delay situations, we achieve a full recovery of the flight schedule simply by rebooking passengers, reallocating aircraft among stands and accelerating ground operations. Thus, often considered recovery options, such as aircraft swaps and flight cancellations, are not required for delays around 30 min in our case study. This reduces total costs in comparison to the conventional aircraft recovery model by 49\%. Despite the lower efficiency of turnaround recovery in medium and high delay scenarios, the combination of flexible aircraft assignments and ground operations still generates additional cost savings of at least 21\% and helps to reduce the necessary amount of optimal recovery options.},

The network construction scheduling problem consists of sequencing the construction of lines of a urban transportation network with the aim of maximizing the discounted long-term profit of the project. This problem can be described as a resource-constrained project scheduling problem, where both the budget and the available construction equipment act as resources influencing the schedule. We consider that partial lines can be put into operation as soon as they are finished, thus benefiting users with a partial and quick usage of the network infrastructure. This assumption makes both the costs and the revenues dependent on the schedule. After analyzing some characteristics of the best solutions, we propose an iterated greedy matheuristic for solving the stochastic version of real-size network construction scheduling problems. To illustrate our methodology we apply the algorithm to the construction of the full metro network of the city of Seville.},

  abstract     = {Metro timetables are usually planned with a top-down approach. After dividing the day into different periods, the trains are scheduled between the terminals of the line with a fixed frequency per period. In this paper we adopt an alternative paradigm where trains are scheduled individually. The schedule is developed so as to best match the passenger demand, and trains may short-turn at intermediate stations, thus reversing their direction before reaching the line terminal. This type of approach is particularly suited for automated metro lines, since it has a limited impact on personnel management. Considering the objective of minimizing the passenger waiting times on a two-directional metro corridor, we make two operating assumptions when designing the train schedule. Specifically, we assume the presence of a root station, which cannot be skipped by short-turning, and we assume that idling is only allowed immediately after a short-turn, and for a maximum amount of time. We present a path-based formulation for the problem and develop an efficient exact algorithm for it using a Benders-based branch-and-cut algorithm. We evaluate the proposed formulation and algorithm on a number of test instances. Through our computational experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed formulation and algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an augmented mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for the nurse scheduling problem designed to accommodate overtime and several practical considerations that are part of the rostering process but have been absent in previous work. The goal is to minimize the sum of weighted uncovered demand and nurse preference violations over a one-month period. Model features include maximum number of consecutive working days and days off, minimum number of rest hours between shifts, vacations and birthdays. Preference violations are measured by the number of times certain days-off and days-on patterns appear in a nurse’s schedule, and the number of times an assignment contains a shift transition on two consecutive days. In addition, the formulation accounts for each nurse’s working status in the last few days of the previous month to ensure that constraints are not violated when new schedules are developed, and that preference violations are properly counted. The problem is solved in two stages due to the complexity of dealing with regular time and overtime in an integrated model. In Stage 1, a mixed-integer linear program is used to assign shifts to nurses without exceeding their contracted regular hours. Column generation is applied to derive solutions. In Stage 2, a heuristic is developed to add overtime to the rosters found in Stage 1. This is done with the goal of minimizing total overtime hours while trying to balance each nurse’s workload. Experimental results are provided for instances with up to 60 nurses based on data obtained from a 1000-bed hospital. We conclude with a sensitivity analysis of the uncovered demand weight to determine its impact on solution quality and computational effort.},

  abstract     = {It is well known that the location of Automatic Vehicle Identification (AVI) sensors on a traffic network for route flow estimation is a complex problem. Heuristics and metaheuristic tools have been proved to provide good results mainly for large networks where exact approaches require high (exponential) computational times. The numerous contributions in the literature mainly focus on the assumption of a steady state condition of the network flows and limited studies have addressed the problem accounting for the dynamic nature of the mobility and the uncertain knowledge of traffic conditions (i.e., the actual routes, the actual O-D matrix, etc.). In this paper, we propose a genetic algorithm to find high quality solutions to the problem of locating AVI sensors on a traffic network assuming uncertainty in the actually used routes of the network. We use the orthogonal array technique to determine the parameter settings of the algorithm to ensure robustness of the subsequent route flows estimation. Furthermore, we have tested our approach on different networks to show its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {The deterministic Asset Protection Problem (APP) involves deploying firefighting resources of various capabilities to service as many community assets as possible within time windows determined by an advancing wildfire. A common situation arising during these situations is a wind change. Forecasts of changes in wind velocity (i.e. direction and speed) are reasonably accurate but there is some uncertainty around the time of a wind change. The timing has implications for which areas, and hence which assets, will be impacted by the wildfire. This presents a difficult problem for an Incident Management Team (IMT) operating under severe time pressure as the wildfire sweeps across the landscape. In this study, we extend the spatial decomposition-based math-heuristic originally developed for the deterministic APP to handle large real life sized stochastic APPs in operational time. This is achieved by regarding the deterministic and stochastic components as a coupled system. A two-stage stochastic programming (TSSP) model is thus only used for a smaller sub-problem around the uncertainty. We found this approach outperformed other methods when tested on a new set of benchmarks. More importantly, the accuracy and solution times make the method suitable for operational purposes .},

  abstract     = {This study explores a dual-channel management problem of a retailer selling multiple products to customers through a traditional retail channel and an online channel to maximize expected profit. The prices and order quantities of both the online and the retail channels and the delivery times of the online channel are the decision variables. The demand for each product and each channel is assumed to be random and dependent on the prices of both channels and on the online delivery time. In addition, to ensure an adequate performance, service level requirements are considered and are modeled as joint chance constraints. Wasserstein uncertainty sets using the Wasserstein metric for demand probability distributions centered at the empirical distributions on the observed demands from the historical data are constructed in a data-driven approach. Accordingly, a data-driven distributionally robust joint chance constrained model is developed based on the data-driven Wasserstein uncertainty sets. A conservative CVaR approximation is used for the distributionally robust joint chance constraints. Through mathematical manipulations, the developed model is transformed into a bilinear program, which can be approximated by a mixed integer quadratic programming model using piecewise affine relaxations of the bilinear terms and can be solved efficiently. Numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed data-driven distributionally robust optimization approach to deal with demand uncertainties. The effects of the key parameters such as delivery time sensitivity, price sensitivity and customer channel preference are analyzed and managerial insights are provided. The results show that the decisions obtained by the proposed approach are robust to hedge against demand uncertainties. The proposed model and solution approach can provide effective decision supports for retailers selling products through an online channel and a traditional retail channel without reliable demand distribution information. Furthermore, compared with the L 1 L1 -norm and the L 2 L2 -norm, the L ∞ L∞ -norm is verified to perform better when used in the Wasserstein metric for constructing the Wasserstein uncertainty sets.},

  abstract     = {The task of the offshore Wind Farm Layout Optimization Problem (WFLOP) is to place n n wind turbines at a subset of k k available positions to maximize power production and minimize wake losses. We start with a comprehensive literature review, where we highlight trends and analyze strategies used to solve WFLOP. Due to the increasing size of real-life wind farm projects, a more scalable approach is needed than those proposed in literature, to place hundreds of turbines at a subset of thousands of available positions. For this reason, we develop an advanced heuristic to solve WFLOP, based on the Variable Neighborhood Search meta-heuristic, considering in addition the minimum distance constraint and foundation costs. We also develop a novel initial solution algorithm, inspired by the P-Dispersion Sum Problem, which proves to be fast and effective. In the results, we compare and choose the best diversification strategy for this problem. Then, we test our heuristic on the most used set of instances in literature involving 100 positions, showing that our optimizer achieves higher production in less than 30 s than the original paper. These instances do not reflect the complexity of real problems, therefore we generate, and make available, a set of the 10 instances that mimic real cases, with over 20 thousand available positions, obstacles, foundation costs, wind distributions, and wind turbine characteristics. We benchmark cases with high, low and no foundation costs on this set. Our optimization technique is able to handle these large cases and reaches in 1 h objective values that are within 0.05\% from the ones obtained in 10 h. Finally, we provide results of our heuristic in all these cases, to encourage future comparison of techniques on a more realistic and challenging dataset than currently used in literature.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we deal with a practical problem that arises in military mission planning. The problem is to plan a path for one, or more, agents to reach a target without being detected by enemy sensors. Agents are not passive, rather they can initiate actions which aid evasion. They can knockout sensors. Here to knockout a sensor means to completely disable the sensor. They can also confuse sensors. Here to confuse a sensor means to reduce the probability that the sensor can detect an agent. Agent actions are path dependent and time limited. By path dependent we mean that an agent needs to be sufficiently close to a sensor to knock it out. By time limited we mean that a limit is imposed on how long a sensor is knocked out or confused before it reverts back to its original operating state. The approach adopted breaks the continuous space in which agents move into a discrete space. This enables the problem to be formulated as a zero–one integer program with linear constraints . The advantage of representing the problem in this manner is that powerful commercial software optimisation packages exist to solve the problem to proven global optimality . A heuristic for the problem based on successive shortest paths is also presented. Computational results are presented for a number of randomly generated test problems that are made publicly available.},

The objective is to minimize the two-dimensional area of the storage block occupied for temporarily storing the containers within a given planning horizon (time dimension). The 3DYAPT is challenging and proved to be strongly NP-hard since it requires dynamically adjusting the shape of the allocated area when placing containers from the same request. We formulate the 3DYAPT as an integer linear programming model and develop a simulated annealing-based dynamic shape adjustment and placement algorithm (SA-DSAP). The simulated annealing-based algorithm comprises a novel dynamic programming procedure with several speed-up techniques that sequentially computes the storage space solution given a particular sequence of requests. Extensive computational experiments are conducted, showing that SA-DSAP is capable of finding optimal solutions very efficiently for nearly all small instances. For large instances, we also find that SA-DSAP produces significantly better heuristic solutions than the existing algorithm from the literature.},

  abstract     = {It is widely acclaimed that the Markowitz mean–variance portfolio selection is a very important investment strategy. One approach to solving the static mean–variance portfolio selection (MVPS) problem is based on the usage of quadratic programming (QP) methods. In this article, we define and study the time-varying mean–variance portfolio selection (TV-MVPS) problem both in the cases of a fixed target portfolio’s expected return and for all possible portfolio’s expected returns as a time-varying quadratic programming (TVQP) problem. The TV-MVPS also comprises the properties of a moving average. These properties make the TV-MVPS an even greater analysis tool suitable to evaluate investments and identify trading opportunities across a continuous-time period. Using an originally developed linear-variational-inequality primal–dual neural network (LVI-PDNN), we also provide an online solution to the static QP problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is an innovative approach that incorporates robust neural network techniques to provide an online, thus more realistic, solution to the TV-MVPS problem. In this way, we present an online solution to a time-varying financial problem while eliminating static method limitations. It has been shown that when applied simultaneously to TVQP problems subject to equality, inequality and boundary constraints, the LVI-PDNN approaches the theoretical solution. Our approach is also verified by numerical experiments and computer simulations as an excellent alternative to conventional MATLAB methods.},

To fulfill a mission, the NRF operates a number of technical systems, mostly vehicles. Each system is composed of several parts which might fail over time, and it can only be used again in the mission if all broken parts are replaced. For short deployments (e.g., one month), the NRF troops bring with them a tightly constrained “warehouse” of spare parts. To ensure an optimal use of the space, we present a two-stage stochastic programming model where in the first stage spare parts are chosen, then failures occur at random, and in the second stage the parts are assigned to the broken systems. We carry out a scenario-based approach, where the failures are simulated by a Monte-Carlo approach. We demonstrate that the resulting mixed-integer linear program can be solved using standard numerical solvers. Using real-world input data provided by the German Armed Forces and simulated data, we analyze the sensitivity of the solutions with respect to the size of the warehouse, the service level, and the number of scenarios, and compare our approach with simpler, doctrine based warehousing strategies.},

  abstract     = {The tourist trip design problem is an extension of the orienteering problem applied to tourism. The problem consists in selecting a subset of locations to visit from among a larger set while maximizing the benefit for the tourist. The benefit is given by the sum of the rewards collected at each location visited. We consider a variant of the problem that deals not only with “typical” constraints such as budget, opening-time hours (i.e., time windows at the locations), and maximum trip duration but also with other practical tourism constraints such as mandatory visits, limits on the number of locations of each type, and the order at which selected locations are visited. To solve this problem, we propose a branch-and-check approach in which the master problem selects a subset of locations, verifying all except time-related constraints, and these locations define candidate solutions to the master problem. For each candidate solution, the sub-problem checks whether a feasible trip can be built using the given locations. To accelerate the branch-and-check approach, we propose and test improvements, including preprocessing to tighten the master-sub problem, valid inequalities generated dynamically to strengthen the master problem, and a local branching and variable neighborhood search to find new feasible solutions. Finally, we report the experimental results and compare the performance of the proposed exact algorithm with that of a mathematical solver.},

  abstract     = {This study addresses a multi-period product-line-mix problem considering product interdependencies and uncertainties regarding price, demand, production cost, and the cannibalization effect of new products. The problem is modeled as a two-stage stochastic program. In the first-stage, decisions for the release times of new product-lines and capacity expansion are made without waiting for the realization of random events. Sales volumes are determined in the second-stage after more information about uncertainties is revealed. The solution approach employs a sample average approximation technique based on the Monte Carlo bounding, and multi-cut version of the L -shaped method to solve approximate problems efficiently. The model and solution approach are tested on different cases considering the value-of-stochastic-solution (VSS) and the expected-value-of-perfect-information (EVPI) as performance measures, under the assumption that the decision-maker is risk-neutral. Data collected through experimental studies are analyzed using ANOVA and Random Forest method to determine the impact of both deterministic and uncertain parameters on the performance of the stochastic approach, and to generate some rule-based inferences about the behavior of the proposed model. The results demonstrate the problem environments in which the stochastic model can generate the highest benefit to the business. It is mainly found the model can provide more expected profit than the mean-value solution in problems having uncertainties, particularly when selling prices and production costs are uncertain.},

  abstract     = {Stockouts of repairable spares usually lead to significant downtime costs. Managers of Maintenance Repair Organizations (MROs) seek advance indicators of future stockouts which might allow them to take proactive actions that are beneficial for achieving target service levels with reasonable costs. Among such (proactive) actions, the most common, and the cheapest one is expediting existing repair processes. In this study, we develop an advance stockout risk estimation system for repairable spare parts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate the future stockout risk of a repairable part. The method considers different statistics , e.g. the number of ongoing repair processes, demand rate, repair time, etc. to estimate stockout risk of a repairable part for a given planning horizon. In our field tests with empirical data, the suggested method overperforms two heuristic approaches and achieves accuracy rates of 63\% for 15 day-planning horizon and 83\% for 45 days. We also suggest a repairable inventory control system including repair expediting, inspection and condemnation processes. To optimize the control parameters we suggest a simple algorithm considering two constraints: Target service level and maximum fraction of expedited demand. The algorithm is proved to be efficient for finding the optimum policy parameter in our tests with empirical data. Tests with empirical data suggest savings up to 8\%. Both systems are implemented at an MRO as building blocks of a inventory control tower. The impact of the implementation is assessed with empirical simulations and verified from the financial indicators of the company.},

  abstract     = {Product recovery has received greater attention in recent years mainly due to increased environmental awareness of consumers and stricter environmental regulations imposed by governments. In product recovery, disassembly of the product into its constituent parts is the most significant activity and generally performed on a disassembly line. During disassembly, a complete or partial disassembly of the product may be preferred. In complete disassembly, all parts must be disassembled, while partial disassembly allows to disassemble a subset of parts (e.g., the ones with relatively high revenues). This study deals with a partial disassembly line balancing and sequencing (PDLBS) problem considering revenues of parts to be disassembled, general workstation cost, additional cost of workstation(s) with hazardous parts, and cost of direction changes. For the PDLBS problem, a generic mixed integer programming (MIP) model, with the aim of maximizing total profit, is developed. To strengthen the MIP formulation, two sets of valid inequalities are proposed. The computational results show that the MIP model with valid inequalities is able to provide optimal solutions for the PDLBS problems with up to 30 tasks. To obtain near-optimal solutions for large-sized problems, a MIP-based solution approach is proposed. The proposed approach decomposes the entire MIP model into selection and assignment (SA) and sequencing (SEQ) models. The SA model is an exact relaxation of the MIP model (with valid inequalities) obtained by removing all the sequencing variables and constraints. Hence, SA model also produces an efficient upper bound for the PDLBS problem. The SEQ model, accordingly, aims to find an optimal sequence of tasks subject to the fixed selection and assignment of tasks provided by the SA model. The computational results show that the proposed MIP-based solution approach provides efficient solutions with small optimality gaps for large-sized problems.},

  abstract     = {We study the robust and adaptive maximum network flow problem in an uncertain environment where the network parameters (e.g., capacities) are known and deterministic, but the network structure (e.g., edges) is vulnerable to adversarial attacks or failures. We propose a robust and sustainable network flow model to effectively and proactively counter plausible attacking behaviors of an adversary operating under a budget constraint. Specifically, we introduce a novel scenario generation approach based on an iterative two-player game between a defender and an adversary. We assume that the adversary always takes a best myopic response (out of some feasible attacks) against the current flow scenario prepared by the defender. On the other hand, we assume that the defender considers all the attacking behaviors revealed by the adversary in previous iterations of the game in order to generate a new conservative flow strategy that is robust (maximin) against all those attacks. This iterative game continues until the objectives of the adversary and the administrator both converge. We show that the robust network flow problem to be solved by the defender is NP-hard and that the complexity of the adversary’s decision problem grows exponentially with the network size and the adversary’s budget value. We propose two principled heuristic approaches for solving the adversary’s problem at the scale of a large urban network. Extensive computational results on multiple synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate that the solution provided by the defender’s problem significantly increases the amount of flow pushed through the network and reduces the expected amount of lost flow over four state-of-the-art benchmark approaches.},

In this paper, we propose a partial pricing scheme for the CRP in which the column generation subproblem of each crew member only contains the pairings that are likely to be selected in an optimal or near-optimal solution. The task of selecting which pairings to include in each network is performed by a deep neural network trained on historical data. We test the proposed method on several large instances.

  abstract     = {Cross-docking is a strategy to facilitate a persistent process from suppliers to the consumer points, without long-term storage of products at a distribution warehouse. Products are collected from various origins by inbound trucks, unloaded to the cross-dock, reconsolidated with other products, and finally loaded onto outbound trucks within the same or next day. Because of the limited number of dock-doors as the main resources and the uncertain arrival time of trucks at the cross-dock, queue problems in such environments are unavoidable. This study considers a vehicle routing problem (VRP) for a multi-door cross-docking system with a queuing approach. A real application of the proposed model can be found in congestion conditions at the cross-docking yard, when the queuing time of the vehicles (i.e., the queuing delay) may reduce the quality of service. Moreover, in some cases, improper queue management at a facility such as a cross-dock may incur an economic cost associated with the waiting time in the queue. In this study, we focus on the receiving doors of a cross-dock and assume that the rate of truck arrivals at the cross-dock is a random variable. Moreover, the cross-dock is not able to provide service to all vehicles simultaneously; it has some limitations such as capacity constraints and service time restrictions. Thus, an M/M/c queuing formulation is proposed to model this cross-docking environment, in which the vehicles’ dispatch plan for starting the pickup process would also be determined. In the proposed multi-channel queuing system, the arrival flow of trucks to the cross-docking terminal can be deemed as a Poisson process, resulting in a nonlinear mathematical formulation to optimize the problem. The model is then linearized. To handle its computational complexity, we develop a new Genetic Algorithm (GA) to obtain near-optimal solutions to the problem and compare them with those of the optimization software GAMS. Then, a sensitivity analysis is done on different parameters of the model, and their effect on transportation cost and waiting cost of vehicles in the queue is investigated. The results show that considering a queuing approach in this problem, even for a small-scale problem derived from a real case study, can improve the average waiting time of trucks in the queue considerably compared with the situation in which all parameters are assumed deterministic.},

The optimization of order picking planning is crucial to speed up customers’ delivery process and reduce warehouse expenses. A commonly adopted strategy is called mixed-shelves storage strategy (MSSS) that is highly recommended for e-commerce warehouses. Applying this, the units of the same stock keeping unit (SKU) are scattered to various storage locations which provides more improvement room for OP. However, consolidated methods have not been sufficiently discussed when OP is under the MSSS. In this paper, we study the problem of wave picking systems to jointly address order batching, batch assignment, and picker routing (BAR) in a MSSS-based warehouse. We propose the decomposition of OP into BAR subproblems (DOPBAR) for solving such a wave OP problem. We examine our approach on a large set of instances, validate the effectiveness of our method, and point out the advantages of the MSSS in OP. Moreover, we analyze the trade-offs between two conflicting objectives that practitioners aim to optimize: customer service level (makespan) and workforce level (labor cost). Finally, a few insightful managerial recommendations are proposed that support the decision making in choosing a storage location assignment strategy.},

  abstract     = {In general, data sets are growing larger and larger, and handling related issues is topic of big data. Similar trends and tendencies are evident in data envelopment analysis (DEA). DEA is a well-known instrument for determining the efficiencies of decision-making units (DMUs), applying linear programming. Still, as we will show, DEA suffers notably from the curse of dimensionality . Therefore, we propose improved decomposition-based algorithms involving different termination criteria and multithreading to address this issue. For some of these criteria, we prove the convergence of the algorithm; to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to prove this. Ultimately, from a computational point of view, we study the performance of the new big data strategy by an extensive numerical analysis , thus demonstrating the algorithm’s scalability.},

  abstract     = {We address an integrated airline scheduling problem that combines three airline planning processes: fleet assignment, aircraft routing, and crew pairing. For a given daily flight schedule, the problem requires simultaneously assigning aircraft and crews to each scheduled flight , taking into account aircraft maintenance restrictions and crew work rules. We propose to solve this complex problem of integrated flight planning while taking into account robustness considerations. In this regard, robustness is achieved by restricting tight connections in the schedule and increasing the number of connections where crews follow the aircraft. We formulate the problem using a very large-scale, yet compact, mixed-integer programming model, and we propose a matheuristic consisting of a decomposition approach and a proximity search algorithm. Computational experiments carried out on real instances from a major airline and having up to 14,014 itineraries, 646 flights, and 202 aircraft provide evidence of the proposed approach’s efficacy. In particular, we find that the average deviation from a conservative bound is at most equal to 0.6\%.},

The allowable angles of each piece are limited. To solve this problem, a waste least first decreasing strategy is introduced to assign the piece to the bins. A simple greedy local search approach by moving the pieces from one bin to another is utilized to improve the solution. We adapt an overlap minimization approach to solving the one bin placement problem. The classical bottom-left method is utilized to generate the initial position for each piece, and the random local search by exchanging the positions of two pieces is used to minimize the overlap. Moreover, a novel warm start and an iteratively doubling search strategy are proposed to speed up the search process. The standard benchmark results show that our approach improves the results for most of the instances in the literature.},

This class of optimization problems has a significant number of applications in different fields of study including but not limited to game theory, systems reliability, and conservation planning. An IL-GMMP can be reformulated as a mixed integer Second-Order Cone Program (SOCP) and therefore, can be solved effectively by commercial solvers such as IBM ILOG CPLEX, Gurobi, and FICO Xpress. In this study, we show that IL-GMMPs can be viewed as special cases of the problem of optimization over the efficient (or Pareto-optimal) set in multi-objective integer linear programming . Based on this observation, we develop three exact solution approaches with a desirable property : they only solve a finite number of single-objective integer linear programs to compute an optimal solution of an IL-GMMP (which is nonlinear). Through an extensive computational study with 57600 experiments, we compare the performance of all three algorithms using the three main commercial single-objective integer linear programming solvers in the market: CPLEX, Gurobi, and Xpress. We also compare the performance of our algorithms using the mixed integer SOCP solvers of CPLEX, Gurobi, and Xpress. The results show that the choice of a commercial solver impacts the solution time dramatically and that, by the right choice of solver, one of our proposed algorithms is significantly faster than other methods. We also illustrate that although it is possible to linearize IL-GMMPs, commercial solvers struggle to solve such linearized instances.},

  abstract     = {The manufacturing of oil extraction pipes involves several steps of pipe processing in a sequence of machines. The pipes are attached to reels that are moved between the machines by cranes. As the physical space and the reach of the cranes are limited, the motion must follow specific paths, which must comply with several movement constraints. A poorly designed reel movement plan will require a long time for reel positioning and can even lead the facility to a deadlock . This work proposes a reel management heuristic that, given the current reel positions, the facility configuration, and the production plan to be executed, builds a full reel movement plan in a few minutes. The proposed tool optimizes five objectives that are combined into a lexicographical function: task compliance; moves to the uncovered part of the facility; tardiness; earliness; and the number of reel movements performed. The optimized movements are generated by a fast local search based heuristic, which employs a distance metric suitable for measuring distances in this study. That distance metric, which is inspired on the Dijkstra’s algorithm, measures the effort for moving a reel from a start vertex to a target vertex. The proposed heuristic for movement planning is conceived as a real-time tool, which is re-run on each time a relevant discrepancy between the planning and the actual behavior of the plant appears; for this reason, the proposed system is allowed a maximum of 300 s of processing time for delivering a complete solution. Comparisons with a heuristic based on ILP and with a VNS procedure were performed, showing that the proposed method reaches either the same performance or a better performance in the objectives, consuming a much smaller processing time.},

However, the optimal dynamic policy for this problem is not known and remains a hard open problem. In our approach, we develop a math program to model a static variant of this routing problem and use the solution from this math program to construct several novel dynamic policies. In three categories, namely, (i) policies that do not block jobs, (ii) policies that block jobs statically (i.e., blocking jobs using a predetermined blocking probability), and (ii) policies that block jobs dynamically (i.e., blocking jobs when all feasible servers are busy), we compare the performance of our policies with Fastest-Server-First (FSF), a well-known routing policy for such problems in practice and in the literature. Our experiments show that our proposed overflow dynamic routing policies outperform FSF and its extensions, FSFStaticBlock and FSFDynamicBlock. Moreover, to showcase our methodology, we apply our proposed policies to the problem of assigning fire incidents in Irvine, CA, to fire stations.},

The mean customer’s satisfaction level criterion related to flexible due date is introduced to approach an imprecise or flexible nature of the data in a practical manufacturing environment. A novel discrete multi-objective evolutionary algorithm combined with an improved differential evolution algorithm and memetic algorithm (MOIDE-MA) is proposed to solve the multi-objective NWMMSP. The improved discrete differential evolution algorithm (IDE) mainly focuses on the edge area of the Pareto front (PF) space and the single objective guide strategy to construct better reference points. Meanwhile, an information-sharing strategy is introduced in IDE to improve the information diversity and enhance the search capabilities for the whole PF. A novel memetic algorithm (MA) based on genetic algorithm (GA) and local search related to the researched scheduling problem is developed to improve the distribution uniformity and accuracy of the non-dominated solutions obtained by IDE further. IDE gains some useful information extracted from the external archive of MA to speed up its search. Computational and simulation results show that the improvement strategy proposed in the algorithm can effectively improve the performance of MOIDE-MA. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is compared with three other multi-objective scheduling optimization approaches based on different scale multi-objective NWMMSP instances. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed MOIDE-MA.},

  abstract     = {Disasters can disrupt road networks by blocking some of the roads and consequently impeding accessibility to critical locations. In the immediate post-disaster response phase, while the blockage information is yet to be collected, relief distribution crews (RDCs) should dispatch from warehouses to supply critical locations with first aid items. The RDCs are not capable of unblocking damaged roads and should find a way to bypass them once such edges are observed in their routes. With the objective of minimizing total latency of the critical nodes, we study the problem that addresses the relief distribution operations with k k non-recoverable online blocked edges. The online blocked edges are not known to the RDCs initially and the blockage of a blocked edge is revealed when one of the RDCs arrives at one of its end-nodes. Once one of the RDCs knows about a blocked edge, this information is communicated among the rest of the RDCs and they will all be informed about that blocked edge. We first investigate the worst-case performance of online algorithms against offline optimal solutions using competitive ratio . We then prove a lower bound on the competitive ratio of deterministic online algorithms . We also provide an upper bound on the competitive ratio of the optimal deterministic online algorithms by introducing a deterministic algorithm which achieves a bounded competitive ratio. We then develop three heuristic algorithms to solve this problem. One of our algorithms is based on solving an Integer Programming model to find the assignment of the nodes to the RDCs and then finding the routes dynamically. The other algorithms are not based on solving optimization models and hence are more efficient in terms of their computational time. We compare our proposed heuristic algorithms with the best known algorithms from the literature that are developed for a single RDC variation of the problem. Finally, we provide a through computational analysis of our algorithms on instances adopted from real-world road networks .},

We assume that the rework process is imperfect and repeated as many times as needed until a conforming unit is produced or the production run ends. The outcomes of this process can be presented by a tree where each branch represents a sequence of production and rework attempts. We call each branch a scenario. The possible number of branches/scenarios is enormously huge, even for reasonable production periods. We employ novel ideas to characterize all branches/scenarios in order to develop the probability mass function for the number of conforming units produced in a given length of the production period.

  abstract     = {Since the battery remains a significant cost component of electric vehicles (EVs), controlling the depreciation costs of EVs’ batteries is of great importance, especially from the perspective of the electric vehicle routing problem (EVRP). However, most existing studies on the EVRP have not explicitly considered the battery depreciation in the cost function; instead, it has been treated as a linear function of an EV’s travel distance or time. In fact, the depth-of-discharge (DOD) significantly affects the battery life and leads to a naturally nonlinear depreciation function, which can be used to calculate the battery life more accurately. In this paper, we adopt three battery depreciation methods to investigate and compare their influences on the EVRP with time windows (EVRPTW): (1) a nonlinear function of DOD; (2) a linear function of charge–discharge cycles; and (3) a linear function of total traveling distance. The first method is mainly studied, and the remaining two methods are verified as comparative analyses. Meanwhile, both full and partial charge policies are considered to formulate the problem. By combining the charging policies and battery depreciation methods, four mixed-integer programming models are formulated, aiming to minimize the total cost. To pursue exact solutions in acceptable computing time, a column generation algorithm (CG) that relies on four tailored labeling algorithms (LAs) is designed. The LAs are used to accelerate the calculation speed of the pricing problem. The most considerable difficulty of solving pricing problems lies in the complex endogenous relationships among recharging time, drivers’ waiting time, battery state-of-charge (SOC), battery depreciation, battery rated capacity, and driving distance. The LAs need to find a tradeoff among them and generate the shortest paths. Given this, we design specific and elaborate resource extension functions (REFs) for the four models, respectively, which is an extension to Desaulniers et al. (2016). Although the REFs are intricate, they work well with the help of dominance rules. Benchmark instances are performed to verify the efficiencies of the CG and LAs, which shows that instances with 25-nodes are solvable. In computational studies, we find that models considering the DOD can increase the battery life and decrease the total cost by 9\%–10\%. Moreover, several insights for better management of EV fleets are obtained.},

With respect to previously studied VRPs, the MVRPTGC includes the following novel features: (i) segregation of facilities into different tiers that distinguish them in terms of different processing and storage capabilities, (ii) cross-docking at a pre-specified subset of facilities in the network (a feature referred to as global cross-docking ), and (iii) the possibility of spill-over into subsequent planning periods of demand for facility visitation. The problem originated from a real-life application concerning the collection and delivery of pathology specimens in the transportation network of a pathology health-care service provider. Other industrial applications may, however, benefit from this type of VRP, such as mail sorting. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for this VRP is proposed, and tested computationally in respect of seventeen small hypothetical test instances. A multi-objective ant colony optimisation (MACO) algorithm for solving larger real-world instances of the MTVRPGC is also proposed. The solutions returned by the MACO algorithm are compared with those achieved by the MILP in respect to sixteen instances and also compared to actual collection and delivery routes of a real pathology healthcare service provider operating in South Africa and it is found that adopting the routes suggested by the algorithm results in substantial improvements of all the objectives pursued relative to the status quo .},

  abstract     = {Elective surgery patients have surgery in the operating room (OR), and then recover in one or more downstream recovery units for several consecutive hours or days after surgery. Upstream scheduling that focuses on OR alone or a resource-constrained scheduling approach that fails to account for the inherent uncertainty in surgery durations and postoperative downstream recovery times yield sub-optimal or infeasible schedules and, consequently, higher cost and reduced quality of care. However, modeling such uncertainties at multiple levels is challenging, especially with limited reliable data on the random parameters in the models. Moreover, sequencing of surgical and recovery activities, and the multiple conflicting objectives of all parties involved (including management, clinicians, patients), lead to a class of complex combinatorial and multi-criteria stochastic optimization problems. In this review, we focus on stochastic optimization (SO) approaches for elective surgery scheduling and downstream capacity planning.

  abstract     = {Over the years, methods and algorithms have been extensively studied to solve variations of the rectangular two-dimensional strip packing problem (2D-SPP), in which small rectangles must be packed inside a larger object denominated as a strip, while minimizing the space necessary to pack all rectangles. In the rectangular 2D-SPP, constraints are used to restrict the packing process, satisfying physical and real-life practical conditions that can impact the material cutting. The objective of this paper is to present an extensive literature review covering scientific publications about the rectangular 2D-SPP constraints in order to provide a useful foundation to support new research works. A systematic literature review was conducted, and 223 articles were selected and analyzed. Real-life practical constraints concerning the rectangular 2D-SPP were classified into seven different groups. In addition, a bibliometric analysis of the rectangular 2D-SPP academic literature was developed. The most relevant authors, articles, and journals were discussed, and an analysis made concerning the basic constraints (orientation and guillotine cutting) and the main solving methods for the rectangular 2D-SPP. Overall, the present paper indicates opportunities to address real-life practical constraints.},

The problem has several variations, mostly originated from real-world problems. This work presents a literature review of the solution approaches proposed for different MIRP variations, focusing on matheuristic methods that combine heuristic and optimal approaches and are frequently used to solve MIRPs. This work also studies the use of Relax-and-Fix and Fix-and-Optimize matheuristics for solving a specific MIRP variant proposed in the literature. The proposed algorithms were tested over two discrete-time formulations for which different components such as valid inequalities and additional constraints were proposed. Several computational tests were performed to evaluate the contribution of the formulation components and algorithms features on the solution quality and processing time. An automatic configuration tool was used to define the parameter values for the algorithms, as well as the choice of the formulation components to be used in the tests. The results demonstrated that the proposed algorithms are potentially effective for solving the MIRP when applied to a public dataset, obtaining three new best-known solutions from a total of twenty-eight instances.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a hybrid metaheuristic is developed to solve the smart waste collection problem with workload concerns. It is composed by: (i) a look-ahead heuristic aiming at deciding the days in which collection is necessary and which bins need to be collected (must-go) considering the present bin fill levels and future bin fill level predictions; and (ii) a simulated annealing/neighborhood search algorithm to choose the bins that are profitable to collect and the best route(s) to visit the bins. This algorithm was developed to find solutions within a relatively short amount of time (we considered two hours as reference), as required for practical operations. The proposed hybrid metaheuristic is applied to randomly-generated test instances of sizes up to 500 bins and to a real case study of recyclables collection, leading to results that demonstrate its effectiveness and usefulness in practice when dealing with large-size instances. For the real case study, involving a major waste management company in Portugal, the profit achieved by the hybrid metaheuristic is at least 45\% higher than the profit obtained by the company, and, at the same time, compliance with maximum shift duration and route workload balance is clearly better when the metaheuristic is used than in current operations.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies a scheduling problem in which serial and parallel batching decisions must be simultaneously taken. There is a single machine with a fixed capacity that can process multiple jobs at the same time (i.e., parallel batching). Throughout the planning horizon, jobs are released at different instants and they belong to different families. Each job requires one unit of the machine capacity and only jobs of the same family can be processed at the same time. Once a group of jobs is decided to be processed, a preparation time occurs and all jobs are considered completed when the last job of the group finishes its processing (i.e., serial batching). We aim to minimize total flow time (i.e., sum of job completion times, ∑ C j ∑Cj ) and total weighted tardiness ( ∑ w j T j ∑wjTj ) objectives. First, we formulate this problem as an integer linear programming model. Then, we develop a column generation algorithm to solve the linear relaxation which is integrated in a branch and bound tree in search for the integer solution. We use a highly efficient heuristic branching technique for ∑ w j T j ∑wjTj objective and prove its optimality for ∑ C j ∑Cj objective.

In particular, deterministic nature and timeliness guarantees can be achieved by time-triggered communication schedules that are enabled by the IEEE 802.1Qbv standard. However, generating such a schedule is a computationally challenging task due to several harsh constraints that must be satisfied. This problem is usually transformed into some existing formalism, e.g., Satisfiability Modulo Theories, and solved using a general third-party solver, which has the drawback of limited scalability. Except for some one-pass heuristics, such as the earliest deadline first or as-soon-as-possible scheduling, the current literature does not provide any algorithm tailored to this specific problem of scheduling time-triggered traffic in time-sensitive networks. In this paper, we develop an efficient algorithm that does not use any third-party solver and is based on the search in the space of partial schedules while being guided by the discovered conflicts. Our algorithm calculates schedules for problem instances consisting of 2000 network nodes and more than 10 000 flows.},

In this paper we argue that clustering, a popular data mining task, provides a good proxy for visual attractiveness. Our claim is supported by the proposal of a bi-objective capacitated vehicle routing problem in which, in addition to seek for traveling cost minimization, optimizes clustering criteria defined over the customers partitioned in the different routes. The model is solved by a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to approximate its Pareto frontier . We show, by means of computational experiments, that our model is able to characterize vehicle routing solutions with low routing costs which are, at the same time, attractive according to the visual metrics proposed in the literature.},

We present an adaptive large neighborhood search with an embedded random variable neighborhood descent as a local search component and a set-partitioning problem for the recombination of routes to solve various versions of the problem. Thereby, we consider location-dependent time windows as well as heterogeneous fleets and propose several new procedures that consider transshipment facilities within the components of our adaptive large neighborhood search. The proposed method is tested on benchmark instances from the literature as well as newly created benchmark instances. It shows promising results, leading to multiple improvements over existing algorithms from the literature. Moreover, a real-world study is presented to gain managerial insights on the impact of transshipment fees, order size, and heterogeneous fleets on the transshipment decisions.},

  abstract     = {Optimizing expensive black-box systems with limited data is an extremely challenging problem. As a resolution, we present a new surrogate optimization approach by addressing two gaps in prior research—unimportant input variables and inefficient treatment of uncertainty associated with the black-box output. We first design a new flexible non-interpolating parsimonious surrogate model using a partitioning-based multivariate adaptive regression splines approach, Tree Knot MARS (TK-MARS). The proposed model is specifically designed for optimization by capturing the structure of the function, bending at near-optimal locations, and is capable of screening unimportant input variables. Furthermore, we develop a novel replication approach called Smart-Replication , to overcome the uncertainty associated with the black-box output. The Smart-Replication approach identifies promising input points to replicate and avoids unnecessary evaluations of other data points. Smart-Replication is agnostic to the choice of a surrogate and can adapt itself to an unknown noise level. Finally to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches we consider different complex global optimization test functions from the surrogate optimization literature. The results indicate that TK-MARS outperforms original MARS within a surrogate optimization algorithm and successfully detects important variables. The results also show that although non-interpolating surrogates can mitigate uncertainty, replication is still beneficial for optimizing highly complex black-box functions. The robustness and the quality of the final optimum solution found through Smart-Replication are competitive with that using no replications in environments with low levels of noise and using a fixed number of replications in highly noisy environments .},

This problem often integrates employee timetabling and production scheduling. The employee timetabling problem is addressed in the context of skill requirements and under availability and legislative constraints. The production scheduling is considered as a re-entrant hybrid job-shop problem with time lags and sequence dependent setup times, under machine availability constraints. The objective is to minimize the labor cost, while respecting a maximum makespan and a maximum tardiness constraints. Two different models and exact resolution methods are proposed, using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Constraint Programming (CP). Numerical experimentations are conducted to compare and evaluate their performances, based on randomly generated instances. The results show that the CP model is slower than the MILP model in terms of finding optimal solutions for large instances, but is more efficient in generating feasible solutions. Thus, providing a feasible initial solution to the MILP model using the CP model is a promising hybrid approach to reduce the computational time.},
