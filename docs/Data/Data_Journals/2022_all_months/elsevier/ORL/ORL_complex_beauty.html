Let A 2 n A2n be an algorithm that, given any clutter C C over 2 n elements via a filter oracle, decides whether C C is ideal. We prove that in the worst case, A 2 n A2n makes at least 2 n − 1 2n−1 calls to the filter oracle. Our proof uses the theory of cuboids.},

  abstract     = {To operationalize the psychological principle that “occupied time feels shorter than unoccupied time”, it is common for service providers to offer entertainment options in the waiting areas. Typical examples that put in practice this mechanism include amusement parks, car dealers, airports, hospitals, restaurants, etc. In this paper, we study a queueing system where the server provides entertainment services to waiting customers. Assuming customers are strategic and delay-sensitive, we formulate a game-theoretical model and study customers&#39; equilibrium behavior in response to this mechanism. Because offering waiting-area entertainment incurs extra operational costs, we discuss whether and when this option will benefit the service provider and obtain the optimal entertainment capacity that maximizes the system&#39;s profit. Our analysis reveals that this option is appealing if and only if the market size is intermediate and that the optimal capacity of the entertainment is a unimodal function in the market size. Our insights continue to remain valid when the service fee becomes endogenous.},

First we show that in weighted TAP, we can restrict our attention to trees which are binary and where all the non-tree edges go between two leaves of the tree. We then give a top-down coloring algorithm that differs from known techniques for approximating TAP. The algorithm we describe always gives a 2-approximation starting from any feasible fractional solution to the natural tree cut covering LP. When the structure of the fractional solution is such that all the edges with non-zero weight are at least α , then this algorithm achieves a 2 1 + α 21+α -approximation. We also investigate a variant of TAP where every tree edge must belong to a cycle of length three (triangle) in the solution. We give a Θ ( log ⁡ n ) Θ(log⁡n) -approximation algorithm for this problem in the weighted case in n -node graphs and a 4-approximation in the unweighted case.},

  abstract     = {Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) contracts are anchored on a fill rate at which the vendor is expected to meet the end-customer demand. Violations of this contracted fill rate due to excess and insufficient inventory are both penalized, often in a linear, but asymmetric manner. To minimize these costs, the vendor needs to maintain an operational fill rate that is different from the contracted fill rate. We model, analyze and solve an optimization problem that determines this operational fill rate and the associated optimal inventory decision. We establish that, for some special, yet popular, models of demand (e.g. truncated normal, gamma, Weibull and uniform distributions), the optimal solution can be derived in closed form and computed precisely. For other demand distributions, either the optimization problem becomes ill-defined or we may need to use approximate solution methods. An extensive computational study reveals that, for realistic values of problem parameters, the operational fill rate is often larger (by as much as 20\%) than the contracted service level, possibly explaining the inventory glut commonly observed in real-world VMI systems.},

These directions are recurrently investigated in a cyclic semi-random order, where the stepsize of the update is determined via univariate optimization. We establish that any accumulation point of this optimization procedure is a stationary point of the problem, meaning that the directional derivative in any feasible direction is nonnegative. To assess and establish a rate of convergence, we develop a new optimality measure that acts as a proxy for the stationarity condition, and substantiate its role by showing that it is coherent with first-order conditions in specific scenarios. Finally we prove that our method enjoys a sublinear rate of convergence of this optimality measure in expectation.},

We say that a partition of the uncertainty space is adapted to the current first stage control x ˇ xˇ if we can aggregate scenarios while conserving the true value of the expected recourse cost at x ˇ xˇ . The core idea of APM is to iteratively construct an adapted partition to all past tentative first stage controls. Relying on the normal fan of the dual admissible set , we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a partition to be adapted even for non-finite distribution, and provide a geometric method to obtain an adapted partition. Further, by showing the connection between APM and the L-shaped algorithm, we prove convergence and complexity bounds of the APM methods.

In what order should the company build the lines? We formalize a class of permutatorial problems with combinatorial/continuous subproblems capturing applications of incremental deployment. We show that, for additive/linear objective functions, efficient polyhedral methods for the subproblems extend to the permutatorial problem. Our main technical ingredient is the permutahedron.},

By formulating a general problem with random delay and partial prepayment, we find that the effect of delay can be opposite for different prepayment rates. Besides, although the constant delay model is commonly used, we argue that it is a reasonable approximation only if the discount rate is small.},

Unlike traditional matching models, which treat them as passive participants, we allow both sides of the market to exercise their choices. To model this setting, we introduce a two-sided assortment optimization model wherein each participant&#39;s choice is modeled using a multinomial logit choice function, and the platform&#39;s objective is to maximize its expected revenue. We first show that the problem is NP-hard even when the number of suppliers is limited to two and provide a mixed-integer linear programming formulation. Next, we discuss two simple greedy heuristics and argue that these can lead to arbitrarily bad solutions. We then develop relaxations that provide upper and lower bounds and investigate the tightness of these relaxations by obtaining parametric approximation guarantees. Finally, we present numerical results on synthetic data demonstrating the practical utility of these relaxations.},

The peak points are determined by an auxiliary assignment problem.

Many of these applications fall into the “Source-Sink Monotone” framework, a special case of Topkis&#39;s monotonic optimization framework, which implies that the parametric min cuts are nested. When there is a single parameter, this property implies that the number of distinct min cuts is linear in the number of nodes, which is quite useful for constructing algorithms to identify all possible min cuts. When there are multiple Source-Sink Monotone parameters, and vectors of parameters are ordered in the usual vector sense, the resulting min cuts are still nested. However, the number of distinct min cuts was an open question. We show that even with only two parameters, the number of distinct min cuts can be exponential in the number of nodes.},

This paper studies Round Robin&#39;s performance for the ℓ p ℓp -norm of the completion times when scheduling n preemptive jobs on a single machine, for all integral p ≥ 1 p≥1 . We show that if all jobs arrive at the same time Round Robin&#39;s approximation ratio is exactly p + 1 p p+1p .
