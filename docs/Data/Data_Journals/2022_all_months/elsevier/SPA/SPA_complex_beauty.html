Then M t ( ϕ ) = e − λ t 〈 ϕ , X t 〉 , t ≥ 0 , Mt(ϕ)=e−λt〈ϕ,Xt〉,t≥0, is a non-negative martingale with almost sure limit M ∞ ( ϕ ) M∞(ϕ) . In this paper we study the rate at which M t ( ϕ ) − M ∞ ( ϕ ) Mt(ϕ)−M∞(ϕ) converges to 0 as t → ∞ t→∞ when the process may not have finite variance. Under some conditions on the mean semigroup, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions for the rate in the almost sure sense. Some results on the convergence rate in L p Lp with p ∈ ( 1 , 2 ) p∈(1,2) are also obtained.},

  abstract     = {Piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) are a class of stochastic processes with applications in several fields of applied mathematics spanning from mathematical modelling of physical phenomena to computational methods. A PDMP is specified by three characteristic quantities: the deterministic motion, the law of the random event times, and the jump kernels. The applicability of PDMPs to real world scenarios is currently limited by the fact that these processes can be simulated only when these three characteristics of the process can be simulated exactly. In order to overcome this problem, we introduce discretisation schemes for PDMPs which make their approximate simulation possible. In particular, we design both first order and higher order schemes that rely on approximations of one or more of the three characteristics. For the proposed approximation schemes we study both pathwise convergence to the continuous PDMP as the step size converges to zero and convergence in law to the invariant measure of the PDMP in the long time limit. Moreover, we apply our theoretical results to several PDMPs that arise from the computational statistics and mathematical biology literature.},

Assume that the interaction matrix B B is random and follows the elliptic model: B = 1 α n A + μ n 1 n 1 n T , B=1αnA+μn1n1nT, where A = ( A i j ) A=(Aij) is a n × n n×n matrix with N ( 0 , 1 ) N(0,1) entries satisfying the following dependence structure ( i ) (i) the entries A i j Aij on and above the diagonal are i.i.d., ( i i ) (ii) for i i&amp;lt;j each vector ( A i j , A j i ) (Aij,Aji) is standard Gaussian with covariance ρ ρ , and independent from the other entries; vector 1 n 1n stands for the n × 1 n×1 vector of ones. Parameters α , μ α,μ are deterministic and may depend on n n . Leveraging on Random Matrix Theory , we analyze this LV system as n → ∞ n→∞ and study the existence of a positive equilibrium. This question boils down to study the existence of a (componentwise) positive solution to the linear equation : x = r + B x , x=r+Bx, depending on B B ’s parameters ( α , μ , ρ ) (α,μ,ρ) , a problem of independent interest in linear algebra . In the case where no positive equilibrium exists, we provide sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique stable equilibrium (with vanishing components), and following Bunin (2017), present a heuristics estimating the number of positive components of the equilibrium and their distribution. The existence of positive equilibria for large Lotka–Volterra systems has been raised in Dougoud et al. (2018), and addressed in various contexts by Bizeul and Najim (2021) and Akjouj and Najim (2022). Such LV systems are widely used in mathematical biology to model populations with interactions, and the existence of a positive equilibrium known as a feasible equilibrium corresponds to the survival of all the species x k xk within the system.},

  abstract     = {A nested Karlin’s occupancy scheme is a symbiosis of classical Karlin’s balls-in-boxes scheme and a weighted branching process. To define it, imagine a deterministic weighted branching process in which weights of the first generation individuals are given by the elements of a discrete probability distribution. For each positive integer j j , identify the j j th generation individuals with the j j th generation boxes. The collection of balls is one and the same for all generations, and each ball starts at the root of the weighted branching process tree and moves along the tree according to the following rule: transition from a mother box to a daughter box occurs with probability given by the ratio of the daughter and mother weights. Assume that there are n n balls and that the discrete probability distribution ( p k ) k ∈ N (pk)k∈N responsible for the first generation is Weibull-like. This means that the counting function of 1 / p 1 1/p1 , 1 / p 2 , … 1/p2,… belongs to de Haan’s class Π Π , a subclass of the class of slowly varying functions . Denote by K n ( j ) ( l ) Kn(j)(l) and K n ∗ ( j ) ( l ) Kn∗(j)(l) the number of the j j th generation boxes which contain at least l l balls and exactly l l balls, respectively. We prove functional limit theorems (FLTs) for the matrix-valued processes ( K [ e T + ⋅ ] ( j ) ( l ) ) j , l ∈ N (K[eT+⋅](j)(l))j,l∈N and ( K [ e T + ⋅ ] ∗ ( j ) ( l ) ) j , l ∈ N (K[eT+⋅]∗(j)(l))j,l∈N , properly normalized and centered, as T → ∞ T→∞ . The present FLTs are an extension of a FLT proved by Iksanov et al. (2022) for the vector-valued process ( K [ e T + ⋅ ] ( j ) ( 1 ) ) j ∈ N (K[eT+⋅](j)(1))j∈N . While the rows of each of the limit matrix-valued processes are independent and identically distributed, the entries within each row are stationary Gaussian processes with explicitly given covariances and cross-covariances. We provide an integral representation for each row. The results obtained are new even for Karlin’s occupancy scheme.},

  abstract     = {Certain defence mechanisms of phages against the immune system of their bacterial host rely on cooperation of phages. Motivated by this example we analyse invasion probabilities of cooperative parasites in moderately structured host populations. We assume that hosts occupy the vertices of a configuration model and offspring parasites move to neighbouring sites to infect new hosts. Parasites (usually) reproduce only when infecting a host simultaneously and then generate many offspring. In this regime we identify and analyse the spatial scale of the population structure at which invasion of parasites turns from being an unlikely to a highly probable event.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, which is a culmination of our previous research efforts, we provide a general framework for studying mixing profiles of non-backtracking random walks on dynamic random graphs generated according to the configuration model. The quantity of interest is the scaling of the mixing time of the random walk as the number of vertices of the random graph tends to infinity. Subject to mild general conditions, we link two mixing times: one for a static version of the random graph, the other for a class of dynamic versions of the random graph in which the edges are randomly rewired but the degrees are preserved. With the help of coupling arguments we show that the link is provided by the probability that the random walk has not yet stepped along a previously rewired edge. To demonstrate the utility of our framework, we rederive our earlier results on mixing profiles for global edge rewiring under weaker assumptions, and extend these results to an entire class of rewiring dynamics parametrised by the range of the rewiring relative to the position of the random walk. Along the way we establish that all the graph dynamics in this class exhibit the trichotomy we found earlier, namely, no cut-off, one-sided cut-off or two-sided cut-off. For interpolations between global edge rewiring, the only Markovian graph dynamics considered here, and local edge rewiring (i.e., only those edges that are incident to the random walk can be rewired), we show that the trichotomy splits further into a hexachotomy, namely, three different mixing profiles with no cut-off, two with one-sided cutoff, and one with two-sided cut-off. Proofs are built on a new and flexible coupling scheme, in combination with sharp estimates on the degrees encountered by the random walk in the static and the dynamic version of the random graph. Some of these estimates require sharp control on possible short-cuts in the graph between the edges that are traversed by the random walk.},

It is a continuous time percolation model defined by a sequence, ( U e ) e ∈ E d (Ue)e∈Ed , of i.i.d. uniform random variables in [ 0 , 1 ] [0,1] and a positive integer (constraint) κ κ . Each bond e ∈ E d e∈Ed tries to open at time U e Ue ; it succeeds if and only if both its end-vertices belong to at most κ − 1 κ−1 open bonds at that time. Our main results are quantitative upper bounds on the critical time, characterising a phase transition for all d ⩾ 3 d⩾3 and most nontrivial values of κ κ . As a byproduct, we obtain that for large constraints and dimensions the critical time is asymptotically 1 / ( 2 d ) 1/(2d) . For most cases considered it was previously not even established that the phase transition is nontrivial. One of the ingredients of our proof is an improved upper bound for the critical curve, s c ( b ) sc(b) , of the Bernoulli mixed site-bond percolation in two dimensions , which may be of independent interest.},

The expansions involve products of polynomials and trigonometric polynomials . These results also have counterparts for triangular arrays. Our results do not require any additional assumptions. As an application of our expansions we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the classical Edgeworth expansion . It turns out that there are two possible obstructions for the validity of the Edgeworth expansion of order r r . First, the distance between the distribution of the underlying partial sums modulo some h ∈ N h∈N and the uniform distribution could fail to be o ( σ N 1 − r ) o(σN1−r) , where σ N σN is the standard deviation of the partial sum. Second, this distribution could have the required closeness but this closeness is unstable, in the sense that it could be destroyed by removing finitely many terms. In the first case, the expansion of order r r fails. In the second case it may or may not hold depending on the behavior of the derivatives of the characteristic functions of the summands whose removal causes the break-up of the uniform distribution. We also show that a quantitative version of the classical Prokhorov condition (for the strong local central limit theorem) is sufficient for Edgeworth expansions, and moreover this condition is, in some sense, optimal.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a new correlated percolation model on the d d -dimensional lattice Z d Zd called the random length worms model . Assume given a probability distribution on the set of positive integers (the length distribution) and v ∈ ( 0 , ∞ ) v∈(0,∞) (the intensity parameter). From each site of Z d Zd we start POI ( v ) POI(v) independent simple random walks with this length distribution. We investigate the connectivity properties of the set S v Sv of sites visited by this cloud of random walks. It is easy to show that if the second moment of the length distribution is finite then S v Sv undergoes a percolation phase transition as v v varies. Our main contribution is a sufficient condition on the length distribution which guarantees that S v Sv percolates for all v &gt; 0 v&amp;gt;0 if d ≥ 5 d≥5 . E.g., if the probability mass function of the length distribution is ɛ m ( ℓ ) = c ⋅ ln ( ln ( ℓ ) ) ɛ / ( ℓ 3 ln ( ℓ ) ) 1 [ ℓ ≥ ℓ 0 ] m(ℓ)=c⋅ln(ln(ℓ))ɛ/(ℓ3ln(ℓ))1[ℓ≥ℓ0] for some ℓ 0 &gt; e e ℓ0&amp;gt;ee and ɛ ɛ &gt; 0 ɛ&amp;gt;0 then S v Sv percolates for all v &gt; 0 v&amp;gt;0 . Note that the second moment of this length distribution is only “barely” infinite. In order to put our result in the context of earlier results about similar models (e.g., finitary random interlacements, loop percolation, Bernoulli hyper-edge percolation, Poisson Boolean model , ellipses percolation, etc.), we define a natural family of percolation models called the Poisson zoo and argue that the percolative behaviour of the random length worms model is quite close to being “extremal” in this family of models.},

This equation is driven by a spatially homogeneous Gaussian noise, whose covariance function is either integrable, or is given by the Riesz kernel. The novelty is that the noise does not depend on time, which means that Itô’s martingale theory for stochastic integration cannot be used. Using a combination of Malliavin calculus with Stein’s method, we show that with proper normalization and centering, the spatial integral of the solution converges to a standard normal distribution , by estimating the speed of this convergence in the total variation distance. We also prove the corresponding functional limit theorem for the spatial integral process.},

A shuffling of the cards is then obtained by arranging the cards by their increasing x -coordinate values. When there are m cards on the table we show that this random ordering gets mixed in time Ologm . Explicit constants are evaluated in a diffusion limit when the position of m cards evolves as an interesting 2m -dimensional non-reversible reflected jump diffusion in time. Our main technique involves the use of multidimensional Skorokhod maps for double reflections in [0,1]2 in taking the discrete to continuous limit. The limiting computations are then based on the planar Brownian motion and properties of Bessel processes.},

We rigorously analyze the ergodic properties of the isa in the low temperature regime, deducing asymptotic estimates for the spectral gap (or Poincaré constant), optimal in dimension one , and an estimate for the log-Sobolev constant. Our main results indicate that the effective energy barrier can be reduced drastically using the isa compared to the classical over-damped Langevin dynamics. As a corollary, we derive a concentration inequality showing that sampling is also improved by an exponential factor. Finally, we study simulated annealing for the isa and prove that the isa again outperforms the over-damped Langevin dynamics.},

In particular, we show that in multi-scale models, strong random effects may persist in the limit. Depending on the precise model choice, these may take the form of a spatial birth–death process or a Brownian motion. Despite the variety of structures that appear in the limit, we show that they can be tackled in a common framework with the potential to be applicable more generally in order to identify limits in dynamic spatial network models going beyond the examples considered in the present work.},

However, its convergence rate can be significantly reduced if the target distribution is a mixture of multiple densities, especially when each component density concentrates around a different mode. Replica exchange Langevin diffusion (ReLD) is a sampling method that can circumvent this issue. This approach can be further extended to multiple replica exchange Langevin diffusion (mReLD). While ReLD and mReLD have been used extensively in statistics , molecular dynamics, and other applications, there is limited existing analysis on its convergence rate and choices of the temperatures. This paper addresses these problems assuming the target distribution is a mixture of log-concave densities. We show ReLD can obtain constant or better convergence rates. We also show mReLD with K K additional LDs can achieve the same results while the exchange frequency only needs to be ( 1 / K ) (1/K) -th power of the one in ReLD.},

Our model covers the case where both processes are not necessarily quasi left-continuous, allowing them to jump at predictable stopping times. By introducing the Markovian version of the signal, we are able to compute an explicit equation for the filter via the innovations approach.},

The latter in particular reveals how the process X b Xb exits a bounded C 1 , 1 C1,1 domain D D , or equivalently, the structure of the harmonic measure of L b Lb on D D , which consists of the continuously exiting term and the jump-off term. These results are then used to establish, under some mild conditions, Harnack principle and the boundary Harnack principle with explicit boundary decay rate for the operator L b Lb on C 1 , 1 C1,1 open sets.},

We present explicit lower bounds of the corresponding contraction rates. By employing the refined basic coupling and the coupling by reflection, the results are applied to Markov chains whose transitions include additive stochastic noises that are not necessarily isotropic. This can be useful in the study of Euler schemes for SDEs driven by Lévy noises. In particular, motivated by recent works on the use of heavy tailed processes in Markov Chain Monte Carlo , we show that chains driven by the α α -stable noise can have better contraction rates than corresponding chains driven by the Gaussian noise, due to the heavy tails of the α α -stable distribution.},

As the death time and the default time (that τ τ might represent) can be seen when they occur only, the progressive enlargement of F F with τ τ sounds tailor-fit for modeling the new flow of information G G that incorporates both F F and τ τ . In this setting of informational market, the first principal goal resides in describing as explicitly as possible the set of all deflators for ( S τ , G ) (Sτ,G) , while the second principal goal lies in addressing the No-Free-Lunch-with-Vanishing-Risk concept (NFLVR hereafter) for ( S τ , G ) (Sτ,G) . Besides this direct application to NFLVR, the set of all deflators constitutes the dual set of all “admissible” wealth processes for the stopped model ( S τ , G ) (Sτ,G) , and hence it is vital in many hedging and pricing related optimization problems. Thanks to the results of Choulli et al. (2020), on martingales classification and representation for progressive enlarged filtration, our two main goals are fully achieved in different versions, when the survival probability never vanishes. The results are illustrated on the two particular cases when ( S , F ) (S,F) follows the jump-diffusion model and the discrete-time model.},

Such processes are well-suited as infinite-dimensional stochastic covariance models. The class of processes we consider is an infinite-dimensional analogue of the affine processes on the cone of positive semi-definite and symmetric matrices studied in Cuchiero et al. (2011). As in the finite-dimensional case, the processes we construct allow for a drift depending affine linearly on the state, as well as jumps governed by a jump measure that depends affine linearly on the state. The fact that the cone of positive self-adjoint Hilbert–Schmidt operators has empty interior calls for a new approach to proving existence: instead of using standard localization techniques, we employ the theory on generalized Feller semigroups introduced in Dörsek and Teichmann (2010) and further developed in Cuchiero and Teichmann (2020). Our approach requires a second moment condition on the jump measures involved, consequently, we obtain explicit formulas for the first and second moments of the affine process.},

Inspired by martingale techniques coming from the directed polymers literature, we first extend the law of large numbers for SHE obtained in Mukherjee et al.

We further extend the Edwards–Wilkinson regime of the SHE and KPZ equation studied in Gu et al. (2018), Magnen and Unterberger (2018), Dunlap et al. (2020) to the full L 2 L2 -region, along with multidimensional convergence and general initial conditions for the KPZ equation (and SHE), which were not proven before.

  abstract     = {We consider a semimartingale reflected Brownian motion (SRBM) Z Z whose state space is the non-negative quarter plane; the apparently more general case of SRBM in a convex wedge can be transformed to the quarter plane by a simple change of variable. The data of the stochastic process Z Z are a drift vector μ μ , a covariance matrix Σ Σ , and a 2 × 2 reflection matrix R R whose columns are the directions of reflection on the two axes. We consider only the case where R R has non-positive off-diagonal elements, that is, the direction of reflection is either normal or toward the origin from each axis. Under that restriction, we define a dual RBM Z ˆ Zˆ that is constructed using the same data ( μ , Σ , R ) (μ,Σ,R) but with certain sign reversals. Using a time reversal argument, we show the following: to find the distribution of the random two-vector Z ( t ) Z(t) at an arbitrary time t t , assuming that Z ( 0 ) = 0 Z(0)=0 , it suffices to find the probability that the dual RBM Z ˆ Zˆ , starting from an arbitrary point z z in the quarter plane, reaches the origin before time t t . Letting t → ∞ t→∞ and assuming that μ μ and R R jointly satisfy the known condition for positive recurrence of Z Z , we then have the following: to determine the stationary distribution of Z Z , it suffices to determine the probability that the dual RBM Z ˆ Zˆ , starting from an arbitrary point z z , ever reaches the origin.},

Two main settings are considered, maxima of integer-valued downward skipfree Lévy processes and Markovian point process with batch arrivals (BMAPs). For the moments of the finite-time maxima, the procedure is to approximate the time horizon T T by an Erlang distributed one and solve the corresponding matrix Wiener–Hopf factorization problem . For the BMAP , a structural matrix-exponential representation of the factorial moments of N ( T ) N(T) is derived. Moments are then used as a computational vehicle to provide a converging Gram–Charlier series for the point probabilities .

We give basic properties of derangements, such as the moments and marginal distributions of the cycle counts, the number of cycles, and asymptotic distributions for large n n , and we construct, for any given n n , a { 0 , 1 } {0,1} -valued non-homogeneous Markov chain with the property that the counts of lengths of spacings between the 1s have the same distribution as the cycle counts of the random derangement of size n n . Unlike the Feller Coupling, this chain does not couple realizations for different values of n n – the chain must be rerun to get derangements of other sizes. To resolve this issue we construct another { 0 , 1 } {0,1} -valued Markov chain η η whose law coincides with that of the Feller Coupling conditional on no consecutive 1s. The distribution of η η , the so-called “Feller Coupling for random derangements”, arises as the weak limit as n → ∞ n→∞ of the distributions of . Consequently, the asymptotic behavior of finite random derangements may be studied via this coupling. The rate of convergence of to η η is studied via an estimate of their total variation distance. We provide extensive comparisons of these methods, and show that the Markov chain methods generate derangements in time independent of θ θ for a given n n and linear in the size of the derangement.},

  abstract     = {Previous authors have considered optimal stopping problems driven by the running maximum of a spectrally negative Lévy process as well as of a one-dimensional diffusion; see e.g. Kyprianou and Ott (2014); Ott (2014); Ott (2013); Alvarez and Matomäki (2014); Guo and Shepp (2001); Pedersen (2000); Gapeev (2007). Many of the aforementioned results are either implicitly or explicitly dependent on Peskir’s maximality principle, cf. (Peskir, 1998). In this article, we are interested in understanding how some of the main ideas from these previous works can be brought into the setting of problems driven by the maximum of a class of Markov additive processes (more precisely Markov modulated Lévy processes). Similarly to Ott (2013); Kyprianou and Ott (2014); Ott (2014), the optimal stopping boundary is characterised by a system of ordinary first-order differential equations, one for each state of the modulating component of the Markov additive process. Moreover, whereas scale functions played an important role in the previously mentioned work, we work instead with scale matrices for Markov additive processes here; as introduced by Kyprianou and Palmowski (2008); Ivanovs and Palmowski (2012). We exemplify our calculations in the setting of the Shepp–Shiryaev optimal stopping problem (Shepp and Shiryaev, 1993; Shepp and Shiryaev, 1995), as well as a family of capped maximum optimal stopping problems.},

This past year we have found ourselves in the midst of another crisis where government spending and fiscal stimulus is again being considered as a solution. In the present paper, we address this question by formulating an optimal control problem generalizing the model of Radner and Shepp (1996). The model allows for the company to borrow continuously from the government. We prove that there exists an optimal strategy ; rigorous verification proofs for its optimality are provided. We proceed to prove that government loans increase the expected value of a company. We also examine the consequences of different profit-taking behaviors among firms who receive fiscal stimulus.},

N N candidates for a job arrive at times independently uniformly distributed in [ 0 , 1 ] [0,1] . The interviewer knows how each candidate ranks relative to all others seen so far, and must immediately appoint or reject each candidate as they arrive. The aim is to choose the best overall. The 1 / e 1/e strategy is to follow the rule: ‘Do nothing until time 1 / e 1/e , then appoint the first candidate thereafter who is best so far (if any).’ The question, first discussed with Larry Shepp in 1983, was to know whether the 1 / e 1/e -strategy is optimal if one has ‘no information about the total number of options’. Quite what this might mean is open to various interpretations, but we shall take the proportional-increment process formulation of Bruss and Yor (2012). Such processes are shown to have a very rigid structure, being time-changed pure birth processes , and this allows some precise distributional calculations, from which we deduce that the 1 / e 1/e -strategy is in fact not optimal.},

Adopting a Bayesian approach , we assume the stopper has a general continuous prior and is allowed to update their belief about the value of the pinning time through sequential observations of the process. Uncertainty in the pinning time influences both the conditional dynamics of the process and the expected (random) horizon of the optimal stopping problem. We analyse certain gamma and beta distributed priors in detail. Remarkably, the optimal stopping problem in the gamma case becomes time homogeneous and is completely solvable in closed form. Moreover, in the beta case we find that the optimal stopping boundary takes on a square-root form, similar to the classical solution with a known pinning time.},

These processes for this stochastic calculus arise naturally from a stochastic chain rule for functionals of Rosenblatt processes; and some Itô-type expressions are given here. Furthermore, there is some analysis of these results for their applications to problems using Rosenblatt noise.},

  abstract     = {On being told that a piece of work he thought was his discovery had duplicated an earlier mathematician’s work, Larry Shepp once replied “Yes, but when I discovered it, it stayed discovered.” In this spirit we give discussion and probabilistic proofs of two related known results (Moon 1963, Joe 1988) on random tournaments which seem surprisingly unknown to modern probabilists. In particular, our proof of Moon’s theorem on mean score sequences seems more constructive than previous proofs. This provides a comparatively concrete introduction to a longstanding mystery, the lack of a canonical construction for a joint distribution in the representation theorem for convex order .},

  abstract     = {In a classical optimal stopping problem in continuous time the agent can choose any stopping time without constraint. Dupuis and Wang (2002) introduced a constraint on the class of admissible stopping times which was that they had to take values in the set of event times of an exogenous, time-homogeneous Poisson process. This can be thought of as a model of finite liquidity. In this article we extend the analysis of Dupuis and Wang to allow the agent to choose the rate of the Poisson process. Choosing a higher rate leads to a higher cost. Even for a simple model for the stopped process and a simple call-style payoff, the problem leads to a rich range of optimal behaviours which depend on the form of the cost function. Often the agent accepts the first offer — if they are not going to accept an offer then there is no point in putting in effort to generate offers, and thus there may be no offers to accept or decline — but for some set-ups this is not the case.},

  abstract     = {High-dimensional linear regression has been intensively studied in the community of statistics in the last two decades. For the convenience of theoretical analyses, classical methods usually assume independent observations and sub-Gaussian-tailed errors. However, neither of them hold in many real high-dimensional time-series data. Recently (Sun et al., 2019) proposed Adaptive Huber Regression (AHR) to address the issue of heavy-tailed errors. They discover that the robustification parameter of the Huber loss should adapt to the sample size, the dimensionality, and the moments of the heavy-tailed errors. We progress in a vertical direction and justify AHR on dependent observations. Specifically, we consider an important dependence structure — Markov dependence. Our results show that the Markov dependence impacts on the adaption of the robustification parameter and the estimation of regression coefficients in the way that the sample size should be discounted by a factor depending on the spectral gap of the underlying Markov chain .},

In particular, the iterated Gilbert model convergence allows one to derive a scaling limit for Poisson tropical plane curves.

We consider the static and dynamic versions of this problem where the control mechanism is related to the diffusion’s drift via the corresponding scale function. In the static version the diffusion’s drift can be chosen at each point in [0,1], whereas in the dynamic version we are only able to choose the drift at each point at the time of first visiting that point. The dynamic version leads to a novel type of stochastic control problem.},

We prove under relatively weak assumptions that there exists a unique optimal harvesting strategy characterized by an optimal threshold below which the population is maintained at all times by utilizing a local time push-type policy. We also discuss, through Abelian limits, how our results are related to the optimal harvesting strategies when one maximizes the expected cumulative present value of the harvesting yield and establish a simple connection and ordering between the values and optimal boundaries. Finally, we explicitly characterize the optimal harvesting strategies in two different cases, one of which is the celebrated stochastic Verhulst Pearl logistic model of population growth.},

Facing both heterogeneity among banks and the common noise, the central bank aims to find an optimal strategy to minimize the average distance between log-monetary reserves of all banks and the benchmark of some target steady levels. A weak formulation is adopted, and an optimal randomized control can be obtained in the system with finite banks by applying Ekeland’s variational principle . As the number of banks grows large, we prove the convergence of optimal strategies using the Gamma-convergence argument, which yields an optimal weak control in the mean field model . It is shown that this mean field optimal control is associated to the solution of a stochastic Fokker–Planck–Kolmogorov (FPK) equation, for which the uniqueness of the solution is established under some mild conditions.},

We study the flow of ancestral lineages as time goes to the past and show that, properly renormalized, it converges almost surely to the inverse of a drift-free subordinator whose Laplace exponent is explicit in terms of the branching mechanism. The inverse subordinator is shown to be partitioning the current population into ancestral families with distinct common ancestors. When Grey’s condition is satisfied, the population comes from a discrete set of ancestors and the ancestral families have i.i.d. sizes distributed according to the quasi-stationary distribution of the CSBP conditioned on non-extinction. When Grey’s condition is not satisfied, the population comes from a continuum of ancestors which is described as the set of increase points S S of the limiting inverse subordinator. The proof is based on a general result for stochastically monotone processes of independent interest, which relates θ θ -invariant measures and θ θ -invariant functions for a process and its Siegmund dual.},

A second part studies the attraction or repulsion between these critical points. A measure is the correlation function. We prove attraction between critical points when N &gt; 2 N&amp;gt;2 , neutrality for N = 2 N=2 and repulsion for N = 1 N=1 . The attraction between critical points that occurs when the dimension is greater than two is due to critical points with adjacent indexes. A strong repulsion between maxima and minima is proved. The correlation function between maxima (or minima) depends on the dimension of the ambient space.},

Namely, if the noise becomes too rough (i.e., the sum of its Hurst indexes becomes too small), then there is essentially no hope to provide a systematic interpretation of the model, whether directly or through a Wick-type renormalization procedure. This phenomenon can be compared with the situation of a general SDE driven by a two-dimensional fractional noise of index H ≤ 1 4 H≤14 .

  abstract     = {We consider a spatial version of the classical Moran model with seed-banks where the constituent populations have finite sizes. Individuals live in colonies labelled by Z d Zd , d ≥ 1 d≥1 , playing the role of a geographic space, carry one of two types , ♡ ♡ or ♠ ♠ , and change type via resampling as long as they are active . Each colony contains a seed-bank into which individuals can enter to become dormant , suspending their resampling until they exit the seed-bank and become active again. Individuals resample not only from their own colony, but also from other colonies according to a symmetric random walk transition kernel. The latter is referred to as migration . The sizes of the active and the dormant populations depend on the colony and remain constant throughout the evolution. It was shown in den Hollander and Nandan (2021) that the spatial system is well-defined, admits a family of equilibria parametrised by the initial density of type ♡ ♡ , and exhibits a dichotomy between clustering (mono-type equilibrium) and coexistence (multi-type equilibrium). This dichotomy is determined by a clustering criterion that is given in terms of the dual of the system, which consists of a system of interacting coalescing random walks. In this paper we provide an alternative clustering criterion, given in terms of an auxiliary dual that is simpler than the original dual, and identify a range of parameters for which the criterion is met, which we refer to as the clustering regime . It turns out that if the sizes of the active populations are non-clumping (i.e., do not take arbitrarily large values in finite regions of the geographic space) and the relative strengths of the seed-banks (i.e., the ratio of the sizes of the dormant and the active population in each colony) are bounded uniformly over the geographic space, then clustering prevails if and only if the symmetrised migration kernel is recurrent. The spatial system is hard to analyse because of the interaction in the original dual and the inhomogeneity of the colony sizes. By comparing the auxiliary dual with a non-interacting two-particle system, we are able to control the correlations that are caused by the interactions. The work in den Hollander and Nandan (2021) and the present paper is part of a broader attempt to include dormancy into interacting particle systems.},

We provide a Law of Large Numbers , a Central Limit Theorem and large deviation results , as time growths to infinity. The proofs lie on a renewal structure for these processes introduced in Costa et al. (2020) which leads to a comparison with cumulative processes. Explicit computations are made on some examples. Similar results have been obtained in the literature for self-exciting Hawkes processes only.},

In this way we complete Boltzmann’s program of deriving kinetic equations from random dynamics for this simple model.

The neuronal network is modeled by a system of interacting point processes with memory of variable length. The influence of a neuron on another can be either excitatory or inhibitory. To identify the existence and the nature of an interaction we propose an algorithm based only on the observation of joint activity of the two neurons in successive time slots. This reduces the amount of computation and storage required to run the algorithm, thereby making the algorithm suitable for the analysis of real neuronal data sets. We obtain computable upper bounds for the probabilities of false positive and false negative detection. As a corollary we prove the consistency of the identification algorithm.},

That is, SDEs in which the drift terms must be used in order to conclude hypoellipticity. As a corollary of this result, we obtain the almost sure behavior as time goes to zero of a given direction in the equation, even if noise is not present explicitly in that direction. The techniques used to prove the main results are based on large deviations applied to a non-trivial rescaling of the original system. In concrete examples, we show how to find the proper rescaling to obtain the functional LIL. Furthermore, we apply the main results to the problem of identifying regular points for hypoelliptic diffusions. Consequently, we obtain a control-theoretic criteria for a given point to be regular for the process.},

The transition probability of a random walk to a given vertex depends exponentially on the proportion of visits made by all walks to that vertex. The individual proportion of visits is modulated by a strength parameter that can be set equal to any real number. This model covers a large variety of interactions including different vertex repulsion and attraction strengths between any two random walks as well as self-reinforced interactions. We show that the process of empirical vertex occupation measures defined by the interacting random walks converges (a.s.) to the limit set of the flow induced by a smooth vector field . Further, if the set of equilibria of the field is formed by isolated points, then the vertex occupation measures converge (a.s.) to an equilibrium of the field. These facts are shown by means of the construction of a strict Lyapunov function. We show that if the absolute value of the interaction strength parameters are smaller than a certain upper bound, then, for any number of random walks ( m ≥ 2 m≥2 ) on any graph ( d ≥ 2 d≥2 ), the vertex occupation measures converge towards a unique equilibrium. We provide two additional examples of repelling random walks for the cases m = d = 2 m=d=2 and m ∈ { 3 , 4 , 5 } m∈{3,4,5} with d = 2 d=2 .

We give first a detailed analysis of the well-posedness of this interacting system as well as its dynamics in large population. The second aim of the paper is to give a rigorous analysis of the longtime behavior of the mean-field limit process. We provide also numerical evidence that inhibition and retroaction may be responsible for the emergence of limit cycles in such system.},

These conditions also ensure the existence and exponential ergodicity of the Q-process, the process conditioned upon never being absorbed. The technique relies on a coupling procedure that is related to Harris recurrence (for Markov Chains). It applies to general continuous-time and continuous-space Markov processes . The main novelty is that we modulate each coupling step depending both on a final horizon of time (for survival) and on the initial distribution. By this way, we could notably include in the convergence a dependency on the initial condition. As an illustration, we consider a continuous-time birth–death process with catastrophes and a diffusion process describing a (localized) population adapting to its environment.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of big data has led to a growing interest in so-called convergence complexity analysis, which is the study of how the convergence rate of a Monte Carlo Markov chain (for an intractable Bayesian posterior distribution) scales as the underlying data set grows in size. Convergence complexity analysis of practical Monte Carlo Markov chains on continuous state spaces is quite challenging, and there have been very few successful analyses of such chains. One fruitful analysis was recently presented by Qin and Hobert (2022), who studied a Gibbs sampler for a simple Bayesian random effects model. These authors showed that, under regularity conditions , the geometric convergence rate of this Gibbs sampler converges to zero as the data set grows in size. It is shown herein that similar behavior is exhibited by Gibbs samplers for more general Bayesian models that possess both random effects and traditional continuous covariates , the so-called mixed models. The analysis employs the Wasserstein-based techniques introduced by Qin and Hobert (2022).},

We derive a probabilistic representation of the density of the anomalous process under the Feynman–Kac transform by the dual Feynman–Kac transform in terms of the weak dual process X ̂ t and the inverse subordinator { E t ; t ≥ 0 } . We then establish the regularity of the density function, and show that it is the unique mild solution as well as the unique weak solution of a non-local Fokker–Planck equation that involves the dual generator of X and the potential measure of the subordinator S .

  abstract     = {We consider a two-color urn model with multiple drawing and random time-dependent addition matrix . The model is very general with respect to previous literature: the number of sampled balls at each time-step is random , the addition matrix is not balanced and it has general random entries . For the proportion of balls of a given color, we prove almost sure convergence results. In particular, in the case of equal reinforcement averages, we prove fluctuation theorems (through CLTs in the sense of stable convergence and of almost sure conditional convergence, which are stronger than convergence in distribution) and we give asymptotic confidence intervals for the limit proportion, whose distribution is generally unknown.},

Here, π 3 ( n ) π3(n) is the “three-arm probability” that the origin is connected to distance n n by three arms, two open and one dual-closed. We then develop estimates for the existence of shortcuts around an edge e e in the box, conditional on { e ∈ γ } {e∈γ} , to obtain a bound of the form O ( n 2 − δ π 3 ( n ) ) O(n2−δπ3(n)) for some δ &gt; 0 δ&amp;gt;0 .},

  abstract     = {In this paper we analyze metastability and nucleation in the context of the Kawasaki dynamics for the two-dimensional Ising lattice gas at very low temperature with periodic boundary conditions . Let β &gt; 0 β&amp;gt;0 be the inverse temperature and let Λ ⊂ Λ β ⊂ Z 2 Λ⊂Λβ⊂Z2 be two boxes. We consider the asymptotic regime corresponding to the limit as β → ∞ β→∞ for finite Λ Λ and lim β → ∞ 1 β log | Λ β | = ∞ limβ→∞1βlog|Λβ|=∞ . We study the simplified model, in which particles perform independent random walks on Λ β ∖ Λ Λβ∖Λ , while inside Λ Λ particles perform simple exclusion, but when they occupy neighboring sites they feel a binding energy − U 1 −U1&amp;lt;0 in the horizontal direction and − U 2 −U2&amp;lt;0 in the vertical one. Thus the Kawasaki dynamics is conservative inside Λ β Λβ . The initial configuration is chosen such that Λ Λ is empty and ρ | Λ β | ρ|Λβ| particles are distributed randomly over Λ β ∖ Λ Λβ∖Λ . Our results will use a deep analysis of a local model, i.e., particles perform Kawasaki dynamics inside Λ Λ and along each bond touching the boundary of Λ Λ from the outside to the inside, particles are created with rate ρ = e − Δ β ρ=e−Δβ , while along each bond from the inside to the outside, particles are annihilated with rate 1 1 , where Δ &gt; 0 Δ&amp;gt;0 is an activity parameter. Thus, in the local model the boundary of Λ Λ plays the role of an infinite gas reservoir with density ρ ρ . We take Δ ∈ ( U 1 , U 1 + U 2 ) Δ∈(U1,U1+U2) , so that the empty (resp. full) configuration is a metastable (resp. stable) pair of configurations. We investigate how the transition from empty to full takes place in the local model with particular attention to the critical configurations that asymptotically have to be crossed with probability 1. To this end, we provide a model-independent strategy to identify unessential saddles (that are not in the union of minimal gates) for the transition from the metastable (or stable) to the stable states and we apply this method to the local model. The derivation of further geometrical properties of the saddles allows us to use this strategy and to identify the union of all the minimal gates for the nucleation in the isotropic ( U 1 = U 2 U1=U2 ) and weakly anisotropic ( U 1 U1&amp;lt;2U2 ) cases. More precisely, in the weakly anisotropic case we are able to identify the full geometry of the minimal gates and their boundaries. We observe very different behaviors compared to the strongly anisotropic case ( U 1 &gt; 2 U 2 U1&amp;gt;2U2 ). Moreover, we investigate the asymptotics, mixing time and spectral gap for isotropic and weakly anisotropic cases.},

We first present a two-type branching process model of this phenomenon, where an initial population of cells that are sensitive to therapy can produce mutants that are resistant to the therapy. In this model we investigate two random times , the recurrence time and the crossover time. Recurrence time is defined as the first time that the population size of mutant cells exceeds a given proportion of the initial population size of drug-sensitive cells. Crossover time is defined as the first time that the resistant cell population dominates the total population. We establish convergence in probability results for both recurrence and crossover time. We then develop expressions for the large deviations rate of early recurrence and early crossover events. We characterize how the large deviation rates and rate functions depend on the initial size of the mutant cell population. We finally look at the large deviations rate of early recurrence conditioned on the number of mutant clones present at recurrence in the special case of deterministically decaying sensitive population. We find that if recurrence occurs before the predicted law of large numbers limit then there will likely be an increase in the number of clones present at recurrence time , i.e., an increase in tumor diversity.},

We prove—for a wide range of parameters—that if an initial assignment is fixed and we independently sample an Erdős–Rényi random graph, G n , p , then after one step of majority dynamics, the number of vertices of each label follows a central limit law. As a corollary, we provide a strengthening of a theorem of Benjamini , Chan, O’Donnell, Tamuz, and Tan about the number of steps required for the process to reach unanimity when the initial assignment is also chosen randomly. Moreover, suppose there are initially three more red vertices than blue. In this setting, we prove that if we independently sample the graph G n , 1 / 2 , then with probability at least 51\%, the majority dynamics process will converge to every vertex being red. This improves a result of Tran and Vu who addressed the case that the initial lead is at least 10.},

Thus, this MPRE can be expressed as a moving average Itô integral which is a considerable advantage with respect to another MPRE introduced a long time ago by Ayache and Taqqu. Thanks to this advantage, very recently, Loboda, Mies and Steland have derived interesting results on local Hölder regularity , self-similarity and other properties of the recently introduced moving average MPRE and generalizations of it. Yet, the problem of obtaining, on a universal event of probability 1 not depending on the location, relevant lower bounds for local oscillations of such processes has remained open.

This strategy was extended in Grothaus and Stilgenbauer (2014) to Kolmogorov backward evolution equations in contrast to the dual Fokker–Planck framework. We use this mathematically complete elaboration to investigate wide ranging classes of Langevin-type SDEs in an abstract manifold setting, i.e. (at least) the position variables obey certain smooth side conditions. Such equations occur e.g. as fibre lay-down processes in industrial applications. We contribute the Lagrangian-type formulation of such geometric Langevin dynamics in terms of (semi-)sprays and in the end L 2 L2 -exponential ergodicity with explicit rates for the associated Hunt processes.},

In a Bayesian framework, where the unobservable drift is assumed to have a known “prior” distribution, this question reduces to choosing judiciously a stopping time for an appropriate diffusion process in natural scale. We establish structural properties of the solution for the corresponding problem of optimal stopping. In particular, we show that, regardless of the prior distribution, the continuation region is monotonically shrinking in time. Moreover, we provide conditions on the prior distribution that guarantee a one-sided stopping region. Lastly, some concrete prior distributions are studied to illustrate the theoretical results.},

We employ the ordinary differential equation (ODE) method, which relates a stochastic algorithm to its mean ODE, along with a Lyapunov-like function Ψ Ψ such that the geometric convergence of Ψ ( θ n ) Ψ(θn) implies – in the case of an optimization algorithm – the geometric convergence of the expected distance between the optimum and the search point generated by the algorithm. We provide two sufficient conditions for Ψ ( θ n ) Ψ(θn) to decrease at a geometric rate: Ψ Ψ should decrease “exponentially” along the solution to the mean ODE, and the deviation between the stochastic algorithm and the ODE solution (measured by Ψ Ψ ) should be bounded by Ψ ( θ n ) Ψ(θn) times a constant. We also provide practical conditions under which the two sufficient conditions may be verified easily without knowing the solution of the mean ODE. Our results are any-time bounds on Ψ ( θ n ) Ψ(θn) , so we can deduce not only the asymptotic upper bound on the convergence rate, but also the first hitting time of the algorithm.

The two problems are in some sense dual, with one defined in terms of the generator associated with X X and the other in terms of its adjoint. Besides proving wellposedness of the associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations, we describe how they can be used to characterize important properties of the QSD. Of particular note is that the QSD itself can be identified, up to normalization, in terms of the cost potential of the control problem associated with the adjoint.},

In this paper, to reflect a realistic economic setting, we propose a model where the dynamics of the labor income has two main features. First, labor income adjusts slowly to financial market shocks, a feature already considered in Biffis et al. (2015). Second, the labor income y i yi of an agent i i is benchmarked against the labor incomes of a population ≔ y n ≔ ( y 1 , y 2 , … , y n ) yn≔(y1,y2,…,yn) of n n agents with comparable tasks and/or ranks. This last feature has not been considered yet in the literature and is faced taking the limit when n → + ∞ n→+∞ so that the problem falls into the family of optimal control of infinite-dimensional McKean–Vlasov Dynamics, which is a completely new and challenging research field. We study the problem in a simplified case where, adding a suitable new variable, we are able to find explicitly the solution of the associated HJB equation and find the optimal feedback controls. The techniques are a careful and nontrivial extension of the ones introduced in the previous papers of Biffis et al. (2015, 0000).},

We show that under the convolution equivalent condition of Klüppelberg et al. (2004), the sample paths of R on the first excursion which crosses over a high level u can be decomposed into two processes. The first describes the paths in a neighborhood of the origin. The process then takes a large jump into a neighborhood of u . The second process describes the subsequent paths. This sample path behavior is similar to that of X conditioned to cross level u . Using this connection many results concerning, for example, undershoots and overshoots can be easily obtained.},

We assume that we observe several independent r -Pareto processes over equispaced grids of [ 0 , 1 ] but with possibly heterogeneous grid resolutions. We build a test based on the normalized approximate total variations of the paths of these processes. We provide its properties under infill asymptotics and assess its finite sample performance through simulation experiments.

  abstract     = {We introduce and study a new class of optimal switching problems, namely switching problem with controlled randomisation , where some extra-randomness impacts the choice of switching modes and associated costs. We show that the optimal value of the switching problem is related to a new class of multidimensional obliquely reflected BSDEs . These BSDEs allow as well to construct an optimal strategy and thus to solve completely the initial problem. The other main contribution of our work is to prove new existence and uniqueness results for these obliquely reflected BSDEs. This is achieved by a careful study of the domain of reflection and the construction of an appropriate oblique reflection operator in order to invoke results from Jean-François Chassagneux and Adrien Richou (2020).},

The marks are assumed to be conditionally independent given the event times, while the distribution of each mark depends on the event time, that is, time-varying. We first observe an immigration–birth (branching) representation of such a non-stationary marked Hawkes process, and then derive an equivalent representation of the process using the associated conditional inhomogeneous Poisson processes with stochastic intensities. We consider such a Hawkes process in the high intensity regime, where the baseline intensity gets large, while the self-exciting function and distributions of the marks are unscaled, and there is no time-scaling in the scaled Hawkes process. We prove functional law of large numbers and functional central limit theorems (FCLTs) for the scaled Hawkes processes in this asymptotic regime. The limits in the FCLTs are characterized by continuous Gaussian processes with covariance structures expressed with convolution functionals resulting from the branching representation. We also consider the special cases of multiplicative self-exciting functions, and an indicator type of non-decomposable self-exciting functions (including the cases of “ceasing” and “delayed” reproductions as well as their extensions with varying reproduction rates), and study the properties of the limiting Gaussian processes in these special cases.},

These changes are often associated with the occurrence of certain events whose time of occurrence depends on the trajectory of the system itself. Dynamics that take longer to change will be observed more frequently and may dominate in the long run (the only ones observed). This article proposes a Markov chain model, called Self-Switching Markov Chain, in which the emergence of dominant dynamics can be rigorously addressed. We present conditions and scaling under which we observe with probability one only the subset of dominant dynamics.},

These processes describe interacting particle systems of Calogero–Moser–Sutherland type with N N particles. For the root systems A N − 1 AN−1 and B N BN these Bessel processes are related with β β -Hermite and β β -Laguerre ensembles. Moreover, for the frozen case k = ∞ k=∞ , these processes degenerate to deterministic or pure jump processes . We use the generators for Bessel and Dunkl processes of types A and B and derive analogues of Wigner’s semicircle and Marchenko–Pastur limit laws for N → ∞ N→∞ for the empirical distributions of the particles with arbitrary initial empirical distributions by using free convolutions. In particular, for Dunkl processes of type B new non-symmetric semicircle-type limit distributions on R R appear. Our results imply that the form of the limiting measures is already completely determined by the frozen processes. Moreover, in the frozen cases, our approach leads to a new simple proof of the semicircle and Marchenko–Pastur limit laws for the empirical measures of the zeros of Hermite and Laguerre polynomials respectively.},
