  abstract     = {In Cognitive Fit Theory (CFT) based research, there is a consensus about cognitive effort as the underlying mechanism impacting performance. Although critical to the theory, cognitive effort and its direct empirical assessment remain a challenge. In this repeated measures experimental study, we introduce a research model and develop hypotheses based on the fundamental relationships underlying CFT while integrating eye tracking as an approach for assessing cognitive effort. Our study finds that eye tracking technology , specifically fixation-based metrics, can be used in the understanding of cognitive processes initiated by our data representation choices. Specifically, we find that in all tasks except the complex-symbolic task, users experience meaningful change in the physiological assessment of cognitive effort based on the condition of cognitive fit. We contrast our findings to existing research and find that physiological indicators of cognitive effort can provide critical insights often missed in traditional CFT research.},

  abstract     = {Information overload often makes it difficult for consumers to identify valuable online reviews through the traditional “helpful votes” button in the big data era, so it is essential to locate helpful reviews. Unlike the existing efforts that often measure online reviews’ helpfulness one-sidedly, this study takes the intrinsic helpfulness (IH) and extrinsic helpfulness (EH) into account, and the intrinsic-extrinsic comprehensive helpfulness (ICH-ECH) plot can be constructed by ensemble neural network model (ENNM) and time-weighted standard deviation accordingly. Furthermore, this study proposes a measure of EH ignored by previous studies, that is, the percentage of negative replies, which contain useful information that can measure online reviews helpfulness. We corrected it with a time sliding window by an improved iterative Bayesian probability approach (IBPA). In addition, this study further proposes a dynamic time-aware helpfulness ranking (DTAHR) model to dynamically rank reviews and identify beneficial reviews in a short time. We used real data sets from JD.com to conduct all experiments. The experimental results show that the performance of the DTAHR model is significantly better than other strategies. Our findings offer guidelines to evaluate the helpfulness of online reviews from multiple perspectives and rank them dynamically.},

  abstract     = {Over the past few decades, the strategies to perform energy systems analysis have evolved into multiple criteria-based frameworks. However, there still remains a lack of guidance on how to select the most suitable Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) method. These methods provide different decision recommendations for the Decision Makers , including ranking, sorting, choice, and clustering of the alternatives (e.g., technologies or scenarios) under evaluation. They deal with a variety of data typologies and preferences, and lead Decision Makers in shaping the energy systems of the future. Here, we evaluate the MCDA methods used in 56 case studies performing energy systems analysis at different scales. We find that close to 60% of these studies chose an MCDA method that was not the most adequate for the respective decision problem. In particular, this concerned the use of weighting methods (e.g., Analytical Hierarchy Process) in MCDA approaches not suited for this type of weights, sub-optimal selection of MCDA techniques for specific types of problem statements, and lack of handling rather evident interactions in preference models. Our analysis demonstrates that these deficiencies can be overcome by using a recently developed methodology and software that support Decision Makers and analysts in selecting the most suitable MCDA method for a given type of decision-making problem.},

Although current anti-phishing tools achieve high accuracy rates and present a potential solution to this problem, users are often reluctant to rely on the predictions of these competent tools. However, we continue to lack a means of resolving this reluctance—or even an explanation for it. To address this need and advance toward a solution, we investigate the factors that influence users&#39; reliance on anti-phishing tools. Over the course of two studies, we test the effects of tool attributes (i.e., accuracy and frequency of phishing email predictions) and develop a model based on the notions of trust and distrust. Countering the common conjecture that tools are not accurate enough, we find that users&#39; under-reliance is not an artifact of the insufficient accuracy of tools, as even in a 100% accuracy condition, users were under-reliant on tools. Rather, we find that while accuracy increases users&#39; trust in tools, full reliance is inhibited by users&#39; distrust, which is driven by a lack of transparency regarding tools&#39; functionalities and the quantity of predictions provided. Thus, overall, our study shows the limits of accuracy in engendering reliance and explains the under-reliance phenomenon by showing that due to lack of knowledge or understanding, some users prefer to rely on their own inferior judgment instead of trusting and relying on the predictions provided by highly accurate tools.},

  abstract     = {In the recent past, several studies have empirically compared the effectiveness of two or more online marketing channels in influencing consumer behavior. While some of these studies have found that the effectiveness tends to vary across channels, at a conceptual level, there is no clear understanding of why such consumer differences exist. There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop a conceptual understanding of how different online marketing channels work so that they can be deployed effectively. To address this need, we present a conceptual model rooted in prior research in online visit type and competition for attention. Specifically, we examine whether the influence of the type of visit (customer-initiated or firm-initiated) engendered by the marketing channel is moderated by the competition for the consumer&#39;s attention inherent in the channel. The model helps us understand why and how different online channels influence consumers&#39; search and purchase behaviors in different ways. We test our research hypotheses based on this model by conducting an empirical study on data obtained from a major financial services firm and also on data from an online computer retailer. The results from the empirical analysis provide support for our central thesis that competition for attention moderates the influence of the type of visit on online shopping behavior , and help us make important theoretical contributions and identify interesting managerial implications},

One important goal of SEA is to increase sales. Nevertheless, while previous research has studied multiple factors that are potentially related to the outcome of SEA campaigns, effects of these factors on actual sales generated by SEA remain understudied. It is also unclear whether and how such effects change over time in dynamic SEA campaigns that last for an extended period of time. As the first empirical investigation of the dynamic advertisement-sales relationship in SEA, this study builds an advertising response model within a time-varying coefficient (TVC) modeling framework, and estimates the model using a unique dataset from a large e-commerce retailer in the United States. Results reveal the effects of the advertising expenditure, consumer behaviors and advertisement characteristics on realized sales, and demonstrate that such effects on sales do change over time in non-linear ways. More importantly, we find that carryover has a stronger effect in generating sales than immediate or direct response does, and advertisers need to carefully decide how much to bid for higher ad positions. These findings have direct implications for business decision-making to launch more effective SEA campaigns and for SEA platforms to improve their pricing mechanism.},

This is because this shortlisting process is performed in multiple user sessions online across time, the shortlist does not stay as a static list, and product comparison in this stage uses the heuristics internal to individual consumers. The goal of this study is two folds: (1) to approximate user heuristics after B&amp;B product shortlisting using NLP and deep learning techniques, and (2) to identify optimized deep learning models for the representation of key elements of consumer heuristics. This offers an extension of the priming theory into product comparison and shortlisting stages that were traditionally difficult for marketers to tap into. By analyzing the B&amp;B product information repeated visited in user sessions, the formation of shortlists is identified and products in the shortlists can then be compared. Subsequent priming and promotions can therefore be performed closer to the actual purchase. Our study also provides marketers keywords and their associated activated words relevant for crafting marketing messages. As these activation words are extracted from the B&amp;B sites and product reviews that the users had visited repeatedly in long-term tracking sessions, they are analogous to effects produced from user participatory design, an approach popular in the IT world. Our work shows that opportunities for marketing decision support, especially into the shortlisting phase, are now possible through machine learning techniques .

The increased incidences of psychological problems , anxiety associated with the infection, social restrictions, economic downturn, etc., are likely to aggravate with the virus spread and leave a longer impact on humankind. These reasons in aggregation have raised concerns on mental health and created a need to identify novel precursors of depression and suicidal tendencies during COVID-19. Identifying factors affecting mental health and causing suicidal ideation is of paramount importance for timely intervention and suicide prevention. This study, thus, bridges this gap by utilizing computational intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to unveil the factors underlying mental health issues. We observed that the pandemic and subsequent lockdown anxiety emerged as significant factors leading to poor mental health outcomes after the onset of COVID-19. Consistent with previous works, we found that psychological disorders have remained pre-eminent. Interestingly, financial burden was found to cause suicidal ideation before the pandemic, while it led to higher odds of depressive (non-suicidal) thoughts for individuals who lost their jobs.

In this paper, we determine if the star rating of mobile payment apps suitably captures the appropriate customer perception reflected in the textual content of the OCR for the payment apps. We conduct a three-dimensional analysis of 146,914 reviews from two popular mobile payment apps and uncover the sentiment and emotions captured in the review text, and the reactions in the emojis. Our analysis shows that the consolidated sentiment and the happiness emotion obtained from the OCR of mobile payment apps impacts the star ratings more strongly, than other emotions embedded in the text, and reactions in the emojis. The findings also hold good during the Covid-19 pandemic. We propose a novel perception score that captures the nuances in the OCR more effectively and suggest how mobile app providers can use it to arrange the OCR for better compatibility with content. The results of this research will be useful for mobile app providers that depend on OCR for popularizing their apps and will provide them a novel metric based on content, that can leverage OCR better to influence future downloads.},

We utilize a similarity calculation method based on natural language processing (NLP) and text mining to evaluate three dimensions of information timeliness: retrospectiveness, immediateness, and prospectiveness. Public engagement is divided into breadth and depth. The empirical results show that information retrospectiveness is negatively associated with public engagement breadth but positively with depth. Both information immediateness and prospectiveness improved the breadth and depth of public engagement. Interestingly, information richness has a positive moderating effect on the relationships between information retrospectiveness, prospectiveness, and public engagement breadth but no significant effects on immediateness; meanwhile, it has a negative moderating effect on the relationship between retrospectiveness and depth but a positive effect on immediateness, prospectiveness. In the extension analysis, we constructed a supervised NLP model to identify and classify health emergency-related information (epidemic prevention and help-seeking) automatically. We find that public engagement differs in the two emergency-related information categories. The findings can promote a more responsive public health strategy that magnifies the transfer speed for critical information and mitigates the negative impacts of information uncertainty or false information.},

This provides firms with a new avenue to connect and converse with their targeted customers in a dialogue fashion and create better customer engagement . Although customer engagement has been studied, no study to date has focused on the concept of customer engagement in social media through the lens of users&#39; participation in (co)creation of content on social media. To that end, this study strives to conceptualize and validate the concept of customer engagement with a social media post, proposing a research model which investigates the effects of popularity, discourse logic and argument frame on customer engagement with a social media post. This study also investigates to what extent those effects vary by the product lifecycle stage and social media platform type, using secondary data extracted from Instagram and Twitter on a group of products (i.e., vehicles) at different lifecycle stages to address its research objective. This study&#39;s findings would help firms make better decisions on enhancing their customer engagement on social media platforms.},

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown bore a devastating impact on organizations across the globe. In this crisis, organizations belonged to the victim cluster, with a low crisis responsibility. Nevertheless, organizations needed to strategize their crisis responses and communicate with stakeholders to reduce the threat to reputational capital and manage stakeholder reactions in the pandemic. In this paper, we studied organizational Twitter communication during the COVID-19 crisis through the lens of the situational crisis communication theory (SCCT). We analyzed 325,627 tweets collected from the Twitter pages of 464 organizations belonging to the Fortune 500 list. The Twitter data reflected organizational COVID-19 crisis response strategies and demonstrated organizational use of Twitter for crisis communication. We applied lexicon-based emotion mining to identify and measure emotions, and topic mining to measure crisis response topic scores from this large multi-organization dataset. We performed path analysis to test our research model derived from the SCCT. The analysis showed that instructing and adjusting information can minimize threats to organizational reputation in a victim crisis and manage stakeholder reactions. Positive emotions showed a stronger association with behavioral outcomes. Emotion neutral tweets generated more favorable stakeholder reactions. The paper contributes to the literature on situational crisis communication for a victim crisis. The multi-organization data addresses the sensitive inter-organization dependencies and improves the understanding of crisis communication. It provides practitioners an insight into the effect of the COVID-19 crisis response strategies on stakeholder emotions and behavior.},

However, the global outbreak of COVID-19 has significantly changed firms&#39; strategic decision-making landscapes and raised questions regarding the effects of ITBA and BDAC on strategic decision-making as conditioned by COVID-19 characteristics. In this study, we contextualize two important event impact factors (i.e., event criticality and event disruption) in the context of COVID-19 and examine their contingent roles in the effects of ITBA and BDAC on strategic decision-making. Our analyses, based on two-round, multi-respondents matched survey data collected from 175 Chinese firms to elucidate the differential moderating roles of event criticality and disruption of COVID-19 in the impact of ITBA and BDAC on strategic decision speed and quality. The results indicate the event criticality of COVID-19 strengthens the effects of ITBA on decision speed and quality but weakens the influence of BDAC on decision quality. Meanwhile, the event disruption of COVID-19 weakens the influence of ITBA on decision speed and quality but strengthens the effect of BDAC on decision speed and quality. These findings have important theoretical and practical implications, which we discuss in the conclusion.},

  abstract     = {One of the major challenges that confront medical experts during a pandemic is the time required to identify and validate the risk factors of the novel disease and to develop an effective treatment protocol. Traditionally, this process involves numerous clinical trials that may take up to several years, during which strict preventive measures must be in place to control the outbreak and reduce the deaths. Advanced data analytics techniques, however, can be leveraged to guide and speed up this process. In this study, we combine evolutionary search algorithms, deep learning, and advanced model interpretation methods to develop a holistic exploratory-predictive-explanatory machine learning framework that can assist clinical decision-makers in reacting to the challenges of a pandemic in a timely manner. The proposed framework is showcased in studying emergency department (ED) readmissions of COVID-19 patients using ED visits from a real-world electronic health records database. After an exploratory feature selection phase using genetic algorithm, we develop and train a deep artificial neural network to predict early (i.e., 7-day) readmissions (AUC = 0.883). Lastly, a SHAP model is formulated to estimate additive Shapley values (i.e., importance scores) of the features and to interpret the magnitude and direction of their effects. The findings are mostly in line with those reported by lengthy and expensive clinical trial studies.},

First, we empirically estimate the reproduction numbers for two different states. Then, we develop an age-structured compartmental simulation model for the disease spread to demonstrate the variation in the observed outbreak. Finally, we analyze the computational results and show that early trigger social distancing strategies result in smaller death tolls; however, there are relatively larger second waves. Conversely, late trigger social distancing strategies result in higher initial death tolls but relatively smaller second waves. This study shows that decision analytic tools can help policy makers simulate different social distancing scenarios at the early stages of a global outbreak. Policy makers should expect multiple waves of cases as a result of the social distancing policies implemented when there are no vaccines available for mass immunization and appropriate antiviral treatments .},

The formulation considers a flexible time window for each operation line and locomotive traction operations, and minimizes the number of locomotives utilized with their total idle time for train rescheduling and locomotive assignment, respectively. The solution algorithm determines the minimum locomotive fleet size based on the optimal train rescheduling results; it then reduces the traction idle time of locomotives. In response to the uncertainty of COVID-19, two tailored approaches were also designed to recover and remove operation lines, which can insert and cut operation lines based on the results of locomotive assignment.

The increasing prevalence of health-related social media may provide an avenue for drug safety profiling using patients&#39; online posts. Recent advances in machine learning , especially in deep learning , have dramatically benefited ADE detection and extraction. However, despite the wide use of state-of-the-art deep learning models, prior research has predominantly analyzed each post independently instead of treating the relevant posts holistically. In this study, guided by the theories of transfer of learning , we adopted the design science research methodology and developed a deep learning-based approach by innovatively integrating historical profiles for ADE detection and extraction. Our framework—the H istorical A wareness M ulti- L evel E mbedding (HAMLE) model—outperformed existing state-of-the-art benchmarks by large margins. We also validated its real-world safety monitoring application using the Food and Drug Administration&#39;s drug safety warnings, and it showed promising performance in identifying previously unknown ADEs. This confirmed its potential for use as an early warning system for postmarketing surveillance . Furthermore, to evaluate the generalizability of HAMLE, we further tested it on a formal medical dataset extracted from PubMed , and it demonstrated robustness and achieved new state-of-the-art results. Our strategy of building a historical awareness deep learning model, inspired by extant theories, could create a new way to integrate historical profiles and characteristics to support various business tasks in different domains.},

This gap presents challenges for decision makers because of the consequent lack of quantitative information about the level of resilience and its impact on project performance throughout a project&#39;s life. We argue that managers can be supported by a priori information about past similar projects as well as new data that evolve during disruption and recovery stages to enhance decision making by key project leaders, such as funders when approving new projects, project managers when developing the detailed plan, and project owners when approving corrective actions following a major disruption. Therefore, this paper develops a mathematical model to measure the level of project resilience by predicting disruption and recovery profiles based on past similar completed projects, as well as actual events unique to the project at hand. We illustrate and validate the model based on a portfolio of 43 major projects that faced disruptions from various sources. Our results provide the first empirical evidence to measure the impact of project resilience on the disruption and recovery behavior of real-life projects. The outputs of this research can be used as a decision support system that enables managers to make informed decisions throughout a project&#39;s life.},

Drawing from the elaboration likelihood model (ELM), we take the visual attributes that are relevant to the informativeness of thumbnails (e.g., element complexity and object complexity) as central route cues, take the visual attributes that are relevant to the aesthetics of thumbnails (e.g., celebrity endorsement, colorfulness, brightness, and image quality) as peripheral route cues, and explore the relation between these visual attributes of thumbnails and the view-through of videos using 3,745 marketing videos posted by 38 top brands across 4 industries – the automobile, beverage, restaurant, and toy industries – on YouTube. We construct our variables by extracting features from thumbnails using image mining techniques. Our study contributes to the literature on information systems and marketing by enhancing our understanding of the role of the visual attributes of images in persuading viewers in the online environment.

In particular, we investigate the behavior of coordinated accounts within a large set of retweet-based information cascades identifying key differences between coordinated and non-coordinated accounts in terms of position within the cascade, action delay and outreach. On average, coordinated accounts occupy higher positions of the information cascade (i.e., closer to the root), spread messages faster and involve a slightly higher number of users. When considering cascade metrics such as size, number of edges and height, we observe clear differences among information cascades that are associated to a systematically larger proportion of coordinated accounts, as confirmed by comparisons with statistical null models. To further characterize the activity of coordinated accounts we introduce two new measures capturing their infectivity within the information cascade (i.e., their ability to involve other users) and their interaction with non-coordinated accounts. Finally, we find that the interaction pattern between the two classes of users follows a saturation-like process. A larger-scale targeting of non-coordinated users does not require a larger amount of coordinated accounts after a threshold value ~50%, after which involving more coordinated accounts within a cascade yields a null marginal effect. Our results contribute to shed light on the role of coordinated accounts and their effect on information diffusion .},

Hence, managers strive heavily to apply security measures that keep their employees safe from these risks, thereby relying on insights from security researchers who have predominantly focused on recipient characteristics, message attributes, and interventions to explicate the phishing susceptibility of individuals. A theoretical lens yet to be explored is the discrete context in which individuals encounter phishing attacks. This paper presents a multi-dimensional model – comprising the three contextual components social, task, and physical – that explains why an employee is likely to fall for phishing emails or not. To empirically validate our model, we conducted a field study among 2302 employees of an internationally operating pharmaceutical company in the United States. By combining employees&#39; behavioral responses to a phishing email, training data , and contextual data, like help desk reliance, job status or workspace, we find that context is key to a more thorough understanding of phishing susceptibility.

  abstract     = {To target crowding at locations, decision support systems (DSS) increasingly feature crowding information (CI) to indicate how much of a location&#39;s available capacity is occupied. Yet, little is known about how and why the timeliness of such CI (e.g., “updated just now”) influences users&#39; selections of differently crowded locations and the effectiveness of location recommendations. Addressing this knowledge gap is, however, important to understand how to design DSS interfaces that prevent (over)crowding and improve related DSS reuse intentions. Drawing on construal level theory, we applied a mixed-methods approach comprising a quantitative and a complementary qualitative study . First, we conducted an online experiment in which 171 participants selected between differently crowded bars. The quantitative data provides evidence that high (vs. low) timeliness of CI leads users to select less crowded bars and raises users&#39; DSS reuse intentions. Yet, the effect of high (vs. low) timeliness of CI on location selection is unexpectedly cancelled out when location recommendations are displayed. In subsequent qualitative interviews with DSS users we find that even though high (vs. low) timeliness of CI affords more conscious elaboration on CI&#39;s costs and benefits and increased trusting beliefs, present (vs. absent) location recommendations decrease one&#39;s cognitive effort and are more influential than timeliness of CI with regard to the actual location selection. Furthermore, high (vs. low) timeliness of CI enhances positive user perceptions, explaining the increased DSS reuse intentions. Overall, we provide novel insights on the role of timeliness of information for DSS to influence crowding behavior.},

While prior research in IS has shown that cloud market consumers do not substitute identical spot instances across distant locations or regions due to costs associated with latency, there is a paucity of research examining spot price dynamics of similar instances which are same along only some of the dimensions (or characteristics) within a region. Using the economic theory of substitution in production and consumption as our theoretical lens, our empirical analysis finds evidence that consumers substitute similar computing resources in the spot market. Further, we find that while hardware configuration similarity between two instances is positively related to spot instance substitution, this substitution effect along hardware configuration is moderated by similarity along hardware capacity and location (zone). Our work contributes to the literature on cloud spot market by providing empirical evidence of the substitution effect among similar spot resources within a region, and thus help in understanding the choices of consumers in this market. We conclude by discussing how practitioners can leverage these findings in the procurement of computing resources from cloud spot market.},

  abstract     = {Depression is a leading mental health problem affecting 300 million people globally. Recent studies show that social networks provide a tremendous potential for mental health professionals as a source of supplemental information about their patients. This study presents a methodological framework for clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) through analysis of social network data to distinguish the language usage of individuals with early signs of depression (i.e., contrast language analysis). By analyzing the contrast language patterns of different user groups, we are able to uncover constructive and actionable insights into the pain points and characteristics of users with signs of depression as decision support mechanisms for clinicians during intervention, (early) diagnosis and treatment plans. First, we discover terms that represent contrasting language by analyzing the percentage difference of terms in two user groups, labeled as”depressed” and”non-depressed” for ease of reference. Second, by building topic models based on social network contents, the topic-level contrast features are discovered. Finally, we consider the structure of the social network to discover the network-level contrast features . To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we present a case study on early depression detection using a real-world dataset. The proposed framework has methodological contributions in enhancing the features and functionalities of CDSS for clinicians. It also contributes to evidence-based health research through cost-effective data and analytical insights that can supplement or improve the traditional survey and time-consuming interview methods.},

In this paper, we study the influence of contact center variables in predictive models for debt collection, which are combined with the financial information of late payers. We explore five different variants of three predictive analytics tasks: (1) the probability of successfully contacting a late payer, (2) the probability of achieving a contact that results in a promise to pay a debt, and (3) the probability that a defaulter repays his/her arrears. Four research questions are developed in the context of debt collection analytics and empirically discussed using data from a Chilean financial institution.

We analyze the individual-level transaction data provided by one of the world&#39;s largest mobile lending platforms. Focusing on identifying behavior-based predictors of financial transactions, we propose that mobile phone calling activities constitute a valuable measure of social capital. Drawing on the theoretical foundation of social capital theory , we identify and study two types of calling activities: incoming calls and outgoing calls, strong ties and weak ties. Our analysis shows that the more incoming calls a borrower usually receives, the less likely he or she is to default on a loan. However, the more outgoing calls a borrower makes, the more likely default will occur. We further find that calling activities associated with stronger social ties have greater predictive power for loan defaults than those associated with weaker ties. These findings demonstrate the relevance of phone call activities in consumers&#39; financial decisions. They provide micro-lending companies with valuable alternatives for assessing borrower creditworthiness beyond “hard information”, such as credit scores and income, and further help them make more effective loan decisions.},

  abstract     = {The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in risk-sensitive environments is still in its infancy because it lacks a systematic framework for reasoning about risk, uncertainty, and their potentially catastrophic consequences . In high-impact applications, inference on risk and uncertainty will become decisive in the adoption of AI/ML systems. To this end, there is a pressing need for a consolidated understanding on the varied risks arising from AI/ML systems, and how these risks and their side effects emerge and unfold in practice. In this paper, we provide a systematic and comprehensive overview of a broad array of inherent risks that can arise in AI/ML systems. These risks are grouped into two categories: data-level risk (e.g., data bias, dataset shift, out-of-domain data, and adversarial attacks) and model-level risk (e.g., model bias, misspecification, and uncertainty). In addition, we highlight the research needs for developing a holistic framework for risk management dedicated to AI/ML systems to hedge the corresponding risks. Furthermore, we outline several research related challenges and opportunities along with the development of risk-aware AI/ML systems. Our research has the potential to significantly increase the credibility of deploying AI/ML models in high-stakes decision settings for facilitating safety assurance, and preventing systems from unintended consequences .},

We created four predictors - review depth , review divergence , semantic entropy and keyword relevance to build our primary empirical models.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for evaluating the risk of underwriting premium fraud at the time of application in the presence of potentially misrepresented self-reported information. The aim of the approach is to support insurance companies in identifying fraudulent applications and their decisions to underwrite insurance contract propositions . Likewise, it can be use to make straight-through processing (i.e. automated) underwriting systems more fraudproof, by e.g., triggering a validation on applications prone to misrepresentations. Our approach is based on conditional density estimates for a set of validated contracts. The proposed approach does not require historical fraud labels and can adapt to changes in pricing policy. Moreover, the approach can be used to detect outliers in addition to predicting underwriting fraud and is extended to multivariate self-reported data. We further demonstrate a link between Shapley values in common conditional expectation problems and conditional density estimations to make our approach explainable. We report a case study involving motor insurance underwriting, in which a driver&#39;s identity and driving record can be misrepresented to benefit from an unduly low premium; the results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for detecting and preventing underwriting fraud.},

Its sheer numbers, together with social and environmental sustainability concerns, and the move towards digitalization of customer-centric operations, make the fashion business a prime target for Decision Support Systems (DSSs). On the other hand, decision support in fashion retail is particularly problematic and embraces all major supply chain domains. Decisions in an online fashion retail supply chain (FRSC) are highly dependent on time-varying customers&#39; preferences and product availability, often leading to a combinatorial explosion. To address such a problem, DSSs could greatly benefit from high-quality information stored in customer models (CMs), constructed by using Artificial Intelligence techniques, allowing informed decisions on how to personalize (adapt) to match the customer&#39;s needs and preferences. Combinations of CMs with recommender systems (RSs) have been increasingly utilized in fashion e-commerce to provide personalized product recommendations. Nevertheless, works on enhancing CMs for e-commerce or other decision-making chain domains are scanty. This paper offers a systematic review of the literature on fashion CMs with applications to decision-making in FRSCs, mining topics for a research agenda. Research on the theme is relevant and urgent for the fashion business, which is still in its infancy. Work on the agenda topics could benefit distinct fashion stakeholders, not just customers, and produce well-grounded decision-making in varied FRSC contexts and dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Process mining is one of the most active research streams in business process management. In recent years, numerous methods have been proposed for analyzing structured process data. In many cases, however, only the digitized parts of processes are directly captured by process-aware information systems , whereas manual activities often leave blind spots in the process analysis. While video data can contain valuable process-related information that is not captured in information systems, a standardized approach to extracting event logs from unstructured video data remains lacking. To solve this problem and facilitate the systematic usage of video data in process mining, we have designed the ViProMiRA, a reference architecture that bridges the gap between computer vision and process mining.

  abstract     = {Do people care equally about reputational gains and losses? We study this question by analyzing users&#39; contribution to online knowledge repositories , with data from StackOverflow.com , a website for user-curated technical questions and answers. Based on an analysis of about 1.2 million data points (22% of all relevant activity during a six-month period on this website) focusing on consistent, regular contributors, we find that users post fewer answers after receiving upvotes as well as downvotes. This is surprising and not consistent with rational behavior, because it is in the best interest of a user to post more answers after a downvote. Interestingly, users who receive downvotes post significantly fewer answers compared to users who receive upvotes. This suggests that reputational losses (downvotes) elicit a stronger reaction in users than reputational gains (upvotes), suggesting the presence of reputational loss aversion, after controlling for alternative explanations. Overall, users&#39; reaction is about twice as strong for reputational losses as for gains. Loss aversion as indicated by relative reaction to downvotes compared to upvotes is convex in reputation – it is stronger among users in the higher reputation segments compared to the lower and middle ranges. Our paper is novel in extending the study of loss aversion to reputational settings, and studying ex post loss aversion, as compared to ex ante loss aversion in prior literature.},

First, we build upon information diagnosticity theory to address the need for explainable classifications empowering regulators to justify their actions. Second, we consider a bag-of-words representation and ensemble learning to ensure high classification accuracy . Third, we take into account author characteristics to avoid discriminating classifications. We evaluate our approach in the financial services industry and show its value for identifying consumer complaints resulting in monetary compensations.

Among others, they need to understand how these resources act in groups to achieve organizational outcomes. Accurate and timely information is a sine qua non to achieve this understanding. Process mining can be exploited for the purpose of deriving organizational models from event logs that contain resource-related data. But existing process mining techniques are not fully up to this task, as they are not able to cope with the multi-faceted nature of business processes and are not yet able to determine how resource groupings are involved in process execution. In addition, there is no provision for how to evaluate the quality of discovered organizational models. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework, OrdinoR , capable of supporting discovery of organizational models using event logs, their evaluation, and their analysis. OrdinoR is constructed around a rich notion of organizational model where resource groupings are linked to multiple dimensions of process execution. The framework also provides a set of measures for systematically evaluating such models and analyzing the behavior of resource groups therein. Experiments have been conducted to evaluate the framework using a publicly available real-life dataset. These demonstrate the usefulness of the approach.},

  abstract     = {Other than banks, non-financial companies also continuously monitor and analyze their credit risk exposure to avoid possible counterparty defaults. Credit default swaps are commonly used financial instruments that provide information on a counterparty&#39;s creditworthiness. Although this metric can provide crucial insights, the underlying price dynamics often remain unknown and require further explanation. Data-driven decision-making is a key concept for identifying these reasons and supporting and justifying decisions. In this paper, we provide such justifications by applying sentiment and topic analysis to company-related financial analyst reports. While the contents of financial news have been analyzed in the past, analyst reports can offer additional insights, as seasoned analysts use them to disseminate in-depth research to experienced investors. This analysis examines 3386 analyst reports covering constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index in the period from 2009 to 2020. The results suggest that even when established credit risk indicators and financial news are considered, the sentiment and a subset of topics are correlated with changes in the credit default swap spread, indicating a fundamental relationship between quantitative risk metric and analyst reports. We find that analyst reports contain information related to the change in credit default swap spreads, an insight that helps to improve our understanding of existing risk assessments. The outcome indicates that banks or corporate risk managers can benefit from complementing established financial metrics and even financial news data with new insights derived from analyst reports.},

The present study examines the characteristics and implications of maturation in the equity crowdfunding industry via the lens of industry life cycle theory. Specifically, we explore whether the industry is reverting to traditional entrepreneurial finance practice, or whether it retains its original distinguishing characteristics. Accordingly, we first assess changes with respect to users (investors) and products (campaigns and investment objects). Second, we assess the implications of these changes by comparing the determinants of fundraising campaign success in earlier and later industry stages. We use a longitudinal database and survey data sourced from a long-standing European equity crowdfunding platform. We show that equity crowdfunding seems to be converging towards traditional entrepreneurial finance practice, yet maintaining certain unique features stemming from digitality, platform nature, and investor diversity. Specifically, we show that (1) fundraising ventures and their campaigns have become larger and more professional, and (2) engaged investors became more knowledgeable and return-oriented. Accordingly, traditional investment criteria, such as team and commercial terms ratings, have become more important predictors of campaign success, and easily observable campaign characteristics, such as B2C business models, and minimum investment thresholds, less so. The findings support platform managers and entrepreneurs as they plan for campaigns seeking to attract investors in the industry&#39;s later stages.},

  abstract     = {Subscription-based video streaming has recently become the main revenue driver in the home entertainment industry. Whether and how it affects the sales of physical media, which was previously the industry&#39;s largest revenue source for decades, is still not well understood. We answer this question using a natural experiment that occurred on October 1, 2015, when the content owner Epix switched its streaming partner from Netflix to Hulu. This event created an exogenous shock that significantly reduced the streaming availability of Epix&#39;s content because of the difference in the market shares of the two streaming service providers at the time. This occurrence allows us to investigate the causal effect of subscription streaming on physical DVD sales. Our difference-in-differences analysis shows that the decline in the streaming availability of Epix&#39;s content caused an increase of 36.07% in its monthly DVD sales during the 15 months after the event. We also find that the cannibalization between these two channels is much stronger for movies with higher level of content stickiness (e.g., more recent titles, and titles with a general audience (G) or parental guidance (PG) rating or belonging to the children/family genre). Our findings provide important implications for content owners on how to balance physical sales with revenues from streaming licenses.},

While deep learning models can handle such data, most of the results from these models are uninterpretable. This greatly limits their value in applications aimed at better understanding multicategory shopping behavior and assisting managerial decision-making. Thus, a new approach is needed to analyze high dimensional consumer shopping data in an efficient and interpretable manner, with the potential to greatly strengthen decision support systems for managers especially at large consumer packaged goods firms and giant retailers. We propose a Bayesian deep learning approach based on Variational Autoencoder (VAE) designed to efficiently capture often complex and multifaceted interrelationships across items in the shopping baskets, in the form of substitute and complementary cross effects (which are observable and controllable) and coincidences (which are not). The benefits of the proposed approach are empirically demonstrated by applying our model to a high dimensional supermarket shopping dataset covering very large numbers of products at the stock-keeping unit (SKU) level, households, and shopping trips. We discuss implications for managerial decision-making and identify promising research directions.},

Existing research has invested much effort into developing comprehensive features and advanced techniques to detect fraudulent reviewers. However, most of these studies have ignored the data imbalance problem inherent in fraudulent reviewer detection: non-fraudulent reviewers are the majority, while fraudulent reviewers are the minority in real practice. To fill this gap, we propose a novel approach called ImDetector to detect fraudulent reviewers while handling data imbalance based on weighted latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence. Specifically, we develop a weighted LDA model to extract the latent topics of reviewers distributed on the review features. Asymmetric KL divergence is adopted to make the similarity measure between reviewers biased toward the fraudulent minority when using the K -nearest-neighbor for classification. By mapping the reviewers to the latent topics of features derived from the weighted LDA model and measuring the similarities between reviewers using asymmetric KL divergence, the data imbalance problem in fraudulent reviewer detection is alleviated. Extensive experiments on the Yelp.com dataset demonstrate that the proposed ImDetector approach is superior to the state-of-the-art techniques used for fraudulent reviewer detection. We also explain the experimental results and present the managerial implications of this paper.},

Unfortunately, research on the transformation of communication has produced conflicting results, creating tension regarding its efficacy among healthcare professionals. In this paper, we propose that nurse and physician communication performance mediate the relationship between health IT implementation and patient outcomes. We test the mediating role of communication with a hospital-level data set spanning 2011 through 2015. The specific health information technologies we investigate include EMR documentation, computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems, clinical decision support (CDS) systems, and health information exchanges (HIE). Our results provide that EMR documentation, CPOE, and HIE directly improve communication between care providers and patients as well as patient outcomes. Further, nurse-patient and physician-patient communication mediates the relationship between health IT implementation and patient outcomes. The mediating effect extends the positive benefits to patient outcomes following technology implementation. We also find that poor communication with patients directly increases mortality, decreases satisfaction, and decreases loyalty. Surprisingly, CDS has a negative relationship on communication and patient outcomes. Our findings contribute to the information systems and healthcare literatures by demonstrating the need to account for the multidimensional nature of healthcare and by providing context for the positive and negative effects previously discovered. Furthermore, the results offer practical and theoretical implications for leveraging specific health IT adoption and for realigning federal incentive structures for hospitals.},

It provides consumers with useful information while potentially revealing the storyline, that is, spoiling the surprise of what will happen. Prior studies have focused on the impact of spoilers on consumers&#39; experiences through psychological experiments. However, the relationship between spoilers and narrative product sales has rarely been empirically explored. To fill this gap, the current study explores the impact of spoilers on the movie box office revenue and how this impact evolves over time. We collected 279,433 reviews of 465 films on a leading community website in China and constructed a dynamic generalized method of moments (GMM) model with instrumental variables to empirically examine the spoiler effect in the movie market. Our findings indicate that spoilers have a negative influence on the movie box office revenue. However, this impact is limited to the first 6 days after the movie is released. We also discover that spoilers have a stronger negative effect on narrative-based movies than non-narrative-based movies. Furthermore, eWOM volume and eWOM variance negatively moderate the spoiler effect on the box office revenue, but the moderating effect of eWOM valence is not significant. These findings can deepen movie industry decision makers&#39; and platform providers&#39; understanding of spoilers, helping them devise more feasible eWOM operation strategies.},

We collect data of over 44,000 voice interactions regarding lung disease from 889 physicians on a leading online health platform. By using the theoretical lens of emotional contagion , we find that the voice pitch and intensity of physicians, respectively, positively and negatively affect patient-perceived satisfaction, in turn positively affecting physician economic returns in the postinteraction stage. However, the negative effect of intensity is low for physicians with high recommendation popularity (a factor in the preinteraction stage), suggesting that physician-inherent information has an anchoring effect . These findings not only provide new insights into the literature on online physician–patient interaction by identifying the novel nonverbal cues of physician voice, their consequent effects, and boundary conditions, but also provide decision support for physicians and platform managers.},

  abstract     = {A network is a form of data representation and is widely used in many fields. For example, in social networks, we regard nodes as individuals or groups, and the edges between nodes are called links, that is, the interaction between people. By analyzing the interaction of nodes, we can learn more about network relationships. The core idea of link prediction is to predict whether there is a new relationship between a pair of nodes or to discover hidden links in the network. Link prediction has been applied to many fields such as social networking , e-commerce, bioinformatics, and so on. In addition, many studies have used graph embedding for link prediction, which effectively preserves the network structure and converts node information into a low-dimensional vector space. In this research, we used three graph embedding approaches: matrix decomposition based methods, random walk based methods, and deep learning based methods. Since each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, we propose an ensemble model to combine these graph embeddings into a new representation of each node. Then, we designed a two-stage link prediction model based on a multi-classifier ensemble and took the new node representation as its input. Performance evaluation was conducted on multiple data sets. Experimental results show that the integration of multiple embedding methods and multiple classifiers can significantly improve the performance of link prediction.},

Product designers frequently aim to consider consumer preferences in their work, but many firms are unsure of how best to harness this online feedback given that textual data is both unstructured and voluminous. In this study, we use text mining tools to propose a method for rapid prioritization of online reviews, differentiating the reviews pertaining to innovation opportunities that are most useful for firms. We draw from the innovation and entrepreneurship literature and provide an empirical basis for the widely accepted attribute mapping framework, which delineates between desirable product attributes that firms may want to capitalize upon and undesirable attributes that they may need to remedy. Based on a large sample of reviews in the countertop appliances industry, we demonstrate the performance of our technique, which offers statistically significant improvements relative to existing methods. We validate the usefulness of our technique by asking senior managers at a large manufacturing firm to rate a selection of online reviews, and we show that the selected attribute types are more useful than alternative reviews. Our results offer insight in how firms may use online reviews to harness vital consumer feedback.},

  abstract     = {Taiwan, located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, is highly vulnerable to the destructive impact of powerful earthquakes. When a massive earthquake occurs, failure to take proper measures can lead to massive casualties, collapse of public facilities, and disruption to traffic networks. Among the many post-disaster management strategies, efficient evacuation is absolutely critical as it can potentially reduce the number of casualties substantially. At present, most post-disaster evacuation decisions are made based on past experience, but the rarity of high-magnitude earthquakes impedes the rate at which the quality of the decision-making process can improve. As such, this study primarily aims to develop an efficient and credible evacuation simulation modeling framework which can be used as a powerful tool to bolster evacuation strategies. The simulation evacuation framework we propose is known as the Stochastic Pedestrian Cell Transmission Model (SPCTM). The model is built based on real data of the mapping of roads and emergency shelters in an urban environment, as well as predictive models of pedestrian flow, the number of people needed to be evacuated after an earthquake, and the impact of earthquakes on urban infrastructure. Much of the data is provided by the Taiwan Earthquake Impact Research and Information Application platform (TERIA) developed by the National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction (NCDR). Applying this data, the model divides the traffic network into a cellular structure, applies the concepts of inflow and outflow to represent population movement and uses random variables to simulate the selection behavior of pedestrian agents. In addition to SPCTM, we propose an alternative model which makes slight modifications to SPCTM to offer users a complementary framework in which evacuees are armed with less ideal information about the evacuation situation. An empirical study is run in a district of Taipei, Taiwan based on a simulated earthquake of magnitude 6.5 in which the overall and moment-by-moment simulation evacuation process is presented. The use of SPCTM as a simulation evacuation model is compared to the current government evacuation policy in Taiwan. Further potential benefits of using the proposed simulation evacuation tool are numerous. For example, the frameworks proposed in this study can offer valuable insights to policy-makers on infrastructure design decisions and evacuation strategies before an earthquake occurs, including the best placement of relief centers, to potentially significantly reduce the number of casualties. Also, simulation results can be utilized after a disaster to assist in crucial decisions related to road restoration priorities, distribution of supplies to shelters, etc.},

  abstract     = {With the growing popularity of online Q&amp;A communities, motivating continuous high-quality knowledge contribution is a key challenge for sustainable community development. Although feedback mechanisms are designed to meet this challenge, there is still no comprehensive understanding of the impact of feedback. Most previous research focuses on feedback valence (i.e., positive or negative) but ignores potential differences associated with the expression of feedback (i.e., textual or nontextual). To address this research gap, we classify community feedback into four types on the dimension of expression and valence to examine their effects on continuous high-quality knowledge contribution. Using a longitudinal knowledge contribution dataset collected from a leading online Q&amp;A community, our empirical results with a series of robustness checks show that (1) positive nontextual feedback is negatively correlated with the continuous contribution of high-quality knowledge, whereas the other three types of feedback generate positive effects; (2) textual and nontextual positive feedback generates significantly opposite effects, but there is no statistically significant difference between textual and nontextual negative feedback. The additional analyses generate a deeper understanding of feedback effects, including disassembling feedback effects on the knowledge quantity and quality, and verifying the moderating effects of user reputation values on feedback effects. This study extends research concerning feedback and continuous knowledge contribution and generates important managerial implications for the online Q&amp;A community.},

To enhance the quality and effectiveness of business process redesign , this paper presents a conceptualization of assisted business process redesign ( a BPR). The a BPR concept guides users in improving business processes based on redesign patterns. Depending on the data at hand, the a BPR concept classifies four types of recommendations that differ in their level of automation. Further, this paper proposes a reference architecture that provides operational support for implementing a BPR tools.

Improving the recommendation model and introducing side information are two main research approaches to address the problem. We combine these two approaches and propose the Review-Based Matrix Factorization method in this paper. The method consists of two phases. The first phase is review-based collaborative filtering, where an item-topic rating matrix is constructed by the feature-level opinion mining of online review text. This rating matrix is used to derive item similarities, which can be used to infer unknown users&#39; ratings of the items. The second phase consists of rating imputation , where we first fill some of the empty elements of the user-item rating matrix, then conduct matrix factorization to learn the latent user and item factors to generate recommendations. Experiments on two actual datasets show that our method improves the accuracy of recommendation compared with similar algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Hospital readmissions lead to unnecessary demand for healthcare resources, greater financial costs, and poorer patient outcomes. These consequences have led hospitals to attempt to identify high-risk patients with predictive models , but research has rarely focused on survival analysis techniques, model applications, and performance measures . This study establishes the uses of survival models to support managerial decision-making for readmissions. First, machine learning and statistical survival techniques are applied, ten of which have not been used in previous readmission research. Secondly, applications of survival models in a decision support capacity are proposed, relating to intervention targeting, follow-up care customisation , and demand forecasting. Thirdly, performance measures for the proposed applications are determined and used for empirical model assessment. These performance measures have not been applied in previous readmission research. The empirical assessment is based on adult admissions to the Emergency Department of Gold Coast University Hospital ( n = 46,659) and Robina Hospital ( n = 23,976) in Queensland, Australia. The relevant aspects of performance were determined to be discrimination and calibration, as measured by time-dependent concordance and D-Calibration respectively. A range of discrimination and calibration combinations can be achieved by different models, with the Recursively Imputed Survival Tree , Cox regression , and hybrid Cox-ANN techniques being most promising. Survival approaches linking techniques, proposed applications, and performance measurement should be given greater consideration in future healthcare research and in institutions aiming to manage readmissions.},

We argue that the information gap between backers and innovators rises with the increases in the geographic distance between them, even for transactions that occur over the Internet. Drawing on signaling theory, we argue that since distant backers face higher levels of information asymmetry compared to nearby backers, the value of traditional and rhetorical quality signals are amplified for them. Interestingly, we show that the interaction of spatial distance and less costly rhetorical signals, such as positive psychological capital, is the same as the interaction of spatial distance and traditional costly signals such as past success experience and endorsement. An analysis of 114,276 Kickstarter crowdfunding campaigns, launched during 2009–2018 in more than 150 countries, confirms our propositions regarding the interaction of geographic distance and quality signals.

Using a before/after study design, we perform an econometric analysis and find that introducing a bidding agent had a positive and dramatic impact on the number of bids and bidders and reduced the time necessary to collect the funds. For projects with lower ratings, it also positively impacted the number of lenders and indirectly enhanced portfolio diversification. We find that after the bidding agent was introduced, well-rated projects benefited from lower interest rates, the magnitude of the change depending positively on their rating. These results provide evidence that the bidding agent generates savings in the screening and bidding costs incurred by lenders and benefits both sides of the platform. Our contribution documents the role of bidding agent as a strategic tool to enhance financial intermediation. It also sheds light on how two types of decision support systems (rating-based and bidding agent) interact and shows that this interaction is of crucial importance with respect to the financial regulation of platforms if the crowd has low financial literacy.},

  abstract     = {Given the limitation of resources in organizations (time, money, staff, material, etc.), deciding which projects should be given priority – among many competing projects – is a constant and continuous challenge for decision makers . As a result, a proliferation of methods and solutions for project prioritization has been developed, each with its own strengths and limitations. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for prioritizing projects taking into consideration four pervasive challenges in decision making : 1) uncertainty (imprecision and vagueness) of human decisions, 2) reliability (extent of sureness) of decision makers , 3) systematic identification of selection criteria, and 4) robustness of decision making (reasonable tolerance against insignificant changes to decision makers&#39; evaluations during the process). In doing so, we propose integrating Z -numbers theory with Quality Function Development (ZQFD), four Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (Z-MCDM) methods, ensemble ranking aggregation, and sensitivity analysis. The proposed method is then applied in a real-world organization with twenty IT projects to illustrate how our approach might be used in practice. Furthermore, we elaborate on the trustworthiness of the proposed method in light of 16 criteria available in the literature of structured decision making.},

By incorporating brand trust, brand knowledge, and reciprocal behavior into Lead User Theory, this paper studies what influences consumers&#39; participation potentials in new product development . Two online survey instruments are employed, and data is collected from two matchable well-known IT companies for two types of online brand communities: Company-initiated and Consumer-initiated. Two separate parallel Structural Equation Modeling analyses are conducted to test these two matchable samples and assess the research model. Our findings suggest that firms may not need to pay to sponsor their online brand communities. We infer our conclusion about company-sponsored communities from our findings that brand trust and brand knowledge play different roles for company-initiated and consumer-initiated online brand communities. Brand knowledge directly impacts consumers&#39; participation potentials in consumer-initiated online brand communities, but only indirectly impacts through brand trust in company-initiated online brand communities.},

  abstract     = {Reading customer reviews before purchasing items online has become a common practice ; however, some companies use machine learning (ML) algorithms to generate false reviews in order to create positive brand images of their own products and negative images of competitors&#39; offerings. Existing techniques use review content to identify fraudulent reviewers; however, spammers become more intelligent, started to learn from their mistakes, and changed their tactics in order to avoid detection techniques. Thus, investigating fraudulent accounts&#39; behaviour of generating fake negative or positive reviews for competitors or themselves and the necessity of ML classifiers to identify fraudulent reviews, is more important than ever. In this research, we present a novel feature engineering approach in which we (1) extract several “review-centric” and “reviewer-centric” features from a dataset; (2) combine the cumulative effects of features distributions into a unified model that represents overall behavior of the fraudulent reviewers; (3) investigate the role of effective data pre-processing to improve detection accuracy; and (4) develop a probabilistic approach to detect fraudulent reviewers by learning a novel M-SMOTE model over a derived balanced dataset and feature distributions, which outperforms other ML models. Our study contributes to the literature on digital platforms and fraudulent review detection with significant managerial and theoretical implications through these novel findings.},

  abstract     = {The evolving digital economy entails multifaceted behavioral tracking data such as internet clickstreams, location trajectories, or taste preferences revealed by music or video streaming. Organizations are increasingly interested in using such data streams to profile customers based on their behavioral similarities for targeting purposes. However, measuring similarities in sequential data is a challenging task. We present a generic deep neural-network-based framework for quantifying the similarity of ordered sequences in observed event histories. This novel approach combines a specific type of recurrent neural nets with a triplet loss cost function used for network training. It yields an embedding space that serves as a similarity metric for complex sequential data, can handle multivariate sequential data and incorporate covariates. We empirically validate the derived similarity metric for user embeddings in the domain of re-identifying users in web browsing histories. We demonstrate its superior performance in discriminating users based on their behavioral browsing patterns by benchmarking against more conventional approaches to measure sequence similarity. In addition, we show that the methodology can be used for clustering sub-sequences and re-classifying users based on their observed clickstream behavior. Finally, we critically reflect benefits and possible downsides of the proposed framework, discuss extensions and promising future applications.

  abstract     = {To address data concealment challenges, this study considers how perceived privacy and justice might drive users&#39; information disclosure intentions. Two contextual factors (privacy feedback and choice) also might function as moderators in the proposed relationships. The model was tested using a controlled lab experiment featuring a new app dedicated to m-commerce where both privacy feedback and choice were manipulated. The results affirm a critical role of perceived justice in determining perceived privacy, which shapes disclosure intentions. Providing privacy feedback also enhances the positive effect of perceived justice on perceived privacy and the positive effect of trust propensity on disclosure intention, and alleviates the negative effect of privacy experience on perceived privacy. In addition, providing choices can help users make more conscious privacy decisions. Accordingly, this study contributes to extant literature by extending a single-context theory view and exploring moderating effects of both privacy feedback and choice on information disclosure decision processes. This research also establishes the real effect of feedback by differentiating people who choose (or not) to receive privacy feedback. In addition, this study is applying justice theory to design privacy feedback, through a theoretical link between feedback functions and three justice dimensions (i.e., procedural, informational, and interactional). Finally, we replicate previous findings from past privacy literature using a new setting and a new measure for privacy, further establishing confidence in those relationships.},

We then develop a preliminary theoretical model based on the interview findings and conduct a survey to test our research model. The empirical results suggest that three platform mechanisms, namely member credibility, blockchain certificate, and structural assurance, significantly facilitate the three trust targets, which subsequently enhance individuals&#39; behavioral intentions. A mediation analysis further demonstrates that the three trust targets partially or fully mediate the influences of three platform mechanisms on behavioral intentions through different path relationships.

However, requirements, such as reliability, which gain new importance when alternative data is employed for credit evaluation, have not been considered as part of the credit scoring process. This research proposes an approach for incorporating context-specific stakeholder requirements in the credit scoring process. Two hybrid heuristics are proposed for a feature selection process that simultaneously optimizes all requirements. The first is a multiple objective, non-dominated sorting, binary Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm . The second incorporates the selection, crossover, and mutation techniques of genetic algorithms for greater diversity. Both algorithms are fitted with objective functions obtained from stakeholder requirements for multiple objective feature selection. Empirical evaluation is conducted with stakeholder requirements and alternative data features collected from mobile, public geospatial, and satellite data sources . Their performance is compared against several existing algorithms, and they offer improved performance on specific metrics. The first algorithm outperforms the existing many-objective non dominated sorting genetic algorithm, NSGA-III, in terms of computational time , convergence, and spacing. Meanwhile, the second method results in greater spread for the same population size but has a lengthy computational time. Thus, stakeholder requirements are successfully incorporated into the feature selection process. This results in a better balance between objectives. These findings extend the research on hybrid metaheuristics for feature selection, as well as alternative data for credit scoring.},

To mitigate such delays, researchers proposed the movement of idle ambulances between emergency bases as one of the effective ways to improve the areal coverage of future demands. In this study, we have developed a model-driven decision support system that simultaneously seeks to maximize demand coverage while minimizing travel time by optimally relocating emergency response vehicles. The developed mathematical model partitions and prioritizes demand into four categories and continuously updates them over time. Furthermore, it dynamically calculates the number of coverages in different regions based on the current location of idle ambulances. Also, we developed a real-time risk assessment DSS for recommended relocations, which could be utilized as a reference by the EMS user while implementing suggested relocation decisions. A real case study is used to validate the proposed DSS, and its final output is compared to the existing operational policy. The findings show that the average workload added to each ambulance due to relocations has significantly improved the response time and coverage ratio. Compared to the existing operational policy, the developed decision support system decreased the time to respond to calls, which was deemed to be more than to offsets the increase in travel time due to relocation. Furthermore, the system also reduced the total working time of all ambulances by about 9% per shift.},

  abstract     = {This paper advances the use of the ranked nodes method (RNM) to portray probabilistic relationships of continuous quantities in Bayesian networks (BNs). In RNM, continuous quantities are represented by ranked nodes with discrete ordinal scales. The probabilistic relationships of the nodes are quantified in conditional probability tables (CPTs) generated with expert-elicited parameters. When ranked nodes are formed by discretizing continuous scales, ignorance about the functioning of RNM can lead to discretizations that make the generation of sensible CPTs impossible. While a guideline exists on this matter, it is limited by a requirement to define an equal number of ordinal states for all the nodes. This paper presents two novel discretization approaches that consider the functioning of RNM and allow the nodes to have non-equal numbers of ordinal states. In the first one, called the “static discretization approach”, the nodes can be given any desired discretizations that stay unchanged during the use of the BN. In the second one, called the “dynamic discretization approach”, the discretizations are algorithmically updated during the use of the BN to help manage the sizes of the generated CPTs. Both approaches are based on the original idea that, besides the RNM parameters, the nodes probabilistic relationship is defined by initial RNM-compatible discretizations elicited from the domain expert. Overall, the new approaches offer an easier and more versatile way of using RNM to depict the probabilistic relationships of continuous quantities. In doing so, they also facilitate the effective and diverse use of BNs in decision support systems.},

  abstract     = {Conducting customer satisfaction surveys (CSS) as a means of encouraging customers&#39; engagement with a firm is a widely used managerial practice. In an effort to convert this customer-to-firm engagement into customer-to-customer engagement, many firms have recently started to ask customers who reach the final question of the CSS to write an online review that will be automatically posted on a review site (e.g., Google or TripAdvisor). Using a unique longitudinal data set provided by a large global hotel chain, we aim to understand the drivers behind CSS participation and, ultimately, behind online review posting in response to a prompt at the end of a survey. We employ the Hidden Markov model (HMM) to analyze how a customer&#39;s engagement state changes as a function of previous managerial responses, loyalty program membership, and satisfaction. The results reveal that customers have a greater tendency to transfer to higher engagement states if managers have responded to prior customer surveys. We have also found that the higher the customer&#39;s loyalty program membership status is, the more likely it is that they will participate in a survey. Lastly, we show that customers have a greater tendency to post negative versus positive reviews. We then discuss the implications of this study for researchers and managers.},

Almost every organization today uses dozens of websites and sub-domains. Each provides essential functions and typically uses dozens of third-parties to produce its capabilities. With the growing problem of illegitimate websites, such as those peddling fake news and selling counterfeit products, the detection of fraudulent websites becomes more and more crucial. While the conventional method of fraudulent website detection mostly relies on the content-based analysis of websites, the method of this study uses third-party request structure features and attributes of third-parties engaged in the structure to predict legitimate and fraudulent websites. This method can be used on a real-time basis to complement current detection methods. Moreover, our approach is not limited to a specific category of websites. In other words, unlike previous studies, our approach is able to increase the likelihood of detecting all kinds of fake and fraudulent websites. The results of this study are largely robust across different predictive models .},

  abstract     = {In this article, we describe the decision support system that was developed for the assignment of courses to teaching modalities and rooms for the Fall semester of 2020 at the University of Connecticut (UConn). With the adoption of safety/mitigation standards imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the seating capacities of rooms were reduced by more than 70%, thus making virtually every existing room assignment for Fall 2020 infeasible. The demand for in-person instruction required the reassignment of a large number of courses to rooms, where not all requests for physical space could be accommodated. In order to maximize opportunities for in-person instruction, UConn introduced a teaching modality in which class meetings are attended on campus by only 50% of the enrolled students. As decision makers were given partial flexibility to assign teaching modalities to classes, the complexity of the assignment problem increased considerably, especially because the real-world instances involved hundreds of rooms and thousands of classes and required a quick solution turnaround in practice. In this article, we introduce this flexible assignment problem and describe the two mixed-integer programming formulations that were used to solve the real-world instances of the problem; in particular, one of the formulations leverages structural properties presented in this work in order to represent the problem in a more compact way. We explain how we tailored our algorithms to solve the real-world problem, describe the dynamics of the interactive decision support system created in this initiative, and present insights derived from our study.},

  abstract     = {Online games offer substantial business opportunities, fueling intense competition among game makers. To build gamer loyalty, a critical challenge for game makers is preventing gamers&#39; misbehaviors that annoy other gamers. Such challenges should be considered when game makers are making their design decisions and resource allocation decisions. We contend that building in-game relational cohesion should be an effective means of reducing such behaviors and strengthening loyalty. We also extend relational cohesion theory (RCT) by challenging the assumption that only equal power helps form relational cohesion in one-on-one contexts. In contrast, unequal power may provide an alternative means of enhancing relational cohesion in large groups of users (e.g., the entire user population). This study is the first to introduce and explore how unequal power—a novel and critical element of power structure—forms relational cohesion and strengthens online gamer loyalty. This study uses both behavioral-continuous and perceptual-anchored scales to collect responses from 1003 online gamers. Theoretically, this study widens the applicability of RCT from one-on-one contexts to one-to-many contexts. Practically, this study can help game makers make design and resource allocation decisions to use unequal power, thus effectively building gamer loyalty.},

  abstract     = {Crowdfunding has become immensely popular today, allowing entrepreneurs to present innovative ideas to a broad audience of potential investors. However, due to the online nature of crowdfunding, investors have to use clues only available on the website to decide on whether to invest or not. Grounded in language expectancy theory (LET), we proposed and tested hypotheses suggesting that, when no knowledge of the entrepreneur is available, investors have to use language expectancy as a way to inform them on their investment decisions. Furthermore, we propose that communication content in entrepreneurial narratives such as vague communication and linguistics affect the quality of information leading to a violation of language expectancy. We also postulate that this will manifest in affect intensity and in two-sided persuasion. We separated the description and risks and challenges (R&amp;C) sections from Kickstarter and performed discrete analyses with regressions to further test two-sidedness. Next, we sought to understand causal knowledge of the underlying target class by implementing a Bayesian Network to find the conditional probability of the variables before attempting to find a near-optimal probability of funding success using a genetic algorithm. We found robust support for our hypotheses and helped shed light on which information is received and interpreted by investors leading to a greater likelihood of funding success. Overall, this approach sheds new light on the role of language within crowdfunding literature.},

  abstract     = {Participatory approaches are increasingly being used to plan policies, usually involving stakeholders with conflicting interests, visions and objectives. Participants are often passionate about their cause, especially in sensitive contexts such as their health or the environment for example. Whether involved in, or observing a debate, more often than not, it is hard to follow its progress; positions are unclear and arguments are unstructured often resulting in circular discussions. This is true both for participants in an ongoing debate hoping to reach a consensus as well as for those who, a posteriori, wish to understand what was discussed and how. However, at the current time, there are to our knowledge no tools to support real-time debates by allowing participants to visualize arguments and identifying opposing points of view in order to resolve conflicts. In order to fill this gap, we developed a model based on Dung&#39;s argumentation framework that we implemented in a tool called AIPA, along with a web-application to facilitate user interaction. AIPA allows one to formalize and visualize, in real-time, the arguments of the participants, to conduct inferences in order to identify acceptable arguments and to highlight conflicting ones. Furthermore, AIPA can be used a posteriori to summarize a debate in an easy to follow argument representation. The main contribution of AIPA is its ability to structure the debate by making the arguments chain traceable and transparent, in real-time and a posteriori, and this, with users with no expertise in argumentation. In this paper, we present AIPA along with two applications to illustrate its workings and benefits.},

  abstract     = {While the transfer of blood is common in practice, research addressing replenishment strategies in the context of random or unscheduled transfers is scarce and the few papers that consider ordering policies with multiple independent sources of supply offer mathematically complex solution approaches that are difficult to implement in practice. There are no simple heuristic approaches to guide ordering decisions in these situations. In this paper, we introduce two near-optimal heuristics to guide replenishment decisions for the fixed lifetime perishable inventory problem with random transfers. Much like the traditional base stock policy, the heuristics are straightforward to calculate and implement. The first heuristic (H1) employs a base stock policy using the convolution of demand and transfer distributions. The second heuristic (H2) employs a transfer adjusted base stock policy. We validate our heuristics using inventory-related cost components (i.e., order, holding, wastage, and underage costs) and demand and transfer distributions based on data provided by a large university medical center. Via simulation, we evaluate the performance of the heuristics by comparing the total costs obtained using each heuristic to the total costs obtained using the optimal ordering policy. Both heuristics perform quite well. We conduct a variety of sensitivity analyses considering the effects of different (1) levels of holding and stockout costs, as these costs are difficult to quantify and can vary dramatically, and (2) percentile transfer adjustments in H2. We observe that the H1 policy consistently results in slightly larger orders than the optimal policy, which leads to a slightly higher inventory, holding costs and wastage rates, yet slightly lower stockout costs. The H2 policy, on the other hand, consistently results in slightly smaller orders than the optimal policy, which leads to a slightly smaller inventory, lower holding costs and wastage rates, yet slightly higher stockout costs. To guide decision making , we discuss a number of management challenges that we encountered as part of this project and offer a five-step process to help decision makers with replenishment decisions.},

To fill the gap, we integrate the UGC and MGC literature and research of determinants of physical exercise to develop a comprehensive conceptual model. Using a dataset collected from a leading online fitness brand, we find that both UGC and MGC affect a free fitness video&#39;s incremental view count. We further categorize UGC into three dimensions, where favorability represents the normative dimension, various textual features represent the informational dimension, and reply-density of the self-organized reviewer community represents the social dimension. While both normative and social UGC are positively associated with online fitness videos&#39; view count increase, the impact of informational UGC is insignificant. More importantly, product features, such as exercise intensity, moderate the impacts of UGC and MGC on free digital content consumption . When facing strenuous exercises, the consumer group relies more on peer users and less on marketers to make their content consumption decisions. The findings provide insightful implications to understand how consumers decide their engagement with free digital content delivered via social media channels.},

The elaboration likelihood model (ELM) has been adopted to explain the review feature–helpfulness link. However, when analyzing reviews from websites, existing studies tend to ignore that quality indicators such as length and readability are merely cues and have not circumvented endogeneity induced by unseen argument quality. Hence, we propose an extended ELM application to observational data on review helpfulness. We develop a research model that integrates relevant quality indicators and sentiment features based on a circumplex model of affect. To test our hypotheses, we use publically available review datasets from three platforms ( Amazon.com , Drugs.com , and Yelp.com ) and adopt an instrument-free method that allows for arbitrary correlations between unseen argument quality and multiple endogenous indicators. Our analysis shows that ignoring endogeneity would result in invalid effect size and hypothesis-testing. In addition to identifying effects of endogenous quality indicators on review helpfulness, we find asymmetric effects of positive and negative valence contingent on low or high arousal. By articulating conceptual pitfalls and illustrating empirical remedies, our study aims to be a prototypical example of performing ELM-grounded analyses of online customer reviews.},

Combining a dataset from TripAdvisor with advanced mediation models, we find that the use of mobile devices significantly influences the content of review elements, which indirectly results in the change of review helpfulness. In detail, review extremity and text negative sentiment positively mediate the effect of mobile devices on review helpfulness, as opposed to the negative mediations of text length and multidimensional ratings. Moreover, comparisons of their effect sizes reveal that text length and multidimensional ratings are responsible for the lower helpfulness of mobile reviews. Drawing on the theory of temporal distance, our moderation-mediation model reveals extending response period can be an effective way of curing the low helpfulness of mobile reviews. Our results deepen the extant understanding about the impact of mobile devices and provide practitioners important implications regarding the design of review elements and the policy of managing reviews.},

A total of 11,528 observations of 467 hotels show that agglomeration density positively affects firm revenue in the hotel sector. However, such an effect decreases with the increase in online review quantity (including volume and length). This change is manifested in two forms, namely, minimizing information asymmetry and increasing competition cost due to information transparency. Moreover, the positive effect of agglomeration density decreases due to the quantity of high-quality (few spelling errors and easy to understand) online reviews, but not with low-quality. We further discover that the substitution effect of online review quantity on agglomeration density is stronger for independent hotels than for branded ones, whereas the effect is similar among hotels with various qualities. Our findings provide implications for the management of online channels in changing the local agglomeration effectiveness.},

Our results, based on the analysis of more than 140,000 search sessions, suggest that this is not the case in general.

There is a lack of generalizability in the current validity indexes ( VI ) for automatic clustering algorithms , as each considers a limited number of objectives and mostly ignores the other aspects of clustering validation. The proposed framework benefits from collaboration among selected evolutionary algorithms . A mixed-integer non-linear programming model is developed, and a framework is proposed for a six-step decision support system to solve it. The decision-maker (DM) selects the quantitative (primary) VI s and the evolutionary algorithms . Given DM&#39;s knowledge on the dataset and VI s, DM can incorporate qualitative (secondary) VI s. DM determines the quality threshold for each VI and runs the evolutionary algorithms separately. The DSS then saves the best obtained value of VI s in order to prepare the input necessary to construct the aggregated function. Based on the selected primary VI s, a new normalized aggregated function is developed and solved repeatedly using the randomly selected or predefined weights of importance. Eventually, DM employs a proper DEA model to define the final clustering output among all possible solutions. Given multiple efficient solutions, the best-worst method and a multi-criteria decision-making approach are applied to find the final output. The applicability of the proposed approach is illustrated on a synthetic and two secondary datasets, and the result at each step is discussed in detail.},

These structures result from combining the decision mechanisms of authority and consensus with the communication networks of star, tree , and full network. Simulation results from Agent Based Modeling show that the authority (consensus) is preferred when the time to reach a group decision matters (not matters), and in organizational environments of high (low) risk and high (low) prospects of growth. Additionally, the results of the paper recommend that organizations that want to migrate from authority to consensus decision making , as defined here, should switch from the low-density tree like connecting network, common in hierarchical structures, to a high-density full network.},

  abstract     = {Events recorded during the execution of a business process can be used to train models to predict, at run-time, the outcome of each execution of the process (a.k.a. case). In this setting, the outcome of a case may refer to whether a given case led to a customer complaint or not, or to a product return or other claims, or whether a case was completed on time or not. Existing approaches to train such predictive models do not take into account information about the prior experience of the (human) resources assigned to each task in the process. Instead, these approaches simply encode the resource who performs each task as a categorical (possibly one-hot encoded) feature. Yet, the experience of the resources involved in the execution of a case may clearly have an impact on the case outcome. For example, specialized resources or resources who are familiar with a given type of case, are more likely to execute the tasks in a case faster and more effectively, leading to a higher probability of a positive outcome. Motivated by this observation, this article proposes and evaluates a framework to extract features from event logs that capture the experience of the resources involved in a business process. The framework exploits traditional principles from the literature to capture resource experience, such as experiential learning and social ties on the workplace. The proposed framework is evaluated by comparing the performance of state-of-the-art predictive models trained with and without the proposed resource experience features, using publicly available event logs. The results show that the proposed resource experience features may improve the accuracy of predictive models, but that depends on the process execution context, such as the type of process generating an event log or the type of label that is predicted.},

IT governance processes are critical for companies to decide what and how to deploy IT resources and measure and achieve the expected business benefits. This study introduces and measures the concept of IT governance process capability , which is defined as the firm&#39;s ability to identify, design, implement and leverage the following IT governance processes: IT decision-making, IT planning, IT infrastructure modernization, IT services delivery , and IT monitoring. We propose that IT governance process capability can improve IT performance, which in turn can improve business performance. Using a unique dataset from 881 global companies, we found support for the proposed research model. This paper contributes to the Information Systems (IS) literature on business value of IT by conceptualizing, evaluating, and introducing the construct of IT governance process capability and theorizing and proving how this core IT capability positively affects IT performance to enhance business performance.},

We know little, though, about the effectiveness of specific hierarchical privilege levels (a.k.a. “leveling up”) and non-hierarchical incentives (e.g., independent reputation gains and achievement badges) in promoting knowledge contribution. Drawing on goal-setting theory, expectancy-value theory, and other related theories, this study models how hierarchical privilege levels and non-hierarchical incentives serve as motivational goals stimulating continued knowledge contribution. By analyzing a rich dataset collected from an online Q&amp;A platform, we find that closeness to the next hierarchical privilege level does, indeed, have a curvilinear relationship with continued knowledge contribution. Interestingly, non-hierarchical incentives, including reputation gains and granted badges, help to maintain continued knowledge contribution. Notably, user reputation diminishes the effects of both privilege levels and granted badges on future knowledge contribution. This implies that these gamification mechanisms, while potentially powerful for incentivizing user engagement in knowledge contribution, might not work as effectively for participants with already established reputations in the online community. This research provides theoretical and practical implications for motivating continued user knowledge contribution in online Q&amp;A communities.},

This allows the customer to pay the cheap item price for the expensive item. Evidence suggests that ticket-switching events in retail supply chains may not be rare and therefore need to be addressed. We consider ticket-switching in RFID-based systems and develop four increasingly complex models to address ticket-switching events. These models use readily available information such as that from related database record, tag memory information, and interdependency among tagged items. We illustrate the relative performance of these models through simulation across seven different scenarios. The various models utilize different input information and are appropriate for different considered scenarios. Our results indicate that ticket-switching can be effectively controlled through these model implementations.},

The complexity of these processes and the resulting cognitive load of managing them may vary significantly. To decrease the cognitive load created by such decision-making efforts and to obtain better outcomes, recommendation systems carry significant potential. In order to investigate the benefits provided by decision support systems (DSS) in personal process management (PPM), we first build a constraint programming (CP) model and a prototype context-aware-mobile application employing this CP model. Then, we evaluate the application and the model via two exemplary real-world scenarios. The scenarios form the core of the experiments conducted with 50 participants. We compare the participants’ planning performances with and without the PPM system with quantitative metrics such as planning times and scenario objective values. In addition, System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaires and open-ended questions provide qualitative evaluation results. Throughout the study, we apply the Design Science Research methodology to rigorously conduct research activities by proof of concept, proof of use, and proof of value. The empirical results clearly show that our proposed model for PPM is effective, and the developed prototype solution generates positive participant comments as well as a high SUS score. Overall, the prototype PPM system with CP implementation leads to better planning in less time in the planning phase, and it lets the user do fast replanning in the execution phase, which is invaluable in dynamically changing situations such as daily activities.},

Moreover, for the first time in the literature, we cast the problem of estimating group rating as an ordinal classification problem relying on the natural ordering between the ratings, which allows us to define the expertise levels of the members in terms of sensitivity and specificity. In fact, we impose priors on the sensitivity and the specificity scores corresponding to the members, taking a Bayesian approach .

  abstract     = {Text databases have grown tremendously in number, size, and volume over the last few decades. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software is used to scan the text and make them available in online repositories. The OCR transcription process is often not accurate resulting in large volumes of garbled text in the repositories. Spell correction and other post-processing of OCR text often prove to be very expensive and time-consuming. While it is possible to rely on the OCR model to assess the quality of text in a corpus, many natural language processing and information retrieval tasks prefer the extrinsic evaluation of the effect of noise on the task at hand. This paper examines the effect of noise on the unsupervised ranking of person name entities by first populating a list of person names using an out-of-the-box Named Entity Recognition (NER) software, extracting content-based features for the identified entities, and ranking them using a novel unsupervised Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) based ranking algorithm. This generative model has the ability to learn rankings using the data distribution and therefore requires limited manual intervention. Empirical results are presented on a carefully curated parallel corpus of OCR and clean text and “in the wild” using a large real-world corpus. Experiments on the parallel corpus reveals that even with a reasonable degree of noise in the dataset, it is possible to generate ranked lists using the KDE algorithm with a high degree of precision and recall. Furthermore, since the KDE algorithm has comparable performance to state-of-the-art unsupervised rankers, using it on real-world corpora is feasible. The paper concludes by reflecting on other methods for enhancing the performance of the unsupervised algorithm on OCR text such as cleaning entity names, disambiguating names concatenated to one another and correcting OCR errors that are statistically significant in the corpus.},

  abstract     = {Artificial Intelligence and servitization reshape the way that manufacturing companies derive value. Aiming to sustain competitive advantage and intensify customer loyalty, full-service providers offer the use of their products as a service to achieve continuous revenues. For this purpose, companies implement AI classification algorithms to enable high levels of service at controllable costs. However, traditional asset sellers who become service providers require previously atypical payment structures, as classic payment methods involving a one-time fee for production costs and profit margins are unsuitable. In addition, a low predictive power of the implemented classification algorithm can lead to misclassifications , which diminish the achievable level of service and the intended net present value of the resultant service. While previous works focus solely on the costs of such misclassifications, our decision model highlights implications for payment structures, service levels, and – ultimately – the net present value of such data-driven service offerings. Our research suggests that predictive power can be a major factor in selecting a suitable payment structure and the overall design of service level agreements. Therefore, we compare common payment structures for data-driven services and investigate their relationship to predictive power. We develop our model using a design science methodology and iteratively evaluate our results using a four-step approach that includes interviews with industry experts and the application of our model to a real-world use case. In summary, our research extends the existing knowledge of servitization and data-driven services in the manufacturing industry through a quantitative decision model.},

  abstract     = {Behavioural economics has been argued to be a productive basis for decision support system (DSS) research. Whereas traditional economics assumes that individuals make decisions independently of others, behavioural economists have shown that humans tend to follow the crowd in their decisions (i.e., exhibit herding bias). However, the literature is silent on how convincing the information on the decisions of the crowd needs to be to elicit herding bias and on whether herding can be reduced (i.e., debiased) by presenting a warning message. This paper addresses both questions in the contexts of financial decisions that were guided by two DSSs in the form of simulation tools. In particular, we conduct a randomised controlled trial with 768 respondents randomly assigned to peer information. The results indicate that the intervention successfully elicited herding bias and that herding occurs when respondents are informed that at least 50% of other people made a particular decision. The results further show that a DSS in the form of a warning message is not sufficient to debias herding. In conclusion, these findings showed that individuals are easily influenced by erroneous peer information and that this effect is robust against debiasing using a warning message. Hence, DSS developers need to consider more intense debiasing strategies to overcome herding.},

Among these features, cybersecurity keywords, sharing of attachments, and sentiments emerged as significant. Further, we found that expert hackers demonstrate leadership in the online forums that eventually serve as communities of practice . Consequently, novice hackers gradually develop their cyber-attack skills through prolonged observations, interactions, and external influences in this social learning process. (ii) Cyber-risk mitigation – computes financial impact for every { hacker expertise, attack-type } combination, and then by ranking them on a { likelihood, impact } decision-matrix to prioritize mitigation strategies in affected organizations. Through these novel recommendations, our framework can guide managers to decide on appropriate cybersecurity controls using an { expected loss, probability, attack-type, hacker expertise } metric against financial losses due to cyber-attacks.},

  abstract     = {Lending decisions are usually made with proprietary models that provide minimally acceptable explanations to users. In a future world without such secrecy, what decision support tools would one want to use for justified lending decisions? This question is timely, since the economy has dramatically shifted due to a pandemic, and a massive number of new loans will be necessary in the short term. We propose a framework for such decisions, including a globally interpretable machine learning model, an interactive visualization of it, and several types of summaries and explanations for any given decision. The machine learning model is a two-layer additive risk model , which resembles a two-layer neural network, but is decomposable into subscales. In this model, each node in the first (hidden) layer represents a meaningful subscale model, and all of the nonlinearities are transparent. Our online visualization tool allows exploration of this model, showing precisely how it came to its conclusion. We provide three types of explanations that are simpler than, but consistent with, the global model: case-based reasoning explanations that use neighboring past cases, a set of features that were the most important for the model&#39;s prediction, and summary-explanations that provide a customized sparse explanation for any particular lending decision made by the model. Our framework earned the FICO recognition award for the Explainable Machine Learning Challenge, which was the first public challenge in the domain of explainable machine learning. 1},

  abstract     = {Visual analytics (VA) is a visually assisted exploratory analysis approach in which knowledge discovery is executed interactively between the user and system in a human-centered manner. The purpose of this study is to develop a method for the VA of set data aimed at supporting knowledge discovery and member selection. A typical target application is a visual support system for team analysis and member selection, by which users can analyze past teams and examine candidate lineups for new teams. Because there are several difficulties, such as the combinatorial explosion problem, developing a VA system of set data is challenging. In this study, we first define the requirements that the target system should satisfy and clarify the accompanying challenges. Then we propose a method for the VA of set data, which satisfies the requirements. The key idea is to model the generation process of sets and their outputs using a manifold network model. The proposed method visualizes the relevant factors as a set of topographic maps on which various information is visualized. Furthermore, using the topographic maps as a bidirectional interface, users can indicate their targets of interest in the system on these maps. We demonstrate the proposed method by applying it to basketball teams, and compare with a benchmark system for outcome prediction and lineup reconstruction tasks. Because the method can be adapted to individual application cases by extending the network structure, it can be a general method by which practical systems can be built.},

  abstract     = {This study examines the complexity of consumer experiences in the sharing economy (SE) from the perspective of the level of interaction between consumers and service providers. Consistent with service-dominant logic, the joint efforts of consumers and service providers co-create value. In the context of accommodation-sharing, this means not just the room that guests seek but, rather, the authentic local experience they co-create with their hosts. This study proposes a text-analytics framework to extract important service dimensions directly from consumer reviews. The results indicate that the importance of service dimensions, on which consumers focus in reviews, varies with levels of interaction. To better understand the complex nature of consumer experiences in the SE, the framework integrates text analytics with fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), to shift attention from individual service dimensions to service-dimension configurations. Drawing on complexity theory , this study examines the service-dimension configurations that lead to positive and negative sentiment. The fsQCA results reveal that the causal recipes for sentiment differ for various interaction mechanisms. This is the first study to integrate topic modeling , sentiment analysis , and fsQCA, framing service-provider decision support for responding to consumers&#39; needs.},
