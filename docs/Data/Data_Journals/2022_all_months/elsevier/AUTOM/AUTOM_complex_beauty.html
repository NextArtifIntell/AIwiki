  abstract     = {This paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC) scheme for maximising the benefit of a useful disturbance by exploiting preview information of the disturbance, in the context of goal-oriented operation. For a constrained system, subject to a persistent, bounded, and predictable disturbance, rather than attenuating the influence of disturbance, the proposed MPC aims to utilise the disturbance to optimise high-level economic criteria, e.g., profitability and productivity, which are normally represented by an indefinite cost function. For linear time-invariant systems, after examining the influence of the future disturbance profile, a computationally efficient finite-horizon convex approach is proposed to approximate the solution of the original possibly non-convex infinite-horizon optimisation problem. Then, a receding-horizon implementation is developed, taking into account the recursively updated disturbance prediction, and the recursive feasibility and input-to-state stability of the implementation are established. Numerical examples are provided to verify the efficacy of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Identification of the so-called dynamic networks is one of the most challenging problems appeared recently in control literature. Such systems consist of large-scale interconnected systems, also called modules. To recover full networks dynamics the two crucial steps are topology detection , where one has to infer from data which connections are active, and modules estimation . Since a small percentage of connections are effective in many real systems, the problem finds also fundamental connections with group-sparse estimation. In particular, in the linear setting modules correspond to unknown impulse responses expected to have null norm but in a small fraction of samples. This paper introduces a new Bayesian approach for linear dynamic networks identification where impulse responses are described through the combination of two particular prior distributions. The first one is a block version of the horseshoe prior, a model possessing important global–local shrinkage features. The second one is the stable spline prior, that encodes information on smooth-exponential decay of the modules. The resulting model is called stable spline horseshoe (SSH) prior. It implements aggressive shrinkage of small impulse responses while larger impulse responses are conveniently subject to stable spline regularization . Inference is performed by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme, tailored to the dynamic context and able to efficiently return the posterior of the modules in sampled form. Numerical studies show that the new approach can accurately reconstruct “line by line” networks dynamics without assuming any knowledge on the topology also when thousands of unknown impulse response coefficients must be inferred from data sets of relatively small size.},

  abstract     = {To facilitate the real-time implementation of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), this paper proposes a deep learning-based NMPC scheme, in which the NMPC law is approximated via a deep neural network (DNN). To optimize the DNN controller, a novel “optimize and train” architecture is designed, where the processes of data generation and neural network training are combined together to result in a single large-scale stochastic optimization problem. Unlike the conventional “optimize then train” approach, our proposed one directly optimizes the closed-loop performance of the DNN controller over a finite horizon for a number of initial states. The important features of our proposed scheme are that it can deal with set-valued optimal MPC input, and a probabilistic guarantee of constraint satisfaction can be concluded for the closed-loop system without simulating the DNN controller. With our proposed scheme, an increased number of training scenarios leads to improved constraint satisfaction of the derived DNN controller, which is not necessarily true for the “optimize then train” approach. Statistical approaches for validating closed-loop control performance are also discussed. Furthermore, computational methods are introduced to efficiently solve the resulting stochastic optimization problem. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is extensively illustrated with several numerical simulations. Compared with the conventional “optimize then train” approach, our proposed approach exhibits better closed-loop constraint satisfaction for all considered case studies.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study multi-agent systems with decentralized resource allocations. Agents have local demand and resource supply, and are interconnected through a network designed to support sharing of the local resource; and the network has no external resource supply. It is known from classical welfare economics theory that by pricing the flow of resource, balance between the demand and supply is possible. Agents decide on the consumed resource, and perhaps further the traded resource as well, to maximize their payoffs considering both the utility of the consumption, and the income from the trading. When the network supply and demand are balanced, a competitive equilibrium is achieved if all agents maximize their individual payoffs, and a social welfare equilibrium is achieved if the total agent utilities are maximized. First, we consider multi-agent systems with static local allocations, and prove from duality theory that under general concavity assumptions, the competitive equilibrium and the social welfare equilibrium exist and agree. Next, we show that the agent utility functions can be prescribed in a family of socially admissible functions , under which the resource price at the competitive equilibrium is kept below a threshold. Finally, we extend the study to dynamical multi-agent systems where agents are associated with dynamical states from linear processes, and prove that the dynamic competitive equilibrium and the dynamic social welfare equilibrium continue to exist and coincide with each other. In addition, we also present a recursive representation of the competitive equilibriums using dynamic programming, and a receding horizon approach for smoothing the dynamic pricing as a dynamic competitive equilibrium social shaping method.},

The primary objective is to design a fully decentralized state-feedback controller with ramp metering and variable speed limit control actions, with no information exchange between local controllers, that ensures feasibility and improves a global performance index. The design of a decentralized feedback controller with a one-hop information structure is examined, wherein the optimum outflow rate from each segment of the network depends only on the state of that segment and the state of all other segments directly connected to the downstream junction of that segment. It is demonstrated that when cost/constraints can be modeled or approximated by piecewise-affine functions, the control law has a closed-form state-feedback realization. The decentralization is based on the truncation of non-local variables in local optimization problems. The resulting decentralized control scheme has a simple closed-form representation and is scalable to arbitrary large networks; moreover, we demonstrate that, under certain conditions, with respect to certain meaningful performance indexes, the performance loss due to decentralization is zero; namely, the centralized optimal controller has a decentralized realization with a one-hop information structure.},

The sampled-data distributed observer consists of two parts. The first part is a sampled-data distributed observer for the angular velocity leader subsystem and the second part is a sampled-data distributed observer for the attitude leader subsystem. It is noted that, since the attitude leader subsystem is nonlinear, a special effort has to be made to establish the sampled-data distributed observer for the attitude leader subsystem. Moreover, we give an explicit upper bound for the sampling intervals to guarantee the validity of the sampled-data distributed observer. On the basis of the sampled-data distributed observer, we further synthesize a distributed control law to solve the leader-following consensus problem.

However, for the general mean field game problem, the FP equation must be employed to describe the mean field dynamics of all the agents. In this brief paper, the optimal condition is obtained through Pontryagin’s maximum principle first; then, this mean field dynamics described by the partial differential equation is calculated through the Lax–Friedrichs approach. Finally, the initial co-state in the optimal condition is determined by the Newton method . Two case studies, including vehicle speed consensus and engine speed control of HEVs with consideration of powertrain structure limitation, are conducted, and the simulation results in both practical applications show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Exploiting the switched-affine nature of this dynamics, we obtain various necessary and/or sufficient conditions on the network structure and its external input for the existence of oscillations in (i) two-dimensional excitatory–inhibitory networks (E-I pairs), (ii) networks with one inhibitory but arbitrary number of excitatory nodes, (iii) purely inhibitory networks with an arbitrary number of nodes, and (iv) networks of E-I pairs.

Moreover, an analysis technique based on supermartingales is proposed, leading to stochastic stability results for a large class of distributionally robust controllers. In this context, we also discuss how to construct terminal cost functions for stochastic and distributionally robust MPC that ensure closed-loop stability and asymptotic convergence to robust invariant sets. The corresponding theoretical developments are illustrated by tutorial-style examples and a numerical case study.},

  abstract     = {The dynamics of cellular chemical reactions are variable due to stochastic noise from intrinsic and extrinsic sources. The intrinsic noise is the intracellular fluctuations of molecular copy numbers caused by the probabilistic encounter of molecules and is modeled by the chemical master equation. The extrinsic noise, on the other hand, represents the intercellular variation of the kinetic parameters due to the variation of global factors affecting gene expression. The objective of this paper is to propose a theoretical framework to analyze the combined effect of the intrinsic and the extrinsic noise modeled by the chemical master equation with uncertain parameters. More specifically, we formulate a semidefinite program to compute the intervals of the stationary solution of uncertain moment equations whose parameters are given only partially in the form of the statistics of their distributions. The semidefinite program is derived without approximating the governing equation in contrast with many existing approaches. Thus, we can obtain guaranteed intervals of the worst possible values of the moments for all parameter distributions satisfying the given statistics, which are prohibitively hard to estimate from sample-path simulations since sampling from all possible uncertain distributions is difficult. We demonstrate the proposed optimization approach using two examples of stochastic chemical reactions and show that the solution of the optimization problem gives informative upper and lower bounds of the statistics of the stationary copy number distributions.},

In particular, the symbolic model is constructed based on learning the un-modeled part of the dynamics from training data based on state-space exploration, and the concept of an alternating simulation relation that represents behavioral relationships with respect to the original control system. Moreover, we aim at achieving safe exploration , meaning that the trajectory of the system is guaranteed to be in a safe region for all times while collecting the training data. In addition, we provide some techniques to reduce the computational load, in terms of memory and computation time,of constructing the symbolic models and the safety controller synthesis, so as to make our approach practical. Finally, a numerical simulation illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Without delay, we establish a boundary control law for the informed agent.

  abstract     = {A multi-dimensional switched system or multi-mode multi-dimensional ( M 3 D ) system extends the classic switched system by allowing different subsystem dimensions. The stability problem of the M 3 D system, whose state transitions at switching instants can be discontinuous due to the dimension-varying feature, is studied. The discontinuous state transition is formulated by an affine map that captures both the dimension variations and the state impulses, with no extra constraint imposed. In the presence of unstable subsystems, the general criteria featuring a series of Lyapunov-like conditions for the practical and asymptotic stability properties of the M 3 D system are provided under the proposed slow/fast transition-dependent average dwell time framework. Then, by considering linear subsystems, we propose a class of parametric multiple Lyapunov functions to verify the obtained Lyapunov-like stability conditions and explicitly reveal a connection between the practical/asymptotic stability property and the non-vanishing/vanishing property of the impulsive effects in the state transition process. Further, the obtained stability results for the M 3 D system are applied to the consensus problem of the open multi-agent system (MAS), whose network topology can be switching and size-varying due to the migrations of agents. It shows that through a proper transformation, the seeking of the (practical) consensus performance of the open MAS with disconnected digraphs boils down to that of the (practical) stability property of an M 3 D system with unstable subsystems.},

  abstract     = {Given a convex quadratic potential of which its minimum is the agent’s goal and a Euclidean space populated with ellipsoidal obstacles, one can construct a Rimon–Koditschek (RK) artificial potential to navigate. Its negative gradient attracts the agent toward the goal and repels the agent away from the boundary of the obstacles. This is a popular approach to navigation problems since it can be implemented with local spatial information that is acquired during operation time. However, navigation is only successful in situations where the obstacles are not too eccentric (flat). This paper proposes a modification to gradient dynamics that allows successful navigation of an environment with a quadratic cost and ellipsoidal obstacles regardless of their eccentricity. This is accomplished by altering gradient dynamics with a Hessian correction that is intended to imitate worlds with spherical obstacles in which RK potentials are known to work. The resulting dynamics simplify by the quadratic form of the obstacles. Convergence to the goal and obstacle avoidance is established from almost every initial position (up to a set of measure one) in the free space, with mild conditions on the location of the target. Results are corroborated empirically with numerical simulations.},

When the angular velocity is greater than π 2 , the system always has at least one positive eigenvalue, which makes the system cannot be stabilized only with the collocated static feedback control. This is why the existing literature usually considers the case where the admissible angular velocity is always less than π 2 . To overcome this obstacle, we design a static proportional feedback control with both collocated and anti-collocated measurements from each boundary to stabilize the system, where the admissible angular velocity is improved from less than π 2 to less than π while ensuring that the system is minimum-phase. Through a detailed spectral analysis, the spectrum of the closed-loop system is proved to be in the left-half complex plane, and the asymptotic expressions of both eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are obtained. By the Riesz basis approach, the stability of the closed-loop system is proved. The effectiveness of the feedback control is verified by numerical simulation.},

The proposed approach builds upon the parameter estimation-based observer recently developed in Ortega et al. (2015) and its extension to matrix Lie groups in our previous work. Conditions on the robot trajectory under which the observer converges are given, and these are strictly weaker than the standard persistency of excitation and uniform complete observability conditions.

The obstacle is allowed to move on any arbitrary trajectory as long as its trajectory satisfies some regularity constraints. By Pontryagin’s maximum principle, the fundamental segments of the time-optimal trajectory are proposed. Along each segment, the control input is either constant or is expressed in state-feedback form. Thereafter, using the necessary conditions for state-inequality constraints, the underlying geometric and analytical properties that govern the concatenation of these fundamental segments are revealed. All these properties exhibit solely state-dependent relations. This has two-fold applications: (1) such relations are essential in ruling out spurious extremals obtained by numerical optimal control methods, and (2) they enable the formulation of a set of nonlinear equations whose solution gives rise to the exact time-optimal trajectory. Numerical examples are presented, validating and highlighting the application of these properties.},

Due to the influence of transmission delay and Markov dropouts, a higher bit rate is required for stabilization, which is quantitatively characterized. To overcome the difficulties induced by the temporal correlation of Markov dropouts, a variable bit rate quantization policy is proposed to achieve the minimum-bit-rate stability by appropriately determining the number of quantization bits for each feedback packet. The obtained sufficient bit rate condition is shown to be also necessary in some special cases. Simulations are done to verify the effectiveness of our results.},

Apart from extending the class of stabilizing controllers beyond the NI family, the proposed framework also generalizes a few existing NI domain results. It is shown that the integral resonant control (IRC) scheme in MIMO setting can be captured as a special case of the developed result. Integral controllability of a class of NI systems having negative definite DC gain directly follows from the proposed stability result of this paper. Further generalization in terms of the set of integral gain matrix is also demonstrated. Effectiveness of the proposed results are illustrated through numerical examples.},

The system’s state x is simultaneously estimated by m agents assuming each agent i senses y i and receives appropriately defined data from each of its current neighbors. Neighbor relations are characterized by a time-varying directed graph N ( t ) whose vertices correspond to agents and whose arcs depict neighbor relations. Agent i updates its estimate x i of x at “event times” t i 1 , t i 2 , t i 3 , … using a local continuous-time linear observer and a local parameter estimator which iterates q times during each event time interval [ t i ( s − 1 ) , t i s ) , s ≥ 1 to obtain an estimate of x ( t i s ) . Subject to the assumptions that none of the C i ’s are zero, the neighbor graph N ( t ) is strongly connected for all time, and the system whose state is to be estimated is jointly observable, it is shown that for any number λ &gt; 0 , it is possible to choose q and the local observer gains so that each estimate x i converges to x at least as fast as e − λ t does. This result holds whether or not agents communicate synchronously, although in the asynchronous case it is necessary to assume that N ( t ) changes in a suitably defined sense. Exponential convergence is also assured if the event time sequences of the m agents are slightly different than each other, although in this case only if the system being observed is exponentially stable; this limitation however, is primarily a robustness issue shared by all state estimators, centralized or not, which are operating in “open loop” in the face of small modeling errors. The result also holds facing abrupt changes in the number of vertices and arcs in the inter-agent communication graph upon which the algorithm depends.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the reachable set computation of a linear system with a nonconvex control constraint and other convex control and state constraints. We propose to convexify the nonconvex constraint by a relaxation technique. We prove that the reachable set of the relaxed constrained system at any given final time is equal to that of the original constrained system at the same final time under certain assumptions, and interestingly it holds even though the admissible control set is expanded. The theoretical result can enable us to use convex optimization to efficiently and accurately compute the reachable set of the original constrained system. We will verify and apply the theoretical result to reachable set computation via two planetary precision landing examples.},

  abstract     = {State estimation for a class of linear time-invariant systems with distributed output measurements (distributed sensors) and unknown inputs is addressed in this paper. The objective is to design a network of observers such that the state vector of the entire system can be estimated, while each observer has access to only local output measurements that may not be sufficient on their own to reconstruct the entire system’s state. Existing results in the literature on distributed state estimation assume either that the system does not have inputs, or that all the system’s inputs are globally known to all the observers. Accordingly, we address this gap by proposing a distributed observer capable of estimating the overall system’s state in the presence of inputs, while each observer only has limited local information on inputs and outputs. We provide a design method that guarantees convergence of the estimation errors to zero under joint detectability conditions. This design suits undirected communication graphs that may have switching topologies and also applies to strongly connected directed graphs. We also give existence conditions that are consistent with existing results on unknown input observers. Finally, simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed estimation scheme for various scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Boolean functions can be represented in many ways including logical forms, truth tables, and polynomials. Additionally, Boolean functions have different canonical representations such as minimal disjunctive normal forms. Another canonical representation is based on the polynomial representation of Boolean functions and the biologically motivated concept of canalization: any Boolean function can be written as a nested product of canalizing layers and a polynomial that contains the variables that are never canalizing. In this paper we study the problem of identifying the canalizing layers of a Boolean function. First, we show that the problem of finding the canalizing layers is NP -hard. Second, we present several algorithms for finding the canalizing layers, discuss their complexities, and compare their performances. Third, we exhibit how the canalizing layers format can be used to find a disjunctive normal form for any nested canalizing function. Another application deals with the reverse engineering of Boolean networks with a prescribed layering format. Implementations of the developed algorithms in Python and in the computer algebra system Macaulay2 are available at https://github.com/ckadelka/BooleanCanalization .},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates sensor scheduling for state estimation of complex networks over shared transmission channels. For a complex network of dynamical systems, referred to as nodes, a sensor network is adopted to measure and estimate the system states in a distributed way, where a sensor is used to measure a node. The estimates are transmitted from sensors to the associated nodes, in the presence of one-step time delay and subject to packet loss. Due to limited transmission capability, only a portion of sensors are allowed to send information at each time step. The goal of this paper is to seek an optimal sensor scheduling policy minimizing the overall estimation errors. Under a distributed state estimation framework, this problem is reformulated as a Markov decision process, where the one-stage reward for each node is strongly coupled. The feasibility of the problem reformulation is ensured. In addition, an easy-to-check condition is established to guarantee the existence of an optimal deterministic and stationary policy. Moreover, it is found that the optimal policies have a threshold, which can be used to reduce the computational complexity in obtaining these policies. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated by several simulation examples.},

The unknown inputs represent unmodeled dynamics or disturbances which are prevalent in reality in quantum systems. Since no prior knowledge for the unknown inputs is assumed, the quantum version of Luenberger observers or Kalman filters are not adequate in such a scenario. We thus employ linear quantum stochastic systems and an inner model to tackle this problem. In addition, in order to preserve the coherence in the information flow due to quantum mechanics, any measurement of the quantum system is ruled out, which brings in new challenges compared to the classical counterpart. To be more specific, we develop coherent strong observers for open quantum harmonic oscillators with unknown inputs involved, showing a detailed procedure regarding synthesis of coherent strong observers for such systems that accomplish the task of simultaneously estimating system variables together with the unknown inputs, which is also illustrated by a simulation example. The results in this paper enrich our exploration on observer design for quantum systems under various circumstances, and thus pave the way towards more systematic and comprehensive analysis concerning coherent estimation.},

Since the disturbance is unknown, computing an exact prediction of the future plant states is not possible. To circumvent this problem, we propose using a high-order extended Luenberger-type observer for the plant states, disturbances, and their finite difference variables, combined with a new equation for computing the prediction based on Newton’s series from the calculus of finite differences. Detailed performance analysis is carried out to show that, under certain assumptions, both enhanced prediction and improved attenuation of the unknown disturbances are achieved. Linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are employed for the observer design to minimize the prediction errors. A stabilization procedure based on an iterative design algorithm is also presented for the case where the plant is affected by time-varying uncertainties. Examples from the literature illustrate the advantages of the scheme.},

Specifically, we show that when using constant stepsize (i.e., α k ≡ α ), the algorithm achieves exponential fast convergence to a neighborhood (with radius O ( α log ( 1 / α ) ) ) around the desired limit point. When using diminishing stepsizes with appropriate decay rate, the algorithm converges with rate O ( log ( k ) / k ) . Our proof is based on Lyapunov drift arguments, and to handle the Markovian noise, we exploit the fast mixing of the underlying Markov chain. To demonstrate the generality of our theoretical results on Markovian SA, we use it to derive the finite-sample bounds of the popular Q -learning algorithm with linear function approximation, under a condition on the behavior policy. Importantly, we do not need to make the assumption that the samples are i.i.d., and do not require an artificial projection step in the algorithm. Numerical simulations corroborate our theoretical results.},

We present and analyze a distributed averaging algorithm which operates exclusively with quantized values (i.e., the information stored, processed and exchanged between neighboring agents is subject to deterministic uniform quantization) and relies on event-driven updates (e.g., to reduce energy consumption, communication bandwidth, network congestion, and/or processor usage). We characterize the properties of the proposed distributed algorithm over dynamic directed communication topologies subject to some connectivity conditions and we show that its execution allows each agent to reach, in finite time, a fixed state that is equal (within one quantization level) to the average of the initial states. The main idea of the proposed algorithm is that each agent (i) models its initial state as two quantized fractions which have numerators equal to the agent’s initial state and denominators equal to one, and (ii) transmits one fraction randomly while it keeps the other stored. Then, every time an agent receives one or more fractions, it averages their numerators with the numerator of the fraction it stored, and then transmits them to randomly selected out-neighbors. Finally, we provide examples to illustrate the operation, performance, and potential advantages of the proposed algorithm. We compare against various quantized average consensus algorithms and show that our algorithm’s convergence speed is among the fastest in the current literature.},

Recent developments in zeroing control barrier functions (ZCBFs) have provided a framework for ensuring safety of a superlevel set of a single constraint function. Euler–Lagrange systems represent many real-world systems including robots and vehicles, which must abide by safety-regulations, especially for use in human-occupied environments. These safety regulations include state constraints (position and velocity) and input constraints that must be respected at all times. ZCBFs are valuable for satisfying system constraints for general nonlinear systems, however their construction to satisfy state and input constraints is not straightforward. Furthermore, the existing barrier function methods do not address the multiple state constraints that are required for safety of Euler–Lagrange systems. In this paper, we propose a methodology to construct multiple, non-conflicting control barrier functions for Euler–Lagrange systems subject to input constraints to satisfy safety regulations, while concurrently taking into account robustness margins and sampling-time effects. The proposed approach consists of a sampled-data controller and an algorithm for barrier function construction to enforce safety (i.e. satisfy position and velocity constraints). The proposed method is validated in simulation on a 2-DOF planar manipulator.},

Then a necessary and sufficient condition for fault detectability analysis is introduced. After that an approach is introduced to design a reduced-order observer for fault detection. If fault occurrence has been detected, then an approach is proposed to solve fault isolation problem of BCNs. The basic idea is to separate dynamics of the faults into different independent subsystems by using graph theory. For each subsystem a residual generator is constructed based on reduced-order observer by getting rid of indistinguishable states.

Automated verification and policy synthesis for stochastic hybrid systems can be inherently challenging: this is due to the heterogeneity of their dynamics (presence of continuous and discrete components), the presence of uncertainty, and in some applications the large dimension of state and input sets. Over the past few years, a few hundred articles have investigated these models, and developed diverse and powerful approaches to mitigate difficulties encountered in the analysis and synthesis of such complex stochastic systems. In this survey, we overview the most recent results in the literature and discuss different approaches, including (in)finite abstractions , verification and synthesis for temporal logic specifications , stochastic similarity relations , (control) barrier certificates , compositional techniques , and a selection of results on continuous-time stochastic systems ; we finally survey recently developed software tools that implement the discussed approaches. Throughout the manuscript we discuss a few open topics to be considered as potential future research directions: we hope that this survey will guide younger researchers through a comprehensive understanding of the various challenges, tools, and solutions in this enticing and rich scientific area.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the input-to-state stability (ISS) problem of switched linear system with unstabilizable modes is investigated under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and external disturbance. In contrast to earlier results which consider only stabilizable modes and usually impose certain constraints on the switching behavior and the DoS attacks, the switched system with unstabilizable modes is studied and a flexible description is proposed to specify the unstabilizable modes. Besides, a more general situation is considered that it allows switching during the active period of DoS attack and the attacks can take place arbitrarily independent of switching. Thus, it leads to a better description of switched system under DoS attacks and a more general result. Moreover, under the sampling scheme and DoS attacks, the asynchronous problem arises. Despite these added complications, a sufficient condition concerning DoS attacks frequency and duration is derived to ensure the ISS of the system under DoS attacks, and the result reveals the trade-off between the average time proportion of unstabilizable modes and the resilience of the system against DoS attacks. Finally, a numerical example and a comparative study are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Under suitable monotonicity assumptions on the plant steady-state input–output map, we use singular perturbation theory results to prove the existence of a sufficiently small controller gain ensuring closed-loop (local) exponential stability and reference tracking for a feasible set of constant references. We suggest a particular controller design, which embeds (when possible) the right inverse of the plant steady-state input–output map. The relevance of the proposed controller scheme is validated through an application in the power systems domain, namely, the output (active and reactive) power regulation for a grid-connected synchronverter.},

The multi-agent system consists of leaders who have the knowledge of their absolute positions in the global coordinate frame, and followers who do not know their absolute positions but have angle-only measurements and communication with respect to their neighboring agents. The aim of SLAF is to simultaneously localize and control the followers such that a desired formation among the leaders and followers can be achieved by using locally available sensing and communication information. To handle the challenging situation where the formation becomes unlocalizable at some nongeneric configurations, a perturbation-based SLAF algorithm is proposed such that the SLAF task can be achieved with an asymptotic convergence. To meet different tasks’ requirements, three types of distributed SLAF algorithms are designed for the followers when the leaders are static, move with constant, or time-varying velocities, respectively. The effect of measurement noises, extension to other types of sensor measurements, requirement on agents’ coordinate frames, collision and collinearity avoidance are also discussed. To validate the theoretical results, simulation examples corresponding to the discussed scenarios are carried out.},

In its current form, the dissipativity theory for economic MPC applies to problems based on deterministic dynamics or to very specific classes of stochastic problems, and does not readily extend to generic Markov decision processes. In this paper, we clarify the core reason for this difficulty, and propose a generalization of the economic MPC dissipativity theory that circumvents it. This generalization focuses on undiscounted infinite-horizon problems and is based on nonlinear stage cost functionals, allowing one to discuss the Lyapunov asymptotic stability of policies for Markov decision processes in terms of the probability measures underlying their stochastic dynamics. This theory is illustrated for the stochastic linear quadratic regulator with Gaussian process noise, for which a storage functional can be provided explicitly. For the sake of brevity, we limit our discussion to undiscounted Markov decision processes.},

  abstract     = {Estimating a function from noisy measurements is a crucial problem in statistics and engineering, with an impact on machine learning predictions and identification of dynamical systems. In view of robust control design and safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and smart healthcare, estimates are required to be complemented with uncertainty bounds quantifying their reliability. Most of the available results are derived by constraining the estimates to belong to a deterministic function space; however, the returned bounds often result overly conservative and, hence, of limited usefulness. An alternative is to use a Bayesian framework. The regions thereby obtained however require complete specification of prior distributions whose choice may significantly affect the probability of inclusion. This study presents a framework for the effective computation of regions that include the unknown function with exact probability. In this setting, the users not only have the freedom to modulate the amount of prior knowledge that informs the constructed regions but can, on a different plane, finely modulate their commitment to such information. The result is a versatile certified estimation framework capable of addressing a multitude of problems, ranging from parametric estimation (where the probabilistic guarantees can be issued under no commitment to the prior information) to non-parametric problems (that call for fine exploitation of prior information).},

The hope of this combination is to reduce the reliance of MPC schemes on accurate models, and to tap into the fast developing machine learning and reinforcement learning tools to exploit the growing amount of data available for many systems. In particular, the combination of reinforcement learning and MPC has been proposed as a viable and theoretically justified approach to introduce explainable, safe and stable policies in reinforcement learning. However, a formal theory detailing how the safety and stability of an MPC-based policy can be maintained through the parameter updates delivered by the learning tools is still lacking. This paper addresses this gap. The theory is developed for the generic robust MPC case, and applied in simulation in the robust tube-based linear MPC case, where the theory is fairly easy to deploy in practice. The paper focuses on reinforcement learning as a learning tool, but it applies to any learning method that updates the MPC parameters online.},

Estimators designed to satisfy transient and robust specifications via a time-varying gain are then proposed to have this condition as necessary and sufficient for their convergence to the true values when continuous functions are involved. These estimators are then used as a part of an adaptive control scheme, following a modular approach, to solve a tracking control problem for a nonlinear system in the strict feedback form with parametric and non-parametric uncertainty. It is shown that the necessary and sufficient condition can be expressed without using closed-loop signals, which allows attaining finite-time identification, exponential convergence to the tracking aim, and local/global robustness to non-parametric perturbations with minimal excitation conditions on the tracked trajectory.

A novel class of multivariate-dependent Lyapunov function is constructed, which is mode-dependent, elapsed-time-dependent, and variation-dependent. The objective of this paper is to design two classes of time-varying gain controllers, i.e., elapsed-time-dependent controller and finite memory controller under bound sojourn time. Numerically testable stabilization criteria are established for discrete-time piecewise homogeneous SMJLSs via the proposed novel Lyapunov function and two classes of controllers. Furthermore, two desired stabilizing controllers are designed such that the closed-loop system is mean-square stable.

We divide all the sensors in the WSN into two groups corresponding to the two targets such that sensors in each group only observe one target but collect the information of the other one by communicating with the sensors in the other group. Then, the consensus-based distributed two-target tracking (CDTT) algorithms are proposed, applying the covariance intersection fusion rule to the information form of the extended Kalman filter. With this fusion rule, the consistency of the algorithms is guaranteed and the estimation accuracy is improved. Through analyzing the boundedness of the information matrices and the Lyapunov candidate defined on the estimation errors, we prove that the two-target tracking task can be completed by running the CDTT algorithms under certain conditions. Moreover, we extend the CDTT algorithms to the multi-target case, obtaining the consensus-based distributed multi-target tracking algorithms and showing their performance analysis. Simulation and experimental results are given to illustrate the performance of these tracking algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the problem of solving distributed online optimization over a network that consists of multiple interacting nodes. Each node in the network is endowed with a sequence of loss functions, each of which is revealed to the node after a decision has been committed. The goal of the network is to minimize the cumulative loss functions of nodes in a distributed fashion, while subject to two types of information constraints, namely, message quantization and bandit feedback. To this end, a quantized distributed online bandit optimization algorithm is proposed by adopting random quantization operation and one-point gradient estimator. We show the convergence of the algorithm by establishing an O ( d T 3 / 4 ) regret bound, where d is the dimension of states and T is the total number of rounds. Finally, an online distributed quadratic programming problem is investigated to validate the theoretical findings of the paper.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel clustering-based approach to the bounded-error identification of switched and piecewise affine autoregressive exogenous systems. We address the problem of determining a minimal collection of linear-in-the-parameters models (called modes) fitting with a given accuracy ɛ a set of input–output data while complying with the switched or piecewise affine nature of the system. The problem is tackled by suitably clustering the data according to their preferences with respect to a pool of candidate models identified on subsets of the available data. The preference of a data point for a model is assessed based on the extent to which that model fits that data point and is set to zero if the fit is worse than ɛ . A two-level clustering with outliers isolation is employed, first grouping data based on their preferences subject to suitable time/space adjacency conditions depending on the nature of the switching mechanism, and then collecting together non-adjacent clusters that can be described by the same mode. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated via comparative numerical examples and on experimental data from an electronic component placement process in a pick-and-place machine.},

Specifically, the finite- and infinite- zero structure of a channel in the network, defined by a single external actuation and measurement, is characterized. This is done by developing a two-layer transformation for the input–output model, which expresses the zero structure in terms of the subsystem model, global network interactions (graph), and the input and output locations. This algebraic characterization then provides a means to: (1) distinguish structural properties of the input–output channel (minimum and nonminimum behavior) in terms of the network’s graph, and (2) design of the graph to shape the input–output dynamics. Similar characterizations are also briefly explored for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network model with collocated measurements and actuations.},

First, a general design algorithm is presented for blocking observability at any group of m nodes, by applying state feedback controls at m + 2 specified actuation nodes. The algorithm is based on a method for eigenstructure assignment, which allows surgical modification of particular eigenvectors to block observability while preserving the remaining open-loop eigenstructure. Next, a sparser design is obtained, which leverages low-cardinality vertex cutsets separating the actuation and measurement locations in the network’s graph to reduce the required number of actuation nodes for observability blocking. Also, the design is modified to encompass regional feedback controls, which only use data from accessible nodes. The regional feedback design does not maintain the open-loop eigenstructure, but can be guaranteed to preserve stability via a time-scale argument. The sparser and regional feedback designs are illustrated with numerical examples.},

It is shown that an infinite-delayed system is (locally) ISS if it has a (local) ISS Lyapunov functional, and conversely, there exists a (local) ISS Lyapunov functional if it is (locally) ISS. To prove the converse ISS Lyapunov theorems, we establish a key technical lemma bridging ISS/LISS and robust asymptotic stability of systems with infinite delays and two converse Lyapunov theorems concerning robust asymptotic stability of systems with infinite delays. Two distinctive advantages of this work are that a large class of infinite dimensional spaces are allowed and the results are established based on a more general Lipschitz condition, i.e., the right hand side Lipschitz (RS-L) condition.

  abstract     = {Leader election, is a fundamental coordination problem in distributed systems. It has been addressed in many ways for different systems. Among these approaches, resilient leader election algorithms are of particular interest due to the ongoing emergence of open, complex distributed systems such as smart cities and the Internet of Things. However, previous algorithms attaining the optimal scaling of O(diameter) stabilization time complexity either assume some prior knowledge of the network or else that very large messages can be sent. In this paper, we present a resilient leader election algorithm with O(diameter) stabilization time, small messages, and no prior knowledge of the network. This algorithm is based on aggregate computing, which provides a layered approach to algorithm development based on composition of resilient algorithmic “building blocks.” With our algorithm, a key design function g ( ⋅ ) defines important performance attributes: a fast-growing g ( ⋅ ) will delay discarding of obsolete data, while a slow-growing g ( ⋅ ) will slow down convergence to a single leader. We prove that the best asymptotic behavior for g ( x ) is ( 1 + 2 ) x + o ( x ) , guaranteeing a near-optimal time complexity of ( 2 + 2 2 ) diameter + o(diameter) rounds for stabilization.},

An internal model principle-based attack, a kind of network attack, is firstly analyzed and modeled in frequency domain. Then, a Quasi- H ∞ robust controller is designed for resilient consensus of the MAS with the help of an internal model controller. This scheme is different from the existing works in the sense that the attacker may inject an attacking signal on the node of an agent instead of a communication link. It is also novel because it can eliminate the impacts of attack without excluding compromised nodes and restricting the number of compromised nodes. The proposed control scheme is applied to a linear delayed MAS with single-input single-output agents and then transformed into multi-input and multi-output agents. An innovative approach is employed for the tuning of the proposed controller to track the performance of the MAS and its robustness. Some necessary and sufficient conditions are extracted using Pade ́ approximation and graph theory to minimize the impacts of time delay and attacks simultaneously. The results are extended for resilient consensus of the MAS under non-internal model principle-based attack. The simulation results are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed control strategy.},

Although off-policy learning algorithms were recently designed for tracking problems, most of these results either are full-state feedback or have bounded control errors, which may not be flexible or desirable for engineering problems in the real world. To address these problems, we propose an output-feedback-based reinforcement learning approach that allows us to find the optimal control solution using input–output data and ensure the asymptotic tracking control of continuous-time systems. More specifically, we first propose a dynamical controller revised from the standard output regulation theory and use it to formulate an optimal output tracking problem. Then, a state observer is used to re-express the system state. Consequently, we address the rank issue of the parameterization matrix and analyze the state re-expression error that are crucial for transforming the off-policy learning into an output-feedback form. A comprehensive simulation study is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

By design, the controllers continuously steer the system toward a time-varying optimal equilibrium point without requiring knowledge of exogenous disturbances affecting the system. For cost functions that are smooth and satisfy the Polyak–Łojasiewicz inequality, we demonstrate that the online gradient-flow controller ensures uniform global exponential stability when the time scales of the system and controller are sufficiently separated and the switching signal of the system varies slowly on average. For cost functions that are strongly convex, we show that the hybrid accelerated controller can outperform the continuous gradient descent method. When the cost function is not strongly convex, we show that the hybrid accelerated method guarantees global practical asymptotic stability.},

By introducing one extra variable, the least square problem of linear equation can be transformed into a distributed constrained optimization problem. Based on the augmented Lagrange method, two continuous-time scalable distributed primal–dual algorithms are developed, in which all the states of agents have fewer dimension and can be even scalars. Subsequently, the discrete-time distributed algorithms with constant step-sizes are proposed by using the Euler discretization method, and the explicit bounds of constant step-sizes are provided. Based on the KKT condition and Lyapunov stability, we show that the proposed continuous-time and discrete-time distributed algorithms collaboratively obtain a least square solution with a linear convergence speed, and also own an additional property that verifies whether the obtained solution is an exact solution.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates a distributed optimization problem based on the framework of a multi-agent system over a directed communication network, where the global cost function is the sum of the local cost functions of agents. The communication network is abstracted as a weight-unbalanced directed graph. First, a surplus-based accelerated algorithm with a fixed stepsize (SAAFS) is proposed by integrating the gradient tracking strategy into the surplus-based consensus protocol to address the problem considered. The matrix norm argument and matrix perturbation theory are employed to prove the linear convergence of SAAFS under the assumption that each local cost function is strongly convex with the Lipschitz continuous gradient. Second, the limitation of the stepsize, which is common to all agents, is relaxed in the cases of different stepsizes for each agent, such that the surplus-based accelerated algorithm with an uncoordinated stepsize (SAAUS) is proposed. It is proven that SAAUS also has a linear convergence rate if the upper bound of the uncoordinated stepsize at each agent is restricted by a sufficiently small positive number. Finally, two simulation examples are provided to evaluate the proposed algorithms and illustrate that both SAAFS and SAAUS achieve acceleration, particularly for ill-conditioned optimization problems.},

The approximate problems can then be solved by gradient-based optimization methods.

In this paper, we introduce a novel technique where the switching times for each of the control component functions can be adaptively selected. To demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed approach, two example problems with control input and terminal state constraints are solved using the method proposed. Numerical results show that the new method achieves much better objective values with some increase in computation time compared to the conventional time-scaling transformation technique.},

The proposed control Lyapunov and barrier functions/functionals extend the existing ones from the delay-free case to the time-delay case, and allow for designing the stabilizing and safety controllers in closed-form. Since analytical solutions to time-delay optimal control problems are hard to be achieved, a sliding mode control based approach is developed to merge the proposed control Lyapunov and barrier functions/functionals. Based on the sliding surface functional, a feedback control law is established to investigate the stabilization and safety objectives simultaneously. In particular, the properties of the sliding surface functional are analyzed, and further how to construct the sliding surface functional is discussed. Finally, the proposed approaches are illustrated via two numerical examples from the connected cruise control problem of automotive systems and the synchronization problem of multi-agent systems.},

  abstract     = {We study the strong structural controllability (SSC) of networks, where the external control inputs are injected to only some nodes, namely the leaders. For such systems, one measure of controllability is the dimension of strong structurally controllable subspace (SSCS), which is equal to the smallest possible rank of controllability matrix under admissible coupling weights among the nodes In this paper, we compare two tight lower bounds on the dimension of SSCS: one based on the distances of followers to leaders, and the other based on the graph coloring process known as zero forcing. We first show that each of these two bounds can be arbitrarily better than the other in some special cases. We then show that the distance-based lower bound is usually better than the zero-forcing-based bound when the value of the latter is less than the dimensionality of the overall network state, n . On the other hand, we also show that any set of leaders that makes the distance-based bound equal to n necessarily makes the zero-forcing-based bound equal to n (the converse is not true). These results indicate that while the zero-forcing-based approach may be preferable when the focus is only on verifying complete SSC (dimension of SSCS is equal to n ), the distance-based approach usually yields a closer bound on the dimension of SSCS when the bounds are both smaller than n . Furthermore, we also present a novel bound based on combining these two approaches, which is always at least as good as, and in some cases strictly greater than, the maximum of the two original bounds. Finally, we support our analysis with numerical results on various graphs.},

The Nash certainty equivalence was used to obtain a Markovian closed-loop Nash equilibrium for the limiting system when the number of minor agents tends to infinity. In the past years several approaches to major–minor mean field game problems have been developed, principally (i) the Nash certainty equivalence and analytic approach, (ii) master equations, (iii) asymptotic solvability, and (iv) the probabilistic approach. For the LQG case, (Firoozi, Jaimungal, and Caines, 2020) develops a convex analysis approach and retrieves the equilibrium obtained via (i). Moreover, (Huang, 2021) establishes the equivalency of the Markovian closed-loop Nash equilibrium obtained via (i) with those obtained via (ii) and (iii). Finally, in this work we demonstrate that the Markovian closed-loop Nash equilibrium of (i) is equivalent to that of (iv). These three studies answer the long-standing questions about the consistency of the solutions to major-minor LQG MFG systems derived using different approaches.},

  abstract     = {Industrial control systems have been frequent targets of cyber attacks during the last decade. Adversaries can hinder the safe operation of these systems by tampering with their sensors and actuators, while ensuring that the monitoring systems are not able to detect such attacks in time. This paper presents methods to design and overcome stealthy attacks on linear time-invariant control systems that estimate their state using an interval observer, in the presence of unknown but bounded noise and perturbations. We analyze scenarios in which a malicious agent compromises the sensors and/or the actuators of the system with additive attack signals to steer the state estimate outside of the bounds provided by the interval observer. We first show that maximally disruptive attack sequences that remain undetected by a linear monitor can be computed recursively via linear programming. We then design an attack-resilient interval observer for the system’s state, identifying sufficient conditions on the sensor data for such an observer to be realizable. We propose a computational method to determine optimal observer gains using semi-definite programming and compute bounds for the unknown attack signal as well. In numerical simulations, we illustrate and compare the ability of such interval observers to still provide accurate estimates when under attack.},

Specifically, the approach decomposes the design of the constraint management strategy into two parts: enforcement at steady-state, and during transient. The former is achieved by using the forward and inverse steady-state characterization of the nonlinear system, which is available, for example, in many applications in the automotive industry. The latter is achieved by implementing an RG-based approach, which employs a novel Robust Output Admissible Set (ROAS), which is obtained using data from the nonlinear system. This scheme is systematically studied, and algorithms for its implementation are provided. The scheme is validated using simulations, as well as real experiments on a turbocharged gasoline engine.},

  abstract     = {By enabling the nodes or agents to solve small-sized subproblems to achieve coordination, distributed algorithms are favored by many networked systems for efficient and scalable computation. While for convex problems, substantial distributed algorithms are available, the results for the more broad nonconvex counterparts are extremely lacking. This paper develops a distributed algorithm for a class of nonconvex and nonsmooth problems featured by (i) a nonconvex objective formed by both separate and composite components regarding the decision variables of interconnected agents, (ii) local bounded convex constraints, and (iii) coupled linear constraints. This problem is directly originated from smart buildings and is also broad in other domains. To provide a distributed algorithm with convergence guarantee, we revise the powerful alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) method and proposed a proximal ADMM. Specifically, noting that the main difficulty to establish the convergence for the nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization with ADMM is to assume the boundness of dual updates, we propose to update the dual variables in a discounted manner. This leads to the establishment of a so-called sufficiently decreasing and lower bounded Lyapunov function, which is critical to establish the convergence. We prove that the method converges to some approximate stationary points. We besides showcase the efficacy and performance of the method by a numerical example and the concrete application to multi-zone heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) control in smart buildings.},

  abstract     = {Active–passive networks are composed of nodes that meet specific criteria depending on applications (active nodes) and nodes that do not (passive nodes). This paper investigates the network size estimation problem, which involves determining the number of active nodes in anonymous active–passive networks in a distributed way. To this end, a distributed counting architecture is proposed to locally manipulate the criteria for being an active node via a variable and to count the number of active nodes, where this is accomplished without prior knowledge of the network or a procedure for initialization. Several properties of an anonymous network such as network size, number of nodes for a given degree, the maximum and minimum degrees, and so on, can be deduced using the proposed architecture by varying the criteria variable. Stability and convergence analysis of the proposed architecture are presented, and its effectiveness is also demonstrated through a numerical example.},

Necessary and sufficient conditions for the robust F -stabilization under dynamical structured uncertainties are given, in terms of matrix inequalities. If besides dynamical, also statical uncertainties are included, the given conditions are only sufficient. The conditions are not convex, but for two dual classes of plants, it is shown that the conditions are convex, expressed by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). An algorithm for controller design is given, and is illustrated by academic examples. It is shown that the uncertainty region where the closed-loop system is stable, obtained by the algorithm, is maximal in respect to literature. It is shown that some of the uncertainties/channels can be completely rejected using the control. If the design algorithm with a transformation is applied to simultaneous robust stabilization and robust ℋ ∞ performance, it improves the performance that can be obtained using the method based on inclusion of an extra uncertainty block in the purely robust stabilization scheme.},

In this paper, we provide a framework to design dynamic periodic event-triggered controllers for multi-agent systems (MASs) with nonlinear dynamics. A preliminary version of this work on single-agent systems was studied in Dhullipalla et al. (2020). The design methodology adopts an emulation-based technique that assumes the existence of a continuous-time state feedback controller that stabilizes the MAS. The dynamic ETMs are constructed based on an agent’s ability or inability to sense states (or relative states) of fellow agents in the network. To illustrate the design methodologies, two case studies on nonlinear MASs (with Lipschitz and one-sided Lipschitz dynamics), interacting over undirected and directed communication networks, are presented. Finally, the results of the case studies are demonstrated via numerical examples.},

The measured output of the system is assumed to be dropped in a probabilistic way before being transmitted to the controller. By virtue of the single exponential smoothing technique, a novel compensation strategy is proposed to help offset the impact of missing measurements. On this basis, an asynchronous output feedback tracking controller is designed to ensure the stochastic stability and strict dissipativity of the tracking error system. Then, sufficient conditions for the existence of the controller are derived via the mode-dependent and fuzzy-basis-dependent Lyapunov function.

It is then shown that SSM depends on the network connectivity λ 2 which increases with r , as well as the geometric shape of Nyquist plot of L ( s ) .

We develop and analyze an accelerated distributed gradient descent method, named Acc-DGDlm, which utilizes gradient tracking technique and local memory. Specifically, we add two memory slots per agent to store two past estimates, namely, an estimate of the optimal solution and an estimate of the average gradient. For strongly convex and smooth functions, Acc-DGDlm achieves a linear convergence rate of O ( C k ) for some constant 0 &lt; C &lt; 1 when the fixed stepsize is sufficiently small and the coefficient θ of past variables satisfies 0 ≤ θ &lt; 1 . Compared to the related works where both the stepsize and the momentum coefficient should belong to intervals determined by global parameters, we eliminate the dependence of θ on global parameters, which makes θ easy to be chosen in practice. We also provide a theoretical analysis showing that including local memory can decrease the convergence factor C and thus speed up the convergence. Besides, numerical experiments with distributed estimation problems show that Acc-DGDlm converges faster in comparison with state-of-the-art methods, especially for sparse networks.},

Our method, firstly, integrates the well-known MRAC and quantized control techniques to construct a quantized output feedback adaptive control law with parameter update laws. Then, some vital technical lemmas are developed, fundamentally applicable to finite and infinite quantized output feedback MRAC. Moreover, we prove that in the case of infinite quantization, appropriately choosing the output quantizer’s sensitivity affords the proposed adaptive control law to ensure closed-loop stability and achieve bounded or asymptotic output tracking. The significant advantage of the developed adaptive control scheme is combining the benefits of the classic MRAC and quantized control. Compared with current adaptive tracking control schemes, the developed scheme not only reduces the feedback information requirement, but also has full capability to achieve closed-loop stability and output tracking. The effectiveness of the proposed MRAC scheme is verified through several simulations.},

So far, only for a relatively small number of classes of matrices A has it been possible to accurately describe the sequences of matrices that guarantee the maximum rate of increase of the corresponding norms. Moreover, in almost all cases studied theoretically, the index sequences { σ n } of matrices maximizing the norms of the corresponding matrix products have been shown to be periodic or so-called Sturmian, which entails a whole set of “good” properties of the sequences { A σ n } , in particular the existence of a limiting frequency of occurrence of each matrix factor A i ∈ A in them. In the paper it is shown that this is not always the case: a class of matrices is defined consisting of two 2 × 2 matrices, similar to rotations in the plane, in which the sequence { A σ n } maximizing the growth rate of the norms ‖ A σ n ⋯ A σ 0 ‖ is not Sturmian.

In order to guarantee the finite-time convergence of the system states and unwinding-free performance of the system on the sliding surface, a novel switching function is constructed by a hyperbolic sine function such that the obtained terminal sliding surface contains two equilibria. Then, a terminal attitude tracking control law is developed to ensure that the system states are driven to the sliding surface in a finite time. Moreover, a boundary layer is introduced to solve the chattering problem of the designed controller. The convergence of the system states within the boundary layer is guaranteed by imposing a constraint for the parameter of the developed switching function. Furthermore, the subsets of attraction domains of the two equilibria are given by designing a dynamic parameter for the proposed control law. The simulation results illustrate that the attitude tracking of rigid spacecraft without unwinding is realized by adopting the proposed attitude control law.},

We consider decentralized best-response with inertia type algorithms in which agents form beliefs about the future actions of other players based on local information, and take actions that maximize their expected utilities computed with respect to these beliefs or continue to take their previous actions. We show convergence of these types of algorithms to a Nash equilibrium in weakly acyclic games. The result depends on the condition that the belief update and information exchange protocols successfully learn the actions of other players with positive probability in finite time given a static environment, i.e., when other agents’ actions do not change. We design a decentralized fictitious play algorithm with voluntary and limited communication (DFP-VL) protocols that satisfy this condition. In the voluntary communication protocol, each agent decides whom to exchange information with by assessing the novelty of its information and the potential effect of its information on others’ beliefs. The limited communication protocol entails agents sending only their most frequent action to agents that they decide to communicate with. Numerical experiments on a target assignment game demonstrate that the voluntary and limited communication protocol can more than halve the number of communication attempts while retaining the same convergence rate as DFP in which agents constantly attempt to communicate.},

By designing a nonlinear feedback law and tightening the system constraints, robust constraint satisfaction can be ensured for all admissible uncertainties. In addition, to guarantee the recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability of the proposed CRMPC, a terminal controller, along with a terminal region, is introduced.

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the optimal control problem for networked systems with the round-robin protocol (RRP) under the denial-of-service (DoS) attacker with power interval. In the literature, the control design is studied for the linear networked system subject to the DoS attacks with a known constant power or a known constant probability of data-packet dropouts. In this paper, the objective is to control the unknown nonlinear system in the communication network subject to the DoS attacks with a power interval and a time-varying probability of data-packet dropouts. The effects of the DoS attacks with power interval on a networked system under RRP are modeled accurately. A neural network (NN) -based observer is designed for the nonlinear system under the DoS attacks with power interval, and the relationship between the DoS attacker power interval and state estimation error is obtained. The NN actor–critic policy for the optimal control of the RRP-based networked system under the DoS attacks with power interval is found with adaptive dynamical programming, and stability of the resulting control system is analyzed. The proposed control method is demonstrated by a networked uninterruptible power supply system.},

Energy data packages and flow-dispatch commands are transmitted over a communication network and corrupted by adversaries. In particular, we consider false data injection attacks that maliciously tamper with the data presented to grid operators. We develop an OPF model considering piecewise invariable load and power generation, which can be evaluated using a linear program. We extend the problem to an online setting, where data are sequentially observed, and adaptive strategies are required to optimize a metric, called the regret function, over time. We then incorporate the state-of-the-art adaptive change-point detection approach to develop an online routing algorithm that retains a sublinear regret in both the time horizon and number of change points. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm were verified by numerical experiments on real-world smart grids.},

In the presence of a process disturbance in data, we have that a set of dynamics could have generated the collected data and we need the designed controller to stabilize such set of data-consistent dynamics robustly. For this problem of data-driven control with noisy data, we advocate the use of a popular tool from robust control, Petersen’s lemma. In the cases of data generated by linear and polynomial systems, we conveniently express the uncertainty captured in the set of data-consistent dynamics through a matrix ellipsoid, and we show that a specific form of this matrix ellipsoid makes it possible to apply Petersen’s lemma to all of the mentioned cases. In this way, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for data-driven stabilization of linear systems through a linear matrix inequality. The matrix ellipsoid representation enables insights and interpretations of the designed control laws. In the same way, we also obtain sufficient conditions for data-driven stabilization of polynomial systems through alternate (convex) sum-of-squares programs. The findings are illustrated numerically.},

In this paper, we provide new theoretical insight into such behaviors and discuss control options. Instead of the standard replicator dynamics, we use a more realistic and comprehensive model of replicator–mutator dynamics , to describe the strategic evolution of the population. After integrating the environment feedback, we study the effect of mutations on the resulting closed-loop system dynamics. We prove the conditions for two types of bifurcations, Hopf bifurcation and Heteroclinic bifurcation , both of which result in stable limit cycles . These limit cycles have not been identified in existing works, and we further prove that such limit cycles are in fact persistent in a large parameter space and are almost globally stable. In the end, an intuitive control policy based on incentives is applied, and the effectiveness of this control policy is examined by analysis and simulations.},

The twofold features of the presented method include: (i) the data-driven identification approach provides an easy-to-implement solution which avoids the direct optimization of a non-convex inverse problem as well as complicated algebraic manipulations on Riccati equations; (ii) the identification framework does not rely on the initial states or terminal costates, which enables its implementation using only segments of data trajectories.

  abstract     = {Hybrid systems form a particularly rich class of dynamical systems based on the combination of multiple continuous subsystems and a discrete mechanism deciding which one of these is active at a given time. Their identification from input–output data involves nontrivial issues that were partly solved over the last twenty years thanks to numerous approaches. However, despite this effort, estimating the number of modes (or subsystems) of hybrid systems remains a critical and open issue. This paper focuses on switched linear systems and proposes an analysis of their identification based on statistical learning theory. This leads to new theoretically sound bounds on the prediction error of switched models on the one hand, and a practical method for the estimation of the number of modes on the other hand. The latter is inspired by the structural risk minimization principle developed in statistical learning for model selection. The proposed analysis is conducted under various assumptions on the model class and regularization schemes for which new algorithms are presented. Numerical experiments are also provided to illustrate the accuracy of the proposed method.},

First, a general multi-platoon control framework is developed, which accommodates longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics, inter- and intra-platoon information exchanges, falsified driving commands, and unknown external disturbances. To deal with the unknown falsified driving commands on the platoon performance, a neural-network-based adaptive control strategy is developed to compensate their adverse effects. In order to avert both longitudinal and lateral collisions under various maneuvering scenarios, a built-in avoidance mechanism is then designed for each platoon vehicle. Furthermore, a secure and anti-collision multi-platoon control design approach is proposed to ensure the desired inter- and intra-platoon tracking performance with a collision-free guarantee. It is formally proved that the inter- and intra-platoon tracking errors converge to small neighborhood around zero. Finally, several comparative simulation cases are presented to verify the effectiveness and merits of the proposed multi-platoon control approach.},

Despite the influence of these misbehaviors, the benign agents aim to reach an agreement while avoiding being seriously influenced by the faulty ones. To this end, this paper first considers a general class of consensus algorithms, where each benign agent computes an “auxiliary point” based on the received values and moves its state towards this point. Concerning this generic form, we present conditions for achieving resilient consensus and obtain a lower bound on the exponential convergence rate. Assuming that the number of malicious agents is upper bounded, two specific resilient consensus algorithms are further developed based on the obtained conditions. Particularly, the first solution, based on Helly’s Theorem, achieves the consensus within the convex hull formed by the benign agents’ initial states, where the auxiliary point can be efficiently computed through linear programming. On the other hand, the second algorithm serves as a “built-in” security guarantee for standard average consensus algorithms, in the sense that its performance coincides exactly with that of the standard ones in the absence of faulty nodes while also resisting the serious influence of the misbehaving ones in adversarial environment. Some numerical examples are provided in the end to verify the theoretical results.},

The state M ( t , ⋅ ) belongs to the Sobolev space H 1 ( ( ω ∗ , ω ∗ ) , S 2 ) where the parameter ω ∈ ( ω ∗ , ω ∗ ) is the Larmor frequency. Previous works have constructed a Lyapunov based stabilizing feedback in a convenient H 1 -norm that assures local L ∞ -convergence of the initial state M 0 ( ω ) to the south pole, solving locally the approximate steering problem from M 0 towards the south pole. However, the corresponding control law contains a comb of periodic π -Rabi pulses (Dirac impulses), corresponding to strongly unbounded control. The present work proposes smooth uniformly bounded time-varying controls for this local steering problem, where the Rabi pulses are replaced by adiabatic following smooth pulses. Furthermore, simulations show that this new strategy produces faster convergence, even for initial conditions “relatively far” from the south pole.},

In the scenario of the proposed designs, each local controller is realized by a parallel connection of a public element and a private element. The public elements are uniform and open access. However, the private elements are allowed to be significant nonuniform and are only known by the pairs of agents who share them. For both continuous-time multi-agent systems and their sampled-data counterparts, we provide the design criterions for the partial public protocols under both static and dynamic public elements, respectively. By exploring the edge sensitivity design approach, it is shown that the consensus can be achieved under the proposed protocols if the private control laws satisfy certain constraints dependent on the public ones and the network topologies.

To alleviate the communication burden in a shared network, as a first effort, a novel dynamic event-triggered round-robin protocol is forwarded to regulate whether to release the measurements and which ones to release. In light of the dynamic event-triggered round-robin protocol, an asynchronous dynamic output feedback control law is constructed, which reflects the mismatching phenomenon of modes switching between the nonhomogeneous Markov switching systems and the desired controllers. By resorting to a novel Lyapunov functional, sufficient conditions are attained to guarantee the stochastic stability of the augmented dynamic.

  abstract     = {Complete vehicle energy management (CVEM) aims at minimizing the energy consumption of all subsystems inside a vehicle. When the subsystems consist of energy buffers with linear dynamics and/or power converters with quadratic power losses, the CVEM becomes a large-scale and ill-conditioned optimal control problem for which well-known solution approaches (e.g. Pontryagin’s maximum principle, dynamic programming, convex and derivative-free optimization methods) are not effective. In this paper, we design an efficient solution algorithm for this problem by leveraging the framework of operator splitting methods. To facilitate its implementation, we propose a spectral method that automatically tunes the step sizes at every iteration and, in practice, accelerates convergence. Finally, we consider a case study for a parallel-hybrid vehicle and we illustrate the numerical performance of our method by showing that we can efficiently solve a CVEM problem with very large horizons.},

  abstract     = {Discrete abstractions have become a standard approach to assist control synthesis under complex specifications. Most techniques for the construction of a discrete abstraction for a continuous-time system require time–space discretization of the concrete system, which constitutes property satisfaction for the continuous-time system non-trivial. In this work, we aim at relaxing this requirement by introducing a control interface. Firstly, we connect the continuous-time uncertain concrete system with its discrete deterministic state-space abstraction with a control interface. Then, a novel stability notion called η -approximately controlled globally practically stable, and a new simulation relation called robust approximate simulation relation are proposed. It is shown that the uncertain concrete system, under the condition that there exists an admissible control interface such that the augmented system (composed of the concrete system and its abstraction) can be made η -approximately controlled globally practically stable, robustly approximately simulates its discrete abstraction. The effectiveness of the proposed results is illustrated by two simulation examples.},

To this end, we propose a method that uses data to directly design a control mechanism without any explicit identification step. Our approach is online, meaning that the data are collected over time while the system is evolving in closed-loop, and are directly used to iteratively update the controller. A major benefit of the proposed online implementation is therefore the ability of the controller to automatically adjust to changes in the operating mode of the system. We show that the proposed control mechanism guarantees stability of the closed-loop switched linear system provided that the switching is slow enough. Effectiveness of the proposed design technique is illustrated for two aerospace applications.},

The behavior of the autonomous vehicles resembles that of self-driven particles that individually produce their driving force and steering, while interacting with each other, giving rise to an emerging particle traffic flow. The bicycle kinematic model is used to model the dynamics of the vehicles, and each vehicle determines its control input based only on its own state and on the relative displacement vector from other (adjacent) vehicles and the boundary of the road. The resulting control system is nonlinear and evolves on a specific open set. Therefore, the feedback design is challenging and is accomplished by means of a control Lyapunov function methodology. Potential functions and Barbălat’s lemma are employed to prove the following properties, which are ensured by the proposed nonlinear controller: (i) the vehicles do not collide with each other or with the boundary of the road; (ii) the speeds of all vehicles are always positive, i.e., no vehicle moves backwards at any time; (iii) the speed of all vehicles remain below a given speed limit; (iv) all vehicle speeds converge to a given longitudinal speed set-point; and (v) the accelerations, lateral speeds, and orientations of all vehicles tend to zero. The efficiency of the proposed 2-D cruise controllers is illustrated by means of numerical examples.},

We adopt a multiscale approach to analysis and design to ensure consistency of the algorithms in the large-scale limit. First, we represent the macroscopic configuration of the swarm as a probability measure and formulate the macroscopic coverage task as the minimization of a convex objective function over probability measures. We then construct a macroscopic dynamics for swarm coverage, which takes the form of a proximal descent scheme in the L 2 -Wasserstein space. Our analysis exploits the generalized geodesic convexity of the coverage objective function, proving convergence in the L 2 -Wasserstein sense to the target probability measure. We then obtain a consistent gradient descent algorithm in the Euclidean space that is implementable by a finite collection of agents, via a “variational” discretization of the macroscopic coverage objective function. We establish the convergence properties of the gradient descent and its behavior in the continuous-time and large-scale limits. Furthermore, we establish a connection with well-known Lloyd-based algorithms, seen as a particular class of algorithms within our framework, and demonstrate our results via numerical experiments.},

Here, the objective is to provide a Lyapunov analysis leading to efficient and precise stability criteria. Thanks to the Legendre orthogonal basis, the study is possible using dedicated Lyapunov functionals. Such functionals contain information based on the state of an augmented finite-dimensional system and a remaining infinite-dimensional system, associated with the first Legendre coefficients and the remainder of the Legendre expansion, respectively. Furthermore, the Legendre’s development provides efficient formulations of Bessel and Wirtinger inequalities and leads to sufficient stability conditions expressed as scalable linear matrix inequalities.

  abstract     = {This paper provides a solution for the preservation of consensus in a network of several agents, described by discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems. Consensus preservation is the problem of maintaining a certain distance between the states of several systems, given that the systems’ initial states are close to each other. The agents are equipped with both a smart sensor, capable of measuring the state of the system and performing some computations, and a controller. The sensors and controllers are placed at locations that are remote from one another. A network of communication channels with limited transmission capacity connects the agents by allowing the sensors to send messages to the controllers of their system as well as to the controllers of other systems. The controllers use the messages that they receive to steer the agents such that the consensus is preserved. Sensors and controllers that achieve this feature are called consensus-preserving protocols. In this paper, three distinct consensus-preserving protocols are presented, each with an increasing degree of interaction between the systems. For each of these protocols, a theorem providing conditions on the minimum communication capacity sufficient to implement them is presented. The protocols are tested by simulations for a network of logistic maps and a network of Hénon maps. For both of these networks, analytical bounds on the sufficient transmission capacities in the communication channels to implement the protocols are provided. These bounds are compared to rates observed in simulations of the consensus-preserving protocols.},

The proposed scheme is based on a notion of so-called pseudo-barrier functions computed for subsystems, by employing which one can synthesize hybrid controllers for interconnected systems enforcing complex specifications over a finite-time horizon. Particularly, we first leverage sufficient small-gain type conditions to compositionally construct control barrier functions for interconnected systems based on the corresponding pseudo-barrier functions computed for subsystems. Then, using the constructed control barrier functions, we provide probabilistic guarantees on the satisfaction of given complex specifications in a bounded time horizon. In this respect, we decompose the given complex specification to simpler reachability tasks based on automata representing the complements of original finite-state automata. We then provide systematic approaches to solve those simpler reachability tasks by computing corresponding pseudo-barrier functions. Two different systematic techniques are provided based on (i) the sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization program and (ii) counter-example guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) to search for pseudo-barrier functions of subsystems while synthesizing local controllers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed results by applying them to a fully-interconnected Kuramoto network of 100 nonlinear oscillators with Markovian switching signals.},

The objective is to calculate estimates of the state at the remote location in real-time with maximum given error, whilst using the communication channel as little as possible. An event-triggered communication strategy is proposed in order to reduce the average number of communications. An important feature of this strategy is to provide an estimation of the relation between the observation error and the communication rate.

It is found that when only sampled input and output data are available for estimation, the IVSVF estimator is not consistent for any fixed sampling period due to the interpolation error that arises from constructing the filtered output. A Bias-Eliminated IVSVF (BEIVSVF) estimator is then proposed and shown to be consistent. The theoretical results developed in the paper are also discussed from a practical standpoint. Simulations are performed to verify the performance of the proposed method as well as to support the theoretical results.},

More specifically, we develop a novel robust distributed estimation algorithm, capable of achieving practically zero average tracking error even for fast time-varying reference signals. The proposed scheme is purely distributed, since the estimation algorithm is based solely on local computations and local communication among neighboring agents, and guarantees prescribed performance in the sense that any convergence rate and steady state deviation among the agents’ estimates may be achieved via the appropriate selection of certain design parameters. Moreover, the consensus and average tracking performance are fully decoupled, thus allowing easy tuning of the gains. Additionally, intermittent implementation is proposed via appropriately selected event- and self-triggering mechanisms. Finally, the approach is clarified and verified through various simulation paradigms.},

Firstly, the time-varying dynamics is not required to be continuous but allowed to have jumps. Also the system matrix is not assumed to be always Hurwitz. In addition, there is nonlinear time-varying perturbation which may be persistent. We first propose several mild regularity assumptions, under which the total variations of the system matrix and its abscissa are well-defined over arbitrary time interval. We then state our main result of the work, which requires the combined assessment of the total variation of the system matrix, the measure when the system is not sufficiently “stable” and the estimate of the perturbation to be upper bounded by a function affine in time. When this condition is met, we prove that the neighborhood of the origin, whose size depends on the magnitude of the perturbation, is uniformly globally exponentially stable for the system. We make several remarks, connecting our results with the known stability theory from continuous linear time-varying systems and switched systems. Finally, a numerical example is included to further illustrate the application of the main result.},

We investigate the dynamic open-loop equilibrium mean–variance pairs trading strategy under such a delayed cointegration model. The existence and uniqueness results for the equilibrium are offered. We prove in general that the equilibrium strategy can lead to statistical arbitrage under certain conditions that are related to the roots of the corresponding characteristic equation.

While most of them optimize a simple cost function along a fixed finite-time horizon, no consensus has been reached about how to simultaneously handle the I P P and the E F S , while minimizing the intervention’s side effects. In this work, based on a new characterization of the dynamical behaviour of SIR-type models under control actions (including the stability of equilibrium sets in terms of herd immunity), we study how to minimize the E F S while keeping the I P P controlled at any time. A procedure is proposed to tailor NPIs by separating transient from stationary control objectives: the potential benefits of the strategy are illustrated by a detailed analysis and simulation results related to the COVID-19 pandemic.},

We first improve the verification of the finiteness condition. In particular, the complexity of our new condition removes a dependency on the number of delays. We also show that, without imposing further conditions on the system, the number of checks cannot be further reduced. The methodology relies on interpreting the verification of the finiteness conditions in terms of a Polynomial Identity Testing problem. Second we show, in a constructive way, that if the strong ℋ 2 norm is finite, the system can always be transformed into a regular neutral-type system with the same ℋ 2 norm, without derivatives in the input or in the output equations. This result closes a gap in the literature as such a transformation was known to exist only under additional assumptions on the system. The transformation enables the computation of the strong ℋ 2 norm using delay Lyapunov matrices. Illustrative examples are provided throughout the paper.},

In such problems, the set (objective) functions of interest often have monotonicity and submodularity properties. Hence, the class of monotone submodular set function maximization problems has been widely studied in the literature. Owing to its challenging nature, almost all existing solutions for this class of problems are based on greedy algorithms. A seminal work on this topic has exploited the submodularity property to prove a (1-1/e) performance bound for such greedy solutions. More recent literature on this topic has been focused on exploiting different curvature properties to establish improved (tighter) performance bounds. However, such improvements come at the cost of enforcing additional assumptions and increasing computational complexity while facing significant inherent limitations. In this paper, first, a brief review of existing performance bounds is provided. Then, a new performance bound that does not require any additional assumptions and is both practical and computationally inexpensive is proposed. In particular, this new performance bound is established based on a series of upper bounds derived for the objective function that can be computed in parallel with the execution of the greedy algorithm. Finally, to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed performance bound, extensive numerical results obtained from a well-known class of multi-agent coverage problems are provided.},

Without involving the control of high-order dynamics, existing distributed resource allocation algorithms cannot deal with our problem. Meanwhile, the high-order dynamics together with the inequality constraints makes it difficult to design and analyze distributed resource allocation algorithms, because the outputs of agents cannot be decided by their inputs directly and the optimal decisions of agents must satisfy the inequality constraints. In order to control the high-order agents to accomplish the resource allocation tasks autonomously, a distributed algorithm is designed by state feedback, gradient descent and primal–dual methods. Moreover, the convergence of the algorithm is analyzed by convex analysis and Lyapunov stability theory. With the algorithm, the high-order agents converge to the optimal allocation.

As a cornerstone of topology graph transformation, N S i graph division, which is proposed for the first time in this paper, plays a crucial role in stabilizability analysis and has far-reaching impact. It establishes an equivalent connection between the stabilizability of the original topology graph and the quotient graph. Results reveal a nontrivial relationship between stabilizability of uncontrollable multi-agent systems and network topology (i.e., the stabilizability of uncontrollable multi-agent systems is not only related to the selection of leaders, but also depends on uncontrollable modes.), which is established by quotient graph as a visual generalization of the original network topology. Surprisingly, structural balance is not always good, and unbalance has a positive effect on the stabilizability of the system.

An impulsive system representation, given by a linear flow and a nonlinear jump dynamics due to the saturation term, is employed. From this representation, a convenient partition of the admissible interval for the intersampling time and an appropriate model of the saturation term, the computation of polyhedral contractive sets is carried out considering a convex embedding of the behavior of the system at the sampling instants. It is then shown that the computed polyhedra are included in the region of attraction of the continuous-time plant driven by the sampled-data control.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a sparse Bayesian treatment of deep neural networks (DNNs) for system identification. Although DNNs show impressive approximation ability in various fields, several challenges still exist for system identification problems. First, DNNs are known to be too complex that they can easily overfit the training data. Second, the selection of the input regressors for system identification is nontrivial. Third, uncertainty quantification of the model parameters and predictions are necessary. The proposed Bayesian approach offers a principled way to alleviate the above challenges by marginal likelihood/model evidence approximation and structured group sparsity-inducing priors construction. The identification algorithm is derived as an iterative regularised optimisation procedure that can be solved as efficiently as training typical DNNs. Remarkably, an efficient and recursive Hessian calculation method for each layer of DNNs is developed, turning the intractable training/optimisation process into a tractable one. Furthermore, a practical calculation approach based on the Monte-Carlo integration method is derived to quantify the uncertainty of the parameters and predictions. The effectiveness of the proposed Bayesian approach is demonstrated on several linear and nonlinear system identification benchmarks by achieving good and competitive simulation accuracy. The code to reproduce the experimental results is open-sourced and available online.},

In these piecewise-smooth dynamical systems sliding dynamics, i.e., dynamics on the switching boundary, have been reported for population models. However, the question whether or not, and if so under which conditions, sliding dynamics may occur in an optimally controlled system have not yet been studied. We explore this issue in a simple harvesting model with two regimes, and find that optimal sliding may occur if regular steady states do not exist. Hence, sliding dynamics may be part of an optimal policy.},

  abstract     = {The paper studies identification of linear systems with multiplicative noise from multiple-trajectory data. An algorithm based on the least-squares method and multiple-trajectory data is proposed for joint estimation of the nominal system matrices and the covariance matrix of the multiplicative noise. The algorithm does not need prior knowledge of the noise or stability of the system, but requires only independent inputs with pre-designed first and second moments and relatively small trajectory length. The study of identifiability of the noise covariance matrix shows that there exists an equivalent class of matrices that generate the same second-moment dynamic of system states. It is demonstrated how to obtain the equivalent class based on estimates of the noise covariance. Asymptotic consistency of the algorithm is verified under sufficiently exciting inputs and system controllability conditions. Non-asymptotic performance of the algorithm is also analyzed under the assumption that the system is bounded. The analysis provides high-probability bounds vanishing as the number of trajectories grows to infinity. The results are illustrated by numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {A novel approach is proposed to the prescribed-time stabilizing design of feedback linearizable controllable systems regardless of their initial conditions. The basic design idea consists in scaling an appropriate finite-time stabilizing non-Lipschitz feedback by means of a certain time deformation which squeezes the infinite time interval [ 0 , ∞ ) to the prescribed one [ 0 , T ) , while also changing the state variables. The resulting nonsmooth feedback design relies on time-varying gains, uniformly bounded over the infinite horizon, thereby yielding an attractive implementation opportunity which is opposed to the original design (Song et al., 2017) with time-varying gains, escaping to infinity as time goes to the prescribed time instant. To facilitate the exposition the approach is first developed for a perturbed double integrator, driven by a twisting-wise controller, which is fed by a supertwisting-wise observer. Both the controller and observer, chosen for their robustness properties, are properly scaled according to the time space deformation to constitute an innovative prescribed-time stabilizing output feedback design of the double integrator, operating in the presence of uniformly bounded matched disturbances. To test the versatility of the approach it is then extended to the prescribed-time state feedback design of multi-input multi-output systems representable in the normal form. Theoretical results are additionally supported by simulations.},

Such formulation provides a unified method to express a large variety of relevant constraint types in the state and the inputs. We present a simple and effective inner approximation of the aforementioned set of trajectories obtained by simple algebraic manipulations of the original constraints formulation.

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms aim to learn optimal decisions in unknown environments through the experience of taking actions and observing the rewards gained. In some cases, the environment is not influenced by the actions of the RL agent, in which case the problem can be modeled as a contextual multi-armed bandit, and lightweight myopic algorithms can be employed. On the other hand, when the RL agent’s actions affect the environment, the problem must be modeled as a Markov decision process, and more complex RL algorithms are required, which take the future effects of actions into account. Moreover, in practice, it is often unknown from the outset whether or not the agent’s actions will impact the environment, and it is therefore not possible to determine which RL algorithm is most fitting. In this work, we propose to avoid this difficult decision entirely and incorporate a choice mechanism into our RL framework. Rather than assuming a specific problem structure, we use a probabilistic structure estimation procedure based on a likelihood-ratio (LR) test to make a more informed selection of the learning algorithm. We derive a sufficient condition under which myopic policies are optimal, present an LR test for this condition, and derive a bound on the regret of our framework. We provide examples of real-world scenarios where our framework is needed and provide extensive simulations to validate our approach.},

Algorithms for maximum likelihood state filtering, prediction and smoothing are derived. The convergence properties of these algorithms, which are inherited from the Expectation Maximization algorithm and the particle filter, are examined in two examples. For nonlinear state–space systems with linear measurements and additive Gaussian noises, it is shown that the filtering and prediction algorithms reduce to gradient-free optimization in a form of a fixed-point iteration.

In this paper, we investigate the synthesis problem for observability of LCNs based on state feedback with exogenous input by using the semitensor product proposed by Daizhan Cheng and the notion of observability graph (previously called weighted pair graph) proposed by us. We prove that if an unobservable LCN can be made observable by state feedback with exogenous input, then it can also be made observable by state feedback (without exogenous input, equivalent to state feedback with constant input). Furthermore, we give an upper bound on the number of state-feedback controllers that are needed to be tested in order to verify whether an unobservable LCN can be made observable by state feedback, and based on the procedure of obtaining the upper bound, we design an observability synthesis algorithm, by additionally combining the ideas of a greedy algorithm and dynamic programming. These results open the study of observability synthesis in LCNs.},

We first extend the formulation of networked supervisory control in the literature by allowing both the upper bound of observation delay and the upper bound of control delay to vary among different event strings, and accommodating dynamic observation in which the past influences whether or not an occurrence of an event is observable. We then combine observation delay and control delay and prove that satisfying both controllability and delay observability over the combined delay is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a supervisor by which the desired language can be obtained deterministically. After that, we reduce the type of problems concerning the networked supervisory control to the corresponding type of problems concerning traditional supervisory control without any delay on observation or control. As an immediate application, the verifier of observability can be used to test the corresponding delay observability. Finally, this reduction is used to leverage methods for minimizing sensor activations for supervisory control without control delay to minimize sensor activations with control delay.},

Since each individual channel may induce a different delay, a sequential approach is employed for the construction of two predictors such that the corresponding input delays can be compensated. Concretely, the predictor over the prediction horizon which corresponds to the smaller input delay is first constructed, and the predictor over the remaining time horizon that corresponds to the larger input delay is in turn constructed, by utilizing the first predictor signal as a basis. The feedback controllers are given based on the predictors. Due to the inherent constraint on the rates of the state-dependent input delays, regional stability results are achieved. Specifically, if the system is forward-complete, for the closed-loop nonlinear system, an estimation of the region of attraction is provided, and for the linear system, the exponential stability is guaranteed. The methodology is applied to the bilateral boundary control problem of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with a moving boundary, for illustration of the effectiveness of the methodology.},

  abstract     = {Stability and safety are two important aspects in safety-critical control of dynamical systems. It has been a well established fact in control theory that stability properties can be characterized by Lyapunov functions. Reachability properties can also be naturally captured by Lyapunov functions for finite-time stability. Motivated by safety-critical control applications, such as in autonomous systems and robotics, there has been a recent surge of interests in characterizing safety properties using barrier functions. Lyapunov and barrier functions conditions, however, are sometimes viewed as competing objectives. In this paper, we provide a unified theoretical treatment of Lyapunov and barrier functions in terms of converse theorems for stability properties with safety guarantees and reach-avoid-stay type specifications. We show that if a system (modeled as a dynamical system with measurable perturbations) possesses a stability with safety property, then there exists a smooth Lyapunov function to certify such a property. This Lyapunov function is shown to be defined on the entire set of initial conditions from which solutions satisfy this property. A similar but slightly weaker statement is made for reach-avoid-stay specifications. We show by a simple example that the latter statement cannot be strengthened without additional assumptions. We further extend the results for systems with control inputs and prove existence of converse Lyapunov-barrier functions for reach-and-avoid specifications. One clear limitation of the results of this paper is that the converse Lyapunov-barrier theorems are not constructive, as with classical converse Lyapunov theorems. We believe, however, that the unified necessary and sufficient conditions with a single Lyapunov-barrier function are of theoretical interest and can hopefully shed some light on computational approaches.},

For the convergence results, the proposed algorithm is able to obtain the exact convergence to the optimal value with any positive, non-summable and non-increasing step-sizes. Furthermore, when the step-size is also square-summable, the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to achieve the exact convergence to an optimal solution.

We seek to optimize a trade-off between the energy consumption of communications and the state estimation error covariance when the acknowledgment (ACK) information, sent by the remote estimator to the local sensor, is compromised. The sensor scheduling problem is formulated as an infinite horizon discounted optimal control problem with infinite states. We first analyze the underlying Markov decision process (MDP) and show that the optimal scheduling without ACK attack is of the threshold type. Thus, we can simplify the problem by replacing the original state space with a finite state space. For the simplified MDP, when the ACK is under attack, the problem is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We analyze the induced MDP that uses a belief vector as its state for the POMDP. We investigate the properties of the exact optimal solution via contractive models and show that the threshold type of solution for the POMDP cannot be readily obtained. A suboptimal solution is then obtained via a rollout approach, which is a prominent class of reinforcement learning (RL) methods based on approximation in value space. We present two variants of rollout and provide performance bounds of those variants. Finally, numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed rollout methods by comparing them with a finite history window approach that is widely used in RL for POMDP.},

  abstract     = {In practical multiple train systems, the desired relative positions of adjacent trains are usually not fixed values but some certain zones which are called “self-adjusting zones” in this paper. However, most of the existing related works were concerned about the case of fixed values and few works focused on the more practical case when the desired relative positions are some certain zones. The aim of this paper is to investigate cooperative control for multiple train systems under moving block system by taking into account self-adjusting zones, collision avoidance and constraints simultaneously, where each train needs not to coordinate with other trains in its desired self-adjusting zones and can be self-adjusted freely. A distributed cooperative control algorithm is proposed to enable all trains to track the desired velocity and operate steadily in their self-adjusting zones by only utilizing the local information of neighbor trains, where a switching mechanism is introduced to ensure the trains to avoid collision. The analysis is performed mainly based on the properties of stochastic matrices and multiple model transformations. It is shown that the braking process can be equivalent to a special coordination process, and the braking process, the coordination process and the self-adjusting process can be unified as an integrated whole to be analyzed by using the properties of stochastic matrices. By addressing the state interactions of the train equivalent system under different scenarios, it is proved that all relative positions of adjacent trains converge into desired self-adjusting zones without the occurrence of collision, while all trains finally move in a desired velocity. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {Many multivariate statistical analysis methods and their corresponding probabilistic counterparts have been adopted to develop process monitoring models in recent decades. However, the insightful connections between them have rarely been studied. In this study, a generalized probabilistic monitoring model (GPMM) is developed with both random and sequential data. Since GPMM can be reduced to various probabilistic linear models under specific restrictions, it is adopted to analyze the connections between different monitoring methods. Using expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, the parameters of GPMM are estimated for both random and sequential cases. Based on the obtained model parameters, statistics are designed for monitoring different aspects of the process system. Besides, the distributions of these statistics are rigorously derived and proved, so that the control limits can be calculated accordingly. After that, contribution analysis methods are presented for identifying faulty variables once the process anomalies are detected. Finally, the equivalence between monitoring models based on classical multivariate methods and their corresponding probabilistic graphic models is further investigated. The conclusions of this study are verified using a numerical example and the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed monitoring statistics are subject to their corresponding distributions, and they are equivalent to statistics in classical deterministic models under specific restrictions.},

  abstract     = {To combat the severity of neurological conditions (NCs), limit the complications, and reduce the cost of treatment, researchers have turned to hybrid exoskeletons such as functional electrical stimulation (FES) cycling. In this work, closed-loop FES/motor controllers are developed that compensate for time-varying, nonlinear, and uncertain dynamics, unknown disturbances, switching between actuators (e.g., between muscle groups and the motor), fatigue, and the unknown time-varying muscle delay between stimulation application and the production of muscle force, called the electromechanical delay (EMD). Control authority is maintained and efficient muscle contractions are produced through the development of FES/motor switching conditions that are both EMD and state dependent. Contributions are that the controllers implement a modular time-varying estimate of the EMD and yield exponential cadence tracking as verified by a Lyapunov-like stability analysis. An example EMD estimate is presented that varies with cycling time to account for fatigue. Furthermore, experiments were conducted to validate the developed control system, which produced an average cadence error of -0.01 ± 1.35 revolutions per minute (RPM) across five able-bodied participants and -0.05 ± 1.38 RPM across four participants with NCs.},

We investigate boundary Dirichlet/Neumann/Robin couplings, as well as in-domain Dirichlet/Neumann couplings. The adopted approach relies on the spectral reduction of the problem by projecting the trajectory of the PDE into a Hilbert basis composed of the eigenvectors of the underlying Sturm–Liouville operator and yields a set of sufficient stability conditions taking the form of LMIs.

The physical controls are modeled as Dirac pulses and lead to a sampled-data control system, sampling corresponding to times of the stimulation, where the output is the muscular force response. Such a dynamics is suitable to compute optimized controls aiming to produce a constant force or force strengthening, but is complex for real time applications. The objective of this article is to construct a finite dimensional approximation of this response to provide fast optimizing schemes for the design of a smart electrostimulator for muscular reinforcement or rehabilitation. It is an on-going industrial project based on force-fatigue models, validated by experiments. Moreover it opens the road to application of optimal control to track a reference trajectory in the joint angular variable to produce movement in the non-isometric models.},

The challenge of simultaneously dealing with topological obstructions to global attitude tracking and with disturbances affecting the attitude dynamics is tackled by means of a hybrid hierarchical design that exploits the cascade structure of the underlying mathematical model. The proposed hierarchical strategy is based on an inner–outer loop paradigm comprising a dynamic control law for angular velocity tracking (inner loop) and a hybrid control law for attitude tracking (outer loop). By leveraging recent tools for the stability analysis of hybrid systems, we prove a robust global tracking property by assuming mild properties on the dynamics of the velocity feedback. We also discuss a few relevant examples satisfying these properties, encompassing harmonic disturbance compensators and conditional integrators, capable of rejecting unknown constant disturbances with an intrinsic anti-windup action.},

On the other hand, the estimation performance with a standard χ 2 detector typically is also difficult to analyze. As such, a stochastic detection mechanism with a varying triggering threshold is proposed. We provide an analytical performance evaluation for the estimation with the proposed detector, and propose a potential countermeasure to actively defend the deception attacks with the proposed detector. The interactive decision-making process between the system with the countermeasure and the attacker is then studied under a game-theoretic framework. In addition, we also extend the stochastic false data detection problem into a multi-sensor setting with a sequential data fusion process and more general attacking patterns, and analyze the estimation performance.

  abstract     = {In this paper, an attitude synchronization problem with velocity-free measurements is investigated for multiple rigid body systems under event-triggered mechanism. To avoid the angular velocities in the control design, an auxiliary system is constructed for the indirect asymptotic estimation of angular velocities, which provides the necessary damping for the closed-loop system. The event-triggered attitude protocol is proposed with a clock-based triggering strategy, and the continuous communication and monitoring requirements among rigid bodies are removed. The convergence of synchronization is analyzed based on a positively invariant set contained in SO ( 3 ) , which inherently avoids the singularity problem or non-uniqueness issue for the attitude representation. Furthermore, based on an invariant-like principle, we extend the topology graph to a switching topology under an average dwell-time condition. A numerical simulation is conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

In this paper, based on a new concept of mixed sets defined as function images of symbol type domains, a compositional approach combining eager and lazy evaluations is proposed. Syntax and semantics are explicitly distinguished. Both continuous (interval) and discrete (signed, boolean) symbol types are used to model dependencies through linear and polynomial functions, so leading to mixed zonotopic and polynotopic sets. Polynotopes extend sparse polynomial zonotopes with typed symbols. Polynotopes can both propagate a mixed encoding of intervals and describe the behavior of logic gates. A functional completeness result is given, as well as an inclusion method for elementary nonlinear and switching functions. A Polynotopic Kalman Filter (PKF) is then proposed as a hybrid nonlinear extension of Zonotopic Kalman Filters (ZKF). Bridges with a stochastic uncertainty paradigm are briefly outlined. Finally, several discrete, continuous and hybrid numerical examples including comparisons illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an efficient suboptimal model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for nonlinear switched systems subject to minimum dwell time constraints (MTC). While MTC are required for most physical systems due to stability, power and mechanical restrictions, MPC optimization problems with MTC are challenging to solve. To efficiently solve such problems, the on-line MPC optimization problem is decomposed into a sequence of simpler problems, which include two nonlinear programs (NLP) and a rounding step, as typically done in mixed-integer optimal control (MIOC). Unlike the classical approach that embeds MTC in a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) with combinatorial constraints in the rounding step, our proposal is to embed the MTC in one of the NLPs using move blocking. Such a formulation can speedup on-line computations by employing recent move blocking algorithms for NLP problems and by using a simple sum-up-rounding (SUR) method for the rounding step. An explicit upper bound of the integer approximation error for the rounding step is given. In addition, a combined shrinking and receding horizon strategy is developed to satisfy closed-loop MTC. Recursive feasibility is proven using a l -step control invariant ( l -CI) set, where l is the minimum dwell time step length. An algorithm to compute l -CI sets for switched linear systems off-line is also presented. Numerical studies show significant speed-up and comparable control performance of the proposed MPC algorithm against the classical approach, though at the cost of significant solution quality degradation especially when the MTC are large.},

Classical diagonal and diagonal/correlated methods are used to design a kernel matrix under the assumption that the parameter series decays exponentially. This assumption has the following limitations: (1) if the system has an unknown time-delay/order, some irregular parameter sub-vectors are equal to zero vectors; (2) if the parameters have random structures, the parameter series does not decay exponentially. To address these limitations, an adaptive regularised kernel-based method is developed in this study. The basic idea is to set the values of diagonal elements of the kernel matrix based on the inner products between the output set and information vectors. Ultimately, the objective is to guarantee that a larger parameter corresponds to a smaller diagonal element. The proposed method can identify large-scale systems with high estimation accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Compared to a centralized approach, a two-level hierarchical controller, with one controller in the upper-level and one controller per subsystem in the lower-level, can significantly reduce the computational cost associated with MPC. Hierarchical coordination is achieved using adjustable tubes, which are optimized by the upper-level controller and bound permissible lower-level controller deviations from the system trajectories determined by the upper-level controller. The size of these adjustable tubes determines the degree of uncertainty between subsystems and directly affects the required constraint tightening under a tube-based robust MPC framework. Sets are represented as zonotopes to enable the ability to optimize the size of these adjustable tubes and perform the necessary constraint tightening online as part of the MPC optimization problems. State and input constraint satisfaction is proven for the two-level hierarchical controller with an arbitrary number of controllers at the lower-level and a numerical example demonstrates the key features and performance of the approach.},

In this paper, we develop tools to analyze stability properties of discrete-time switched linear systems driven by shuffled switching signals. We introduce the new notion of shuffled joint spectral radius (SJSR), which intuitively measures how much the state of the system contracts each time the signal shuffles (i.e. each time all modes have been activated). We show how this notion relates to stability properties of the associated switched systems. In particular, we show that some switched systems that are unstable for arbitrary switching signals can be stabilized by using switching signals that shuffle sufficiently fast and that the SJSR allows us to derive an expression of the minimal shuffling rate required to stabilize the system. We then present several approaches to compute lower and upper bounds of the SJSR using tools such as the classical joint spectral radius, Lyapunov functions and finite state automata. Several tightness results of the bounds are established. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the main results of the paper.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the zonotopic state estimation is investigated for discrete-time switched positive systems under asynchronism. Taking into account the particularity of the positive system, new radius definition called positive generator matrix based radius (PGR) is proposed to characterize the size of state zonotope and derive linear programming conditions. First, using the merging signal technique, the estimation error system is modeled as a switched positive system with augmented switching signal. Then, we propose an iterative estimation procedure to construct the state bounding zonotope. To be more realistic, the mode-dependent weighted PGR of the resulting zonotope is allowed to increase within asynchronous intervals, and the PGR is proven to be bounded with an L ∞ disturbance attenuation performance by establishing a suitable radius function. Furthermore, the asynchronous positive observer is designed for the considered system, based on which the interval estimation is determined for the switched positive system. Finally, a simulation example is provided to verify the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

For these systems, the already known set of attainable equilibrium points has higher dimensionality than in the full-rank case due to the existence of what we define as singular equilibrium points. Our main goal is to design a state-dependent switching function to ensure global asymptotic stability of a chosen point inside this set with conditions expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities. For this class of systems, global exponential stability is generally impossible to be guaranteed. Hence, the proposed switching function is shown to ensure global asymptotic and local exponential stability of the desired equilibrium point. The position control and the velocity control with integral action of a dc motor driven by a h-bridge fed via a boost converter are used for validation. This practical application example is composed of eight subsystems, and all possible convex combinations of the dynamic matrices are singular.},

Positive systems are systems for which the state and the output are always non-negative for any non-negative initial state and input. They are used to model phenomena in which the variables must take non-negative values due to the nature of the underlying physical system. Restricting the state–space realization to positive systems makes the problem extremely different and much more difficult than that for ordinary systems. Indeed, a minimal positive realization may have a dimension even much greater than the order of the transfer function it realizes. Although the problem of finding a finite-dimensional positive state–space realization of a given transfer function has been solved, the characterization of minimality for positive systems is still an open problem. This survey introduces the reader to different aspects of the problem and presents the mathematical approaches used to tackle it as well as some relevant related problems. Moreover, some partial results are presented. Finally, a comprehensive bibliography on positive systems, organized by topics, is provided.},

A digital regulator is first developed via the conventional emulation-based approach, rendering the regulation errors asymptotically bounded with a small sampling period. We then develop a hybrid design framework by incorporating a generalized hold device, which transforms the original problem into the problem of designing an output feedback controller fulfilling two conditions for a discrete-time system, given any (large) non-pathological sampling period. In our hybrid design framework, we show that such a controller can always be obtained by designing a discrete-time internal model, a discrete-time washout filter, and a discrete-time output feedback stabilizer. As a result, the regulation errors are shown to be globally exponentially convergent to zero. This design framework is further developed for a multi-rate digital regulator with a large sampling period of the measurements and a small control execution period.},

However, it is unknown which combination of angle measurements is necessary to make a sensor network localizable, and it is also unidentified if there is a distributed localization algorithm whose required communication only consists of the sensor nodes’ measured angles and estimated positions. Motivated by these two challenging problems, this paper develops triangular angle rigidity for those networks consisting of a set of nodes and triangular angle constraints in 2D. First, we transfer the geometric constraint of each triangle into an angle-induced linear constraint. Based on the linear constraint, we show that different from angle rigidity, triangular angle rigidity implies global triangular angle rigidity. More importantly, inspired by Laman’s theorem, we propose a topological, necessary and sufficient condition to check generic triangular angle rigidity. Based on the results on triangular angle rigidity, both algebraic and topological localizability conditions are developed, which are necessary and sufficient when the number of anchor nodes in the network is two. Both continuous and discrete localization algorithms are proposed, in which only measured angles and estimated positions are communicated among the sensor nodes. Finally, a simulation example with 32 sensor nodes is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.},

This will restrict the solution of the MDP to stabilizing policies by construction. Because the stability theory for MPC is most mature for the undiscounted MPC case, we will first show in this paper that stable discounted MDPs can be reformulated as undiscounted ones.

A principal is tasked to optimize the network’s performance by controlling the information available to each agent with regard to other agents’ latest actions. The information control by the principal is done via a compartmental observability approach, which comprises a static partitioning of agents into blocks and making the mean of agents’ latest actions within each block publicly available. While the problem setup is very general in terms of the payoff functions and the network’s performance metric, the paper has a narrower, yet still fairly general, focus to display essential characteristics of the problem and to show how it can be addressed in practice. In particular, the performance metric is assumed to be a function of the steady-state behavior of the agents.

In this paper, we develop a general framework for modeling the control of flying qubits based on the quantum stochastic differential equation (QSDE) that describes the input-output process actuated by a standing quantum system. Under the continuous time-ordered photon-number basis, the infinite-dimensional QSDE is reduced to a low-dimensional deterministic differential equation for the non-unitary state evolution of the standing quantum system, and the outgoing flying-qubit states can be expressed in the form of randomly occurring quantum jumps. This makes it possible, as demonstrated by examples of flying-qubit generation and transformation, to analyze general cases when the number of excitations is not reserved. The proposed framework lays the foundation for the design of flying-qubit control systems, with which advanced control techniques can be incorporated for practical applications.},

This paper proposes two differentially private distributed algorithms seeking the Nash equilibrium in stochastic aggregative games. By adding time-varying random noises, the input and output-perturbation methods are given to protect each player’s sensitive information. For the case of output-perturbation, utilizing mini-batch methods, the algorithm’s mean square error is inversely proportional to the privacy level ε and the number of samples. For the case of input-perturbation, a differentially private distributed stochastic approximation-type algorithm is developed to achieve almost sure convergence and ( ε , δ ) -differential privacy. Under suitable consensus time conditions, the algorithm’s convergence rate is rigorously presented for the first time, where the optimal convergence rate O ( 1 / k ) in a mean square sense is obtained. Then, utilizing mini-batch methods, the influence of added privacy noise on the algorithm’s performance is reduced, and the convergence rate of the algorithm is improved. Specifically, when the batch sizes and the number of consensus times at each iteration grow at a suitable rate, an exponential rate of convergence can be achieved with the same privacy level. Finally, a simulation example demonstrates the algorithms’ effectiveness.},

This is done by extending previous set-based state estimation methods to include parameter identification in a unified framework. Unlike in interval-based methods, the existing dependencies between states and model parameters are maintained from one time step to the next, thus providing a more accurate estimation scheme. In addition, the enclosure of states and parameters is refined using measurements through generalized intersections, which are properly captured by constrained zonotopes. The advantages of the new approach are highlighted in two numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a self-triggered adaptive model predictive control (MPC) method is proposed for constrained discrete-time nonlinear systems subject to parametric uncertainties and additive disturbances. Firstly, a real-time zonotope-based set-membership parameter estimator is developed to refine a set-valued description of the time-varying parametric uncertainty based on the available measurements. By approximating the reachable sets for the states between two successive triggering time instants, the proposed estimator can be used for dynamic systems sampled in an aperiodic manner, including the self-triggered scheduling. We leverage this estimation scheme to design a novel self-triggered adaptive MPC (ST-AMPC) approach for uncertain nonlinear systems. Compared with the existing self-triggered robust MPC methods, the proposed ST-AMPC method can further reduce the average sampling frequency while preserving comparable closed-loop performance. We theoretically show that, under some reasonable assumptions, the proposed ST-AMPC algorithm is recursively feasible, and the closed-loop system is input-to-state practical stable (ISpS) at triggering time instants. Numerical experiments and comparisons are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.},

In order to eliminate the nonlinearities caused by the nonconvex input and velocity constraints, we first introduce two time-varying scaling factors to transform the original constrained system into an unconstrained time-varying linear one. By proposing an inductive method based on the lower bounds of the scaling factors, we decouple the relevance of the two kinds of constraints and transform the obtained time-varying system into a new equivalent system. It is shown that all agents converge into the convex hull of the leaders even when switching graphs, nonconvex control input constraints and nonconvex velocity constraints coexist, as long as there exists at least one directed path from one of the leaders to each agent in the union of the communication graphs.

  abstract     = {Most extremum-seeking control (ESC) approaches focus solely on the problem of finding the extremum of some unknown, steady-state input–output map, providing parameter settings that lead to optimal steady-state system performance. However, many industrial applications also have to deal with constraints on operating conditions due to, e.g., actuator limitations, limitations on tunable system parameters, or constraints on measurable variables. In particular, constraints on measurable variables are typically unknown in terms of their relationship with the tunable system parameters. In addition, the constraints on system inputs as a result of the constraints on measurable variables may conflict with the otherwise optimal operational condition, and hence should be taken into account in the data-based optimization approach. In this work, we propose a sampled-data extremum-seeking framework for the constrained optimization of a class of nonlinear dynamical systems with measurable constrained variables. In this framework, barrier function methods are employed, exploiting both the objective function and constraint functions which are available through output measurement only. We show, under the assumption that the parametric initialization yield operating conditions that do not violate the constraints, that (1) the resulting closed-loop dynamics is stable, (2) constraint satisfaction of the inputs is guaranteed for all iterations of the optimization process, and (3) constrained optimization is achieved. We illustrate the working principle of the proposed framework by means of an industrial case study of the constrained optimization of extreme ultraviolet light generation in a laser-produced plasma source within a state-of-the-art lithography system.},

However, the approximate linear measurement equation obtained by statistical linearization technique may be not accurate enough since it only uses prior information. In this paper, a robust stable iterative maximum correntropy criterion UKF (RS-IMCC-UKF) is proposed by using nonlinear measurement function directly and numerical stability methods. Different from the existing UKF algorithms, we only need to perform one-time unscented transformation in each filtering cycle, reducing the execution time of algorithm. Then a nonlinear enhancement model is constructed to handle predictions and observations simultaneously, which will be included in the cost function of robust MCC. In the process of iterative solution, thanks to the latest iteration values which are used to update the measurement information, RS-IMCC-UKF has more accurate results compared with traditional filters. In order to avoid non-positive definite characteristic in covariance matrix and the inverse operation in ill-conditioned matrix, the hyperbolic QR decomposition and Moore–Penrose pseudo-inversion are introduced to improve the numerical stability of the algorithm. Finally, a target tracking is modeled to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

However, this requirement is not always met in many practical cases where the system is not completely known or may differ from the assumed model. For such a system, we consider a scenario where the measurements are transmitted to a remote location using a common communication network and due to which, a delay is introduced while receiving the measurements. The delay that we consider here is random and one step maximum at a given time instant. For such a scenario, this paper develops a robust estimator for a linear Gaussian system by minimizing the risk sensitive error criterion that is defined as an expectation of the accumulated exponential quadratic error. The criteria for the stability of the risk sensitive Kalman filter (RSKF) are derived and the results are used to study the stability of the developed filter. Further, it is assumed that the latency probability related to delay is not known and it is estimated by maximizing the likelihood function. Simulation results suggest that the proposed filter shows acceptable performance under the nominal conditions, and it performs better than the Kalman filter for randomly delayed measurements and the RSKF in presence of both the model uncertainty and random delays.},

However, due to the limited communication resources in physical systems, the number of fusion steps cannot be infinite. To deal with this issue, the present paper analyzes the performance of CMDF with finite consensus fusion operations. First, by introducing a modified discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation and several novel techniques, the convergence of the estimation error covariance matrix of each sensor is guaranteed under a collective observability condition. In particular, the steady-state covariance matrix can be simplified as the solution to a discrete-time Lyapunov equation. Moreover, the performance degradation induced by reduced fusion frequency is obtained in closed form, which establishes an analytical relation between the performance of the CMDF with finite fusion steps and that of centralized filtering. Meanwhile, it provides a trade-off between the filtering performance and the communication cost. Furthermore, it is shown that the steady-state estimation error covariance matrix exponentially converges to the centralized optimal steady-state covariance matrix with fusion operations tending to infinity during each sampling interval. Finally, the theoretical results are verified with illustrative numerical experiments.},

The unknown LPV model matrices are estimated along with the state sequence by minimizing a properly constructed dual-objective criterion. A coordinate-descent algorithm is employed to optimize the desired objective, which alternates between computing the unknown LPV matrices and estimating the state sequence. Thanks to the linear parametric structure induced by the LPV model, the optimization variables within each coordinate-descent step can be updated analytically via ordinary least squares. Furthermore, in order to handle large-size datasets, we discuss how to perform optimization based on short-size subsequences. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated via an academic example and two case studies. The first case study consists of identifying an LPV model describing the behaviour of an electronic bandpass filter from benchmark experimental data. The second case study involves identification of the plasma safety factor from a tokamak plasma simulator.},

The factor of multi-links is first introduced into highly non-linear systems, which makes our model more in line with the practical situations. However, when considering highly non-linear systems, the existing results are not suitable for AIC. Therefore, in order to solve this difficulty, a new Halanay-type differential inequality is established in this paper, which not only extends the classic Halanay inequality, but also expands the application scopes of AIC. In addition, utilizing the Lyapunov method and the graph theory, it can be proved that under suitable conditions, SHNMSs exponentially reach stabilization. Furthermore, the theoretical results are applied to modified stochastic multi-links coupled Fitzhugh–Nagumo models.

We consider leader–follower networks, where only some of the agents are governed by external control inputs, namely the leaders. We develop a graph-theoretic characterization for strong targeted controllability of multi-agent systems with time-varying topologies over finite fields. Specifically, we show that a time-varying multi-agent system is strongly targeted controllable over any finite field if the graphs of the system satisfy certain properties. Our main results are applicable to time-varying topologies with arbitrary fields and coupling weights. We also present a necessary and sufficient condition for the strong structural controllability of the time-invariant multi-agent systems.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with distributed consensus optimization problems in which a connected network of agents aims at minimizing the sum of local cost functions over a common variable. In particular, we focus on the ADMM-based algorithm proposed by Shi et al. in Shi et al. (2014) that, under the assumption that local cost functions are strongly convex with Lipschitz continuous gradients, was shown to converge linearly to the optimal solution. In Shi et al. (2014), an upper bound to the convergence rate, depending on the network topology and on few properties of the local cost functions, has been derived and used to propose an optimal design of the penalty parameter of the algorithm. In this paper, assuming also twice differentiability of the costs function around the optimal solution, we refine the result of Shi et al. (2014) deriving a novel upper bound which is based on the additional knowledge of the curvatures of the cost functions around the optimal solution. We conjecture this bound to be tight in most cases and, to corroborate its effectiveness we perform a numerical analysis over important families of graphs showing that: (i) the bound we introduce improves significantly the bound derived in Shi et al. (2014) and, as a consequence, (ii) the design of the penalty parameter proposed in Shi et al. (2014) might lead to poor performance.},

That is to say, the communication channels between the controller and the actuators and between the sensors and the controller are unreliable. This is of growing importance as networked control systems and use of wireless communication in control are becoming increasingly common. The problem of how to optimize LQG control in this case is examined in the situation where communication between the components is done with acknowledgments. Previous solutions to finite horizon discrete time hold-input LQG control for this case do not fully utilize the available information. Here a new solution is presented which resolves this limitation. The solution is linear and covers communication channels subject to both packet losses and delays. The new control scheme is compared with previous solutions for LQG control in simulations, which demonstrates that a significant improvement in the cost can be achieved by fully utilizing the available information.},

DDUs refer to the uncertainties that are affected by the strategies of decision-makers and have been rarely addressed in game equilibrium analysis. In this paper, we first formulate the N–S–N games with DDUs of complete ignorance, where the interactions between the players and DDUs are characterized by uncertainty sets that depend parametrically on the players’ strategies. Then, a rigorous definition for the equilibrium of the game is established by consolidating generalized Nash equilibrium and Pareto-Nash equilibrium. Afterward, we prove the existence of the equilibrium of N–S–N games under DDUs by applying Kakutani’s fixed-point theorem. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to show the impact of DDUs on the equilibrium of N–S–N games.},

To alleviate the difficulty of the linear periodically time-varying (LPTV) nature of sampled-data systems, we first take an operator-based approach to sampled-data systems via the lifting treatment. We next develop a framework for piecewise constant approximation in the context of the generalized H 2 controller synthesis problem after further applying the so-called fast-lifting treatment. An optimal controller for the approximate treatment is also shown to achieve the generalized H 2 performance for the sampled-data system that is close enough to its optimal generalized H 2 performance, if the fast-lifting parameter N is large enough. This is established by deriving, in a fashion suitable for controller synthesis, upper and lower bounds on the resulting sampled-data generalized H 2 performance, where their gap tends to 0 at the rate of 1 / N . We further introduce a discretization method of the continuous-time plant, with which the controller synthesis in the approximate fashion can actually be carried out through an equivalent discrete-time counterpart of the generalized H 2 controller synthesis problem. Finally, numerical examples are given to validate the overall arguments.},

More precisely, the aim is to propose the MATLAB-based UKF algorithms for accurate and robust state estimation of stochastic dynamic systems. The accuracy of the continuous–discrete nonlinear filters heavily depends on how the implementation method manages the discretization error arisen at the filter prediction step. We suggest the elegant and accurate implementation framework for tracking the hidden states by utilizing the MATLAB built-in numerical integration schemes developed for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The accuracy is boosted by the discretization error control involved in all MATLAB ODE solvers. This keeps the discretization error below the tolerance value provided by users, automatically. Meanwhile, the robustness of the UKF filtering methods is examined in terms of the stability to roundoff. In contrast to the pseudo-square-root UKF implementations established in engineering literature, which are based on the one-rank Cholesky updates, we derive the stable square-root methods by utilizing the J -orthogonal transformations for calculating the Cholesky square-root factors.},

By verifying the similarity degree of measurement data of a sensor type, the attack location information can be extracted to exclude some mismatching search candidates, without loss of estimation correctness. This confirms high speed performance of the proposed algorithm, since the number of sensor types is usually far less than the number of sensors.},

  abstract     = {In practical multi-sensor fusion estimation, both the expensive communication burden of long-distance connection sensor networks and cross-correlated noises are usually inevitable, and need to be taken into account. To adequately address these difficulties, a global fusion estimation problem is studied for clustered sensor networks with cross-correlated measurement noises. To begin, we derive direct and indirect sequential measurement fusion (SMF) schemes as fusion rules, relying on whether a weighted least square method is used directly for the arriving measurements. We discover that the direct SMF has lower computational complexity than the indirect SMF, but the estimation accuracy of the latter is higher when the number of sensors exceeds three. Then, a globally indirect sequential measurement fusion estimation (GISMF) algorithm is proposed by using the indirect SMF, which is more computationally efficient and suitable for asynchronous fusion than that of batch fusion estimation. Accuracy relations among the GISMF, the batch state fusion estimation, and the centralized Kalman fuser (CKF) are proved. Moreover, the equality of the estimation accuracy between the GISMF and the CKF is also performed if all the measurement noises are mutually independent or if the measurement noises are only cross-correlated within the same cluster. Finally, several simulation results are implemented to show the effectiveness of the presented algorithm.},

We first consider the single agent scenario and characterize several properties of the optimal policy for the agent based on a quantity that we term the “reward-to-risk” ratio of the tasks. We provide the optimal policy when the risk of destruction is sufficiently high, and then extend our analysis to multiple (heterogeneous) agents, with potentially different costs and survival probabilities. In particular, when the risk of destruction is sufficiently high, we show that the multi-agent task allocation problem has a submodular structure, and accordingly provide a greedy algorithm that is guaranteed to return an allocation that is within a 1 2 factor of optimal.},

Compared with traditional intermediate estimators, the dependence of linear matrix inequality technique is completely removed, besides, the intrinsic heavy overshooting problem in transient period is effectively alleviated.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the stabilization properties of Continuous/Discrete switched systems using the dwell time approaches. The considered system switches between a continuous-time subsystem evolving on time intervals with variable lengths and a discrete-time subsystem with variable discrete step sizes. Since the time domain is non-uniform, and the stability of the discrete-time subsystem with variable discrete step sizes does not depend only on the dynamic of the system, but also on the length of the discrete steps, the usual conditions of dwell time approaches may not be applicable to stabilize this special class of switched systems. Motivated by that, stabilizing dwell time and average dwell time conditions are derived by introducing the time scales theory and numerical examples are proposed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with a general filtering scheme of a continuous-time dynamic system in which the state is not completely observable. The observation process consists of a function of the state with additive noise. Typically, such noise is assumed to be non-degenerate. In this case, various filtering schemes can be developed. For example, in a linear case, the Kalman–Bucy (KB) filter applies and leads to a recursive filtering equation for the conditional expectation of the state given the observation up to time t . Nevertheless, in applications, only some state variables are directly observable and the rest are not. This gives rise to filtering with degenerate observation noise. In this case, traditional filtering schemes fail. This paper develops a viable scheme to address possible degenerate observation noise. In this paper, we propose a recursive filtering equation in which the gain matrix is a matrix-valued parameter to be determined. We adopt the Monte Carlo training procedure used for deep filtering to determine the best gain matrix. In particular, given the state and observation equations, we generate their Monte Carlo samples. Given a gain matrix, we generate the corresponding state estimation samples, which leads to the error function of the state and its estimation. The problem is to choose the gain matrix to minimize the error function. We develop a stochastic approximation method for such a minimization task; we term the procedure the SA filter, where SA stands for stochastic approximation. We focus on computational experiments and demonstrate the performance of the SA filter and its robustness. We also compare the SA filter with the (extended) Kalman–Bucy filter and the deep filter in both linear and nonlinear models.},

Further, it is proved that the proposed adaptive VB MHE filter ensures mean-square boundedness of the estimation error with any number of importance samples and VB iterations, as well as for any window length.

To address this challenge, in this paper, a new switching law and a resilient adaptive event-triggering strategy (RA-ETS) are proposed for networked switched systems to mitigate the negative impacts of asynchronous switching and denial of service (DoS) attacks By utilizing the new switching law, asynchronous switching is converted to expected and unexpected synchronous switchings. According to the minimum DoS sleeping time, the constraints on average dwell time and minimum dwell time are obtained for this switching law, and the sufficient conditions for the existence of expected synchronization are derived. Moreover, RA-ETS is designed to prevent the useless data during attacking from being triggered and to adjust the triggering frequency adaptively if no attacks. Subsequently, the stability of switched systems with an H ∞ performance index is ensured by virtue of the average dwell time method and piecewise Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional technique. In particular, the coupling relationship among the DoS attacking, expected and unexpected synchronous intervals is revealed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by a numerical simulation.},

The disconnected network topology is considered, where the connectivity or initial connectivity of the network is not assumed. To achieve the global consensus of all the agents, a switching control protocol is proposed by adding the controls for the type II uninformed agents from their closest informed agent. The subsystem-based analysis approach is given based on the change of the topology by constructing the multiple Lyapunov functions, where the Lyapunov function can be divided into two parts with and without leader information. It is proven that the total energy is non-monotonic but bounded all the time, and the system can converge in a fixed time eventually. The upper bound of the convergence time can be estimated with the convergence of each part of the Lyapunov function, which only depends on the control protocol and the topology of network. Finally, numerical examples are used to verify the theoretical results, and show that the proposed method provides an applicable method for the control of the disconnected topology problems.},

  abstract     = {An approach is proposed for inferring Granger causality between jointly stationary, Gaussian signals from quantized data. First, a necessary and sufficient rank criterion for the equality of two conditional Gaussian distributions is proved. Assuming a partial finite-order Markov property, a characterization of Granger causality in terms of the rank of a matrix involving the covariances is presented. We call this the causality matrix. The smallest singular value of the causality matrix gives a lower bound on the distance between the two conditional Gaussian distributions appearing in the definition of Granger causality and yields a new measure of causality. Then, conditions are derived under which Granger causality between jointly Gaussian processes can be reliably inferred from the second order moments of quantized measurements. A necessary and sufficient condition is proposed for Granger causality inference under binary quantization. Furthermore, sufficient conditions are introduced to infer Granger causality between jointly Gaussian signals through measurements quantized via non-uniform or high resolution quantizers. Apart from the assumed partial Markov order and joint Gaussianity, this approach does not require the parameters of a system model to be identified. No assumptions are made on the identifiability of the jointly Gaussian random processes through the quantized observations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by simulation results.},

  abstract     = {In classical approaches of dynamic network identification, in order to identify a system (module) embedded in a dynamic network, one has to formulate a Multi-input-Single-output (MISO) identification problem that requires identification of a parametric model for all the modules constituting the MISO setup including (possibly) the noise model, and determine their model order. This requirement leads to model order selection steps for modules that are of no interest to the experimenter which increases the computational complexity for large-sized networks. Also, identification using a parametric noise model (like BJ method) can suffer from local minima, however neglecting the noise model has its impact on the variance of the estimates. In this paper, we provide a two-step identification approach to avoid these issues such that the complexity of the problem is independent of the complexity of the network. The first step involves performing a non-parametric indirect approach for a MISO identification problem to get the non-parametric frequency response function (FRF) estimates and its variance as a function of frequency. In the second step, the estimated non-parametric FRF of the target module is smoothed using a parametric frequency domain estimator with the estimated variance from the previous step as the non-parametric noise model. The developed approach is practical with weak assumptions on noise, uses the available toolbox, requires a parametric model only for the target module of interest, and uses a non-parametric noise model to reduce the variance of the estimates. Numerical simulations illustrate the potentials of the introduced method in comparison with the classical identification methods.},

This motivates us to consider the influence of resource failures on NEs. Some proper conditions on resource failure probability (RFP) are obtained for keeping the NE unchanged in the CGPRF. Then the control problem of the evolutionary CGPRF under a myopic best response adjustment rule is investigated with the help of the algebraic state space approach. A necessary and sufficient condition for ensuring the global convergence of the target NE is obtained by adopting partial players as the controllers.

We develop a so-called relaxed small-gain theorem for ISS with respect to a closed set and show the necessity of the proposed small-gain condition in case of exponentially ISS infinite networks. Moreover, we study the well-posedness of the interconnection based on the behavior of the individual subsystems. Finally, over-approximations of large-but-finite networks by infinite networks are studied and it is shown that all the stability and performance indices obtained for the infinite system can be transferred to the original finite one if each subsystem of the infinite network is individually ISS.},

By first imposing a natural uniform prior probability density on the unknown frequencies, the estimation of the hyperparameters of the a priori distribution can be accomplished by a sequence of subspace identification techniques. These techniques exploit the special structure of the covariance matrix of the a posteriori process which is discovered by making a connection with classical results on energy concentration in deterministic signal processing. The convergence of the spectrum of the subspace estimates to the (nonrational) spectral density of the a posteriori process has an analytic counterpart in the approximation of symmetric positive definite Toeplitz matrices by submatrices of finite rank. This is proven by a weak-sense convergence theorem for Toeplitz spectra.},

However, a theory that can explain the rationale why the linear PID can successfully deal with the ubiquitous uncertain nonlinear dynamical systems and a method that can provide explicit design formulae for the PID parameters are still lacking. This paper is a continuation of the authors recent endeavor towards establishing a theoretical foundation of PID for nonlinear uncertain systems. In contrary to most of the existing literature on linear or affine nonlinear systems, we will consider a class of non-affine nonlinear uncertain systems, and will show that a three dimensional parameter set can be constructed explicitly, such that whenever the PID parameters are chosen from this set, the closed-loop systems will be globally stable and the regulation error will converge to zero exponentially fast, under some suitable conditions on the system uncertainties. Moreover, we will also consider the simpler PI and PD control, and provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the choice of the PI parameters for a class of one dimensional non-affine uncertain systems, by applying the Markus–Yamabe theorem in differential equations. These theoretical results show explicitly that the ubiquitous PID control does indeed have strong robustness with respect to both the system nonlinear uncertainties and the selection of the controller parameters.},

If the objective function is strongly convex, PIPG improves the convergence rate of the primal–dual gap to O ( 1 / k 2 ) . Further, unlike any existing first-order methods, PIPG also improves the convergence rate of the constraint violation to O ( 1 / k 3 ) .

Using an integral sliding mode strategy we incorporate effective disturbances rejection on the decision variables as experienced in a wide range of industrial applications. It is shown that the algorithm can easily be modified to a finite-time solution when evaluations of the optimization variables are required to be bounded.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates requirements on a networked dynamic system (NDS) such that its subsystem interactions can be solely determined from experiment data or reconstructed from its overall model. The NDS is constituted from several subsystems whose dynamics are described through a descriptor form. Except regularity on each subsystem and the whole NDS, and the well-posedness of the whole NDS, no other restrictions are put on either subsystem dynamics or subsystem interactions. A matrix rank based necessary and sufficient condition is derived for the global identifiability of subsystem interactions, which leads to several conclusions about NDS structure identifiability when there is some a priori information. This matrix also gives an explicit description for the set of subsystem interactions that cannot be differentiated from experiment data only. In addition, a necessary and sufficient condition is obtained for the reconstructibility of subsystem interactions from an NDS descriptor form model. This condition can be verified with each subsystem separately and is therefore attractive in the analysis and synthesis of a large-scale NDS. Simulation results show that rather than increases monotonically with the distance of subsystem interactions to the undifferentiable set, the magnitude of the external output differences between two NDSs with distinct subsystem interactions increases much more rapidly when one of them is close to be unstable. In addition, directions of probing signals are also very important in differentiating external outputs of distinct NDSs. These findings are expected to be helpful in identification experiment designs, etc.},

Based on the Lyapunov criterion, a necessary and sufficient condition is supplied for regional stabilizability. Furthermore, Popov–Belevitch–Hautus (PBH) criterion is obtained for observability of mean-field stochastic periodic systems. By the proposed spectral criterion of stability/observability, the intrinsic relationships are clarified for stability/observability among deterministic periodic systems, stochastic periodic systems and mean-field stochastic periodic systems.

This problem has various machine learning applications. As a solution, we propose two distributed ZO algorithms, in which at each iteration each agent samples the local stochastic ZO oracle at two points with a time-varying smoothing parameter. We show that the proposed algorithms achieve the linear speedup convergence rate O ( p / ( n T ) ) for smooth cost functions under the state-dependent variance assumptions which are more general than the commonly used bounded variance and Lipschitz assumptions, and O ( p / ( n T ) ) convergence rate when the global cost function additionally satisfies the Polyak–Łojasiewicz (P–Ł) condition, where p and T are the dimension of the decision variable and the total number of iterations, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first linear speedup result for distributed ZO algorithms. It consequently enables systematic processing performance improvements by adding more agents. We also show that the proposed algorithms converge linearly under the relatively bounded second moment assumptions and the P–Ł condition. We demonstrate through numerical experiments the efficiency of our algorithms on generating adversarial examples from deep neural networks in comparison with baseline and recently proposed centralized and distributed ZO algorithms.},

The well-known replay, zero dynamics and covert attacks are special forms of the kernel attacks. Existence conditions for the kernel attacks are presented. It is demonstrated, in the unified framework of control and detection, that all kernel attacks can be structurally detected when not only the observer-based residual, but also the control signal based residual signals are used for the detection purpose. Two schemes for detecting kernel attacks are then proposed, which allow reliable attack detection without loss of control performance. While the first scheme is similar to the well-established moving target method and auxiliary system aided detection scheme, the second one is realised with encrypted transmissions of control and monitoring signals in the feedback control system, which prevents adversary to gain system knowledge by means of eavesdropping attacks. Both schemes are illustrated by an experimental study on a three-tank control system.},

This paper presents a shapelet temporal logic, which is an expressive formal language to describe the temporal properties of shapelets. Moreover, an incremental algorithm is proposed to find the optimal logic expression with formal and theoretical guarantees, and the obtained logic expression can be used for fault diagnosis. Additionally, a case study on rolling element bearing fault diagnosis shows the proposed method can diagnose and interpret faults with high accuracy. Comparison experiments with other logic-based and shapelet-based methods illustrate the proposed method has better interpretability at the cost of computation efficiency.},

However, the classical methods usually design fault diagnosis and control modules, separately, which ignore the existing interactions between the two key modules in active fault-tolerant control systems. In order to deal with this problem, this paper establishes a framework for integrated design of active fault diagnosis (AFD) and control while ensuring the performance of tracking control. In particular, the input is designed to balance the goal of AFD with the reference output tracking performance. The design of inputs is formulated to minimize the sum of a quadratic function and a non-convex quadratic fractional function at each step, whose global optimality can be obtained under the tight condition of convex relaxation. Furthermore, despite the global optimal condition is not achieved, a locally optimal solution could still be obtained by using our proposed local linearization search algorithm, whose suboptimality can be strictly guaranteed theoretically. At the end, a practical four-tank system example is used to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

In this work, an improved sliding mode control strategy against time-varying state-dependent actuator and sensor false data injection (FDI) attacks is proposed to design an adaptive resilient control scheme for Markovian jump CPS (MJCPS). Firstly, considering that the feedback state information is compromised by adversaries, a compromised state variable-dependent switching function is designed. Secondly, based on the compromised state variables, an attack compensator with projection-based adaptation laws are constructed. In this way, the attack related parameters can be adjusted online and the FDI attacks can be compensated adaptively. Then, the stochastically bounded stable of the overall closed-loop MJCPS and the reachability analysis for the constructed sliding surface are derived. Finally, a practical example about an F-404 aircraft engine system is employed to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed technique.},

In this paper, this subset is referred to as associated memory. Each parameter of the model corresponds to an associated memory set, which is updated over time. In the second stage, the a priori estimation is updated using the innovation brought by the new incoming data and the recursive least squares algorithm. A nonlinear in the parameters moving average, a multi-parameter model, and a model with multi-dependent parameters are analyzed under this perspective. Two examples are shown to validate this proposal and alternative methods from the literature are used for performance comparison.},

The optimal output feedback controller is designed using an optimal mean-square state feedback gain and two observer gains, which are determined by the mean-square stabilizing solution to a modified algebraic Riccati equation (MARE), provided that the plant is minimum-phase and left-invertible. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the stabilizing solution to the MARE is explicitly presented. It shows that the separation principle holds in a certain sense for the optimal control design of the work.

In this paper we present an improved method in terms of the reduced-order LMIs (that significantly reduce the computation time) and introduce predictors to manage with larger delays. We treat the case of a 1D heat equation under Neumann actuation and non-local measurement, that has not been studied yet. We apply modal decomposition and prove L 2 exponential stability by a direct Lyapunov method. We provide reduced-order LMI conditions for finding the observer dimension N and resulting decay rate. The LMI dimension does not grow with N . The LMI is always feasible for large N , and feasibility for N implies feasibility for N + 1 . For the first time we manage with delayed implementation of the controller in the presence of fast-varying (without any constraints on the delay-derivative) input and output delays. To manage with larger delays, we construct classical observer-based predictors. For the known input delay, the LMIs’ dimension does not grow with N , whereas for unknown one the LMIs dimension grows, but it is essentially smaller than in the existing results. A numerical example demonstrates the efficiency of our method.},

In this paper a distributed control scheme is proposed, which simultaneously considers these two control objectives via a trade-off factor. This factor permits to adjust the degree of compromise between accurate voltage regulation and current sharing. At the same time, the voltage of a critical node can be precisely regulated. A sufficient condition for closed-loop stability is given and it is shown that the control parameters can always be chosen, such that stability is guaranteed. In addition, the steady state voltage and current deviations relative to their rated values are quantified via suitable metrics. For a given topology and settings of a DC microgrid, a sufficient condition for the existence of the trade-off factor is provided. The results are illustrated by simulation examples.},

Specifically, we review and complement the concept of controlled invariance for nonlinear systems, based on which a new concept called strongly controlled invariance is proposed as a tool to characterize the controlled mode discernibility. Besides the general characterization of controlled mode discernibility, we discuss some commonly considered special nonlinearities, and demonstrate that the discerning control design problem can be formulated as a quadratic game for some cases.},

Unlike the deterministic case, stochastic stability analysis of this model needs to handle the Hessian matrix of the line integral function. Since the Hessian matrix is dependent on the partial derivatives of membership-based functions, representing and estimating it are complicated and challenging and no relevant result has been reported so far. The novel representation of the Hessian matrix is skillfully provided which includes a part of the partial derivatives of membership-based functions. By giving an assumption on the partial derivatives of normalized membership functions, together with the property of matrix with rank one, an upper bound of the symmetric sum of partial derivative dependent part of the Hessian matrix is achieved. Thus a more general result of stochastic stability for the underlying model can be established by the line integral function. In terms of the obtained condition and a decoupling technique, a convergent cone complementarity linearization-like algorithm is provided for the controller design. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

First, as the basis of leader selection, sufficient conditions including average dwell time bounds for each possible topology and a mild network connectivity assumption are derived for followers to reach the expected property. Second, by applying the derived consensus criterion, metrics for identifying leaders are established via the submodular optimization method, and the supermodularity of the metrics is proved in the digraph case. Third, by utilizing the established metrics, a leader selection scheme with two polynomial-time algorithms is presented to determine leaders dynamically, and the optimality of the returned solution has a provable guarantee.

  abstract     = {Tunability is a major obstacle in the creation and subsequent application of the explicit model predictive control (MPC). The main bottleneck lies in the need to reconstruct the parametric solution each time weighting factors changes. Such an operation makes the implementation of the explicit MPC impractical. This manuscript addresses the problem of producing a suboptimal parametric solution to the optimal control problem, where the change of the weighting factor does not warrant the reconstruction of the explicit MPC. The solution is achieved by interpolating between two boundary explicit solutions for a range of values in weighing factors. Furthermore, we show that the suboptimal solution enforces the closed-loop stability and recursive feasibility. The stability and recursive feasibility are maintained by carefully choosing the terminal penalty and terminal set in those boundary explicit solutions.},

In this paper, we introduce the phase response of a class of discrete-time (DT) LTI multivariable systems by exploiting a definition of matrix phases based on the numerical range. Positive frequency joint sectorial systems are also defined, which can generalize the positive real and negative imaginary systems. The interpretation of system phases is given in terms of the input and output signals of the system. A sectored real lemma is obtained to characterize the phase information from a state–space realization. Motivated by finding a phasic counterpart to the small gain theorem, we develop a small phase theorem for the internal stability of a closed-loop system. The phase properties are also investigated for parallel and feedback interconnected systems.},

  abstract     = {We address the problem of sparsity-promoting optimal control of cyber–physical systems (CPSs) in the presence of communication delays. The delays are categorized into two types — namely, an inter-layer delay for passing state and control information between the physical layer and the cyber layer, and an intra-layer delay that operates between the computing agents, referred to here as control nodes (CNs), within the cyber-layer. Our objective is to minimize the closed-loop H 2 -norm of the physical system by co-designing an optimal combination of these two delays and a sparse state-feedback controller while respecting a given bandwidth cost constraint. We propose a two-loop optimization algorithm for this. Based on the alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM), the inner loop handles the conflicting directions between the decreasing H 2 -norm and the increasing sparsity level of the controller. The outer loop comprises a semidefinite program (SDP)-based relaxation of non-convex inequalities necessary for closed-loop stability. Moreover, for CPSs where the state and control information assigned to the CNs are not private, we derive an additional algorithm that further sparsifies the communication topology by modifying the row and column structures of the obtained controller, resulting in a reassignment of the communication map between the cyber and physical layers, and determining which physical agent should send its state information to which CN. Proofs for closed-loop stability and optimality are provided for both algorithms, followed by numerical simulations.},

The class of considered ODE contains the effect of a proportional term, that can be considered as the proportional action of a controller or a spring in case of mechanical systems. In this particular case of study, it is not possible to directly add damping on the boundary of the PDE. To remedy this problem we propose a control law that makes use of a “strong feedback” term. We first prove that the closed-loop operator generates a contraction strongly continuous semigroup, then we address the asymptotic stability making use of a Lyapunov argument, taking advantage of the pH structure of the original system to be controlled. Furthermore, we apply the proposed control law for the stabilization of a vibrating string with a tip mass and we show the simulation results compared with the application of a simple PD controller.},

We formulate a desired n -D continuum deformation as a leader–follower problem guided by n + 1 leaders and followed by the remaining follower agents either through direct communication with leaders or communication with neighboring agents. To plan a safe continuum deformation coordination, we first provide sufficient conditions for inter-agent and obstacle collision avoidance. Then, we spatially optimize the continuum deformation coordination using the A* search to determine leaders’ desired waypoints in an obstacle-laden environment. Leaders’ desired waypoints are connected through C 1 continuous paths that are assigned by the spline curve fitting method. The desired trajectories of the leaders are then determined by planning a piece-wise constant reference input such that travel time is minimized and safety of the continuum deformation coordination is ensured.},

Aiming at approximating the nonlinearities with high accuracy and broadening practical application, the fuzzy Markov jump affine systems associated with mode-dependent operating regions are developed. A novel nonhomogeneous Markov process is proposed to describe the generalized stochastic jumping among subsystems, whose time-varying transition probabilities are orchestrated by a higher-level deterministic switching signal. Compared with the conventional Markov process with arbitrary switchings, the average dwell-time strategy is adopted in the novel nonhomogeneous Markov process to improve the dynamic performance. A dynamic event-triggered protocol is provided to alleviate the network transmission burden by elongating the interval between any two consecutive events. Based on the variation of state-space partitions, nonsynchronous reduced-order generalized filters are considered. Under this framework, sufficient criteria are attained to ensure stochastic stability and prescribed l 2 − l ∞ performance for the filtering error systems. Eventually, the theoretical findings are verified by two simulation examples.},

Dividing the indeterminate entries into two categories, generic entries and unspecified entries, a system is PSSC, if for almost all values of the generic entries in the parameter space except for a set of measure zero, and any nonzero (complex) values of the unspecified entries, the corresponding system is controllable. We highlight that this notion generalizes the generic property embedded in the conventional structural controllability for single-input systems. We then give algebraic and (bipartite) graph-theoretic necessary and sufficient conditions for single-input systems to be PSSC, the latter of which can be verified in polynomial time. Conditions for multi-input systems are subsequently given for a special case. It is shown the established results can induce a new maximum matching based criterion for SSC over the system bipartite graph representations.},

First, we study the problem of fixed-time convergence in the presence of input constraints. The relation between the domain of attraction for fixed-time stability with respect to input constraints and the required time of convergence is established. It is shown that increasing the control authority or the required time of convergence can expand the domain of attraction for fixed-time stability Then, we consider the problem of finding a control input that confines the closed-loop system trajectories in a safe set and steers them to a goal set within a fixed time. To this end, we present a Quadratic Programming (QP) formulation to compute the corresponding control input. We use slack variables to guarantee the feasibility of the proposed QP under input constraints. Furthermore, when strict complementary slackness holds, we show that the solution of the QP is a continuous function of the system states and establish the uniqueness of closed-loop solutions to guarantee forward invariance using Nagumo’s theorem. To corroborate our proposed methods, we present two case studies, an example of an adaptive cruise control problem and a two-robot motion planning problem.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an elevation angle rigidity theory in both 2D and 3D spaces, and applies it to solve multi-agent formation control with only inter-agent bearing/direction measurements in agents’ local coordinate frames. Motivated by the sensor technology in measuring elevation angle and angular diameter, we develop elevation angle rigidity by attaching each agent in a multi-agent framework with a rod in 2D and a ball in 3D, respectively. By defining the elevation angle rigidity matrix, conditions for infinitesimal elevation angle rigidity are derived. Compared to previously developed angle rigidity-based and bearing rigidity-based formation control laws, the proposed elevation angle rigidity-based control law can maintain the gradient-based control property. Compared to distance-based formation control laws, less sensor measurements are required. The formation maneuvering with desired translation and rotation is also realized by using only local bearing measurements. Simulation examples illustrate the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Light-Emitting Diode (LED) optical wireless communication is a potentially low-cost, sustainable approach for enabling high-speed free-space and underwater transmissions within a limited communication range. Establishing a tightly controlled line of sight (LOS) between transmitter and receiver is a significant challenge because the angle of the alignment is not directly measured and has to be estimated. To address this problem, we propose a novel switched-gain discrete-time nonlinear observer for an LED-based optical communication model in which the nonlinear output functions are composed of nonlinear vector functions of multi-scalar combinations of the states. Lyapunov function-based analysis that ensures global stability is used to design the proposed observer in each piecewise monotonic region of the LED output functions. Furthermore, we prove via a quadratic Lyapunov-based approach that a constant stabilizing observer gain design approach has no feasible solution when the entire LED optical communication range is considered. Therefore, a suitable switched-gain nonlinear observer is derived for non-monotonic output measurement equations. Simulation results are shown together with extensive comparisons with the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to illustrate the performance of the proposed switched-gain observer design.},

Furthermore, when the underlying network switches amongst an infinite number of networks, the matrix-weighted integral network is employed to provide sufficient conditions for cluster consensus; analogous to the previous case, the quantitative characterization of the corresponding steady-state of the nodes pertains to the null space analysis of matrix-valued Laplacian of the “integral” network.

Firstly, we establish the relation between the motion-integration errors and the flow field, which is given in the form of a set of nonlinear equations. An iterative algorithm is then proposed to estimate the unknown flow field by solving an inverse problem for these nonlinear equations. Moreover, it is rigorously proven that under this algorithm, the estimation result converges to the real flow field.

A stepwise method is presented to derive novel distributed adaptive optimization algorithms that steer the outputs of all the agents to the optimal solution of the total objective function. First, a novel distributed adaptive optimization algorithm is developed for first-order nonlinear uncertain multi-agent systems, supported by stability analysis and convergence proofs using Lyapunov arguments. Second, by means of Lyapunov arguments in the spirit of backstepping, a distributed adaptive optimization algorithm is presented for high-order strict-feedback systems with parametric uncertainty. Interesting extensions of the main result to practically important classes of systems with unknown virtual control coefficients, output feedback, and relative-measurement feedback are also discussed.},

The communication between the process and controller is also subject to bit rate constraints. For mitigating the influences of DoS attacks and bit rate constraints, we develop a variable bit rate (VBR) encoding–decoding protocol and quantized controller to stabilize the control system. We show that the system’s resilience against DoS under VBR is preserved comparing with those under constant bit rate (CBR) quantized control, with fewer bits transmitted. The proposed VBR quantized control framework in this paper is general enough so that the results of CBR quantized control under DoS and moreover the results of minimum bit rate in the absence of DoS can be recovered. In the last part of the paper, we propose two random VBR transmission protocols, in which not only the bit rate but also the interval between two transmission attempts are time-varying. These protocols enable us to prevent attackers from learning how transmissions are scheduled and to mitigate the influence of attacks specifically targeting at periodic transmission instants. A numerical example is given to illustrate the proposed solution approach.},

A new admissible adjacent region switching paths (AARSPs) algorithm is proposed for the first time in the continuous-time domain to decrease the conservatism of the complete adjacent region switching paths (CARSPs) algorithm. This new algorithm optimizes the path selection conditions of the next instantaneous time region switching in the CARSPs algorithm, and effectively reduces the computational complexity and the conservatism of the CARSPs algorithm. Furthermore, a state-feedback piecewise-linear controller is designed by means of the ellipsoidal outer approximation estimation method, such that the corresponding closed-loop system is stochastically stable and has a guaranteed H ∞ performance index.

When running the proposed algorithm, each agent makes decisions only using its own bifunction information and the local state information received from its immediate neighbors.

While methods for estimating network topology are available in the literature, less attention has been paid to estimating the disturbance topology, i.e., the (spatial) noise correlation structure and the noise rank in a filtered white noise representation of the disturbance signal. In this work we present an identification method for dynamic networks, in which an estimation of the disturbance topology precedes the identification of the full dynamic network with known network topology. To this end we extend the multi-step Sequential Linear Regression and Weighted Null Space Fitting methods to deal with reduced rank noise, and use these methods to estimate the disturbance topology and the network dynamics in the full measurement situation. As a result, we provide a multi-step least squares algorithm with parallel computation capabilities and that rely only on explicit analytical solutions, thereby avoiding the usual non-convex optimizations involved. Consequently we consistently estimate dynamic networks of Box Jenkins model structure, while keeping the computational burden low. We provide a consistency proof that includes path-based data informativity conditions for allocation of excitation signals in the experimental design. Numerical simulations performed on a dynamic network with reduced rank noise clearly illustrate the potential of this method.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an on-line parametric estimation method for robot manipulators. The identification algorithm estimates the parameters by using the input error between the robot and a parallel estimated model. Both, the robot and the estimated model are controlled by two Proportional–Derivative (PD) controller tuned with the same gain values, and a persistent excitation (PE) signal for ensuring parameters convergence is included. The exact model matching and the estimation error cases are analysed. Noisy state measurements and filters are avoided in the model parameterization by using only the states of the estimated model. A second parameter identification algorithm, which is based on a composite update law, is also proposed. It improves parameters convergence and robustness of the update rule in presence of estimation errors. The stability of the closed-loop dynamics related to the estimated model is assessed via Lyapunov stability theory. Simulations are carried out to validate the proposed approaches.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel approach to solve linear and nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) problems that requires small memory footprint and throughput and is particularly suitable when the model and/or controller parameters change at runtime. The contributions of the paper include: ( i ) a formulation of the nonlinear MPC problem as a bounded-variable nonlinear least-squares (BVNLS) problem, demonstrating that the use of an appropriate solver can outperform industry-standard solvers; ( i i ) an easily-implementable library-free BVNLS solver with a novel proof of global convergence; ( i i i ) a matrix-free method for computing the products of vectors and Jacobians, required by BVNLS; ( i v ) an efficient method for updating sparse QR factors when using active-set methods to solve sparse BVNLS problems. Thanks to explicitly parameterizing the optimization algorithm in terms of the model and MPC tuning parameters, the resulting approach is inherently and immediately adaptive to any changes in the MPC formulation. The same algorithmic framework can cope with linear, nonlinear, and adaptive MPC variants based on a broad class of prediction models and sum-of-squares cost functions.},

A novel dynamic triggering mechanism is proposed to cancel out the influence of asynchronous parameters induced by the event-based sampling. This new mechanism allows to derive constructive conditions to simultaneously design the gain-scheduled control law and the dynamic triggering mechanism to ensure the origin of the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable. As a sub-product, a co-design condition is readily derived to design static triggering mechanisms. Moreover, a convex optimization problem is proposed to enlarge the inter-event sampling and an estimate of the region of attraction of the closed-loop system is obtained.

The sign rigidity theory can be viewed as an extended version of the standard distance rigidity theory with the addition of signed area constraints. This property enables elimination of possible formation specification ambiguities arising when a formation specification includes distance constraints only. As an application of the sign rigidity theory, this paper explores formation specification control in 2-D space. Under the proposed gradient-based formation control law, almost global convergence (from arbitrary initial positions) can be achieved when a target formation consists of triangulated sub-formations defined by distance- and signed area-constraints; the formation control law is applied for either single-integrator models or unicycle models.},

The benefits include (i) individual cost function need not be convex as long as the global cost function is strongly convex and (ii) the convergence rate of the distributed algorithm is arbitrarily close to the convergence rate of the centralized one. Two particular continuous-time algorithms are presented using the proportional–integral-type couplings. One has benefit of ‘initialization-free’, so that agents can join or leave the network during the operation. The other one has the minimal amount of communication information.

By providing a desired formation that is BPE, distributed control laws for multi-agent systems under both single- and double-integrator dynamics are proposed using bearing measurements (along with velocity measurements when the agents are described by double-integrator dynamics), which guarantee uniform exponential stabilization of the desired formation up to a translation. A key contribution of this work is to show that the classical bearing rigidity condition on the graph topology, required for achieving the stabilization of a formation up to a translation and a scale factor, is relaxed and extended in a natural manner by exploring PE conditions imposed either on a specific set of desired bearing vectors or on the whole desired formation.

The capacity constraints restrict the mass of players that are allowed to simultaneously play each strategy of the game, while the migration constraints introduce a networked interaction structure among the players and rule the strategic switches that players can make. In this brief, we consider both decoupled capacity constraints regarding individual strategies, as well as coupled capacity constraints regarding disjoint groups of strategies. As main technical contributions, we prove that the proposed decision-making protocol guarantees the forward time invariance of the feasible set, and we provide sufficient conditions on the connectivity level of the migration graph to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the set of generalized Nash equilibria of the underlying game when the game is a full-potential population game with concave potential function. Furthermore, we also provide an alternative discrete-time analysis of the proposed evolutionary game dynamics, which allows us to formulate a population-game-inspired distributed optimization algorithm that guarantees the hard satisfaction of the constraints over all iterations. Finally, the theoretical results are validated numerically on a constrained networked congestion game.},

As it involves differentiating virtual control signals recursively, the involved signals must be differentiable. However, when the measured states are only transmitted based on event-triggered conditions, such requirement will not be met, making the recursive backstepping design procedure inapplicable. Thus it is still an open problem to study how an event-triggered scheme is employed to transmit state signals in decentralized control of uncertain interconnected systems with dynamic interactions. In this paper, we present a solution by constructing a new decentralized adaptive backstepping-based control algorithm capable of coping with discontinuity caused by state-triggering. With aid of appropriately chosen Lyapunov functions, all signals in the closed-loop system are ensured globally uniformly bounded.

In addition, the average long-run undiscounted closed loop cost is shown to be finite if the discount factor takes appropriate values.

Based on a recent high-gain like observer design method, called HG/LMI observer, a larger bound of the time-delay is allowed compared to that obtained by using the standard high-gain methodology. Such a HG/LMI observer adopts a lower value of the tuning parameter, which results in the reduction of the value of the observer gain, and an increase in the maximum bound of the delay required to ensure exponential convergence. Indeed, an explicit relation between the maximum bound of the delay and the observer tuning parameter is derived by using a Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional jointly with the Halanay inequality. Such a relation shows clearly the superiority of HG/LMI observer design methodology. An application to nonlinear systems with sampled measurements is provided. Furthermore, the proposed methodology is extended to systems with nonlinear outputs. This extension provides more general synthesis conditions and encompasses the linear case as a particular situation. Finally, two numerical examples are proposed to illustrate the performance of the proposed observer design procedure, and comparison to standard approaches is also provided.},

However, for networked MAS, there exist no theoretical results on guaranteed stability margins, due to the complexity caused by the interplay of communication structure and agents’ dynamics. In this paper, we analyze the effect of communication graph topology on the robustness properties of networked cooperative tracking systems with local LQR designs. For such systems, we provide closed-form expressions of phase and gain margins modulated by their graph topology, following a Lyapunov type of analysis. We further derive upper bounds of stability margins for MAS with general graph topology, through a structural analysis based on the algebraic graph theory. We prove that the directed tree communication topology is among the most robust graph topology that promises the best stability margins, which are as good as the ones in a single-agent LQR system},

We propose a nearest-neighbor based static feedback mapping from the output space to the finite set of control actions, that is able to practically stabilize the closed-loop systems. Consequently, we show that for such systems with m -dimensional input space, it is sufficient to have m + 1 discrete input points (other than zero for general passive systems or the target constant input for constant-incrementally passive systems).

In the absence of noise, we show that the detectors’ performance is no better for sensors on a partitioned set than those on the cutset. Instead, in the presence of noise, we show that the detectors’ performance can be better for sensors on a partitioned set than those on the cutset for certain choices of edge weights.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce a nonlinear time-varying coupling law, which can be designed in a fully decentralized manner and achieves approximate synchronization with arbitrary precision, under only mild assumptions on the individual vector fields and the underlying (undirected) graph structure. The proposed coupling law is motivated by the so-called funnel control method studied in adaptive control under the observation that arbitrary precision synchronization can be achieved for heterogeneous multi-agent systems by a high-gain coupling; consequently we call our novel synchronization method ‘(node-wise) funnel coupling.’ By adjusting the conventional proof technique in the funnel control study, we are even able to obtain asymptotic synchronization with the same funnel coupling law. Moreover, the emergent collective behavior that arises for a heterogeneous multi-agent system when enforcing arbitrary precision synchronization by the proposed funnel coupling law, is analyzed in this paper. In particular, we introduce a single scalar dynamics called ‘emergent dynamics’ which describes the emergent synchronized behavior of the multi-agent system under funnel coupling. Characterization of the emergent dynamics is important because, for instance, one can design the emergent dynamics first such that the solution trajectory behaves as desired, and then, provide a design guideline to each agent so that the constructed vector fields yield the desired emergent dynamics. We illustrate this idea via the example of a distributed median solver based on funnel coupling.},

Its optimal strategy minimises Kullback–Leibler divergence (KLD) of the joint, strategy-dependent, pd of behaviours to its ideal twin. A range of FPD results confirmed its theoretical and practical strength. Curiously, no guide exists how to select a specific ideal pd for an estimator design. The paper offers it. It advocates the use of the closed-loop state notion and generalises dynamic programming so that FPD is its special case.

  abstract     = {This paper deals with continuous-time system identification of multiple-input single-output (MISO) fractional differentiation models. When differentiation orders are assumed to be known, coefficients are estimated using the simplified refined instrumental variable method for continuous-time fractional models extended to the MISO case. For unknown differentiation orders, a two-stage optimization algorithm is proposed with the developed instrumental variable for coefficient estimation and a gradient-based algorithm for differentiation order estimation. A new definition of structured-commensurability (or S-commensurability) is introduced to better cope with differentiation order estimation. Three variants of the algorithm are then proposed: (i) first, all differentiation orders are set as integer multiples of a global S-commensurate order, (ii) then, the differentiation orders are set as integer multiples of a local S-commensurate orders (one S-commensurate order for each subsystem), (iii) finally, all differentiation orders are estimated by releasing the S-commensurability constraint. The first variant has the smallest number of parameters and is used as a good initial hit for the second variant which in turn is used as a good initial hit for the third variant. Such a progressive increase of the number of parameters allows better performance of the optimization algorithm evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation analysis.},

  abstract     = {The discrete-time two-dimensional (2-D) switched system is a powerful tool to model many practical physical processes with abrupt changes. However, the stability analysis problem for 2-D switched systems struggles to provide a unified framework for stable or unstable modes. Users have to delicately tune lots of parameters to shape the Lyapunov function for each mode. Besides, the resulting stability conditions are non-convex and thus the feasibility highly depends on the tuning parameters. In this paper, we propose a unified stability framework for 2-D switched systems, formulated by the well-known Fornasini–Marchesini local state-space model and the Roesser model. The concepts called unit switching sequence (USS) and sequence generator are presented. A novel Lyapunov function is also accordingly established which views the switching sequence as a concatenation of USSs, different from the perspective that regards the switching sequence as a combination of subsystems in previous literatures. Upon this framework, a convex stability criterion is developed, and the conservativeness can be lowered by a lifting technique at the expense of a higher off-line computational complexity. The derived theories are further extended for a standard l 2 -gain which is achieved under restricted switching signals for the first time. Numerical examples are provided for validity verification, conservativeness comparison, and l 2 -gain computation.},

An equivalent increment of the system at a time prior to the attack occurrence time is introduced, which is theoretically proved to be effective to detect stealthy integrity attacks. A backward-in-time estimator is developed via the fixed-point smoother design tool to exploit this equivalent increment and allow the detection of the attack. More specifically, an asymptotically stable incremental system is introduced to characterize stealthy integrity attacks, and its backward-in-time solution at a fixed time prior to the attack occurrence formulates the equivalent increment. When running reversely in time, the divergence property of such an asymptotically stable incremental system enables the equivalent increment to detect stealthy integrity attacks. A fixed-point smoother is introduced to estimate the unknown equivalent increment for a class of Lipschitz nonlinear physical plants, such that the estimation error satisfies the H ∞ performance objective. Based on the equivalent increment and its estimation provided by the smoother, suitable residual and threshold signals are generated, allowing the detection of the considered stealthy integrity attacks. A detectability analysis is conducted to rigorously characterize the class of detectable attacks. Finally, a case study is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed backward-in-time attack detection methodology.},

Each agent has stochastic linear dynamics with quadratic costs, and the agents are coupled in their dynamics and costs by the average state of minor agents (i.e. the empirical mean field). It is shown that for a class of Hybrid LQG MFGs, the optimal switching and stopping times are state-invariant and only depend on the dynamical parameters of each agent. Accordingly, a hybrid systems formulation of the game is presented via the indexing by discrete events: (i) the switching of the major agent between alternative dynamics or (ii) the termination of the agents’ trajectories in one or both of the subpopulations of minor agents. Optimal switchings and stopping time strategies together with best response control actions for, respectively, the major agent and all minor agents are established with respect to their individual cost criteria by an application of Hybrid LQG MFG theory.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a general framework for state estimation of systems modeled as hybrid dynamical systems with jumps occurring at (approximately) known times. A candidate observer is a hybrid dynamical system with jumps triggered when the system jumps. With some information about the time elapsed between successive jumps, a Lyapunov-based analysis allows us to derive sufficient conditions for observer design. In particular, a high-gain flow-based observer, with innovation during flow only, can be designed for systems with an average dwell-time when the flow dynamics are strongly differentially observable. On the other hand, when the jumps are persistent, a jump-based observer, with innovation at jumps only, should be designed based on an equivalent discrete-time system corresponding to the hybrid system discretized at jump times. In the context of linear maps, this reasoning leads us to a hybrid Kalman filter. These designs apply to a large class of hybrid systems, including cases where the time between successive jumps is unbounded or tends to zero – namely, Zeno behavior–, and cases where detectability only holds during flows, at jumps, or neither. We also study the robustness of this approach when the jumps of the observer are delayed with respect to those of the system. Under some regularity and dwell-time conditions, we show that the estimation error is semiglobally practically asymptotically stable over time intervals after such delays. The results are illustrated in examples and applications, including mechanical systems with impacts, spiking neurons, and switched systems.},

This note presents a new classification strategy of polyhedral regions with respect to hyperplanes to build BST for PWA functions. The proposed solution is based on the verification of intersection between regions and hyperplanes, resulting in a decrease by almost half in the number of optimization problems, and consequently, in the total time to build the BST, which is the main time-consuming task.

  abstract     = {Repetitive control enables the exact compensation of periodic disturbances if the internal model is appropriately selected. The aim of this paper is to develop a novel synthesis technique for repetitive control (RC) based on a new more general internal model. By employing a Gaussian process internal model, asymptotic rejection is obtained for a wide range of disturbances through an appropriate selection of a kernel. The implementation is a simple linear time-invariant (LTI) filter that is automatically synthesized through this kernel. The result is a user-friendly design approach based on a limited number of intuitive design variables, such as smoothness and periodicity. The approach naturally extends to reject multi-period and non-periodic disturbances, exiting approaches are recovered as special cases, and a case study shows that it outperforms traditional RC in both convergence speed and steady-state error.},

First, we only consider local aggregated congestion terms that penalize the magnitude of the decision-makers’ strategies allowing us to avoid the formation of congestion. Second, we consider both local and global (population-like) aggregated congestion terms to perform crowd aversion during the evacuation procedure. We present the solution for these proposed problems in a semi-explicit way by solving the corresponding Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) backward Partial Differential Equation (PDE). Afterward, we discuss an evacuation Braess paradox stating that enabling a new path to the exits may lead to a worse evacuation performance. We propose a concrete example where a Braess paradox can emerge and we formally find the required conditions. Finally, we present some numerical examples corresponding to a case study with multiple rooms and either one or two exits. We implement the two aforementioned stochastic differential-game approaches and compare the results.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the problem of control synthesis for a class of discrete-time semi-Markov jump linear systems, in which the sojourn time of each mode is bi-boundary (with upper and lower bounds). The system is subject to modal asynchrony, which means that the switchings of the mode-dependent controller to be designed lag behind the ones of the controlled plant, and the lag is mode-dependent. In contrast with the traditional mode-independent lag commonly assumed in the existing studies, not only is the modal lag more practical and general, but also it yields less conservatism of the controller design. By virtue of the semi-Markov kernel approach, the conditions on the existence of the anticipated stabilizing controllers capable of overcoming the modal asynchrony are derived. Illustrative examples including a class of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) helicopter models are presented to demonstrate the necessity and the validity of the designed anti-modal-asynchrony controllers.},

Often, the set of all such input transformations forms a Lie group, the most prominent examples being scale-invariant ( u ↦ e p u , p ∈ R ) and translational-invariant ( u ↦ u + p ) systems, the latter comprising linear systems with transfer function zeros at the origin. Here, we derive a necessary and sufficient normal form for invariant systems and, by analyzing this normal form, provide a complete characterization of the mechanism by which invariance can be achieved. In this normal form, all invariant systems (i) estimate the applied input transformation by means of an integral feedback, and (ii) then apply the inverse of this estimate to the input before processing it in any other way. We demonstrate our results based on three examples: a scale-invariant “feed-forward loop”, a bistable switch, and a system resembling the core of the mammalian circadian network.},

However, such variable is not accessible to direct measurement and its estimation requires the solution of a difficult inverse problem. In particular, being the result not only of biological but also of social factors, the transmission dynamics can vary significantly in time. This makes questionable the use of parametric models which could be unable to capture their full complexity. In this paper we exploit compartmental models which include important COVID-19 peculiarities (like the presence of asymptomatic individuals) and allow the infection rate to assume any continuous-time profile. We show that these models are universal , i.e. capable to reproduce exactly any epidemic evolution, and extract from them closed-form expressions of the infection rate time-course. Building upon such expressions, we then design a regularized estimator able to reconstruct COVID-19 transmission dynamics in continuous-time. Using real data collected in Italy, our technique proves to be an useful tool to monitor COVID-19 transmission dynamics and to predict and assess the effect of lockdown restrictions.},

For separation control of these states, this paper defines the periodic/aperiodic, quasi-periodic, and quasi-aperiodic states to construct a periodic/aperiodic separation filter that separates the periodic/aperiodic state into the quasi-periodic and quasi-aperiodic states. Based on these definitions, the linearity of periodic-pass and aperiodic-pass functions and the orthogonality of quasi-periodic and quasi-aperiodic state functions are proved. Subsequently, the periodic/aperiodic separation filter composed of periodic-pass and aperiodic-pass filters that realize the periodic-pass and aperiodic-pass functions is designed and integrated with a Kalman filter for estimation of the quasi-periodic and quasi-aperiodic states.},

No prefiltering of the input/output signals is required which distinguishes cISSIM from other existing direct CT identification methods.

  abstract     = {Instead of using the conventional discrete-time or continuous-time protocols with arbitrary values, this paper studies a cooperative–antagonistic multi-agent network with three-option decision mechanism. In particular, each agent over the network periodically makes decisions just from three available options (i.e., “1”, “0” and “ − 1 ”) at decision instants for the promotion of agreement with its cooperative neighbors or disagreement with its antagonistic neighbors. The asynchronous decisions of distinct agents are allowed herein. A digraph with signs is implemented to characterize the information delivery. Next, the consensus behaviors of the concerned cooperative–antagonistic multi-agent network are analyzed. In particular, on the basis of an intermediate modulus consensus result in terms of a strongly connected topology condition, it is first shown that structural balance is a sufficient and necessary condition for the bipartite consensus result. Besides this, a stabilizing result that all the agents reach an agreement at the origin is shown under the structurally unbalanced condition. On the other hand, for a relaxed signed digraph that contains a spanning tree, if only the root subgraph is strongly connected and structurally balanced, it is shown that only the root agents reach the bipartite consensus while the states of the non-root agents converge between the polarized values of the root agents. In addition, if the structural balance condition associated with the root subgraph cannot be guaranteed, the considered cooperative–antagonistic multi-agent network is shown stabilizing. Finally, simulations are carried out to verify the proposed theoretical results.},

To this end we introduce a general model where packet arrival probabilities are determined based on the received Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise Ratio and with two different receivers design schemes, one implementing standard multi-packet reception technique and one implementing Successive Interference Cancellation decoding algorithm in addition. Then we cast the power allocation problem as an optimization task where the mean error covariance at the remote estimator is minimized, while penalizing the mean transmission power consumption. For the infinite-horizon problem we show the existence of a stationary optimal policy, while for the finite-horizon case we derive some structural properties under the special scenario where the overall system to be estimated can be seen as a set of independent subsystems. Numerical simulations illustrate the improvement given by the proposed receivers, especially when SIC is used, over orthogonal schemes that schedule only one sensor transmission at a time in order to avoid interference.},

A similar construction is also developed for the case of plants with restrictions on the poles.

Existing studies mainly focused on ideal systems that always guarantee optimal responses and have not considered several realistic aspects, for instance, the fact that actions can only be performed under sufficient resources. In this paper, we propose a game model with resource constraints and thereby a novel logic named LRC for such games. This logic enables the strategic reasoning of the likely strategies of the other participating entities and thus supports not only the characterization of the equilibrium of games with limited resources, but also strategic exploitation in multi-agent systems in which the available resources are restricted. Interesting properties of this logic are investigated, and a model-checking algorithm is presented. Being built upon the alternating-time temporal logic (ATL), LRC is shown to be more expressive than ATL without bringing additional complexity. In addition to determining the existence or absence of a collaborative strategy, we explore the generation of the team plan when a certain protocol is supposed to be followed.},

Inspired by this, this work is concerned with the model-free design of stochastic LQR controller for linear systems subject to Gaussian noises, from the perspective of primal–dual optimization. We first reformulate the stochastic LQR problem as a constrained non-convex optimization problem, which is shown to have strong duality. Then, to solve this non-convex optimization problem, we propose a model-based primal–dual (MB-PD) algorithm based on the properties of the resulting Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions. We also give a model-free implementation for the MB-PD algorithm by solving a transformed dual feasibility condition. More importantly, we establish the connection between the proposed MB-PD algorithm and classical policy iteration algorithm, which provides a novel primal–dual optimization perspective to understand the common RL algorithms. Finally, we provide a high-dimensional case study to show the performance of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the development of an online data-driven model-based inverse reinforcement learning (MBIRL) technique for linear and nonlinear deterministic systems. Input and output trajectories of an agent under observation, attempting to optimize an unknown reward function, are used to estimate the reward function and the corresponding unknown optimal value function, online and in real-time. To achieve MBIRL using limited data, a novel feedback-driven approach to MBIRL is developed. The feedback policy and the dynamic model of the agent under observation are estimated from the measured data and the estimates are used to generate synthetic data to drive MBIRL. Theoretical guarantees for ultimate boundedness of the estimation errors in general, and convergence of the estimation errors to zero in special cases, are derived using Lyapunov techniques. Proof of concept numerical experiments demonstrates the utility of the developed method to solve linear and nonlinear inverse reinforcement learning problems.},

In particular, we reexamine tools used to analyse the structure of the BAP, and apply them to derive an O ( n 3 ) algorithm that solves the SeqBAP. We show that the set of solutions of the LexBAP is a subset of the solutions of the SeqBAP and analyse the conditions for which the solutions sets are identical. Furthermore, we provide a method to verify the satisfaction of these conditions. In cases where the conditions are satisfied, the proposed algorithm for solving the SeqBAP solves the LexBAP with computation that has lower complexity and can be distributed over a network of computing agents. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated with a case study where mobile robots are assigned to goal locations.},

  abstract     = {Structural balance theory characterizes stable configurations of signed interpersonal appraisal networks. Existing models explaining the convergence of appraisal networks to structural balance either diverge in finite time, or could get stuck in jammed states, or converge to only complete graphs. In this paper, we study the open problem of how non-complete appraisal networks converge to structural balance while their graph topologies remain unchanged. Firstly, we present two established definitions of structural balance: the local balance and the global balance, which are equivalent in complete graphs but not in graphs with arbitrary topologies. The notion of local balance is characterized as “Friends’ friends are not enemies; Friends’ enemies are not friends; Enemies’ friends are not friends; Enemies’ enemies are not enemies.”, which is a straightforward generalization of the famous Heider’s axioms in structural balance theory. On the other hand, the global balance, widely adopted in the modeling of opinion dynamics, means that the appraisal network can be divided into two antagonistic factions. We propose two mechanisms: the symmetry-influence-homophily (SIH) dynamics and the symmetry-influence-opinion-homophily (SIOH) dynamics, in which the appraisal networks almost surely achieve the local balance (for certain initial conditions) and the global balance (for any initial condition) in finite time respectively. Along these dynamics, the connection patterns of the appraisal networks remain unchanged and thereby avoid evolving into complete graphs. Furthermore, we provide certain graph-theoretical conditions on which the local balance is equivalent to the global balance. In addition, numerical studies of our dynamics indicate some insightful take-home messages, e.g., whether multilateral relations reduce or exacerbate conflicts.},

As an information-flow property, the underlying observation model is the key in the modeling and analysis of opacity. In this paper, we investigate the verification of current-state opacity for discrete-event systems under Orwellian-type observations, i.e., the system is allowed to re-interpret the observation of an event based on its future suffix. First, we propose a new Orwellian-type observation model called the dynamic information release mechanism (DIRM). In the DIRM, when to release previous “hold on” events is state-dependent. Then we propose a new definition of opacity based on the notion of history-equivalence rather than the standard projection-equivalence. This definition is more suitable for observations that are not prefix-closed. Finally, we show that by constructing a new structure called the DIRM-observer, current-state opacity can be effectively verified under the DIRM. Computational complexity analysis as well as illustrative examples for the proposed approach is also provided. Compared with the existing Orwellian-type observation model, the proposed framework is more general in the sense that the information-release-mechanism is state-dependent, information is partially released and the corresponding definition of opacity is more suitable for non-prefix-closed observations.},

In this paper, we investigate how to design a fault-tolerant H ∞ controller for an OPO with a disturbance input and time-varying uncertainties, which can achieve the required H ∞ performance of the quantum system. We apply robust H ∞ control theory to a quantum system, and design a passive controller and an active controller based on the solutions to two Riccati equations. The passive controller has a simple structure and is easy to be implemented by using only passive optical components, while the active quantum controller may achieve improved performance. The control performance of the proposed two controllers and one controller that was designed without consideration of system uncertainties is compared by numerical simulations in a specific OPO, and the results show that the designed controllers work effectively for fluctuations in both the phase and amplitude of the pumping field.},

A new theoretical proof of asymptotic convergence of the formation tracking trajectories is derived based on the integral controllability of a networked SNI systems. The proposed scheme is an alternative to the conventional Lyapunov-based formation tracking schemes. It offers robustness to NI/SNI-type model uncertainties and fault-tolerance to a sudden loss of robots due to hardware/communication fault.

Notably, we do not require knowledge of which agents contribute to our measurements. We propose an efficient algorithm to exactly recover the (potentially complex) eigenvalues corresponding to network modes which are observable from the output measurements. The length of the sequence of measurements required by our method to generate a full reconstruction of the observable eigenvalue spectrum is at most three times the number of agents in the network, but in practice fewer are required, dependent on the number of observable network modes. The proposed technique can be applied to networks of non-autonomous multiagent systems with arbitrary dynamics in both continuous- and discrete-time.

The objective is to minimize the expected discounted cost from exerting the impulse control in the infinite horizon. Based on the dynamic programming principle (DPP), the value function of the hybrid optimal impulse control problem is shown to be the unique viscosity solution to the associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation, which is in the form of a coupled system of variational inequalities. Moreover, a verification theorem as the sufficient condition for optimality of a solution is also established. The optimal impulse control, indicates when and how it is optimal to intervene, is described by the obstacle part of the HJB equation. Finally, the general theoretical results are applied to an optimal cash management problem. The value function in closed-form and an explicit optimal policy are obtained, which exhibit clearly the effect of regime switching on the agent’s decision.},

  abstract     = {Formulating cyber-security problems with attackers and defenders as a partially observable stochastic game has become a trend recently. Among them, the one-sided two-player zero-sum partially observable stochastic game (OTZ-POSG) has emerged as a popular model because it allows players to compete for multiple stages based on partial knowledge of the system. All existing work on OTZ-POSG has focused on the simultaneous move scenario and assumed that one player’s actions are private in the execution process. However, this assumption may become questionable since one player’s action may be detected by the opponent through deploying action detection strategies. Hence, in this paper, we propose a turn-based OTZ-POSG with the assumption of public actions and investigate the existence and properties of a Stackelberg equilibrium for this game. We first prove the existence of the Stackelberg equilibrium for the one-stage case and show that the one-stage game can be converted into a linear-fractional programming problem and therefore solved by linear programming. For multiple stages, the main challenge is the information leakage issue as the public run-time action reveals certain private information to the opponent and allows the opponent to achieve more rewards in the future. To deal with this issue, we adopt the concept of ε -Stackelberg equilibrium and prove that this equilibrium can be achieved for finite-horizon OTZ-POSGs. We propose a space partition approach to solve the game iteratively and show that the value function of the leader is piece-wise linear and the value function of the follower is piece-wise constant for multiple stages. Finally, examples are given to illustrate the space partition approach and show that value functions are piece-wise linear and piece-wise constant.},

During this period, most of the focus seems to be on structural system’s properties related to controllability/observability and decentralized control, in the context of linear time-invariant systems, under the classic assumption that the parameters are independent and belonging to infinite fields. Notwithstanding, it is notable an increase in research in topics that go beyond such scope and underlying assumptions, as well as applications in a variety of domains.

  abstract     = {Linear temporal logic (LTL) formulae are widely used to provide high level behavioral specifications on mobile robots. We propose a decentralized route-planning method for a networked team of mobile robots to satisfy a common (global) LTL specification. The global specification is assumed to be a conjunction of multiple formulae, each of which is treated as a task to be assigned to one or more vehicles. The vehicle kinematic model consists of two modes: a hover mode and a constant-speed forward motion mode with bounded steering rate. The proposed method leverages the consensus-based bundle algorithm for decentralized task assignment, thereby decomposing the global specification into local specifications for each vehicle. We develop a new algorithm to assign collaborative tasks: those simultaneously assigned to multiple vehicles. Rewards in the proposed task assignment algorithm are computed using the so-called lifted graph, which ensures the satisfaction of minimum turn radius constraints on vehicular motion. This algorithm synchronizes the vehicles’ routes with minimum waiting durations. The proposed method is compared against a multi-vehicle task assignment algorithm from the literature, which we extend to apply for satisfying LTL specifications. The proposed route-planning method is demonstrated via numerical simulation examples and a hardware implementation on networked single-board computers.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the problem of generalized Nash equilibrium seeking in population games under general affine equality and convex inequality constraints. In particular, we design a novel payoff dynamics model to steer the decision-making agents to a generalized Nash equilibrium of the underlying game, i.e., to a self-enforceable state where the constraints are satisfied and no agent has incentives to unilaterally deviate from her selected strategy. Moreover, using Lyapunov stability theory, we provide sufficient conditions to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the corresponding equilibria set in stable population games. Auxiliary results characterizing the properties of the equilibria set are also provided for general continuous population games. Furthermore, our theoretical developments are numerically validated on a Cournot game considering various market-related and production-related constraints.},

In contrast to other state estimation methods that propagate the conditional moments, the proposed filter is shown to propagate and update the full probability density function of the state. Characteristic solutions to the Liouville equation are used to propagate the exact probability density values along the flow of the dynamical system. The reconstruction of the state probability density function is then posed as a convex programming problem. An adaptive regression-tree based region-decomposition approach is used to efficiently compute expectation integrals involved in implementing the Bayes rule associated with posterior density function. Numerical examples capturing the non-Gaussian nature of the uncertainty in the duffing oscillator problem and the two body problem are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.},

We further develop dynamic-programming-based iterative algorithms for the proposed equilibrium problems, together with their arithmetic complexity analysis. Finally, we illustrate our network equilibrium model via a multi-commodity ride-sharing example, and compare the computational efficiency of our algorithms against the state-of-the-art optimization software MOSEK over extensive numerical experiments.},

A novel algorithm is proposed, which adds edge-based perturbation signals to the process of consensus computation. Our algorithm can be divided into two phases: a coordinated scrambling phase, which is for privacy preservation, and a convergence phase. In the scrambling phase, each agent is required to generate some perturbation signals and add them to the edges leading out of it. In the convergence phase, the agents update their states following a normal updating rule. It is shown that an internal honest-but-curious agent can obtain the privacy of a target agent if and only if no other agents can communicate with the target agent. As for external eavesdroppers, it is proved that this kind of attackers can never obtain any agent’s privacy.},

In these works, permanent or intermittent failures are considered, and models of the plant subject to these failures are obtained. One characteristic of the robust diagnosis method considering intermittent failures is that the faulty sensor may or may not recover from the failure, and the intermittent failures may evolve to permanent failures, which are also represented in the model of the plant subject to intermittent failures. However, in some cases, the communication failure is transient due to external interference, i . e . , the communication channel always recovers from the failure after a short period of time. In this paper, we formulate the problem of robust diagnosis against transient sensor communication failures. The new formulation leads to the definition of K -loss robust codiagnosability. We also present a method to verify this property.},

If the intruder is never able to ascertain that the system is or was in a secret state at any time, the system is said to be infinite-step opaque. This work aims at verifying the two opacity properties when the discrete event system is modeled as a bounded labeled Petri net.

The crane with the resulting stabilized dynamics is controlled with a tracking controller based on NMPC (nonlinear model predictive controller). The Lyapunov-based damping controller is designed so that the stabilized closed-loop pendulum dynamics are exponentially stable. This means that the pendulum motion is ultimately bounded in the presence of bounded perturbations. The control variables of the NMPC tracking controller are constrained so that the perturbations to the damping controller are sufficiently bounded.

This distribution can be expressed as a Gaussian mixture with a known, but exponentially increasing, number of Gaussian components as the time index increases. This is accompanied by exponential growth in memory and computational requirements, which rapidly becomes intractable. To ameliorate this, we limit the number of allowed mixture terms by employing a Gaussian likelihood mixture reduction strategy, which results in a computationally tractable, but approximate smoothed distribution. The approximation error can be balanced against computational complexity in order to provide an accurate and practical smoothing algorithm that compares favourably to existing state-of-the-art approaches.},

In this paper, we address the existence of new convex parameterizations and discuss potential tradeoffs of each parameterization in different scenarios. Our main contributions are: (1) We reveal that only four groups of stable closed-loop transfer matrices are equivalent to internal stability: one of them is used in the SLP, another one is used in the IOP, and the other two are new, leading to two new convex parameterizations of C stab . (2) We investigate the properties of these parameterizations after imposing the finite impulse response (FIR) approximation, revealing that the IOP has the best ability of approximating C stab given FIR constraints. (3) These four parameterizations require no a priori doubly-coprime factorization of the plant, but impose a set of equality constraints. However, these equality constraints will never be satisfied exactly in floating-point arithmetic computation and/or implementation. We prove that the IOP is numerically robust for open-loop stable plants, in the sense that small mismatches in the equality constraints do not compromise the closed-loop stability; but a direct IOP implementation will fail to stabilize open-loop unstable systems in practice. The SLP is known to enjoy numerical robustness in the state feedback case; here, we show that numerical robustness of the four-block SLP controller requires case-by-case analysis even when the plant is open-loop stable.},

This paper presents the results of a consistency and asymptotic normality study based on the analysis of the prediction error cost function and Monte Carlo simulations. We show that for persistently exciting input signals (filtered white noise), model structures such as Output-Error, AR and ARX are consistently estimated, and the estimated parameters are asymptotically normally distributed.

  abstract     = {This paper studies a 3D multiplayer reach-avoid differential game with a goal region and a play region. Multiple pursuers defend the goal region by consecutively capturing multiple evaders in the play region. The players have heterogeneous moving speeds and the pursuers have heterogeneous capture radii. Since this game is hard to analyze directly, we decompose the whole game as many subgames which involve multiple pursuers and only one evader. Then, these subgames are used as a building block for the pursuer–evader matching. First, for multiple pursuers and one evader, we introduce an evasion space (ES) method characterized by a potential function to construct a guaranteed pursuer winning strategy. Then, based on this strategy, we develop conditions to determine whether a pursuit team can guard the goal region against one evader. It is shown that in 3D, if a pursuit team is able to defend the goal region against an evader, then at most three pursuers in the team are necessarily needed. We also compute the value function of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs (HJI) equation for a special subgame of degree. To capture the maximum number of evaders in the open-loop sense, we formulate a maximum bipartite matching problem with conflict graph (MBMC). We show that the MBMC is NP-hard and design a polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithm to solve it. Finally, we propose a receding horizon strategy for the pursuit team where in each horizon an MBMC is solved and the strategies of the pursuers are given. We also extend our results to the case of a bounded convex play region where the evaders escape through an exit. Two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the results.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel approach to (controlled) synchronization of networked nonlinear systems. For classes of identical single-input–single-output nonlinear systems and networks, including oscillator networks, we propose a systematic design procedure (with generic as well as constructive conditions) for specifying nonlinear coupling functions that guarantee global asymptotic synchronization of the systems’ (oscillatory) states. The proposed coupling laws are in the form of a definite integral of a nonlinear “coupling gain” function. It can be fit to the system’s nonlinearities and, thus, can avoid cancelling nonlinearities by feedback or high-gain arguments commonly needed for linear (diffusive) coupling laws. As demonstrated by two examples, including a network of FitzHugh–Nagumo oscillators, this design can result in much lower synchronizing coupling gains than for the common case of linear couplings, therewith increasing energy efficiency of the coupling laws and reducing output-noise sensitivity. The resulting coupling structure can be of a varying type, when couplings are activated/deactivated depending on the systems’ outputs without undermining overall synchronization. The approach is based on a novel notion of incremental feedback passivity with a nonlinear gain. In addition to the design contribution, these results provide a new insight into potential synchronization mechanisms in natural and artificial nonlinearly coupled systems.},

In this note, necessary and sufficient conditions are developed for the prescribed-time attractivity of linear time-varying (LTV) systems. It is proved that the frozen-time eigenvalues of a prescribed-time attractive LTV system have negative real parts when the time is sufficiently close to the convergence moment. This result shows that the ubiquitous singularity problem of prescribed-time attractive LTV systems can be avoided without instability effects by switching to the corresponding frozen-time system at an appropriate time. Consequently, it is proved that the time-varying state-feedback gain of a prescribed-time controller, designed for an unknown linear time-invariant system, approaches the set of stabilizing constant state-feedback gains.},

It has also provided a deeper understanding of the theoretical framework that relates the power cepstrum with some system theoretic properties of the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we pursue the intricate connections between the power cepstrum of a signal and the pole polynomial of the underlying generative model. In this way, we develop a simple and extremely efficient method to identify an autoregressive (AR) system, starting from the power cepstrum of its output signal. This general framework uses Newton’s identities to set up a system of elementary symmetric polynomials over the cepstral coefficients and results in an identification algorithm that is independent of the length of the power cepstrum, with computational complexity only linearly dependent on the order of the model. We provide several numerical examples, first on synthetic time series, then on the classical Yule sunspot numbers modeling problem, and finally on a contemporary application involving structural health monitoring. Subsequently, the novel system identification algorithm is employed to provide insight in the results of weighted cepstral clustering, showing that the model estimated from the center of a cluster provides a good estimator for the dynamics in that cluster.},

Two novel event-triggered strategies named adaptive dynamic event-triggered (ADET) schemes for one-to-all and one-to-one ETC are well developed, in which on-line triggering parameters associated with each node or edge and dynamic thresholds with updating laws are introduced, respectively. Firstly, an ADET consensus control protocol under one-to-all ETC is proposed and a sufficient condition for consensus is derived. Compared with most existing triggering rules, the on-line triggering parameter associated with each node makes the controller be designed in a fully distributed way. On the other hand, the proposed dynamic threshold has the potential of excluding Zeno behavior without sacrificing the system performance. Secondly, an ADET consensus control protocol under one-to-one ETC is studied, in which each agent asynchronously transmits its observer states to its neighbors depending on edge-based triggering functions. The one-to-one ETC provides a flexible self-regulated transmission mode. An effective fully distributed and observer-based consensus protocol is developed appropriately with available local measurement outputs, under which the agents are not required to have a priori knowledge of any global information. Further discussion on the efficiency of ADET strategies and comparison between state-based and observer-based ADET control are provided to enrich the distributed resources-aware control framework. Finally, one simulation example is provided to illustrate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the stability of meshed DC micro-grids with constant power loads (CPLs), under decentralized primary and distributed secondary control schemes to achieve accurate power sharing and voltage restoration, with the latter being more significant to the case of parallel converters in a micro-grid architecture. The DC micro-grid consists of multiple DC/DC boost converters, which have nonlinear dynamics, feeding local CPLs, which also exhibit a nonlinear behaviour and introduce negative impedance characteristics that are well-known to yield instability. At the primary control layer, the droop control concept is suitably formulated and implemented using the recently proposed state-limiting PI controller to accomplish an inherent current limitation for each converter and simultaneously facilitate the stability analysis. Using limited information of the injected power from neighbouring converters and, depending on the micro-grid configuration, the load voltage, a distributed secondary controller is formulated to enhance the power sharing and accurately regulate the voltage to the rated value. By analysing for the first time both the dynamics of the converters with the CPLs and the two-layer control, singular perturbation theory is applied to analytically prove the stability of the entire DC micro-grid. The scalability of the system is also ensured through relevant passivity analysis. Simulation and experimental testings are performed to confirm the effectiveness and validity of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Imitation is widely observed in nature and often used to model populations of decision-making agents, but it is not yet known under what conditions a network of imitators will reach a state where they are satisfied with their decisions. We show that every network in which agents imitate the best performing strategy in their neighborhood will reach an equilibrium in finite time, provided that all agents are opponent coordinating , i.e., earn a higher payoff if their opponent plays the same strategy as they do. It follows that any non-convergence observed in imitative networks is not necessarily a result of population heterogeneity nor special network topology, but rather must be caused by other factors such as the presence of non-opponent-coordinating agents. To strengthen this result, we show that large classes of imitative networks containing non-opponent-coordinating agents never equilibrate even when the population is homogeneous. Comparing to best-response dynamics where equilibration is guaranteed for every network of homogeneous agents playing 2 × 2 matrix games, our results imply that networks of imitators have a lower equilibration tendency.},

  abstract     = {We propose a counterexample-guided inductive synthesis framework for the formal synthesis of closed-form sampled-data controllers for nonlinear systems to meet STL specifications over finite-time trajectories. Rather than stating the STL specification for a single initial condition, we consider an (infinite and bounded) set of initial conditions. Candidate solutions are proposed using genetic programming, which evolves controllers based on a finite number of simulations. Subsequently, the best candidate is verified using reachability analysis; if the candidate solution does not satisfy the specification, an initial condition violating the specification is extracted as a counterexample. Based on this counterexample, candidate solutions are refined until eventually a solution is found (or a user-specified number of iterations is met). The resulting sampled-data controller is expressed as a closed-form expression, enabling both interpretability and the implementation in embedded hardware with limited memory and computation power. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated for multiple systems.},

In this paper, we develop a novel state decomposition-based privacy preservation scheme to protect the privacy of agents when sharing information with neighboring agents. Specifically, we first show that an external eavesdropper can successfully wiretap the reference signals of all agents in a conventional dynamic average consensus algorithm. To protect privacy against the eavesdropper, a state decomposition scheme is developed where the original state of each agent is decomposed into two sub-states: one succeeds the role of the original state in inter-node interactions, while the other sub-state only communicates with the first one and is invisible to other neighboring agents. Rigorous analyses are performed to show that (1) the proposed privacy scheme preserves the convergence of the average consensus; and (2) the privacy of the agents is protected such that an eavesdropper cannot discover the private reference signals with guaranteed accuracy. The developed privacy-preserving dynamic average consensus framework is then applied to the formation control of multiple non-holonomic mobile robots, in which the efficacy of the scheme is demonstrated. Numerical simulation is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

To suppress the inherent system nonlinearities (reflected by the polynomial-of-output growth rate), a dynamic gain is integrated into event-triggered scheme. While reducing execution as much as possible to maintain efficiency, it is critical to ensure timely information transmission and control updating for the effectiveness of adaptive mechanism. To this end, double-side asynchronous adaptive event-triggering mechanisms, instead of a one-side or (double-side) synchronous one, are delicately designed by fully exploiting the dynamic gain, upon which adaptive event-triggered output-feedback control is established to ensure the system states to converge to zero. Particularly, the time of evaluation suspension and the threshold parameter for the events on system output and observer states are not fixed but rather online adjusted with the alteration of dynamic gain, to make sure to counteract the influence of sampling/actuation error. Unlike the related results, the adaptive event-triggering mechanisms render the inter-execution times determined purely according to system behavior and without explicit upper-bound limit, which retain the desired potential in execution reducing.},

In particular, we consider the state feedback stabilization problem for nonlinear systems when the state measurement is sent to the controller via a communication channel that only has a finite transmitting rate and is moreover subject to cyber attacks in the form of Denial-of-Service (DoS). We use a dynamic quantization method to update the quantization range of the encoder/decoder and characterize the number of bits for quantization needed to stabilize the system under a given level of DoS attacks in terms of duration and frequency. Our theoretical result shows that under DoS attacks, the required data bits to stabilize nonlinear systems by state feedback control are larger than those without DoS since the communication interruption induced by DoS makes the quantization uncertainty expand more between two successful transmissions. Even so, in the simulation, we show that the actual quantization bits can be much smaller than the theoretical value.},

We show that sufficient conditions presented in the literature for discounted-cost problems are in general not sufficient to ensure robustness for average-cost problems. However, we show that the average optimal cost is continuous in the convergences of controlled transition kernel models where convergence of models entails (i) continuous weak convergence in state and actions, and (ii) continuous setwise convergence in the actions for every fixed state variable, in addition to either uniform ergodicity or some regularity conditions. We establish that the mismatch error due to the application of a control policy designed for an incorrectly estimated model to the true model decreases to zero as the incorrect model approaches the true model under the stated convergence criteria. Our findings significantly relax related studies in the literature which have primarily considered the more restrictive total variation convergence criteria. Applications to robustness to models estimated through empirical data (where almost sure weak convergence criterion typically holds, but stronger criteria do not) are studied and conditions for asymptotic robustness to data-driven learning are established.},

In this paper, we develop a closed-loop FES cycling controller that yields exponential cadence tracking. Contributions of the work result from the design and analysis innovations to compensate for switching between the different muscles and motor control inputs, compensating for the inherent uncertain nonlinear dynamics, compensating for the time-varying unknown input delay resulting from the complex electrochemical FES muscle torque production process, and compensating for saturation in the evoked torque due to fatigue, available muscle mass, or stimulation sensitivity. The performance of the developed control system was examined through a series of experiments on nine participants (five able-bodied and four with NCs). The experiments resulted in a cadence tracking error of −0.03 ± 1.69 RPM for non-informed passive able-bodied participants and −0.04 ± 1.98 RPM for the participants with NCs, for a desired cadence of 50 RPM.},

Another key feature of our approach is that the growth condition is imposed only on the driving state variables that actually appear in the LKF analysis of the driven subsystem: this feature happens to be new also in a delay-free context and helps reducing the conservatism of existing approaches.},

A novel resilient practical cooperative output regulation control scheme is developed. This scheme consists of (i) a data-driven learning algorithm to learn the unknown switching exosystem matrices; (ii) an auxiliary observer to estimate the state of the exosystem; (iii) distributed resilient observers to estimate the state of the auxiliary system; and (iv) distributed controllers for individual agents. By using the dwell-time method, rigorous stability analysis shows that the resilient observation errors are globally ultimately bounded in the presence of DoS attacks and the resilient practical CORP is solved.

A controllability and observability analysis of the intermittent ILC framework leads to appropriate monotonic convergence conditions which allow for missing data. These conditions lead to a new explicit ILC controller design independent of the sampling instances, which is reminiscent of gradient-descent ILC.

  abstract     = {Sign-Perturbed-Sums (SPS) is a system identification algorithm that, under mild assumptions on the distribution of the noise, constructs confidence regions with finite-sample validity and a user-specified confidence level. For linear regression models, SPS regions are well-shaped in a precise meaning, but it is still possible (though rare in practice) that they are unbounded. In this communication, we provide a reformulation of a technical condition for the boundedness of the SPS regions in terms of a more practical excitation condition. We briefly argue that the simple condition here proposed provides insight to tune the SPS parameters, and even to design refined algorithms that can be guaranteed to deliver bounded regions.},

However, an exact delay compensation is not possible in the presence of time-varying delay mismatches, and larger delays cannot therefore be obtained by increasing the number of subpredictors. To alleviate this limitation and enhance robustness against time-varying delay uncertainties, a generalized sequential subpredictor (SSP) control scheme is proposed by introducing new observer parameters that can be designed via Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) and Cone-Complementarity Linearization (CCL) algorithm.

In fact, also in the linear setting there is no procedure proposed in the literature able to estimate the dominant pole of a dynamic system ensuring stability. In this paper, we design a new algorithm, namely the sequential stabilizing spline (SSS) algorithm, which fills this gap. Our approach determines the system’s stability radius by combining Gaussian regression and stochastic simulation, using stable spline kernels to model the one-step ahead predictor impulse responses. Then, a stable model is recovered through a novel sequential convex optimization procedure whose computational time is orders of magnitude faster than approaches based on linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Numerical experiments are included and show that SSS can return models with high long-term predictive capability. SSS performance is comparable to that achieved by classical prediction error methods equipped with an oracle that has access to the test set to tune the best model order for any prediction horizon.},

Though there have been much efforts devoted to the identification of such systems, most of the previous investigations are based on first-order gradient algorithm which usually has much slower convergence rate than the Quasi-Newton algorithm. Moreover, persistence of excitation (PE) conditions are usually required to guarantee consistent parameter estimates in the existing literature, which are hard to be verified or guaranteed for feedback control systems. In this paper, we propose an online projected Quasi-Newton type algorithm for parameter estimation of stochastic regression models with binary-valued observations and varying thresholds. By using both the stochastic Lyapunov function and martingale estimation methods, we establish the strong consistency of the estimation algorithm and provide the convergence rate, under a signal condition which is considerably weaker than the traditional PE condition and coincides with the weakest possible excitation known for the classical least square algorithm of stochastic regression models. Convergence of adaptive predictors and their applications in adaptive control are also discussed.},

By constructing a special form of stochastic event-based protocols, the optimal control policy is obtained, which minimizes an average quadratic cost function under a fixed transmission protocol. Then, analytical expressions of the corresponding transmission and control performance are derived. To evaluate the efficiency of event-based protocols, the concept of strict consistency is introduced, which requires that the control performance of event-based protocols be strictly better than that of the periodic protocol under the same transmission rate. Based on the obtained analytical expressions, the strict consistency is proved by showing that the periodic protocol corresponds to a local maximum point in the design space of parameters. To further improve the control performance of stochastic event-based protocols, an iterative parameter design algorithm (with finite iterations) is proposed for ensuring a strict reduction in cost functions after each iteration.

Our key idea lies in the design of a finite-time set-consensus method with Polyak’s adaptive stepsize. Moreover, we introduce a low-rank matrix approximation (LA) technique to compress the innovation of Hessian matrix so that each node only needs to transmit message of dimension O ( p ) (where p is the dimension of decision vectors) per iteration, which is essentially the same as that of first-order methods. Nevertheless, the resulting DAN-LA converges to an optimal solution with a global superlinear rate.

The measurements’ structure is changed by the scheduling protocol, which may cause the round-robin-induced periodic extended state system (RRIPESS) to be unobservable. A necessary and sufficient condition of a class of RRIPESS’s observability is established. An extended state estimator is designed. The upper bound of the priori estimation error covariance is derived via a set of periodic Riccati equations (PREs). The stability of these PREs is ensured by the detectability and the stabilizability of the original system’s parameters. In addition, we give an iterative algorithm to improve the upper bound by optimizing a set of scalars induced by Young’s inequality.

Policy iteration involves a model-based initialization stage, i.e., seeking an initial stabilizing control policy, which is, however, dependent on the full system dynamics including the drift dynamics and system input matrix. To remove such model requirements, this paper utilizes a homotopy-based initialization strategy for policy iteration, wherein a stabilizing control policy for continuous-time systems is obtained by gradually moving a stable system to the original system. We propose two homotopic policy iteration-based stabilizing control schemes, namely, a model-based design and a model-free design using system data, which are proved to place unstable poles into a stable region. The effectiveness of the proposed designs is validated through an illustrative example.},

Moreover, an algorithm for generating false data is provided to keep the attack stealthy. In order to overcome the detection vulnerability, a new protection strategy is proposed to ensure that the distributed estimator is secure under false data injection attacks. It is worth emphasizing that the strategy adopts a stochastic rule instead of a fixed threshold to detect suspicious data, which effectively avoids the occurrence of the truncated Gaussian distribution.

To overcome these shortcomings, this study proposes a new multivariate statistics-based process monitoring (MSPM) method called the orthonormal subspace analysis (OSA) method. OSA divides process data and KPI data into three orthonormal subspaces through an analytic solution. Hence, OSA not only can detect a fault but also can judge whether the fault is KPI-related or KPI-unrelated. OSA is always effective irrespective of the availability of the KPI variables in the online monitoring stage. In OSA, the cumulative percent variance (CPV) method is adopted for principal component selection. In brief, OSA is a more effective method than PLS and CCA, and it achieves superior performance in fault detection and classification.},

A Levenberg–Marquardt-like regularization algorithm is integrated in the filter to preclude the estimator from becoming unreliable due to wind-up effects. It is proven that, under uniform complete observability–controllability conditions and a persistent excitation condition, the expectations of the state and parameter estimation errors tend to zero exponentially fast. Furthermore, their stability (in the sense of Lyapunov) is guaranteed even if the persistent excitation condition is not satisfied. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated using real sensor data from a vehicle motion estimation application. Unlike the original algorithm, the proposed regularized adaptive Kalman filter provides accurate and reliable estimates of the states and parameters despite periods of poor excitation.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we compute finite sample bounds for data-driven approximations of the solution to stochastic reachability problems. Our approach uses a nonparametric technique known as kernel distribution embeddings, and provides probabilistic assurances of safety for stochastic systems in a model-free manner. By implicitly embedding the stochastic kernel of a Markov control process in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, we can approximate the safety probabilities for stochastic systems with arbitrary stochastic disturbances as simple matrix operations and inner products. We present finite sample bounds for point-based approximations of the safety probabilities through construction of probabilistic confidence bounds that are state- and input-dependent. One advantage of this approach is that the bounds are responsive to non-uniformly sampled data, meaning that tighter bounds are feasible in regions of the state- and input-space with more observations. We numerically evaluate the approach, and demonstrate its efficacy on a neural network-controlled pendulum system.},

  abstract     = {The event-triggered fault detection problem for nonlinear semi-Markov jump systems constructed by Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy approach is studied in this paper. Owing to that the premise variables and the modes are usually mismatched for both the filter and the plant in actual network environment, i.e., the double asynchronous phenomenon, a novel double asynchronous fault detection filter is designed to take the place of the traditional filter and tackle the fault detection problem for fuzzy semi-Markov jump systems. Particularly, the event-triggered scheme is considered to reduce the waste of communication resources, which gives rise to the premise variables asynchronous phenomenon for the plant and the filter. The modes information of the fuzzy semi-Markov jump systems is not always instantaneously accessible, which leads to the mode asynchronous phenomenon for the plant and the filter. This mode asynchronous phenomenon is described by a hidden semi-Markov model. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, the sufficient conditions are developed to ensure that the system not only is stochastically stable and meets an H ∞ performance, but also can make sure that the filter gains could be captured. Finally, an illustrative tunnel diode circuit example is provided to show the effectiveness of proposed approach.},

Two sets of new formulations are established to capture the temporal relationships between channel inputs and outputs without assuming the first-in-first-out (FIFO) property, which naturally contains the model without delays and losses in the Ramadge–Wonham framework. Based on the defined mappings of each component, the closed-loop behavior is defined to describe the concurrent system dynamics. We hope the new framework could serve as an analysis tool, and possibly the building block for a synthesis tool, for future theoretical explorations and practical implementations of networked DES control.},

After treating the time delay of arbitrary length as a transport PDE whose boundary connects with the plant, a state observer is built to estimate the states of the overall system of heterodirectional coupled hyperbolic PDEs–ODE–transport PDE, only using the measurements at the right boundary of the last transport PDE. An observer-based output-feedback continuous-in-time controller is designed to stabilize the overall system using the backstepping method, followed by an observer-based event-triggering mechanism, which is designed based on the evolution of the overall PDE–ODE–PDE system, to determine the updating times of the actuation signal. The absence of a Zeno behavior and exponential convergence in the event-based closed-loop system are proved. In the simulation, the obtained theoretical result is verified in control of a deep-sea construction vessel to place the equipment in the target area on the seabed.

  abstract     = {This paper examines one aspect of computational control, namely the reduction of computational load for the real-time estimation of distributed parameter systems over large spatial domains. One way to improve the performance of the state estimator is to employ a small number of mobile devices that are free to move within the spatial domain while collecting process information. Another way is to use numerical methods to reduce the computational load as dictated by the discretization index of the finite dimensional representation of the filter. This is done via the use of domain decomposition methods and the domain decomposition filter is presented here for the first time along with its well-posedness. In the subdomain surrounding the sensor a refined grid is used as it improves the spatial resolution, and in the subdomain excluding the vicinity of the sensing device, a naïve observer with coarse grid is used which results in a significant reduction of the computational cost. However, due to the transmission conditions that couple the information between the inner subdomain surrounding the sensor and the outer subdomain excluding the sensor, the filters in the two subdomains implement an information exchange protocol rendering them consensus filters. The two approaches are combined thus resulting in a state estimation scheme where the mobile sensor residing in the inner subdomain carries its own refined grid. Not only is the sensor mobile, but also the refined grid surrounding the sensor is moving along with the sensor. A further reduction in computational costs is presented in the form of a hybrid DD filter wherein the filter kernel is rendered sparse thus ensuring that no residual measurement signals enter as disturbance signals in the naïve observer defined over the outer subdomain. Extensive simulation studies of a 2D PDE with realistic parameters are included to demonstrate the proposed hybrid DD filter.},

As a result, having access to accurate state estimates, even in the presence of attacks on sensor measurements, is of critical importance. In this work, we analyze performance of resilient state estimators (RSEs) when any subset of sensors may be compromised by a stealthy attacker . Specifically, we consider systems with the well-known l 0 -based RSE and two commonly used sound intrusion detectors (IDs). For linear time-invariant plants with bounded noise, we define the notion of perfect attackability (PA) when attacks may result in unbounded estimation errors while remaining undetected by the employed ID (i.e., stealthy). We derive necessary and sufficient PA conditions, showing that a system can be perfectly attackable even if the plant is stable. While PA can be prevented with the use the standard cryptographic mechanisms (e.g., message authentication) that ensure data integrity under network-based attacks, their continuous use imposes significant communication and computational overhead. Consequently, we also study the impact that even intermittent use of data authentication has on RSE performance guarantees in the presence of stealthy attacks. We show that if messages from some of the sensors are even intermittently authenticated, stealthy attacks could not result in unbounded state estimation errors.},

ODeePC is enabled by computationally efficient methods that exploit the special structure of the Hankel matrices in the context of DeePC with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and primal–dual algorithm We provide theoretical guarantees regarding the asymptotic behavior of ODeePC, and we demonstrate its performance through numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {In remote state estimation systems, the state being estimated may be wiretapped by eavesdropping communications from the sensor to the remote estimator. A straightforward remedy for protecting the state privacy is to encrypt all the sensory data before transmission, which however may not be affordable for an energy-constrained sensor. In this paper, we address the optimal sensor transmission scheduling problem in order to protect the state privacy in an energy-efficient manner. The sensor can choose either to transmit data in plaintext or encrypted text, or to stay in silence without transmitting. We formulate the problem as the one of maximizing the eavesdropper’s estimation error of the system state, while guaranteeing a certain level of the remote estimation performance under a given energy budget for the sensor in the finite time horizon. Then, we transform the problem into an optimal scheduling problem under any fixed transmission times and an energy allocation problem, and propose algorithms to solve each of them. We theoretically prove that, provided that a certain level of remote estimation performance is guaranteed, the optimal sensor schedule is to group instants of encrypted transmissions and silent states as tighter as possible and the optimal energy allocation tends to arrange more energy to transmit encrypted text. Furthermore, we extend our results over finite time horizon to infinite periodic time horizon. We construct a set of monotonic sequences to approximate the estimator’s performance constraint. Then, we design an algorithm to obtain the suboptimal schedule Finally, numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods.},

Compared to the state-of-the-art logic-based mechanisms, the challenge of power-chained dynamics is that in general asymptotic tracking cannot be obtained, even for a single agent. To address this challenge, a new logic-based mechanism is proposed, which is orchestrated by a dynamic boundary function. The boundary function is decreasing in-between switching instants and monotonically increasing at the switching instants, depending on the jumps of an appropriately designed Lyapunov-like function. To remove chattering (i.e. two or more switching instants occurring consecutively with zero dwell time), a dynamic threshold is proposed, based on selecting the maximum values of the Lyapunov-like function before and after switching.},

Taking advantage of the structure of certain classes of distributed systems seen in applications with inter-agent coupling, a novel robust DMPC is formulated. The proposed approach is characterised by separable terminal costs and locally robust terminal sets, with the latter sets adaptively estimated in the online optimisation problem. A constraint tightening approach based on a set-membership approach is used to guarantee constraint satisfaction for coupled subsystems in the presence of disturbances. Under this formulation, the closed-loop system is shown to be recursively feasible and input-to-state stable. To aid in the deployment of the proposed robust DMPC, a possible synthesis method and design conditions for practical implementation are presented. Finally, simulation results with a mass–spring–damper system are provided to demonstrate the proposed robust DMPC.},

We predict that the opinions of agents in a sink strongly connected component achieve a state of bipartite consensus exponentially fast, and the corresponding appraisal subnetwork converges to a fully connected structural balance state, which determines the scope of non-sinks’ opinions.

We analyze computation dynamics (associated with stochastic gradient updates) and information exchange (associated with exchanging current models with neighboring nodes). We provide a finite-time characterization of convergence of the weighted ensemble average estimate and compare this result to federated learning, an alternative approach to estimation wherein a single model is updated by locally generated gradient updates. This comparison highlights the trade-off between speed vs precision: while model updates take place at a faster rate in federated learning, the proposed networked approach to estimation enables the identification of models with higher precision. We illustrate the method’s general applicability in two examples: estimating a Markov random field using wireless sensor networks and modeling prey escape behavior of flocking birds based on a publicly available dataset.},

In the present paper, we present an improved time-delay approach and extend it to L 2 -gain analysis. By the backward averaging, we transform the system to a modified time-delay system that leads to fewer terms to be compensated in the Lyapunov–Krasovskii (L–K) analysis. As a result we derive less conservative and simpler conditions for ISS and L 2 -gain analysis in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). We further extend our results to stochastic systems where we employ a stochastic extension of Lyapunov functionals that we use for the deterministic case.

  abstract     = {Semidefinite programs (SDPs) are standard convex problems that are frequently found in control and optimization applications. Interior-point methods can solve SDPs in polynomial time up to arbitrary accuracy, but scale poorly as the size of matrix variables and the number of constraints increases. To improve scalability, SDPs can be approximated with lower and upper bounds through the use of structured subsets (e.g., diagonally-dominant and scaled-diagonally dominant matrices). Meanwhile, any underlying sparsity or symmetry structure may be leveraged to form an equivalent SDP with smaller positive semidefinite constraints. In this paper, we present a notion of decomposed structured subsets to approximate an SDP with structured subsets after an equivalent conversion. The lower/upper bounds found by approximation after conversion become tighter than the bounds obtained by approximating the original SDP directly. We apply decomposed structured subsets to semidefinite and sum-of-squares optimization problems with examples of H ∞ norm estimation and constrained polynomial optimization. An existing basis pursuit method is adapted into this framework to iteratively refine bounds.},

It is known that a globally asymptotically stable nonlinear system cascaded by a stabilizable linear system through its output can be semi-globally asymptotically stabilized by a combination of linear low gain and high gain feedback of the state of the linear subsystem as long as the linear subsystem is right invertible and has all its invariant zeros located on the closed left-half plane. Such low-and-high state feedback can be implemented by an observer. To retain a domain of attraction arbitrarily close to that under a given state feedback law, a high gain observer is employed to achieve arbitrarily fast decay to zero of the observation errors of all states and the effect of the peaking phenomenon associated with the high observer gain is overcome by saturating the control input outside the desired domain of attraction under the state feedback law. Existing high gain observer designs thus require the linear subsystem to be observable. The proposed co-design does not resort to making all state observation errors to decay to zero arbitrarily fast and thus allows the linear subsystem to be detectable but not observable. Moreover, the proposed design does not resort to saturating the control input and results in linear feedback laws that are parameterized in a single parameter and easy to tune.},

The proposed control scheme exploits the passivity property of the closed-loop system to ensure robustness to unknown and slowly varying plant parameters. The controller design follows a decentralized control approach, which features a high flexibility in terms of the number of available actuators. However, the unknown disturbance frequency is estimated in a centralized way. Here, the frequency estimator switches between individual outputs based on the estimated amplitudes of the compensation scheme. This leads to an improved rate of convergence compared to a fixed output frequency estimator while retaining the high flexibility of the controller design regarding the number of available actuators. In this work, the local exponential stability of the respective nonlinear time-varying switched error dynamics is proven. Furthermore, measurements from an experimental test rig for electromagnetic stabilization of thin steel strips demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control scheme.},

In this context, we introduce a number of methodological results to compute a control policy from example datasets that: (i) makes the behavior of the closed-loop system similar to the one illustrated in the data; (ii) guarantees compliance with the constraints. We recast the control problem as a finite-horizon optimal control problem and give an explicit expression for its optimal solution. Moreover, we turn our findings into an algorithmic procedure.

Our results extend existing ones that typically impose that the solution set is a singleton and require certain non-degeneracy properties: hence, we thereby offer probabilistic feasibility guarantees for any feasible solution of the underlying variational inequality. We show that assessing the violation probability of an entire set of solutions requires enumeration of the support constraints that “shape” this set, and also propose a procedure to enumerate the support constraints that does not require a description of the solution set.

We show that this time based deadlock prevention (TBDP) problem is decidable for bounded PN and can be formalised as a parametric model checking problem. However, in this context, the parametric model checking faces a severe state explosion problem. To deal with this limitation, we propose a symbolic approach that abstracts firing order constraints and bypasses the use of parameter domains with their associated very costly operations. Both approaches can handle, as an input model, a (time) PN with controllable/uncontrollable transitions. In such a case, they expose whether or not the firing intervals of the controllable transitions of the input model can be restricted so as to force the deadlock freeness (i.e., there is no marking with no enabled transitions).},

The aim is to find a reduced-order model that not only approximates the input–output mapping of the original system but also preserves crucial structures, such as the second-order form, asymptotically stability, and diffusive couplings. To this end, an H 2 optimal approach based on a convex relaxation is used to reduce the dimension, yielding a lower order asymptotically stable approximation of the original second-order network system. Then, a novel graph reconstruction approach is employed to convert the obtained model to a reduced system that is interpretable as an undirected diffusively coupled network.

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with estimating the parameters of single-input, continuous-time systems from sampled input–output data, where any input time delays may be a fraction of the sampling interval. The proposed method estimates the parameters by minimizing a cost function defined by the sum of squared errors between the predicted and measured outputs using the optimal Refined Instrumental Variable method for Continuous-time models (RIVC). Potential difficulties may be encountered when standard gradient-based optimization is used for solving this optimization problem directly. These arise because the cost function is normally multi-modal with respect to the fractional time delay and they can occur for several reasons, such as aliasing errors, the nature of the system dynamics, and the selection of the excitation signal. In order to avoid the problems caused by these local minima, a two-stage procedure is proposed combining RIVC estimation of the model parameters with a grid search for the fractional time delay. Although this algorithm is not quite as computationally efficient as standard gradient-based optimization, it is simple, robust, and more widely applicable, as illustrated by numerical examples.},

The adopted control strategy is composed of a finite-dimensional observer estimating the first modes of the PDE coupled with a predictor to compensate the input delay. In this context, we show for any arbitrary value of the input delay that the control strategy achieves the exponential stabilization of the closed-loop system, for system trajectories evaluated in H 1 norm (also in L 2 norm in the case of a Dirichlet boundary measurement), provided the dimension of the observer is selected large enough. The reported proof of this result requires to perform both control design and stability analysis using simultaneously the (non-homogeneous) original version of the PDE and one of its equivalent homogeneous representations.},

The finite data-driven approximation of Koopman operators results in a class of linear predictors, useful for formulating linear model predictive control (MPC) of nonlinear dynamical systems with reduced computational complexity. However, the robustness of the closed-loop Koopman MPC under modeling approximation errors and possible exogenous disturbances is still a crucial issue to be resolved. Aiming at the above problem, this paper presents a robust tube-based MPC solution with Koopman operators, i.e., r-KMPC, for nonlinear discrete-time dynamical systems with additive disturbances. The proposed controller is composed of a nominal MPC using a lifted Koopman model and an off-line nonlinear feedback policy. The proposed approach does not assume the convergence of the approximated Koopman operator, which allows using a Koopman model with a limited order for controller design. Fundamental properties, e.g., stabilizability, observability, of the Koopman model are derived under standard assumptions with which, the closed-loop robustness and nominal point-wise convergence are proven. Simulated examples are illustrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Owing to the abstract linear system representation of the process, we apply the Kalman–Bucy filter for estimation, where the sensors provide linear outputs. We propose an optimization problem that minimizes the sum of the trace of the covariance operator of the Kalman–Bucy filter and a generic mobility cost of the mobile sensors, subject to the sensors’ motion modeled by linear dynamics. We establish the existence of a solution to this problem. Moreover, we prove convergence to the exact optimal solution of the approximate optimal solution. That is, when evaluating these two solutions using the original cost function, the difference becomes arbitrarily small as the approximation gets finer. To compute the approximate solution, we use Pontryagin’s minimum principle after approximating the infinite-dimensional terms originating from the diffusion–advection process. The approximate solution is applied in simulation to analyze how a single mobile sensor’s performance depends on two important parameters: sensor noise variance and mobility penalty. We also illustrate the application of the framework to multiple sensors, in particular the performance of a heterogeneous team of sensors.},

The system is assumed to be actuated by two torques acting orthogonally to the symmetry axis. In the process of stabilising the system, two main difficulties are encountered: first, the presence of a well-known topological obstruction to the global stabilisation by means of continuous feedback laws, and second, the fact that the linearised system around the target equilibrium is not controllable due to the strong underactuation of the system. To cope with the first issue, in this paper we look for feedback laws capable of stabilising the system starting from almost all initial conditions. The second issue entails the impossibility of stabilising the system exponentially by means of a smooth feedback. The contributions of this paper are ( 1 ) to propose a family of smooth feedback laws capable of almost-globally stabilising the system with a polynomial rate of convergence, and ( 2 ) to define a second family of feedback laws presenting a discontinuity at the target attitude configuration and continuous elsewhere inducing almost global exponential stabilisation.},

This translates to infection carriers preferring to visit healthier sites over more infected ones. A flow-independent epidemic threshold is defined that sets the conditions on the graph’s structure and the aggregate infection rate for a disease to either spread or die out. An individual-based mean-field approach returns results comparable to models with constant infection rates.

In this paper, a time-delay disturbance observer based sampled-data control approach is developed for the visual servoing of an inertially stabilized platform. As a camera is employed to capture the position of the target, the measurement delay is generated by the acquisition and the processing of the image information. Besides, kinematic uncertainties arising from the variable feature depth and inner-loop tracking errors of given reference signals are also unavoidable. To this end, the model of the perturbed and delayed system is established firstly. Due to the measurement delay, it is quite difficult to get the current system state. As such, a new time-delay disturbance observer is developed to estimate the previous disturbance and its differences, which facilitates predictions of the current state and the current disturbance. Based on above predictions, a sampled-data robust controller is designed with the rigorous stability analysis of the closed-loop system. Experiments on tracking a target are performed to validate promising qualities of the proposed method.},

This phenomenon raises the question: Why is the property of synchrony so sensitive with respect to the agent parameters? The paper gives an explanation by showing that the synchronous behaviour of any linear multi-agent system appears in a part of the state space that is unobservable by the networked controller. As the overall system is not completely observable but structurally observable, any parameter deviation generally makes the unobservable part to become observable. Hence, this part is moved into the control loop of the networked controller and, for oscillator networks, it gets asymptotically stabilised, which destroys the synchrony of the overall system.},

It is shown that the system in closed-loop with the developed controllers is asymptotically stable at an equilibrium of interest, and the tracking errors asymptotically converge to zero.

Our algorithm is built upon the classical expectation–maximization algorithm and the recently proposed aggregate inference algorithm (Sinkhorn belief propagation). We present the parameter learning algorithm for two different settings of HMMs: one with discrete observations and one with continuous observations, and the algorithm exhibits convergence guarantees in both cases. Moreover, our learning framework naturally reduces to the standard Baum–Welch learning algorithm for HMMs when the population size is 1. The efficacy of our algorithm is demonstrated through several numerical experiments.},

Starting with a finite family of continuously differentiable functions, suitable inequalities involving these functions and the vector fields defining the switched system are encoded in a direct and labeled graph. We then provide sufficient conditions for (asymptotic) stability subject to constrained switching times, by relying on the path-completeness of the chosen graph. The analysis is first carried out under the hypothesis of constant switching frequency. Then, the results are generalized to dwell time setting. In the case of linear dynamics, the graph formalism allows us to interpret the existing results on dwell time stability in a unified language.

It is shown that under a basic joint spanning tree condition, the states of all agents can exponentially agree on a common trajectory along the iteration axis.

The agents are connected to a server, and there is no inter-agent communication. The agents’ goal is to compute a linear model that optimally fits the collective data. The agents, however, cannot share their data points. In principle, the agents can solve this problem by collaborating with the server using the server–agent network variant of the classical gradient-descent method. However, when the data points are ill-conditioned , the gradient-descent method requires a large number of iterations to converge. We propose an iterative pre-conditioning technique to mitigate the deleterious impact of the data points’ conditioning on the convergence rate of the gradient-descent method. Unlike the conventional pre-conditioning techniques, the pre-conditioner matrix used in our proposed technique evolves iteratively. We show that our proposed algorithm converges linearly with an improved rate of convergence in comparison to both the classical and the accelerated gradient-descent methods. For the special case, when the solution of the least-squares problem is unique, our algorithm converges to the solution superlinearly . Through numerical experiments on benchmark least-squares problems, we validate our theoretical findings, and also demonstrate our algorithm’s improved robustness against process noise.},

Additionally, the network model set is allowed to contain non-parametrized modules that are fixed, and e.g. reflect modules of which the dynamics are known to the user. The conditions take the form of path-based conditions on the graph of the network model set. Based on these conditions, synthesis results are formulated for allocating external excitation signals to achieve generic identifiability of particular subnetworks.

However, challenges such as sample-efficiency, sensitivity to hyper-parameters, and compatibility with classical control paradigms limit the integration of such algorithms in critical control applications. This paper aims to take some steps towards bridging the well-known classical control requirements and learning algorithms by using optimization frameworks and properties of conic constraints. Accordingly, a new off-policy model-free approach is proposed for learning the Q-function and designing the discrete-time LQR controller. The design procedure is based on non-iterative semi-definite programs (SDP) with linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints. It is sample-efficient, inherently robust to model uncertainties, and does not require an initial stabilizing controller. The proposed model-free approach is extended to distributed control of interconnected systems, as well. The performance of the presented design is evaluated on several stable and unstable synthetic systems. The data-driven control scheme is also implemented on the IEEE 39-bus New England power grid. The results confirm optimality, sample-efficiency, and satisfactory performance of the proposed approach in centralized and distributed design.},

To overcome this difficulty, we develop a novel adaptive iterative learning control (ILC) scheme to achieve the attitude tracking control tasks with high precision for rigid bodies. Owing to the newly employed deadzone mechanism in the parametric updating law, the proposed adaptive ILC scheme is able to deal with initial alignment errors properly without imposing extra requirements to the system dynamics. Moreover, by utilizing the quaternion-based description in the system dynamics, various uncertainties, including external iteration-varying disturbances and unknown system parameters, can be addressed together by a single scalar estimation scheme. The convergence of the proposed adaptive ILC scheme is analyzed rigorously with a Lyapunov-like theory by virtue of newly introducing a modified composite energy function. In addition, to demonstrate its effectiveness, the proposed adaptive ILC method is applied to the attitude tracking of a spacecraft, which shows excellent control performances despite various uncertainties.},

Toward this, first, a novel event-triggered mechanism (ETM) based on relative information is proposed to reduce the control effects, and the enforced fixed positive lower bound of the inter-execution times in the ETM can effectively exclude the infinitely fast execution behavior. Moreover, the input-to-state stability (ISS) is analyzed and the execution error is delicately estimated so that the constant control on each inter-execution time possesses enough feedback capability to dominate the effect of execution error. Based on this, the desired consensus is achieved in the almost sure sense. Particularly, the involved stochastic convergence strategy, without using the well-known Lyapunov theorem, is hopeful to provide a potential pattern to achieve an event-triggered consensus for more general stochastic linear/nonlinear MASs. Finally, a simulation example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the optimal state-feedback LQG control (OSLC) of interconnected systems (ISs) with time-correlated process noises. In an IS, the information is transmitted among subsystems via the network, and the transmission time is proportional to the distance of the corresponding subsystem pairs. This means that the information received by a subsystem includes the non-real-time information, and that the information from different subsystems may be of different time indexes. This makes the optimal controller design challenging. The OSLC of ISs with time-uncorrelated process noises is studied by an independence decomposition method in the existing literature. However, the existing independence decomposition method strongly relies on the condition that the process noises are time-uncorrelated, and fails for the time-correlated process noises case. In this paper, the globally optimal LQG controller of ISs with time-correlated process noises is successfully designed. In particular, a new cost function decomposition is obtained based on the Bellman equation. Both the system state and the control input are decomposed into two independent parts by the orthogonal decomposition technique. The proposed decomposition method leads to the successful design of the globally optimal controller. The proposed theoretical results are applied to a vehicle platoon system. The simulation shows that the platoon maintains a desired state and achieves a good performance under the proposed controller.},

  abstract     = {Input estimation is a signal processing technique associated with deconvolution of measured signals after filtering through a known dynamic system. Kitanidis and others extended this to the simultaneous estimation of the input signal and the state of the intervening system. This is normally posed as a special least-squares estimation problem with unbiasedness. The approach has application in signal analysis and in control. Despite the connection to optimal estimation, the standard algorithms are not necessarily stable, leading to a number of recent papers which present sufficient conditions for stability. In this paper we complete these stability results in two ways in the time-invariant case: for the square case, where the number of measurements equals the number of unknown inputs, we establish exactly the location of the algorithm poles; for the non-square case, we show that the best sufficient conditions are also necessary. We then draw on our previous results interpreting these algorithms, when stable, as singular Kalman filters to advocate a direct, guaranteed stable implementation via Kalman filtering. This has the advantage of clarity and flexibility in addition to stability. En route, we decipher the existing algorithms in terms of system inversion and successive singular filtering. The stability results are extended to the time-varying case directly to recover the earlier sufficient conditions for stability via the Riccati difference equation.},

A Boolean network (BN) is well known as a mathematical model of gene regulatory networks. Each state of BNs takes a binary value (0 or 1), and its update rule is given by a set of Boolean functions. In this paper, we consider the optimal reconstruction problem of finding a probabilistic BN consisting of the main dynamics and the noisy dynamics, by giving the main dynamics and the sample mean of the state obtained from noisy experimental data. In the proposed method, the selection probability of the main dynamics is maximized. We show that the optimal Boolean function of the noisy dynamics is a constant (0 or 1) map under no assumption on the structure of noisy dynamics. Finally, as a biological application, the reconstruction of a PBN model of the lac operon networks of Escherichia coli bacterium is addressed using the proposed approach.},

Without waiting for any other node of the network, each node can locally update its value function at any time using (possibly delayed) information from its neighbors. This is in sharp contrast to the gossip-based scheme where a pair of nodes concurrently update. Even though the fully asynchronous setting involves a difficult multi-timescale decision problem, we design a novel incremental aggregated gradient (IAG) based distributed algorithm and develop a push–pull augmented graph approach to prove its exact convergence at a linear rate of O ( c k ) where c ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) and k is the total number of updates within the entire network. Finally, numerical experiments validate that our method speeds up linearly with respect to the number of nodes, and is robust to straggler nodes.},

First, both uniform and logarithmic quantization effects are analyzed. A unified control method (involving a distributed controller, a distributed event-detector, time-varying gains and constant parameters) is developed based on the relative quantized state information, which is applicable to practical scenarios where uniform and logarithmic quantization phenomena appear separately or alternately. Second, the updates of the relative information involved in the controller and the communication between adjacent agents are executed only at certain discrete event instants, significantly reducing the information update burden and data transmission load. Moreover, an internal variable, which is adjustable in accordance with the update law, is introduced in the event-detector to enhance the dynamic characteristics of the triggering performance with a lower triggering frequency. Simultaneously, the undesired Zeno behavior can be ruled out. Third, time-varying coupling gain (regulated by an adaptive rule) and triggering gain (relevant to the coupling gain) instead of constant ones are designed for the controller and the event-detector, respectively. Besides, other constant parameters can be easily tuned. These settings enable the developed control method to feature more flexibility and to be implemented in a fully distributed manner, requiring no global information. Finally, simulation examples are presented to illustrate the applicability of the theoretical results.},

The AORG is distinguished from the conventional RG by computing the Auxiliary Reference (AR) sequence so that to optimize performance over a prescribed time interval instead of only at the current time instant; this enables the integration of the AORG with fault detection schemes. In particular, it is shown that, when the AORG is combined with a Multi-Model Adaptive Estimator (MMAE), the AR sequence can be determined such that the tracking properties are guaranteed and constraints are satisfied at all times, while the detection performance is optimized, i.e., faults can be detected with a high probability of correctness. In addition a reconfiguration scheme is presented that ensures system viability despite the presence of faults based on recoverable sets. Simulations on a Boeing 747-100 aircraft model are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the AORG scheme in enforcing constraints and tracking the desired roll and side-slip angles. The effectiveness of the presented fault-tolerant control scheme in maintaining the airplane viability in the presence of damaged vertical stabilizer is also demonstrated.},

In general, the limit of the gossip process (if it converges) depends on the order of iterations of the gossiping pairs. The main contribution of the paper is to provide a necessary and sufficient condition for convergence of the gossip process that is independent of the order of iterations.

The existing distributed estimation algorithms allow each node to broadcast its explicit state information to its neighbors, which results in the disclosure of CPS’s secret state. To meet the confidentiality requirement, this paper formulates a new framework for opacity for distributed state estimation. Two opacity-enhancing algorithms are proposed against the intruder models with different eavesdropping capacities for a subset of nodes. Necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure that a secret state is opaque are established in terms of the rank of constructed structural matrices of the eavesdropped nodes. Moreover, it is shown that the use of enhancement mechanism does not compromise the estimation accuracy. The framework of opacity is further extended to the case of measurement noises.},

Recent work by Li and Mao in 2020 gave a positive answer when the delay in the given SDDE is a positive constant. It is also noted that in their paper the time lag in the feedback control is another constant. However, time delay in a real-world system is often a variable of time while it is difficult to implement the feedback control in practice if the time lag involved is a strict constant. Mathematically speaking, the stabilization problem becomes much harder if these delays are time-varying, in particular, if they are not differentiable. The aim of this paper is to tackle the stabilization problem under non-differentiable time delays. One more new feature in this paper is that the feedback control function used is bounded.},

The first result establishes that the problem is, in general, NP-hard. We then introduce the notion of eigenvalue observability and show that the state can be reconstructed in polynomial time when each eigenvalue is observable by at least 2 s + 1 sensors and at most s sensors are corrupted by an adversary. However, there is a gap between eigenvalue observability and the possibility of reconstructing the state despite attacks — this gap has been characterized in the literature by the notion of sparse observability. To better understand this, we show that when the A matrix of the linear system has unitary geometric multiplicity, the gap disappears, i.e., eigenvalue observability coincides with sparse observability, and there exists a polynomial time algorithm to reconstruct the state provided the state can be reconstructed.},

  abstract     = {We address the generalized Nash equilibrium seeking problem in a partial-decision information scenario, where each agent can only exchange information with some neighbors, although its cost function possibly depends on the strategies of all agents. The few existing methods build on projected pseudo-gradient dynamics, and require either double-layer iterations or conservative conditions on the step sizes. To overcome both these flaws and improve efficiency, we design the first fully-distributed single-layer algorithms based on proximal best-response. Our schemes are fixed-step and allow for inexact updates, which is crucial for reducing the computational complexity. Under standard assumptions on the game primitives, we establish convergence to a variational equilibrium (with linear rate for games without coupling constraints) by recasting our algorithms as proximal-point methods, opportunely preconditioned to distribute the computation among the agents. Since our analysis hinges on a restricted monotonicity property, we also provide new general results that significantly extend the domain of applicability of proximal-point methods. Besides, our operator-theoretic approach favors the implementation of provably correct acceleration schemes that can further improve the convergence speed. Finally, the potential of our algorithms is demonstrated numerically, revealing much faster convergence with respect to projected pseudo-gradient methods and validating our theoretical findings.},

While the sensor scheduling problem is NP-hard, the proposed framework circumvents this computational complexity by decomposing this problem into a convex sensor design problem and a covariance tracking problem.

The desired formation patterns are achieved by Nash equilibrium strategies in an intrinsic way in the sense that they are only attributed to the inter-agent interaction and geometric properties of the network, where the desired formations are not designated directly in the controller. The whole formation manifold of the desired relative pattern is studied by allowing all orientations of the formation and all permutations of the agents. For finite horizon games the terminal formation of Nash equilibrium trajectories is shown to converge to desired pattern as the length of the time interval tends to infinity. Furthermore the asymptotic stability of the desired formation manifold is also guaranteed in infinite horizon games. Relative patterns of regular polyhedra and antipodal formations are achieved by designing the interaction graph while inter-agent collisions are avoided.

  abstract     = {Multiple domains involve systems with abruptly changing states, that result in signals with signatures that are corrupted by noise and sensor dynamics. In many applications, prior information on the magnitudes and timing distributions are unknown, compounding the difficulty of filtering such signals. Several non-linear filtering techniques are available with varying efficacies, however only a few offer theoretical guarantees. Recent research has led to a heuristic, iterative, non-linear filtering technique that is found to be effective over a range of applications. In this article, we present this iterative algorithm that learns the distribution of the event magnitude and provides an estimate of when an event has occurred. Here, every iteration involves two stages: the first one providing an estimate of the true signal that uses a prior on the distribution of event magnitudes, followed by the second stage where a distribution of the event magnitudes is computed from an estimate of the true signal. It is shown that with every iterate, the performance of the algorithm only improves and convergence of the posterior probability is established. Our comparative tests show that our algorithm provides significant performance improvements, especially for high bandwidth applications where sensor dynamics cannot be neglected. In addition, we provide a python-based implementation of the algorithm and provide a comprehensive comparison with existing methods in practice.},

This work presents novel results in this sense that are grouped in three parts. The first one focuses on the relationships among properties as monotonicity , continuity , and deadlock-free monotonicity of the equilibrium throughput when either the firing rate or the initial marking varies. It is done in a broad class of nets called Mono-T-Semiflow nets. The second one relates previous properties with some structural objects named configurations . In particular, it is shown that for both, firing rate and initial marking variations, the occurrence of undesired behaviors (non-monotonicities, discontinuities) is due to configurations whose associated set of places does not contain the support of a P-semiflow. Finally, based on the structural characterization, sets of firing rates and initial markings for avoiding undesired behaviors are derived.},

Communication graphs of underlying multi-agent systems are directed and strongly connected but not necessarily weighted-balanced. The multi-proximal splitting is introduced to deal with the difficulty caused by the unproximable property of the summation of those nonsmooth functions. Moreover, it can also guarantee the Lipschitz continuity of proposed algorithms. Auxiliary variables in the multi-proximal splitting are designed to estimate subgradients of nonsmooth functions. Theoretically, the convergence analysis is conducted by employing Lyapunov stability theory and integral input-to-state stability (iISS) theory with respect to sets.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a remote estimation problem where multiple dynamical systems are observed by smart sensors, which transmit their local estimates to a remote estimator over channels prone to packet losses. Unlike previous works, we allow multiple sensors to transmit simultaneously even though they can cause interference, thanks to the multi-packet reception capability at the remote estimator. In this setting, the remote estimator can decode multiple sensor transmissions (successful packet arrivals) as long as their signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios (SINR) are above a certain threshold. In this setting, we address the problem of optimal sensor transmission scheduling by minimizing a finite horizon discounted expected estimation error covariance cost across all systems at the remote estimator, subject to an average transmission cost. While this problem can be posed as a stochastic control problem, the optimal solution requires solving a Bellman equation for a dynamic programming (DP) problem, the complexity of which scales exponentially with the number of systems being measured and their state dimensions. In this paper, we resort to a novel Least Squares Temporal Difference (LSTD) Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) based approach to approximating the value function. More specifically, an off-policy based LSTD approach, named in short Enhanced-Exploration Greedy LSTD (EG-LSTD), is proposed. We discuss the convergence analysis of the EG-LSTD algorithm and its implementation. A Python based program is developed to implement and analyse the different aspects of the proposed method.

To address such problem, a new distributed primal–dual algorithm is proposed for a continuous-time multi-agent system under a time-varying graph. In the proposed algorithm, two consensus strategies are employed. One is used to estimate the coupled equality constraint function, and the other one is used to estimate corresponding optimal dual variable. Furthermore, a novel Lyapunov function is constructed based on a strongly convex function to analyze convergence of the algorithm. The results show that if the time-varying graph is balanced and the union in a certain period is strongly connected, the algorithm asymptotically converges, and the convergence state is the solution to the distributed resource allocation problem.

The proposed reset control essentially provides a dynamically generated higher gain for better transient consensus performance, including faster convergence with less control effort. Compared with a static high gain controller, this dynamic high gain mechanism is more efficient and sophisticated especially in regularly resetting the additional gain to zero during the dynamic evolution.},

  abstract     = {Nonparametric kernel-based modelling of dynamical systems offers important advantages over other nonparametric techniques; the estimate is a continuous function, the model complexity is continuously tuneable, and stability, causality and smoothness are imposed on the impulse response estimate. However, for lightly damped systems, most of the existing kernel-based approaches for estimating the impulse- or frequency response function fail because classical kernels are not appropriate for describing lowly damped resonances. Smoothness is imposed on the entire frequency axis with the diagonal correlated or stable spline kernel, with as a result that resonances cannot be captured well. By introducing the superposition of different kernels, carrying prior knowledge about the resonant poles of the system, we make the kernel-based modelling of lightly-damped systems possible with high-accuracy. We use a frequency domain local rational modelling technique as preprocessing step to determine the most dominant poles, and include these as prior knowledge in the kernels. The performance of the new kernel is demonstrated on a highly resonating simulated system and compared to the state of the art nonparametric frequency domain approaches.},

In sharp contrast to the existing NAGs, each player in our Asy-NAG can compute an estimate of the aggregate action at any wall-clock time by only using (possibly stale) information from neighboring players of a directed network. Such an asynchronous update does not require any coordination among players. Moreover, we design a novel distributed algorithm with an aggressive mechanism for each player to adaptively adjust its optimization stepsize per update. Particularly, the slow players in terms of updating their estimates smartly increase their stepsizes to catch up with the fast ones. Then, we adopt an augmented network approach to address the asynchronicity and the information delays between players, and rigorously show the convergence to a Nash equilibrium of the Asy-NAG via a perturbed coordinate algorithm which is also of independent interest. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the distributed algorithm through numerical simulations.},

When it comes to computation, however, the LP approach often suffers from poor scalability. In this work, we introduce a relaxed version of the Bellman operator for q -functions and prove that it is still a monotone contraction mapping with a unique fixed point. In the spirit of the LP approach, we exploit the new operator to build a relaxed linear program (RLP). Compared to the standard LP formulation, our RLP has only one family of constraints and half the decision variables, making it more scalable and computationally efficient. For deterministic systems, the RLP trivially returns the correct q -function. For stochastic linear systems in continuous spaces, the solution to the RLP preserves the minimizer of the optimal q -function, hence retrieves the optimal policy. Theoretical results are backed up in simulation where we solve sampled versions of the LPs with data collected by interacting with the environment. For general nonlinear systems, we observe that the RLP again tends to preserve the minimizers of the solution to the LP, though the relative performance is influenced by the specific geometry of the problem.},

More specifically, by introducing a novel time-varying constraining function, the original finite-time tracking control problem is converted into one with a deferred constraint on tracking error, then by stabilizing of which, the prescribed time tracking control problem is solved with the following appealing features: 1) both the settling time and the tracking accuracy can be explicitly specified in advance regardless of initial conditions and any design parameter; 2) the control gains and the control input remain bounded and continuous everywhere; 3) the system is allowed to operate continuously even after the prescribed time; and 4) the results are global in that pre-set tracking accuracy is ensured within the predefined time for states starting from anywhere within the physically possible domain.},

To deal with the unknown system parameters while addressing the non-differentiability problem of the virtual control inputs, auxiliary systems are elaborately constructed for the agents with relative degree larger than one. Different from most of the existing results, both the system orders and the relative degree of all the agents are allowed to be nonidentical. To decrease the amount of communication, a decentralized triggering condition with time-varying triggering threshold is well designed such that continuous monitoring of neighboring states can be avoided. Besides, only the output of each agent needs be shared among neighbors, which contributes to further reduction of communication burden. It is shown that with the proposed control scheme, all the closed-loop signals are uniformly bounded and desired output consensus tracking can be achieved without Zeno behavior. Moreover, the tracking performance in the mean square sense can be improved by appropriately adjusting design parameters. Simulation results are shown to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

Contraction theory has found numerous applications in systems and control theory because there exist easy to verify sufficient conditions, based on matrix measures, guaranteeing contraction. We provide a geometric generalization of contraction theory called k -contraction. A dynamical system is called k -contractive if the dynamics contracts k -parallelotopes at an exponential rate. For k = 1 this reduces to standard contraction. We describe easy to verify sufficient conditions for k -contraction based on a matrix measure of the k th additive compound of the Jacobian of the vector field. We also describe applications of the seminal work of Muldowney and Li, that can be interpreted in the framework of 2-contraction, to systems and control theory.},

We define the robust instability radius as the smallest H ∞ norm of the stable linear perturbation that stabilizes the nominal system. There are two main theoretical results: one is on a partial characterization of unperturbed nominal systems for which the robust instability radius can be calculated exactly, and the other is a numerically tractable procedure for calculating the exact robust instability radius for nominal systems parametrized by a perturbation parameter. The results are applied to the repressilator in synthetic biology, where hyperbolic instability of a unique equilibrium guarantees the persistence of oscillation phenomena in the global sense, and the effectiveness of our linear robust instability analysis is confirmed by numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the resilient vector consensus problem in networks with adversarial agents and improve resilience guarantees of existing algorithms. A common approach to achieving resilient vector consensus is that every non-adversarial (or normal) agent in the network updates its state by moving towards a point in the convex hull of its normal neighbors’ states. Since an agent cannot distinguish between its normal and adversarial neighbors, computing such a point, often called safe point , is a challenging task. To compute a safe point, we propose to use the notion of centerpoint , which is an extension of the median in higher dimensions, instead of the Tverberg partition of points, which is often used for this purpose. We discuss that the notion of centerpoint provides a complete characterization of safe points in R d . In particular, we show that a safe point is essentially an interior centerpoint if the number of adversaries in the neighborhood of a normal agent i is less than N i d + 1 , where d is the dimension of the state vector and N i is the total number of agents in the neighborhood of i . Consequently, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions on the number of adversarial agents to guarantee resilient vector consensus. Further, by considering the complexity of computing centerpoints, we discuss improvements in the resilience guarantees of vector consensus algorithms and compare with the other existing approaches. Finally, we numerically evaluate our approach.},

  abstract     = {Consensus-based time synchronization, which is built on multi-agent consensus technique, becomes an important synchronization strategy to achieve accurate time synchronization for wireless sensor networks in a fully distributed way. In practical network scenarios, random communication delays are inevitable and have a significant influence on the information exchange procedure. Without dealing with the delays, many synchronization algorithms based on consensus will diverge and the nodes in the network will fail to synchronize with each other. A feasible approach addressing this problem is to design powerful and effective relative skew estimator to suppress the influence caused by delays. In this paper, we propose a sequential least squares algorithm to estimate the skew under delays, which improves the estimation accuracy while reducing the memory requirement. Based on the estimation algorithm and considering the case of the varying skews, we also devise an improved estimation scheme by incorporating a forgetting factor so as to track the skew evolution. By applying the proposed estimation method to average consensus protocol, each node can achieve accurate synchronization in the presence of delays. We theoretically prove the convergence of the whole scheme by using Lyapunov theory and considering strongly rooted topology condition, and provide simulations to show that our scheme outperforms existing consensus-based synchronization schemes under random delays.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we develop boundary output feedback control laws for traffic flow on two cascaded freeway segments connected by a junction. The macroscopic traffic dynamics are governed by the Aw–Rascle–Zhang (ARZ) model in which two subsystems of second-order nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) describe the evolution of traffic density and velocity on each segment. Due to the change of road access at the junction, different equilibria are considered for the two connected segments. To suppress stop-and-go traffic oscillations on the cascaded roads, we consider a ramp metering that regulates the traffic flow rate entering from the on-ramp to the mainline freeway. Different control designs are proposed such that the output feedback stabilization is realized with either the ramp metering located at the middle junction or the outlet with only boundary measurements of flow rate and velocity. The control objective is to simultaneously stabilize the upstream and downstream traffic to a given spatially-uniform constant steady-state. The distinct actuation locations motivate our design of two different delay-robust full state feedback control laws. The proposed designs are based on the PDE backstepping methodology and guarantee the exponential stability of the under-actuated network of two systems of two hyperbolic PDEs. Collocated boundary observers are proposed to construct output feedback controllers. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the control designs. Stabilization performance of the two output feedback is compared and evaluated with Proportional Integral (PI) boundary feedback controllers. Robustness to delays is also investigated.},

The plant is considered to be LTI (linear and time-invariant) and that it is parametrized by a random variable whose distribution may be unknown but can be sampled from. The objective is to design a dynamic LTI MIMO controller optimizing the closed-loop H 2 -performance. To account for the uncertainty in the plant, we employ measures of risk on the performance and discuss how coherent measures of risk are suitable to address this problem. In particular, we introduce a measure called Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) and analyze its advantages and disadvantages regarding other traditional measures of risk. A simulation study complements the discussion.},

Those stability results, in the spirit of input-to-state stability, are then applied to the case where the dynamical system is an extremum seeking system. Two scenarios are analyzed. We first consider that the uncontrolled input is a deterministic noise corrupting the cost measurement.

First, through constructing a novel attack model where adversaries make estimators track the state of a target system instead of tracking the original system state, necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of undetectable attacks are provided and an undetectable attack design strategy is proposed such that the adversary can worsen the estimation performance without being detected. Second, based on the analysis for undetectable attacks, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of unidentifiable attacks is also provided. For the adversary who cannot compromise enough channels for designing undetectable attacks, an unidentifiable attack design strategy is proposed such that secure state estimators cannot determine which channels are attacked. Different from the existing methods mainly considering undetectable attacks, investigating unidentifiable attacks shows that the adversary has the ability to affect the state estimate greatly even if secure state estimators are adopted.

Based on the dependency of transitions, we propose a structural approach to compute a monitor function using Hilbert basis , which helps us develop an algorithm to design an online supervisor using the monitor function.

Source identifiability , i.e. the ability to detect the source and uniquely identify its location and intensity, is analyzed in a system-theoretic framework by providing sufficient conditions in terms of rank tests on suitable polynomial matrices. Further, a novel finite element multiple model (FE-MM) filtering approach to source estimation is presented. The approach consists of running a bank of FE Kalman filters, each conditioned to the source being placed in a given element of the FE mesh, and then combining the estimates of such filters in order to produce estimates of the source location and intensity as well as of the diffusing field. The effectiveness of the proposed source estimation algorithm is demonstrated via simulation experiments in both cases of motionless source of unknown position and mobile source.},

A suitable change of variables followed by an averaging procedure reveals that the closed-loop system approximates the behavior of an averaged system. The disturbances in the averaged system are directly linked to the disturbances in the closed-loop system. This allows us to conclude stability and robustness properties of closed-loop system from respective properties of the averaged system. In particular, we show that, if the averaged system tolerates L ∞ -disturbances of a certain magnitude, then the same is true for the approximating closed-loop system. Another feature of the proposed method is that it steers the closed-loop system approximately into descent directions of an averaged objective function. This property can be beneficial for the purpose of global optimization because an averaged objective function is expected to have fewer undesired critical points than the original objective function.},

This paper presents a countermeasure based on single-dimensional encryption to defend against stealthy attacks. Instead of encrypting one entry of the original measurements, a linear or nonlinear transformation of them is encrypted in order to enhance the security level of the system. It is proved that for most systems, single-dimensional encryption can completely resist innovation-based stealthy attacks. For other special cases, the worst-case constrained attack that yields the greatest estimation error is analyzed. Accordingly, a suboptimal encryption strategy can reduce the influence of attacks effectively. In addition, a new type of innovation-based stealthy attack is proposed. This attack model does not require the calculation of the nominal innovation and can usually lead to greater estimation errors. The worst-case attack for this model is derived analytically. The effectiveness of single-dimensional encryption against the proposed attack is also analyzed. For the above two innovation-based stealthy attacks, the proposed single-dimensional encryption scheme provides an effective defense.},

A connected digraph is used to describe the IS. The edges in the graph represent the network connection between the subsystems. Assume that the subsystem information travels across an edge in the graph with random delays. To design the controller gains off-line, the communication outcomes are random and unknown for all subsystems. Thus, the ODLCP is defined under the framework of randomized information pattern. In general, it is difficult to find the global optimal solution to the ODLCP with randomized information pattern, due to the random sparse structure constraints. In this paper, a new information set composed of noise history is found to design the controller without losing optimality. Using the property of the information set we found, the random sparse structure constraints are treated by the Hadamard product. Then, the system state and the control input can be decomposed into independent components. Based on the decomposition results, an optimal controller in the mean sense is designed for the ODLCP with randomized information pattern by solving algebraic Riccati equation and linear matrix equations. The proposed theoretical results are demonstrated by a numerical example.},

Moreover, it is assumed that the players have no access to the explicit functional form but only the function value of their local costs. To solve the problem, a discrete-time gradient-free Nash equilibrium seeking strategy, based on the gradient tracking method, is proposed. Specifically, a gradient estimator is developed locally based on Gaussian smoothing to estimate the partial gradients, and a gradient tracker is constructed locally to trace the average sum of the partial gradients among the players within the coalition. With a sufficiently small constant step-size, we show that all players’ actions approximately converge to the Nash equilibrium at a geometric rate under a strongly monotone game mapping condition.

Active elements are necessary to design physical circuits that switch and oscillate. We generalize the classical passivity theory of circuit analysis to develop a port interconnection theory for such non-equilibrium behaviors. The approach closely mimics the classical methodology of (incremental) dissipativity theory, but with dissipation inequalities that combine signed storage functions and signed supply rates to account for the port interconnection of passive and active elements.},

First, the introduction of a data packet processor enables us to calculate both network-induced delays and the number of consecutive malicious packet dropouts explicitly . Second, a novel Lyapunov functional is constructed, whose forward difference along with the trajectory of the closed-loop system is estimated as a quartic polynomial . A class of necessary and sufficient conditions on such an inequality are established by using the Finsler lemma. By employing the Lyapunov method, a bounded real condition is formulated, which depends on the upper bound of network-induced delays and the maximum number of consecutive malicious packet dropouts. Therefore, their effects on H ∞ performance can be investigated simultaneously. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is shown through an inverted pendulum system.},

  abstract     = {Zeroth-order optimization (ZO) algorithms have been recently used to solve black-box or simulation-based learning and control problems, where the gradient of the objective function cannot be easily computed but can be approximated using the objective function values. Many existing ZO algorithms adopt two-point feedback schemes due to their fast convergence rate compared to one-point feedback schemes. However, two-point schemes require two evaluations of the objective function at each iteration, which can be impractical in applications where the data are not all available a priori, e.g., in online optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel one-point feedback scheme that queries the function value once at each iteration and estimates the gradient using the residual between two consecutive points. When optimizing a deterministic Lipschitz function, we show that the query complexity of ZO with the proposed one-point residual feedback matches that of ZO with the existing two-point schemes. Moreover, the query complexity of the proposed algorithm can be improved when the objective function has Lipschitz gradient. Then, for stochastic bandit optimization problems where only noisy objective function values are given, we show that ZO with one-point residual feedback achieves the same convergence rate as that of two-point scheme with uncontrollable data samples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed one-point residual feedback via extensive numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the problem of steering the aggregative behavior of a population of noncooperative price-taking agents towards a desired behavior. Different from conventional pricing schemes where the price is fully available for design, we consider the scenario where a system regulator broadcasts a price prediction signal that can be different from the actual price incurred by the agents. The resulting reliability issues are taken into account by including trust dynamics in our model, implying that the agents will not blindly follow the signal sent by the regulator, but rather follow it based on the history of its accuracy, i.e, its deviation from the actual price. We present several nudge mechanisms to generate suitable price prediction signals that are able to steer the aggregative behavior of the agents to stationary as well as temporal desired aggregative behaviors. We provide analytical convergence guarantees for the resulting multi-components models. In particular, we prove that the proposed nudge mechanisms earn and maintain full trust of the agents, and the aggregative behavior converges to the desired one. The analytical results are complemented by a numerical case study of coordinated charging of plug-in electric vehicles.},

We characterize this property for the discrete-time Toeplitz and Hankel operators of finite-dimensional causal systems. Our main result is that these operators have a dominant approximation in the form of series or parallel interconnections of k first order positive systems. This is shown by expressing the k -positivity of a LTI system as the external positivity (that is, 1-positivity) of k compound LTI systems . Our characterization generalizes well known properties of externally positive systems ( k = 1 ) and totally positive systems ( k = ∞ ; also known as relaxation systems in case of the Hankel operator). All results readily extend to continuous-time systems by considering sampled impulse responses.},

  abstract     = {Coordinated mission rendezvous is the most fundamental and crucial issue in the application of cooperative search and rescue, forest fire fighting, and target hunting even tactical simulation and drill. The biggest challenge is how to schedule the limited resource to carry out cooperative mission rendezvous against uncertain targets with unknown external inputs and heterogeneous system dynamics. Three fundamental challenges are addressed: (1) how to accurately estimate the motion trajectory of an uncertain target; (2) how to design a pre-action mission rendezvous framework to create the rendezvous region; and (3) how to enhance the difficulty of interception but improve the accuracy of rendezvous. To do this, this paper first proposes a time-varying observer design for synchronization with an uncertain target over a dual design framework. By introducing proper assumptions, a novel condition of dwell time of switching communication topologies can be constructed, from which a synchronization algorithm is developed to achieve the cooperative behaviors between the trackers and distributed observers such that they eventually synchronize to their target signal. With the application of multi-missile systems, the time-varying formation techniques will be further developed for an uncertain mission rendezvoustarget. Specifically, this paper proposes a novel multi-stage cooperative mission rendezvous strategy that includes preparation and execution phases. In the preparation stage, the trackers will maintain a specified altitude to pre-construct the mission rendezvous region. In the execution stage, the trackers are in time-varying formation attitudes to approach the uncertain target over time-varying observers to accomplish the cooperative mission rendezvous. Specifically, the cases of chattering reduction and synchronization for general heterogeneous systems are discussed, respectively. At last, two simulations with uncertain moving targets, i.e., the ground vehicle and robotic with unknown input signals, are presented to demonstrate the proposed theories and chattering-free controllers.},

This paper shows how the approach can be used further on for solving interpolation, extrapolation, and smoothing problems. The solution proposed and the resulting method are general – can deal simultaneously with missing, exact, and noisy data of multivariable systems – and simple—require only the solution of a linear system of equations. In the case of exact data, we provide conditions for existence and uniqueness of solution. In the case of noisy data, we propose an approximation procedure based on ℓ 1 -norm regularization and validate its performance on real-life datasets. The results have application in missing data estimation and trajectory planning.

  abstract     = {Deep learning (DL) has achieved great success in many applications, but it has been less well analyzed from the theoretical perspective. The unexplainable success of black-box DL models has raised questions among scientists and promoted the emergence of the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). In robotics, it is particularly important to deploy DL algorithms in a predictable and stable manner as robots are active agents that need to interact safely with the physical world. This paper presents an analytic deep learning framework for fully connected neural networks, which can be applied for both regression problems and classification problems. Examples for regression and classification problems include online robot control and robot vision. We present two layer-wise learning algorithms such that the convergence of the learning systems can be analyzed. Firstly, an inverse layer-wise learning algorithm for multilayer networks with convergence analysis for each layer is presented to understand the problems of layer-wise deep learning. Secondly, a forward progressive learning algorithm where the deep networks are built progressively by using single hidden layer networks is developed to achieve better accuracy. It is shown that the progressive learning method can be used for fine-tuning of weights from convergence point of view. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is illustrated based on classical benchmark recognition tasks using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets and the results show a good balance between performance and explainability. The proposed method is subsequently applied for online learning of robot kinematics and experimental results on kinematic control of UR5e robot with unknown model are presented.},

We model the sensor delay as a transport partial differential equation (PDE) and build upon the cascade ODE–PDE setting while accounting for the infinite dimensionality of the sensor. To construct our time-varying gains, the observer design needs to be conducted in a particular system representation. For this reason, we employ a sequence of state transformations (and their inverses) mapping the original observer error model into (1) the observer form, (2) a sensor delay-compensated observer error form via backstepping, and (3) a particular diagonal form that is amenable to the selection of time-varying gains for prescribed-time stabilization. Our construction of the time-varying observer gains uses (a) generalized Laguerre polynomials, (b) elementary symmetric polynomials, and (c) polynomial-based Vandermonde matrices. A simulation illustrates the results.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the distributed filtering issue under the Cauchy-kernel-based maximum correntropy for large-scale systems subject to randomly occurring cyber-attacks in non-Gaussian environments. The considered cyber-attacks are hybrid and consist of both denial-of-service attacks and deception attacks. The weighted Cauchy kernel-based maximum correntropy criterion instead of the traditional minimum variance is put forward to evaluate the filtering performance against non-Gaussian noises as well as cyber-attacks. Based on the matrix decomposition and the fixed-point iterative update rules, the desired filter gain related with a set of Riccati-type equations is obtained to achieve the optimal filtering performance. Then, an improved version only dependent on the local information and neighboring one-step prediction is developed to realize the distributed implementation. Furthermore, the convergence of the developed fixed-point iterative algorithm is addressed via the famous Banach fixed-point theorem. Finally, a standard IEEE 39-bus power system is utilized to show the merit of the proposed distributed filtering algorithm in the presence of cyber-attacks and non-Gaussian noises.},

This problem set-up arises in the context of social networks and opinion dynamics, where reaching a consensus means that the opinions of the agents in the same cluster converge to the same decision, that is typically different for the different clusters. Under the assumption that agents belonging to the same cluster have the same amount of trust (/distrust) to be distributed among their cooperators (/adversaries), we propose a modified version of DeGroot’s law. By simply constraining how much agents in each group should be conservative about their own opinions, it is possible to achieve a nontrivial solution by means of a distributed algorithm. The result is then particularized to unweighted complete communication graphs, and subsequently extended to a class of nonlinear multi-agent systems.},

Then, based on Krein space projection and innovation analysis, sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of desired filter are derived and a feasible solution is obtained in terms of Riccati recursions. Thus, an algorithm based on the time-update and event-update recursions is given for the implementation of event-triggered H ∞ filtering. Different from some existing results, a new event-triggered H ∞ filtering scheme is provided so that the estimation error can be completely decoupled from the event-triggered transmission error. Moreover, the new proposed Krein space approach is less conservative and more computational attractive than the existing methods based on recursive linear inequality matrix.

The new proposed model is here named as the accelerating noise-tolerant zeroing neural network (ANTZNN) model since its fixed convergence time can be shorter than that of the NNTZNN model in certain model parameter ranges. These parameter ranges and the convergence of the ANTZNN model are theoretically analyzed in detail. Numerical experiments are performed to confirm the theoretical results, including the numerical comparisons with the known NNTZNN model under different parameter settings.

In particular, the velocities and positions can be estimated by the proposed method. Since the proper fractional integrals of accelerations can be estimated using a numerical method, the main task of this work is to estimate unknown initial conditions. For this purpose, the generalized modulating functions method is adopted, which is recently developed to design non-asymptotic and robust fractional order differentiators. By distinguishing the cases where the stiffness matrix is invertible or not, algebraic integral formulas are provided for the unknown initial conditions in different situations. Hence, the unknowns can also be estimated even if the stiffness matrix is not invertible. Finally, the efficiency and robustness of the proposed estimators are verified by taking several numerical examples.},

It benefits not only from a monotone property of transition systems but also from the ordered structure of the state (input) space and the fact that directed safety specifications are considered. To enrich the class of the considered specifications, we also present an incremental controller synthesis framework, which allows us to deal with intersections of upper and lower-closed safety requirements.

With appropriately chosen monitoring signals, it is shown that the scale-free hysteresis switching mechanism is capable of selecting the estimator which “best” emulates the plant, even if the decay rates of the estimation errors are non-exponential. Then, the proposed methodology is validated by means of a subclass of nonlinear uncertain systems in the strict-feedback form, for which novel constructive designs of the estimators and the corresponding control laws are proposed to solve the supervisory control problem. An extension to the case of parameter mismatch shows that practical convergence is guaranteed by means of the same supervisory control structure and a modified design of monitoring signals.

Specifically, for the case without noise, the square convergence rate is proved to be close to O 1 k 2 with respect to the time step k . For the case with bounded noises, the upper bound of the estimation error is obtained, which depends on the bound of the noises and the lower bound of the input persistent excitation condition. For the case with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) stochastic noises, the estimate is shown to converge to the true parameter in the sense of mean square and almost surely.

The core idea of the proposed scheme is to characterize the influence of cooperation and competition between agents through positive and negative weight functions with respect to the interaction distance, respectively. Based on the tool of infinite products of super-stochastic matrices, we establish mathematical inequalities about the intensities of cooperation and competition, and further obtain the algebraic conditions that depend on factors such as the initial states of agents, topological structure and weight functions. Moreover, we also discuss the influence of these factors on the least exponential convergence rate and the final position errors among agents. The obtained theoretical results are illustrated through simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new method for systems identification from relay feedback test. As a difference with most of the existing methods, which are based on the describing function technique, our proposal considers a more precise approach that allows to improve the estimation results. Furthermore, the method has also the advantage of being easy to implement, which makes it to stand out among other methods that require introducing additional elements on the loop or extend the experiment duration. The validity of the proposed method has been proved using a batch of models that represent the most common dynamic behaviors of actual industrial processes. The study reveals that with the new proposal, using data from a simple relay experiment, the error in the estimation for some kind of systems can be considerably reduced with respect to previous approaches.},

By adopting dynamic programming, duality theory, and a comparison approach, we manage to derive a semi-closed form solution of the optimal dynamic investment policy with the boundaries of buying, no-transaction, selling, and liquidation regions. Numerically, we illustrate the properties of the optimal policy by depicting the corresponding efficient frontiers under different rates of transaction costs and initial wealth allocations. We find that the efficient frontier is distorted due to the transaction cost incurred. We also examine how the width of the no-transaction region varies with different transaction cost rates. Empirically, we show that our transaction-cost-aware policy outperforms the transaction-cost-unaware policy in a realistic trading environment that incurs transaction costs},

The main contributions include a globally optimal distributed formation control law and a comprehensive analysis of the resulting closed-loop system under those hard constraints. It is revealed that the energy levels, the task termination time, the steady-state error tolerance, as well as the network topology impose inherent limitations in achieving the formation control mission. Most notably, the lower bounds on the achievable termination time and the required minimum energy levels are derived, which are given in terms of the initial formation error, the steady-state error tolerance, and the largest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix. These lower bounds can be employed to assert whether an energy and time constrained formation task is achievable and how to accomplish such a task. Furthermore, the monotonicity of those lower bounds in relation to the control parameters is revealed.},

Using regularisation and averaging theory, it is proven that under milder conditions for the control gains, the trajectories of the periodically perturbed closed-loop system converge to a stable limit cycle of the same period containing the origin. Additionally, guidelines for selecting the controller gains are provided based on bounds of the closed-loop system states. Finally, the theoretical findings are validated through simulations.},

To solve this problem, we first parameterize the delay in terms of piecewise-quadratic basis functions, thus yielding a finite-dimensional approximate problem with continuous-time inequality constraints induced by the delay bounds. We then exploit the quadratic structure of the delay to convert these continuous-time constraints into a finite set of canonical point constraints. We also develop an efficient numerical method for computing the gradients of the system cost function. This method, which involves integrating an auxiliary impulsive system with time-varying advance backwards in time, can be combined with any existing gradient-based optimization algorithm to generate approximate solutions for the optimal control problem.},

To solve this problem, the existence condition of a similarity-enforcing supervisor under full observation is extended to the case of partial observation. We provide a method to synthesize a similarity-enforcing supervisor when the existence condition holds.

  abstract     = {We consider the tracking problem for an uncertain nonlinear single-input-single-output system satisfying the minimum-phase assumption, preceded by an unknown hysteresis operator. This is a widely used model for smart material-actuated systems, such as piezo-based nanopositioning systems. Existing hysteresis compensation methods typically require explicit hysteresis models, which tend to be high-dimensional operators and entail significant complexity in model identification and inversion. We propose an output feedback-based hysteresis compensation approach for this class of systems using dynamic inversion and extended high-gain observers. With mild assumptions on the hysteresis nonlinearity properties, the system can be represented as an uncertain, nonaffine, nonlinear system containing a hysteretic perturbation. Dynamic inversion is used to deal with the nonaffine input, uncertainties, and the hysteretic perturbation, where the latter two are estimated using an extended high-gain observer. Analysis of the closed-loop system under output feedback shows that the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood near the origin, which can be made arbitrarily small via a proper choice of time-scale parameters of dynamic inversion and the observer, respectively. Simulation results are presented to show the interplay between these two parameters. Finally, experiments conducted on a commercial nanopositioner confirm the theoretical analysis and demonstrate that the proposed method delivers performance comparable to several competing methods, all of which require an explicit hysteresis inversion operator.},

The optimal trajectory planning problem of constructing minimum-time trajectories for a Dubins car in the presence of a priory known time-dependent wind vector field is a special case of the presented problem. Using the properties of the three-dimensional reachable set of a Dubins car, it is proved that the optimal interception point belongs to a part of an analytically described surface in the three-dimensional space. The analytical description of the surface makes it possible to obtain 10 algebraic equations for calculating parameters of the optimal control that implements the minimum-time lateral interception. These equations are generally transcendental and can be simplified for particular cases of target motion (e.g. resting target, straight-line uniform target motion). Finally, some particular cases of optimal lateral interception validate developments of the paper and highlight the necessity to consider each of 10 algebraic equations in general case.},

The channel states are characterized by the finite Markov states, enabling the computation of the corresponding transition probability matrix. As the number of Markov states increases exponentially with respect to the delay bound, the reduced channel states are proposed and studied to ease the complexity issue in the controller design. The linear quadratic Gaussian control problem is then studied for the NCS in which random delays and packet drops exist at both the plant input and output. The controller design problem is converted into state feedback control and state estimation for the augmented system of the plant and channel models. Under the framework of Markovian jump linear systems, the optimal control laws, which are non-causal, are obtained, implemented by transmitting multiple control data in a single packet. An optimal jump linear estimator that has a recursive form is also derived.

We consider the heat equation under boundary actuation and point (either in-domain or boundary) measurement. In order to manage with point measurement, we employ dynamic extension and prove H 1 -stability. Due to dynamic extension, which leads to proportional–integral controller, we suggest a sampled-data implementation of the controller via a generalized hold device. We take into account the quantization effect that leads to a disturbed closed-loop system and input-to-state stability (ISS) analysis. We use Wirtinger-based piecewise continuous in time Lyapunov functionals which compensate sampling in the finite-dimensional state and lead to the simplest efficient stability conditions for ODEs. To compensate sampling in the infinite-dimensional tail, we introduce a novel form of Halanay’s inequality for ISS, which is appropriate for functions with jump discontinuities that do not grow in the jumps. Numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency of our method.},

We consider gradient-based ES of static maps in the case of one and two variables, and we study two ES methods: the classical one and a more recent bounded ES method. By transforming the ES dynamics into a time-delay system where the delay is the period of averaging, we derive the practical stability conditions for the resulting time-delay system. The time-delay system stability guarantees the stability of the original ES plant. Under assumption of some known bounds on the extremum point, the extremum value and the Hessian, the time-delay approach provides a quantitative calculation on the lower bound of the frequency and on the upper bound of the resulting ultimate bound. We also give a bound on the neighborhood of the extremum point starting from which the solution is ultimately bounded. When the extremum value is unknown, we provide, for the first time, the asymptotic ultimate bound in terms of the frequency in the case of bounded ES. Moreover, our explicit bound on the seeking error of ES control systems allows to select appropriate tuning parameters (such as dither frequency, magnitude, and control gain). Two numerical examples illustrate the efficiency of our method. Particularly, our quantitative bounds are more efficient for the classical ES than for the bounded one. However, the latter bounds correspond to a more general case with unknown extremum value.},

Based on the corresponding bounded real lemma, a state feedback control with a prescribed H ∞ performance index for the underlying systems is proposed. Finally, numerical examples are provided to show effectiveness of the given results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the N -step model predictive control problem is investigated for a class of networked control systems with limited communication capacity. By resorting to the dynamic uniform quantization method, a novel observer-based endec-decoder is put forward in order to accommodate the digital transmission requirement. In this sense, the state reconstructed by the observer is coded into certain codewords and then transmitted to the controller via a bandwidth-limited network. The aim of the problem addressed is to co-design the observer-based endec-decoder and the N -step model predictive controller such that the underlying system is detectable and asymptotically stable. By solving certain offline “min-max” optimization problems with matrix inequality constraints, a series of one step sets and the terminal constraint set are derived as well as the desired offline controller parameters. Then, in order to improve the convergence speed of the closed-loop system, a recursive algorithm is developed to design the online controller based on the results obtained from the offline optimization problems. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {It has been shown that satisfying state and control constraints while optimizing quadratic costs subject to desired (sets of) state convergence for affine control systems can be reduced to a sequence of quadratic programs (QPs) by using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs). One of the main challenges in this approach is ensuring the feasibility of these QPs, especially under tight control bounds and safety constraints of high relative degree. The main contribution of this paper is to provide sufficient conditions for guaranteed feasibility. The sufficient conditions are captured by a single constraint that is enforced by a CBF, which is added to the QPs such that their feasibility is always guaranteed. The additional constraint is designed to be always compatible with the existing constraints, therefore, it cannot make a feasible set of constraints infeasible — it can only increase the overall feasibility. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on an adaptive cruise control problem.},

Under this framework, the delayed input can be captured in the stability estimate by augmenting it as a state with initial conditions. Then by applying the novel framework, we consider the stabilization problems of linear systems with distributed unbounded input delays via the so-called predictor feedback controllers. Both time-invariant and time-varying cases are considered. It is shown that under the new framework, the previous works on low-gain based truncated predictor feedback controllers can be improved by removing an implicit assumption on initial conditions. It is also shown that the predictor feedback controllers can exponentially stabilize both time-invariant and time-varying linear systems with distributed unbounded input delays. Several examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the predictor feedback controllers.},

The control problem is described as minimization of a weighted sum of the terminal time and the L 0 norm of multi-input control for a linear time-invariant dynamical system, with state and control constraints. In particular, we treat the constraint on the number of actuations at each time, which is described as an ℓ 0 norm constraint. Since the L 0 / ℓ 0 optimization problem is highly non-convex, we propose to solve a convex relaxation using L 1 and ℓ 1 norms. We give sufficient conditions for the equivalence between the original L 0 / ℓ 0 problem and the relaxed L 1 / ℓ 1 problem. Based on the relaxation, we also propose a numerical computation method for the L 1 / ℓ 1 problem by sequential linear programming.

An entirely different algebraic approach is presented that offers new, inspiring insights into the problem. The approach is based on the properties of the invariant factors of a product of two proper rational matrices. A complete and explicit solution to the problem is established for linear multivariable systems described by quadruples ( A , B , C , D ). The system is first brought to Morse normal form so that one can identify the structural invariants and construct a state-feedback realizable compensator that assigns the prespecified infinite zero orders, then one returns to the original coordinates. The solvability condition, necessary and sufficient, is stated by using the system’s structural invariants; the use of conjugate lists of invariants is avoided. In addition to determining all infinite zero orders that can be assigned, the most important result of the new approach is a characterization of the structural properties of all compensators achieving every single assignable list of infinite zero orders. It turns out that this is a combinatorial problem. The solution set has the structure of a lattice of lists of nonnegative integers with a given sum, partially ordered by majorization.},

A systematic solution is presented for additive time-varying actuator, process and sensor faults in the presence of disturbances. The faults and disturbances are represented by the solutions of finite-dimensional ODEs, which allow to take a large class of signals into account. For disturbances, that are only bounded, a threshold for secured fault diagnosis is derived. By applying integral transformations to the system an algebraic fault detection equation to detect faults in finite time is obtained. The corresponding integral kernels result from the realization of a finite-time transition between a non-equilibrium initial state and a vanishing final state of a hyperbolic ODE–PDE system. For this new challenging problem, a systematic trajectory planning approach is presented. In particular, this problem is facilitated by mapping the kernel equations into backstepping coordinates and tracing the solution of the transition problem back to a simple trajectory planning. The fault diagnosis for a 4 × 4 heterodirectional hyperbolic system coupled with a second order ODE demonstrates the results of the paper.},

First, for all agents whose state matrix has no eigenvalues with positive real parts, a communication-delay-related observer, which is used to construct the controller, is designed for followers to estimate the leader’s state information. Second, by means of the output regulation theory, the results are relaxed to the case that only the leader’s state matrix needs to be asymptotically stable or marginally stable and, under these relaxed conditions, the controller is redesigned. Both cases lead to a closed-loop error system of which the stability is guaranteed via a Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional with sufficient conditions in terms of input-delay-dependent linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). An extended LMI is proposed which, in conjunction with the rest of LMIs, results in a solution with a larger upper bound on delays than what would be feasible without it. It is highlighted that the integration of communication-delay-related observer and input-delay-related LMI to construct a fully distributed controller (which requires no global information) is scalable to arbitrarily large networks. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is demonstrated via an illustrative numerical example.},

  abstract     = {A positive semidefinite Toeplitz matrix, which often arises as the finite covariance matrix of a stationary random process, can be decomposed as the sum of a nonnegative multiple of the identity corresponding to a white noise, and a singular term corresponding to a purely deterministic process. Moreover, the singular nonnegative Toeplitz matrix admits a unique characterization in terms of spectral lines which are associated to an oscillatory signal. This is the content of the famous Carathéodory–Fejér theorem. Its importance lies in the practice of extracting the signal component from noise, providing insights in modeling, filtering, and estimation. The multivariate counterpart of the theorem concerning block-Toeplitz matrices is less well understood, and in this paper, we aim to partially address this issue. To this end, we first establish an existence result of the line spectrum representation for a finite covariance multisequence of some underlying random vector field. Then, we give a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of the representation, which indeed holds true in the special case of bivariate time series. Equivalently, we obtain the Vandermonde decomposition for positive semidefinite block-Toeplitz matrices with 2 × 2 blocks. The theory is applied to the problem of frequency estimation with two measurement channels within the recently developed framework of atomic norm minimization. It is shown that exact frequency recovery can be guaranteed in the noiseless case under suitable conditions, while in the noisy case, extensive numerical simulations are performed showing that the method performs well in a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces distributed adaptive algorithms for optimal step size selection in a distributed constrained optimization problem that involves stochastic target variations and noisy observations. The limit behavior of the step size sequences reflects fundamental impact that must be balanced between tracking the target changes and attenuating observation noises. Algorithms for simultaneously estimating target variation, tracking the global optimal solution, and finding the optimal step size are derived, which are shown to achieve convergence on all the sequences simultaneously to their respective optimal values.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we deal with decision-coupled problems involving multiple agents over a network. Each agent has its own local objective function and local constraints, and all agents aim at finding the value of a common decision vector that minimizes the sum of all agents’ cost functions and satisfies all local constraints. To this purpose, we introduce a Proximal-Tracking distributed optimization algorithm that integrates dynamic average consensus within the proximal minimization method. Convergence to an optimal consensus solution is guaranteed for any value of a constant penalty parameter, under a convexity assumption only, without requiring differentiability, Lipschitz continuity, or smoothness of the local objective functions. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Abnormality localization for industrial processes described by distributed parameter systems (DPSs) is vital but seldom studied to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, a systematic framework is proposed to address this problem for a class of linear parabolic DPSs using a limited number of in-domain measurements plus one boundary measurement rather than the full-state measurement. The proposed methodology consists of an abnormality detection filter (ADF) and an abnormality localization filter (ALF) design based on the backstepping techniques and eigenspectrum. For the detection purpose, the residual is evaluated in a lumped manner; For the localization purpose, a distributed residual is first constructed and then evaluated in a distributed manner. Numerical simulations on a heat transfer rod are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the backstepping state feedback control of coupled linear parabolic PDEs with spatially varying coefficients and bilateral actuation. By making use of the folding technique, a system representation with unilateral actuation is obtained, allowing to apply the standard backstepping transformation. To ensure the regularity of the solution, the folded system is subject to unusual folding boundary conditions, which lead to additional boundary couplings between the PDEs. Therefore, the solution of the corresponding kernel equations determining the transformations is a very challenging problem. A systematic approach to derive the corresponding integral equations is proposed, allowing to solve them with the method of successive approximations. By making use of a Volterra and a Volterra–Fredholm transformation, the closed-loop system is mapped into a cascade of stable parabolic systems. This allows a simple proof of exponential stability in the L 2 -norm with the decay rate as design parameter. The bilateral state feedback stabilization of an unstable system of two coupled parabolic PDEs and the comparison to the application of an unilateral controller demonstrates the results of the paper.},

  abstract     = {We consider stochastic dynamic programming problems with high-dimensional, discrete state-spaces and finite, discrete-time horizons that prohibit direct computation of the value function from a given Bellman equation for all states and time steps due to the “curse of dimensionality”. For the case where the value function of the dynamic program is concave extensible and submodular in its state-space, we present a new algorithm that computes deterministic upper and stochastic lower bounds of the value function in the realm of dual dynamic programming. We show that the proposed algorithm terminates after a finite number of iterations. Furthermore, we derive probabilistic guarantees on the value accumulated under the associated policy for a single realisation of the dynamic program and for the expectation of this value. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a high-dimensional numerical example from delivery slot pricing in attended home delivery.},
