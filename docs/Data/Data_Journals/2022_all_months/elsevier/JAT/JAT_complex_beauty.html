We consider the least m -term deviation σm(x) of an element x∈H : this is the distance from x to the set of all m -term linear combinations of elements of D . We prove a dichotomy result: for any dictionary D , either the sequence {σm(x)}m=0∞ decreases exponentially for every x∈H , or the rate of convergence σm(x)→0 can be arbitrarily slow. We seek universal dictionaries realizing all strictly decreasing null sequences as sequences of m -term deviations. All commonly used dictionaries turn out not to be universal. In particular, the least rational deviations in Hardy space H2 do not form certain strictly monotone null sequences. There are no universal dictionaries in finite dimensional Hilbert spaces . We construct a universal dictionary in every infinite dimensional Hilbert space .},

We argue that for nearly uniform meshes the compact cubic approach offers some potential advantages, and offers a simple way to treat the edge conditions, relieving the user of the burden of deciding to use one of the three standard options: free (natural), complete (clamped), or “not-a-knot” conditions. Finally, we establish that the matrices defining the compact cubic splines (equivalently, the fourth-order compact finite difference formulæ) are totally nonnegative, if all mesh widths are the same sign, for instance if the mesh is real and nodes are numbered in increasing order.},

Simple sufficient geometric conditions that imply the existence of the interpolant are derived in general. They require data points to be convex in a certain discrete sense. Since the geometric interpolation is based precisely on the known data only, one may consider it as the parametric counterpart to the polynomial function interpolation. The established result confirms the Höllig–Koch conjecture on the existence and the approximation order in the planar case for parametric polynomial curves of any degree stated quite a while ago.},

The corresponding Jacobi–Sobolev differential operator of order 4 α + 10 4α+10 is appropriately defined by four elementary terms reflecting the influence of the point masses. Moreover, we prove that the new operator is symmetric with respect to the Sobolev inner product.

  abstract     = {We solve the pointwise Landau–Kolmogorov problem on the interval I = [ − 1 , 1 ] I=[−1,1] on finding | f ( k ) ( t ) | → sup |f(k)(t)|→sup under constraints ‖ f ‖ 2 ⩽ 1 ‖f‖2⩽1 and ‖ f ( n ) ‖ 2 ⩽ σ ‖f(n)‖2⩽σ , where t ∈ I t∈I and σ &gt; 0 σ&amp;gt;0 are fixed. For n = 1 n=1 and n = 2 n=2 , we solve the uniform version of the Landau–Kolmogorov problem on the interval I I in the Taikov case by proving the Karlin-type conjecture sup t ∈ I | f ( k ) ( t ) | = | f ( k ) ( 1 ) | supt∈I|f(k)(t)|=|f(k)(1)| under above constraints. The proof relies on the analysis of the dependence of the norm of the solution to higher-order Sturm–Liouville equation ( − 1 ) n u ( 2 n ) + λ u = − λ f (−1)nu(2n)+λu=−λf with boundary conditions u ( s ) ( − 1 ) = u ( s ) ( 1 ) = 0 u(s)(−1)=u(s)(1)=0 , s = 0 , 1 , … , n − 1 s=0,1,…,n−1 , on non-negative parameter λ λ , where f f is some piece-wise polynomial function .

Our focus will be on the behavior of the best m m -term trigonometric approximation as well as the decay of Kolmogorov and entropy numbers in the uniform norm. It turns out that these quantities share a few fundamental abstract properties like their behavior under real interpolation, such that they can be treated simultaneously. We start with proving estimates on finite rank convolution operators with range in a step hyperbolic cross. These results imply bounds for the corresponding function space embeddings by a well-known decomposition technique. The decay of Kolmogorov numbers have direct implications for the problem of sampling recovery in L 2 L2 in situations where recent results in the literature are not applicable since the corresponding approximation numbers are not square summable.},

  abstract     = {Choosing models from a hypothesis space is a frequent task in approximation theory and inverse problems. Cross-validation is a classical tool in the learner’s repertoire to compare the goodness of fit for different reconstruction models. Much work has been dedicated to computing this quantity in a fast manner but tackling its theoretical properties occurs to be difficult. So far, most optimality results are stated in an asymptotic fashion. In this paper we propose a concentration inequality on the difference of cross-validation score and the risk functional with respect to the squared error. This gives a pre-asymptotic bound which holds with high probability . For the assumptions we rely on bounds on the uniform error of the model which allow for a broadly applicable framework. We support our claims by applying this machinery to Shepard’s model, where we are able to determine precise constants of the concentration inequality. Numerical experiments in combination with fast algorithms indicate the applicability of our results.},

This is a well-studied topic in the literature but some of the published results appear to be discordant. To address this issue we provide an in-depth investigation of the case b = 0 b=0 , which is most relevant for our applications. Our approach is based on a new and surprisingly simple representation of P n ( a n + α , β ) ( 1 − 2 λ 2 ) , a &gt; − 1 Pn(an+α,β)(1−2λ2),a&amp;gt;−1 in terms of two integrals. The integrals’ asymptotic behavior is studied using standard tools of asymptotic analysis: one is a Laplace integral and the other is treated via the method of stationary phase. As a consequence we prove that if a ∈ ( 2 λ 1 − λ , ∞ ) a∈(2λ1−λ,∞) then λ a n P n ( a n + α , β ) ( 1 − 2 λ 2 ) λanPn(an+α,β)(1−2λ2) shows exponential decay and we derive simple exponential upper bounds in this region. If a ∈ ( − 2 λ 1 + λ , 2 λ 1 − λ ) a∈(−2λ1+λ,2λ1−λ) then the decay of λ a n P n ( a n + α , β ) ( 1 − 2 λ 2 ) λanPn(an+α,β)(1−2λ2) is O ( n − 1 / 2 ) O(n−1/2) and if a ∈ { − 2 λ 1 + λ , 2 λ 1 − λ } a∈{−2λ1+λ,2λ1−λ} then λ a n P n ( a n + α , β ) ( 1 − 2 λ 2 ) λanPn(an+α,β)(1−2λ2) decays as O ( n − 1 / 3 ) O(n−1/3) . A new phenomenon occurs in the parameter range a ∈ ( − 1 , − 2 λ 1 + λ ) a∈(−1,−2λ1+λ) , where we find that the behavior depends on whether or not a n + α an+α is an integer: If a ∈ ( − 1 , − 2 λ 1 + λ ) a∈(−1,−2λ1+λ) and a n + α an+α is an integer then λ a n P n ( a n + α , β ) ( 1 − 2 λ 2 ) λanPn(an+α,β)(1−2λ2) decays exponentially. If a ∈ ( − 1 , − 2 λ 1 + λ ) a∈(−1,−2λ1+λ) and a n + α an+α is not an integer then λ a n P n ( a n + α , β ) ( 1 − 2 λ 2 ) λanPn(an+α,β)(1−2λ2) may increase exponentially depending on the proximity of the sequence ( a n + α ) n (an+α)n to integers.},

These denominators are related as in the classical case to the notion of orthogonality over a contour. We investigate a specific setup where the Riemann surface is a real elliptic curve with two components and the measure of orthogonality is supported on one of the two real ovals . Using a characterization in terms of a Riemann–Hilbert problem, we determine the strong asymptotic behaviour of the corresponding orthogonal functions for large degree. The theory of vector bundles and the non-abelian Cauchy kernel play a prominent role even in this simplified setting, indicating the new challenges that the steepest descent method on a Riemann surface has to overcome.},

  abstract     = {Very recently, we have shown how the harmonic analysis approach can be modified to deal with products of general Hermitian and complex random matrices at finite matrix dimension. In the present work, we consider the particular product of a multiplicative Pólya ensemble on the complex square matrices and a Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) shifted by a constant multiplicative of the identity. The shift shall show that the limiting hard edge statistics of the product matrix is weakly dependent on the local spectral statistics of the GUE, but depends more on the global statistics via its Stieltjes transform (Green function). Under rather mild conditions for the Pólya ensemble, we prove formulas for the hard edge kernel of the singular value statistics of the Pólya ensemble alone and the product matrix to highlight their very close similarity. Due to these observations, we even propose a conjecture for the hard edge statistics of a multiplicative Pólya ensemble on the complex matrices and a polynomial ensemble on the Hermitian matrices .},

  abstract     = {We propose and analyse randomized cubature formulae for the numerical integration of functions with respect to a given probability measure μ μ defined on a domain Γ ⊆ R d Γ⊆Rd , in any dimension d d . Each cubature formula is exact on a given finite-dimensional subspace V n ⊂ L 2 ( Γ , μ ) Vn⊂L2(Γ,μ) of dimension n n , and uses pointwise evaluations of the integrand function ϕ : Γ → R ϕ:Γ→R at m &gt; n m&amp;gt;n independent random points. These points are drawn from a suitable auxiliary probability measure that depends on V n Vn . We show that, up to a logarithmic factor, a linear proportionality between m m and n n with dimension-independent constant ensures stability of the cubature formula with high probability. We also prove error estimates in probability and in expectation for any n ≥ 1 n≥1 and m &gt; n m&amp;gt;n , thus covering both preasymptotic and asymptotic regimes. Our analysis shows that the expected cubature error decays as n / m n/m times the L 2 ( Γ , μ ) L2(Γ,μ) -best approximation error of ϕ ϕ in V n Vn . On the one hand, for fixed n n and m → ∞ m→∞ our cubature formula can be seen as a variance reduction technique for a Monte Carlo estimator, and can lead to enormous variance reduction for smooth integrand functions and subspaces V n Vn with spectral approximation properties. On the other hand, when n , m → ∞ n,m→∞ , our cubature becomes of high order with spectral convergence. As a further contribution, we analyse also another cubature whose expected error decays as 1 / m 1/m times the L 2 ( Γ , μ ) L2(Γ,μ) -best approximation error of ϕ ϕ in V n Vn , but with constants that can be larger in the preasymptotic regime. Finally we show that, under a more demanding (at least quadratic) proportionality between m m and n n , all the weights of the cubature are strictly positive with high probability. As an example of application, we discuss the case where the domain Γ Γ has the structure of Cartesian product , μ μ is a product measure on Γ Γ and V n Vn contains algebraic multivariate polynomials.},

The minimal error converges to 0 as N → + ∞ N→+∞ and we try to characterize the order associated with this convergence. In Xu and Berger (2019), Xu and Berger show that, apart when μ μ is a Dirac mass and the error vanishes, the order is not larger than 1 and give a sufficient condition for the order to be equal to this threshold 1 in terms of the density of the absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure part of μ μ . They also prove that the order is not smaller than 1 / ρ 1/ρ when the support of μ μ is bounded and not larger when the support is not an interval. We complement these results by checking that for the order to lie in the interval 1 / ρ , 1 1/ρ,1 , the support has to be bounded and by stating a necessary and sufficient condition in terms of the tails of μ μ for the order to be equal to some given value in the interval 0 , 1 / ρ 0,1/ρ , thus precising the sufficient condition in terms of moments given in Xu and Berger (2019). We also give a necessary condition for the order to be equal to the boundary value 1 / ρ 1/ρ . In view of practical application, we emphasize that in the proof of each result about the order of convergence of the minimal error, we exhibit a choice of points explicit in terms of the quantile function of μ μ which exhibits the same order of convergence.},

  abstract     = {As one of the triumphs and milestones of robust statistics , Huber regression plays an important role in robust inference and estimation. It has also been finding a great variety of applications in machine learning. In a parametric setup, it has been extensively studied. However, in the statistical learning context where a function is typically learned in a nonparametric way, there is still a lack of theoretical understanding of how Huber regression estimators learn the conditional mean function and why it works in the absence of light-tailed noise assumptions. To address these fundamental questions, this paper conducts an assessment of Huber regression from a statistical learning viewpoint. First, we show that the usual risk consistency property of Huber regression estimators , which is usually pursued in machine learning, cannot guarantee their learnability in mean regression. Second, we argue that Huber regression should be implemented in an adaptive way to perform mean regression, implying that one needs to tune the scale parameter in accordance with the sample size and the moment condition of the noise. Third, with an adaptive choice of the scale parameter, we demonstrate that Huber regression estimators can be asymptotic mean regression calibrated under ( 1 + ε ) (1+ε) -moment conditions ( ε &gt; 0 ε&amp;gt;0 ) on the conditional distribution. Last but not least, under the same moment conditions, we establish almost sure convergence rates for Huber regression estimators. Note that the ( 1 + ε ) (1+ε) -moment conditions accommodate the special case where the response variable possesses infinite variance and so the established convergence rates justify the robustness feature of Huber regression estimators. In the above senses, the present study provides a systematic statistical learning assessment of Huber regression estimators and justifies their merits in terms of robustness from a theoretical viewpoint.},

  abstract     = {By means of the regularity of the differential operators generated by the Szász-Mirakjan operators, this paper further investigates the relation between the approximation rate of the linear combinations of the Szász-Mirakjan operators and the smoothness of the approximated function. We precisely give both the upper and lower bounds , which are of the same order, of the approximation of the linear combinations of these operators. Our results under some conditions include the direct theorem, the inverse theorem and the saturation of the uniform approximation of the linear combinations of these operators, and hence the approximation order of the uniform approximation of the linear combinations of the Szász-Mirakjan operators are further characterized.},
