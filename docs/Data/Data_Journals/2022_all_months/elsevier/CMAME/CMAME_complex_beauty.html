  abstract     = {Multiscale models are known to be successful in uncovering and representing structure in data at different resolutions. We propose here a feature driven Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) for which the associated kernel has a weighted multiscale structure. For generating approximations in this space, we provide a practical forward–backward algorithm that is shown to greedily construct a set of basis functions having a multiscale structure which enables sparse efficient representation of the given data and efficient predictions. We provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm including recommendations for selecting algorithmic hyperparameters and estimating probabilistic rates of convergence at individual scales. We also extend this analysis to a multiscale setting, studying the effects of finite scale truncation and quality of solution in the inherent RKHS. In the last section, we analyze the performance of the approach on a variety of simulations and real data sets illustrating the efficiency claims in terms of model quality and data reduction.},

  abstract     = {Parametric multiscale tumor models have been used nowadays as tools to understand and predict the behavior of tumor onset, development, and decrease under treatments. In order to obtain a useful model, its parameters have to be accurately estimated, often requiring numerous model evaluations. This can be computationally prohibitive for complex problems. In this work, we propose an approximate Bayesian computation approach for estimating model parameters using a low-fidelity Gaussian Process Regression metamodel. We develop an adaptive procedure to build the data-driven surrogate model by sequentially enriching the data set in the parametric space regions where the surrogate is not accurate enough. At the end of the process, we obtain good emulators of the original models over the entire parametric space at a low computational cost. We investigate the use of the proposed framework for the calibration of two tumor growth models, reaching high accuracy and computational efficiency, which may be key issues in many complex problems.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the problem of parametric , nonlinear, projection-based model order reduction (PMOR) and makes three contributions to advance its state of the art. First, it presents a computational strategy for reducing the total offline cost of nonlinear PMOR by enabling hyperreduction to be performed adaptively within the typical greedy sampling procedure, rather than uniformly at each of its iteration. Then, it presents a more accurate and computationally efficient approach for training hyperreduction based on residual Jacobians rather than residuals. Finally, it demonstrates for a large-scale, industrial-grade, parametric, nonlinear application, that the two aforementioned contributions make both offline and online stages of nonlinear PMOR practical in today’s engineering environments. The paper also shows that despite the so-called Kolmogorov n n -width barrier for the model reduction of convection-dominated transport problems, the current state of the art of nonlinear, Petrov–Galerkin PMOR equipped with the advances proposed in this paper is capable of accelerating by orders of magnitude the accurate solution of shape-parametric, high Reynolds number , viscous flow problems represented by the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations augmented with turbulence modeling . All three contributions are presented and discussed in the contexts of steady-state CFD problems ; however, they are equally applicable to unsteady CFD problems as well as problems in solid mechanics and structural dynamics.},

  abstract     = {We propose a scalable framework for the learning of high-dimensional parametric maps via adaptively constructed residual network (ResNet) maps between reduced bases of the inputs and outputs. When just few training data are available, it is beneficial to have a compact parametrization in order to ameliorate the ill-posedness of the neural network training problem. By linearly restricting high-dimensional maps to informed reduced bases of the inputs, one can compress high-dimensional maps in a constructive way that can be used to detect appropriate basis ranks, equipped with rigorous error estimates . A scalable neural network learning framework is thus to learn the nonlinear compressed reduced basis mapping. Unlike the reduced basis construction, however, neural network constructions are not guaranteed to reduce errors by adding representation power, making it difficult to achieve good practical performance. Inspired by recent approximation theory that connects ResNets to sequential minimizing flows, we present an adaptive ResNet construction algorithm . This algorithm allows for depth-wise enrichment of the neural network approximation , in a manner that can achieve good practical performance by first training a shallow network and then adapting. We prove universal approximation of the associated neural network class for L ν 2 Lν2 functions on compact sets . Our overall framework allows for constructive means to detect appropriate breadth and depth, and related compact parametrizations of neural networks, significantly reducing the need for architectural hyperparameter tuning. Numerical experiments for parametric PDE problems and a 3D CFD wing design optimization parametric map demonstrate that the proposed methodology can achieve remarkably high accuracy for limited training data, and outperformed other neural network strategies we compared against.},

Finding the neural control that (quasi-) minimizes a suitable cost (or loss) functional, then yields a numerical approximation with desirable attributes. In particular, the framework allows in a natural way the incorporation of known data of the exact solution, or the incorporation of stabilization mechanisms (e.g., to remove spurious oscillations). The main result of our analysis pertains to the well-posedness and convergence of the associated constrained-optimization problem. In particular, we prove under certain conditions, that the discrete weak forms are stable, and that quasi-minimizing neural controls exist, which converge quasi-optimally. We specialize the analysis results to Galerkin, least squares and minimal-residual formulations, where the neural-network dependence appears in the form of suitable weights. Elementary numerical experiments support our findings and demonstrate the potential of the framework.},

It was presented first in [Moës, Chevaugeon 2021], providing one-dimensional simulations for damage and plasticity. The present paper focuses on a two-dimensional implementation for elasto-damage models (quasi-brittle fracture). The incremental potential used in the Lip-field approach is the non-regularized one. The regularization comes from the addition of a Lipschitz constraint on the damage field. In other words, the free energy does not depend on the damage gradient. The search of the displacement and damage fields from one time-step to the next is based on an iterative staggered scheme. The displacement field is sought for a given damage field. Then, a Lipschitz continuous damage field is sought for a given displacement field. Both problems are convex. The solution to the latter benefits from bounds proven in [Moës, Chevaugeon 2021] and used in the present paper. The implementation of the Lipschitz regularity constraint on a finite element mesh and details of the overall solution scheme are presented. Four numerical examples demonstrate the capability of the new approach.},

Our AMLMC algorithm is built on the results of the weak convergence rates in the work (Moon et al., 2006) for an adaptive algorithm using isoparametric d-linear quadrilateral finite element approximations and the dual weighted residual error representation in a deterministic setting. Designed to suit the geometric nature of the singularities in the solution, our AMLMC algorithm uses a sequence of deterministic, non-uniform auxiliary meshes as a building block . The above-mentioned deterministic adaptive algorithm generates these meshes, corresponding to a geometrically decreasing sequence of tolerances. In particular, for a given realization of the diffusivity coefficient and accuracy level, AMLMC constructs its approximate sample using the first mesh in the hierarchy that satisfies the corresponding bias accuracy constraint. This adaptive approach is particularly useful for the lognormal case treated here, which lacks uniform coercivity and thus produces functional outputs that vary over orders of magnitude when sampled. Furthermore, we discuss iterative solvers and compare their efficiency with direct ones. To reduce computational work, we propose a stopping criterion for the iterative solver with respect to the quantity of interest, the realization of the diffusivity coefficient, and the desired level of AMLMC approximation. From the numerical experiments, based on a Fourier expansion of the diffusivity coefficient field, we observe improvements in efficiency compared with both standard Monte Carlo (MC) and standard MLMC (SMLMC) for a problem with a singularity similar to that at the tip of a slit modeling a crack.},

  abstract     = {Fractional calculus constitutive models are of wide applicability. They have been used, for example, for: xanthan gum, bread dough, synthetic polymers (e.g. nylon), single collagen fibrils, semi-hard zero-fat cheese, pure ice at − 3 5 ∘ C −35∘C , asphalt sealants, epithelial cells, gels, polymers, concrete, asphalt, rock mass, waxy crude oil, breast tissue cells, lung parenchyma, and red blood cell membranes (e.g. Bonfanti et al. (2020)). In this note we are motivated by applications to dispersive media such as lossy dielectrics and viscoelastic polymers, both of which involve constitutive laws with fading memory convolution Volterra integrals, and both of which have been modelled by fractional calculus — which implies a weakly singular Volterra kernel. To step forward in time with such a model the entire hereditary Volterra integral needs to be numerically re-computed at each time step. Done naïvely with standard quadrature this involves O ( N 2 ) O(N2) operations and O ( N ) O(N) storage to compute over N N time steps, and this severely limits the usefulness of such simple methods in large scale computations. Several alternatives addressing these shortcomings of this naïve approach have been offered in the literature, all of which can provide remedies. Here we propose another method, but ours is rather different in that we use a Fourier series proxy over much of the integration range. This allows for a recursive update to the ‘history integral’, with a much smaller effort expended in standard quadrature near the singularity . The recursive update is basically the same as that used when the Volterra kernel comprises decaying exponentials, a method which is already employed in some commercial codes. Given that this partial implementation is already in use, we intend that our method therefore has a lower ‘barrier to entry’ for incorporating fractional calculus models into commercial codes: it requires only minor surgery on the weakly singular kernel in order to apply the Fourier series proxy. This study is presented in the spirit of a discussion piece — there are several directions one could take from the basic observations presented here. We have aimed for simplicity and economy of presentation, and included just enough numerical results to give evidence that the method works. In summary, our method mitigates the O ( N ) O(N) storage and O ( N 2 ) O(N2) storage issues using an easily implemented proxy. It can also be implemented for variable time steps.

To this end, the Occam-Plausibility Algorithm (Farrell-Maupin et al., 2015) is extended by introducing a method for the design of model-specific validation experiments to provide data that portray the features of the prediction quantities of interest. Leveraging Bayesian inference and model plausibility, the framework adaptively balances the trade-off between complexity and validity of the models while taking into account the uncertainty in data, model parameters, and the choice of the model itself for making reliable computational predictions. An application of this framework is demonstrated in discrete-continuum multiscale modeling of size-dependent plasticity in polycrystalline materials, involving dislocation dynamics simulations and strain gradient plasticity models. This study suggests that the effectiveness of validation experiments relies upon the choice of the model; thus, a validation data set that adequately informs a predictive computational model may not be effective for validating other models.

  abstract     = {We present an approach to reduced-order modeling that builds off recent graph-theoretic work for representation, exploration, and analysis of computed states of physical systems (Banerjee et al., Comp. Meth. App. Mech. Eng. , 351 , 501–530, 2019). We extend a non-local calculus on finite weighted graphs to build such models by exploiting polynomial expansions and Taylor series. In the general framework for non-local calculus on graphs, the graph edge weights are intricately linked to the embedding of the graph, and consequently to the definition of the derivatives. In a previous communication (Duschenes and Garikipati, arXiv:2105.01740 [math.NA]), we have shown that radially symmetric, continuous edge weights derived from, for example Gaussian functions, yield inconsistent results in the resulting non-local derivatives when compared against the corresponding local, differential derivative definitions. Taking inspiration from finite difference methods, we algorithmically compute edge weights, considering the embedding of the local neighborhood of each graph vertex. Given this procedure, we ensure the consistency of the non-local derivatives in this setting, a crucial requirement for numerical applications. We show that we can achieve any desired orders of accuracy of derivatives, in a chosen number of dimensions without symmetry assumptions in the underlying data. Finally, we present two example applications of extracting reduced-order models using this non-local calculus, in the form of ordinary differential equations from parabolic partial differential equations of progressively greater complexity.},

  abstract     = {Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) breast cancer is frequently treated with drugs that target the HER2 receptor, such as trastuzumab, in combination with chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin. However, an open problem in treatment design is to determine the therapeutic regimen that optimally combines these two treatments to yield optimal tumor control. Working with data quantifying temporal changes in tumor volume due to different trastuzumab and doxorubicin treatment protocols in a murine model of human HER2+ breast cancer, we propose a complete framework for model development, calibration, selection, and treatment optimization to find the optimal treatment protocol. Through different assumptions for the drug–tumor interactions, we propose ten different models to characterize the dynamic relationship between tumor volume and drug availability, as well as the drug–drug interaction. Using a Bayesian framework, each of these models are calibrated to the dataset and the model with the highest Bayesian information criterion weight is selected to represent the biological system. The selected model captures the inhibition of trastuzumab due to pre-treatment with doxorubicin, as well as the increase in doxorubicin efficacy due to pre-treatment with trastuzumab. We then apply optimal control theory (OCT) to this model to identify two optimal treatment protocols. In the first optimized protocol, we fix the maximum dosage for doxorubicin and trastuzumab to be the same as the maximum dose delivered experimentally, while trying to minimize tumor burden. Within this constraint, optimal control theory indicates the optimal regimen is to first deliver two doses of trastuzumab on days 35 and 36, followed by two doses of doxorubicin on days 37 and 38. This protocol predicts an additional 45% reduction in tumor burden compared to that achieved with the experimentally delivered regimen. In the second optimized protocol we fix the tumor control to be the same as that obtained experimentally, and attempt to reduce the doxorubicin dose. Within this constraint, the optimal regimen is the same as the first optimized protocol but uses only 43% of the doxorubicin dose used experimentally. This protocol predicts tumor control equivalent to that achieved experimentally. These results strongly suggest the utility of mathematical modeling and optimal control theory for identifying therapeutic regimens maximizing efficacy and minimizing toxicity.},

Details of the specimen geometry , loading, and experimentally-measured forces are provided for V-notches with opening angles of 30, 60, and 90 degrees. Despite the relatively simple geometry and loading, and the fact that the specimens exhibit small scale yielding , model-based simulations that can accurately reproduce the critical forces at crack nucleation across the full set of specimens have proven to be elusive. Along these lines, we present model-based simulation results from finite-element discretizations of phase-field models for fracture. We provide results using both a well-established phase-field model for brittle materials as well as a recently-developed phase-field model for ductile materials. Importantly, both models tie crack nucleation to critical values of energy, and both are shown to be lacking in their accuracy to varying degrees. We also use standard finite-element calculations of a calibrated plasticity model to demonstrate that much greater accuracy in the calculated critical forces can be obtained with the use of a particular strength envelope.},

  abstract     = {Fully 3-D models can be prohibitively expensive when dealing with industrial-scale problems while plate and shell models are not able to capture localized 3-D effects around cracks, welds, and other structural features. This paper presents an iterative multiscale Generalized Finite Element Method (GFEM) able to automatically couple 3-D solid and shell models and capture interactions among structural scales. Three scales and corresponding models and discretizations are considered: A global shell model that captures only the overall behavior of a structure; a 3-D mesoscale model that bridges the solutions between the global and finer scales; and a 3-D fine-scale model, denoted local model, used to simulate localized defects, such as cracks, or structural features, such as welds. The coupling between global and mesoscale models is done using the iterative global-local algorithm and a Generalized Finite Element Method with analytically or numerically defined enrichments is used for the meso and local scales coupling. The proposed multiscale framework combines software with complementary capabilities. The shell problem is solved with the commercial software Abaqus while the meso and local scale problems are solved with an in-house GFEM solver. Another contribution of this work is a staggered algorithm for the solution of the coupled problems defined at the global, meso, and local scales. The performance of the methodology is compared against fully 3-D models and the sub-modeling approach which is widely adopted in engineering practice for the analysis of problems with multiple spatial scales of interest.},

The second originality of the proposed approach consists in using projections on an eigenmode basis associated with the use of an adapted SVD in order to compute the eigenfrequencies of the coupled problem.

The resulting approximation space can be used to solve problems with moving discontinuities, such as cracks, without the need of remeshing in the vicinity of the crack. The enrichment of the displacement field in XFEM inflicts a substantial increase in the ellipticity of the discretized problem. As a consequence, the resulting algebraic systems become strongly ill-conditioned, rendering the convergence of iterative solvers very slow. On the other hand, direct solvers may become inefficient in 3D problems, due to the increased bandwidth of the system matrix . In this paper, two of the most efficient domain decomposition solvers, namely the FETI-DP and P-FETI-DP, are proposed for solving the linear systems resulting from XFEM crack propagation analysis in large-scale 3D problems. Both solvers are amenable to parallelization and can be implemented in modern parallel computing environments, with multicore processors and distributed memory systems, following appropriate modifications, to achieve a drastic reduction of memory and computing time in computationally intensive problems.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a concurrent multiscale modeling framework for developing parametrically-upscaled crystal plasticity models (PUCPM) for crystalline metals that are characterized by multiple phases in their intragranular microstructure. Specifically, Ni-based superalloys with distributions of γ ′ γ′ precipitates in the γ γ matrix in their sub-grain microstructure are modeled in this study. The interaction of the γ − γ ′ γ−γ′ phases with nano-scale dislocation mechanisms determine the elasto-plastic behavior of the material across multiple scales. The PUCPM is designed to explicitly account for the morphological and configurational statistics of these γ − γ ′ γ−γ′ intragranular microstructures in its crystal plasticity constitutive coefficients. This approach provides a thermodynamically-consistent foundation to enable microstructure-aware material simulation at the higher scale. Establishing this multiscale characteristic requires an automated toolchain of computational methods to generate and embed heterogeneous, statistically-equivalent representative volume elements (SERVEs) into the concurrent multiscale simulation domains for self-consistent homogenization. The self-consistency condition is enforced through an optimization strategy invoking a series of coupled nonlinear finite element solutions. Supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods are integrated with the physics-based modeling at all stages of model development to overcome computational limitations and to provide the final, connecting map between PUCPM constitutive coefficients and γ − γ ′ γ−γ′ microstructural descriptors. The resulting PUCPM benefits from orders of magnitudes of speedup compared to the equivalent explicit representation of the lower scale microstructure. This advantage enables unique model capabilities for the multiscale analysis of deformation and failure in materials and location-specific design.},

  abstract     = {Reducing the intensity of wind excitation via aerodynamic shape modification is a major strategy to mitigate the reaction forces on supertall buildings , reduce construction and maintenance costs, and improve the comfort of future occupants. To this end, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) combined with state-of-the-art stochastic optimization algorithms is more promising than the trial and error approach adopted by the industry. The present study proposes and investigates a novel approach to risk-averse shape optimization of tall building structures that incorporates site-specific uncertainties in the wind velocity , terrain conditions, and wind flow direction. A body-fitted finite element approximation is used for the CFD with different wind directions incorporated by re-meshing the fluid domain. The bending moment at the base of the building is minimized, resulting in a building with reduced cost, material, and hence, a reduced carbon footprint. Both risk-neutral (mean value) and risk-averse optimization of the twist and tapering of a representative building are presented under uncertain inflow wind conditions that have been calibrated to fit freely-available site-specific data from Basel, Switzerland. The risk-averse strategy uses the conditional value-at-risk to optimize for the low-probability high-consequence events appearing in the worst 10% of loading conditions. Adaptive sampling is used to accelerate the gradient-based stochastic optimization pipeline. The adaptive method is easy to implement and particularly helpful for compute-intensive simulations because the number of gradient samples grows only as the optimal design algorithm converges. The performance of the final risk-averse building geometry is exceptionally favorable when compared to the risk-neutral optimized geometry, thus, demonstrating the effectiveness of the risk-averse design approach in computational wind engineering.},

  abstract     = {Characterization and modeling of path-dependent behaviors of complex materials by phenomenological models remains challenging due to difficulties in formulating mathematical expressions and internal state variables (ISVs) governing path-dependent behaviors. Data-driven machine learning models, such as deep neural networks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have become viable alternatives. However, pure black-box data-driven models mapping inputs to outputs without considering the underlying physics suffer from unstable and inaccurate generalization performance. This study proposes a machine-learned physics-informed data-driven constitutive modeling approach for path-dependent materials based on the measurable material states. The proposed data-driven constitutive model is designed with the consideration of universal thermodynamics principles, where the ISVs essential to the material path-dependency are inferred automatically from the hidden state of RNNs. The RNN describing the evolution of the data-driven machine-learned ISVs follows the thermodynamics second law. To enhance the robustness and accuracy of RNN models, stochasticity is introduced to model training. The effects of the number of RNN history steps, the internal state dimension, the model complexity, and the strain increment on model performances have been investigated. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by modeling soil material behaviors under cyclic shear loading using experimental stress–strain data.},

  abstract     = {Understanding real-world dynamical phenomena remains a challenging task. Across various scientific disciplines, machine learning has advanced as the go-to technology to analyze nonlinear dynamical systems, identify patterns in big data, and make decision around them. Neural networks are now consistently used as universal function approximators for data with underlying mechanisms that are incompletely understood or exceedingly complex. However, neural networks alone ignore the fundamental laws of physics and often fail to make plausible predictions. Here we integrate data, physics, and uncertainties by combining neural networks, physics informed modeling, and Bayesian inference to improve the predictive potential of traditional neural network models. We embed the physical model of a damped harmonic oscillator into a fully-connected feed-forward neural network to explore a simple and illustrative model system, the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19. Our Physics Informed Neural Networks seamlessly integrate data and physics, robustly solve forward and inverse problems, and perform well for both interpolation and extrapolation, even for a small amount of noisy and incomplete data. At only minor additional cost, they self-adaptively learn the weighting between data and physics. They can serve as priors in a Bayesian Inference, and provide credible intervals for uncertainty quantification. Our study reveals the inherent advantages and disadvantages of Neural Networks, Bayesian Inference, and a combination of both and provides valuable guidelines for model selection. While we have only demonstrated these different approaches for the simple model problem of a seasonal endemic infectious disease, we anticipate that the underlying concepts and trends generalize to more complex disease conditions and, more broadly, to a wide variety of nonlinear dynamical systems.

Informed by the structure of the governing equations, the task of learning a reduced-order model from data is posed as a Bayesian inverse problem with Gaussian prior and likelihood. The resulting posterior distribution characterizes the operators defining the reduced-order model, hence the predictions subsequently issued by the reduced-order model are endowed with uncertainty. The statistical moments of these predictions are estimated via a Monte Carlo sampling of the posterior distribution. Since the reduced models are fast to solve, this sampling is computationally efficient. Furthermore, the proposed Bayesian framework provides a statistical interpretation of the regularization term that is present in the deterministic operator inference problem, and the empirical Bayes approach of maximum marginal likelihood suggests a selection algorithm for the regularization hyperparameters. The proposed method is demonstrated on two examples: the compressible Euler equations with noise-corrupted observations, and a single-injector combustion process.},

  abstract     = {Manufactured materials usually contain random imperfections due to the fabrication process , e.g., the 3D-printing, casting, etc. These imperfections affect significantly the effective material properties and result in uncertainties in the mechanical response. Numerical analysis of the effects of the imperfections and the uncertainty quantification (UQ) can be often done by use of digital stochastic surrogate material models. In this work, we present a new flexible class of surrogate models depending on a small number of parameters and a calibration strategy ensuring that the constructed model fits to the available observation data, with special focus on two-phase materials. The surrogate models are constructed as the level-set of a linear combination of an intensity field representing the topological shape and a Gaussian perturbation representing the imperfections, allowing for fast sampling strategies. The mathematical design parameters of the model are related to physical ones and thus easy to interpret. The calibration of the model parameters is performed using progressive batching sub-sampled quasi-Newton minimization, using a designed distance measure between the synthetic samples and the data. Then, employing a fast sampling algorithm , an arbitrary number of synthetic samples can be generated to use in Monte Carlo type methods for prediction of effective material properties. In particular, we illustrate the method in application to UQ of the elasto-plastic response of an imperfect octet-truss lattice which plays an important role in additive manufacturing . To this end, we study the effective material properties of the lattice unit cell under elasto-plastic deformations and investigate the sensitivity of the effective Young’s modulus to the imperfections.},

  abstract     = {Sensitivity analysis and reliability assessment are two important aspects of structural and system safety. Epistemic uncertainty with respect to probabilistic model of input parameters due to lack of knowledge is present in many scarce-data applications and complicates the characterization of uncertainty in model response. In this article, we present two importance measures to evaluate the impact of distribution parameters on the probability distribution function (PDF) of the output and the failure probability. The epistemic uncertainty associated with the distribution parameters is modeled as random variables. A modified extended polynomial chaos expansion (MEPCE) approach is introduced in which aleatory and epistemic random variables are modeled and propagated simultaneously while allowing the separate assessment for any single epistemic variable. A MEPCE-based kernel density estimation (KDE) construction provides a composite map from each epistemic variable to the response PDF. The functional global sensitivity index of the PDF with respect to the distribution parameters is thus derived, as a function of output, which is both more informative and more efficient than standard scalar sensitivity measures. Reliability sensitivity indices can be readily evaluated by integrating the global sensitivity index function over the failure zone. Three illustrative examples are used to demonstrate the proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {A four-field mixed variational principle is proposed for large deformation analysis of Kirchhoff rods with the lowest order C 0 C0 mixed FE approximations . The core idea behind the approach is to introduce a one-parameter family of points (the centerline) and a separate one-parameter family of orthonormal frames (the Cartan moving frame) that are specified independently. The curvature and torsion of the curve are then related to the relative rotation of neighboring frames. The relationship between the frame and the centerline is then enforced at the solution step using a Lagrange multiplier (which plays the role of section force). In case of Kirchhoff rods, the cross sectional orientation can be described using frames like the Frenet–Serret, which are defined only using the centerline, thereby demanding higher-order smoothness for the centerline approximation. Decoupling the frame from the position vector of the base curve leads to a description of torsion and curvature that is independent of the position information , thus allowing for simpler interpolations. The four-field mixed variational principle we propose has the frame, section force, extension strain and position vector as input arguments . We discretize the position vector using linear Lagrange shape functions, while the frames are interpolated as piecewise geodesics on the rotation group. Finite element approximations for extensional strain and section force are constructed using constant shape functions. Using these discrete approximations, a discrete mixed variational principle is laid out which is then numerically extremized. The discrete approximation is then applied to a few benchmark problems. Vis-á-vis most available approaches, our numerical studies reveal an impressive performance of the proposed method without numerical instabilities or locking.},

In this paper, we propose a multi-output physics-informed neural network (MO-PINN) which can provide solutions with uncertainty distributions for both forward and inverse PDE problems with noisy data . In this framework, the uncertainty arising from the noisy data is first translated into multiple measurements regarding the prior noise distribution using the bootstrap method , and then the outputs of neural networks are designed to satisfy the measurements as well as the underlying physical laws. The posterior estimation of target parameters can be obtained at the end of training, which can be further used for uncertainty quantification and decision making. In this paper, MO-PINNs are demonstrated with a series of numerical experiments including both linear and nonlinear, forward and inverse problems . The results show that MO-PINN is able to provide accurate predictions with noisy data. In addition, we also demonstrate that the prediction and posterior distributions from MO-PINNs are consistent with the solutions from traditional a finite element method (FEM) solver and Monte Carlo methods given the same data and prior knowledge. Finally, we show that additional statistical knowledge can be incorporated into the training to improve the prediction if available.},

  abstract     = {Multiscale modeling is an effective approach for investigating multiphysics systems with largely disparate size features, where models with different resolutions or heterogeneous descriptions are coupled together for predicting the system’s response. The solver with lower fidelity (coarse) is responsible for simulating domains with homogeneous features, whereas the expensive high-fidelity (fine) model describes microscopic features with refined discretization , often making the overall cost prohibitively high, especially for time-dependent problems. In this work, we explore the idea of multiscale modeling with machine learning and employ DeepONet, a neural operator, as an efficient surrogate of the expensive solver. DeepONet is trained offline using data acquired from the fine solver for learning the underlying and possibly unknown fine-scale dynamics. It is then coupled with standard PDE solvers for predicting the multiscale systems with new boundary/initial conditions in the coupling stage. The proposed framework significantly reduces the computational cost of multiscale simulations since the DeepONet inference cost is negligible, facilitating readily the incorporation of a plurality of interface conditions and coupling schemes. We present various benchmarks to assess the accuracy and efficiency, including static and time-dependent problems. We also demonstrate the feasibility of coupling of a continuum model (finite element methods, FEM) with a neural operator, serving as a surrogate of a particle system (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics , SPH), for predicting mechanical responses of anisotropic and hyperelastic materials. What makes this approach unique is that a well-trained over-parametrized DeepONet can generalize well and make predictions at a negligible cost.},

The method is expected to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals with the improvement of the sustainability of the computational mechanics simulation itself. It is based on the controlled inexactness in the computational mechanics simulations, where partial differential equations are usually solved as accurately as possible. In particular, it not only reduces the power consumption but also gains in computation speed of computational mechanics simulations by actively introducing the low-precision computation, expanding the applicability of the low-precision computation while controlling the accuracy of computation results with the support of deep learning .

To investigate the evaporation of a single droplet and multiple droplets on a substrate, we develop novel and effective models based on phase field method. The interface of droplets can be implicitly captured by a specific level-set of order parameter (phase field function). The contact angle boundary condition derived from a wall free energy is adopted to reflect different wetting conditions. To reflect the effect of evaporation, we derive an evaporation term based on the relation between volume change and surface area. In each time step, the operator splitting based temporal discretization is adopted and all nonlinear terms are explicitly treated. Therefore, we can update each component in a step-by-step manner and the algorithm is efficient to implement. The proposed models and algorithms are validated by comparing the contact angle, spreading length, change of radius, and change of volume with analytical results. The effect of contact angle on a single droplet is investigated. Furthermore, the evaporations of multiple droplets under different contact angle conditions and pinning condition are simulated.},

  abstract     = {Studying wave propagation in heterogeneous structures can become computationally expensive because they rely on detailed finite element models to ensure accuracy. This problem is exacerbated if short wavelengths need to be captured, which leads to the need for a very fine discretization of the temporal domain. In this work, we propose a method for predicting the dynamic response of large arbitrary heterogeneous structures that leverages state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to develop a surrogate model for a unit cell and effectively homogenize it. Such a surrogate model represents the global behavior of the unit cell while preserving the local information and/or the effect of heterogeneities on the global behavior. To generate our model, we propose a training scheme inspired from meta-learning that expands the operational frequency spectrum and improves the prediction resolution of the unit cell.The proposed approach is not limited to only a particular type of material of heterogeneity in the unit cell, as demonstrated through linear as well as hyperelastic unit cells with and without holes. We also illustrate how to implement a surrogate unit cell in large arbitrary structures to study wave propagation phenomena. We present our method’s ability by comparing its results with those obtained via high-fidelity finite element simulations. Our findings indicate that using surrogate unit cells can dramatically boost the computational efficiency and simplicity to analyze large structures, thus enabling their applications in areas such as band structure optimization and acoustic wave management, to name a few.},

In this paper, an improved HL–RF algorithm introducing the hybrid conjugate gradient method with adaptive Barzilai–Borwein step sizes is developed to enhance the robustness and efficiency of the original HL–RF method. The proposed algorithm is composed of two stages, the steepest descent method is performed in the first stage to move to the vicinity of the most probable failure point (MPFP) and provide a good initial location for the second stage. Along with the hybrid conjugate search direction defined by the descent direction of the non-differential merit function, the second stage quantizes the adaptive Barzilai–Borwein step sizes to accelerate the process of locating the final MPFP under the nonmonotone line search rule. Eight illustrative examples with nonlinear LSFs are analyzed in detail to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm compared with other first order reliability methods. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is not only computationally efficient but also robust in terms of convergence, especially for those problems with super nonlinear LSFs and with nonlinear LSFs involving high-frequency noise terms.},

A general stiffness matrix is introduced in the coupling model to combine the PD and BEM governing equations in such a way that the continuity of displacement and the equilibrium of tractions at the PD-BEM interface are satisfied. A variable horizon method is developed to further eliminate boundary effects and ghost forces at the coupling interface between PD and BEM. Then, a concurrent coupling procedure of PD and BEM is established and its implementation is also introduced based on the dynamic explicit algorithm, i.e. the central difference method.

To validate the approach, we test the results of the framework with the numerical solution obtained with Finite Element Method (FEM) for Reissner–Mindlin plate elements at different strain rates.

  abstract     = {It is challenging to develop numerical methods that simultaneously maintain accuracy of resolving boundary conditions and mesh flexibility to handle the interface in interface-coupled multi-physics problems involving large property discontinuity. On the one hand, boundary-fitted methods possess high accuracy in capturing the interfacial phenomenon but involve complicated volumetric mesh generation, mesh-motion, and even re-meshing procedures. On the other hand, immersed boundary methods (IBM) provide mesh flexibility but sometimes suffer from inferior interface representations, leading to poor enforcement of boundary conditions. This paper presents an enriched immersed boundary method (EIBM) to overcome this challenge and demonstrates its efficacy in conjugate heat transfer, a representative example in interface-coupled multi-physics systems that have implications for many industrial processes. The core technique of the method is to enhance IBM’s accuracy of the fluid–solid interface by enriching the degrees of freedom of the cut elements to enforce temperature and flux compatibilities and resolve all the physical unknowns on the background mesh to simplify the volumetric mesh generation. We implement the EIBM under the framework of a variational multiscale formulation for coupled Navier–Stokes and thermodynamics equations. The enriched DoFs enable better enforcement of temperature and flux compatibilities with large conductivity ratios across the fluid–solid interface. At the same time, the immersed nature of the proposed method still attains mesh flexibility. The EIBM’s accuracy is thoroughly evaluated through a set of examples, ranging from benchmark problems with analytical solutions to real-world cooling processes of a moving metallic structure with complex geometry.},

To provide further insight into the theory, numerical values of the poroelastic coefficients are calculated for sandstone that are consistent with the material parameters reported by prominent authors. Then, the node-based smoothed finite element method (NS-FEM) is extended to implement the coupled double porosity flow and deformation formulation. In order to provide numerical stability and accuracy, a modified nodal integration scheme based on multiple stress points over the smoothing domain (SD) and the polynomial pressure projection (PPP) scheme are further implemented in the NS-FEM. Next, four benchmark tests are simulated and compared with reference solutions, based on which the correctness of the proposed NS-FEM formulation is verified and the generalizability of the derived anisotropic double porosity model is confirmed.

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is an effective approach to fabricating intricate shapes obtained from topology optimization (TO). However, it may cause undesired manufacturing-induced defects/cracks due to high thermal residual stresses. This study proposes a PeriDynamics-enabled three-dimensional Topology Optimization method (PD-TO) for designing structures by considering surface cracks for the AM processes. The PD-TO approach employs a bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization method and uses particle discretization of geometry for mechanical analysis. Crack surfaces are generated by breaking three-dimensional nonlocal interactions of the particles, and thus, during the optimization process, complex multiple structural discontinuities can be diligently modeled. First, the proposed approach is validated by solving benchmark problems without cracks. For each benchmark geometry, the PD-TO analysis is then performed by considering different positions and numbers (single/multiple) of cracks. These analyses extensively investigate and demonstrate the effects of a priori knowledge of residual stress-induced damages/cracks on the optimum topology for additive manufacturing. Besides, the smoothing operation is applied to the optimum designs to transform voxel shapes into AM-friendly smooth surfaces. These geometries are manufactured by an extrusion-based AM process to demonstrate the practical engineering application of the proposed method. Finally, the comparison of numerical results is also supported by the experimental tests conducted on the optimized topologies. Overall, it is confirmed that the PD-TO approach is a viable and accurate optimization tool for additive manufacturing considering possible process-induced damages.},

To ensure the injectivity of the parameterization, we utilize a collocation-based framework where the foldovers are eliminated on an increasing collocation set until the injectivity can be verified. A local–global solver is employed to eliminate any foldover effectively by projecting the mapping onto a bounded conformal distortion space. Local refinement of THB splines is also performed to enlarge the injectivity space. Various sufficient conditions are proposed to check the injectivity of the mapping efficiently. The quality of the bijective mapping is further improved by optimizing a geometrical energy, which is also embedded in the collocation framework to ensure injectivity. A coarse-to-fine variant of our method, which is more robust, is also presented. THB splines not only reduce the number of degrees of freedom in the parametric representation, but also increase the possibility of producing a bijective parameterization by local refinement. Some examples are provided to demonstrate the efficiency, effectiveness and robustness of our method.},

The full order model uses finite element discretization for space and explicit–implicit discretization for time, where the same degree of Lagrange polynomials are used to discretize phase function ϕ ϕ , velocity u u and pressure p p for the spatial discretization . Such spatial discretization leads to unstable schemes due to the loss of inf–sup stability condition. Therefore, we consider adding some stability terms to increase the stability of the whole system. The local projection stabilization method is added to the gradient of velocity and pressure. It should be emphasized that the local projection stabilization method relaxes the constraints of the stabilization coefficient compared with the previous research. Secondly, on the basis of full order model, we obtain the reduced order model by using proper orthogonal decomposition method . Then, we theoretically validate the energy stabilities and the error estimate of the full order model and the reduced order model, respectively.

  abstract     = {To accurately capture the dynamic responses of flexible multibody systems with complex geometric shapes or with contact and collision problems, extremely fine meshes have to be used. However, most previous algorithms for simulating these systems adopt a single integration time step size. A way to improve computation efficiency is to use different integration time steps for different elements with different sizes. In this study, a novel implicit AVI (asynchronous variational integrator) is originally proposed to study dynamics of complex flexible multibody systems. The proposed integrator allows different integration time step sizes for different elements with different mesh sizes . The multipoint constraint method is utilized to glue non-matching elements. To establish the system’s discrete Euler–Lagrange equations (DELs) , the diagonal-scaling method is used to construct the lumped mass matrix of elements. Finally, seven numerical examples are presented to comprehensively validate accuracy and efficiency of the proposed integrator. Numerical results indicate that the proposed AVI is capable of accurately capturing the dynamic response of flexible multibody systems and preserving systems’ energy and momentum. Compared with the generalized- α α algorithm with a single time step size, the proposed AVI can significantly improve the computation efficiency for the dynamic simulation of complex flexible multibody systems with clearance joints .},

The fluid is simulated by the SPH method, and the structure response is considered by the FEM beam. The normal flux method is employed to calculate the coupled force between the fluid and structure by considering the surface integration term in SPH approximation equations. A multi-resolution technology is proposed by discretizing the fluid and structure with different resolutions. The resolution of beam elements can be either coarser or finer than that of SPH particles. Finally, the accuracy, robustness and efficiency of the current FSI solver are strictly validated by several typical benchmarks, including the hydrostatic, free-surface flow and water entry problems.},

  abstract     = {With the diversification of engineering structure performance requirements and the continuous development of refinement of processing and manufacturing, structural design is faced with more and more factors to be considered. By quantifying the important features of non-design domain location and parameter uncertainty, a feature-driven robust topology optimization strategy considering movable non-design domain and complex uncertainty is proposed. Firstly, the influence of non-design domain on structural topology is quantified by a shape description function. The slight boundary discontinuity caused by non-design domain is further solved. In addition, the mathematical properties of structural response about uncertainty are analyzed, and vertex method and subinterval dimension-wise method are adopted to quantify the influence of uncertainties. Finally, the sensitivity of the robust optimization model is derived based on the shape derivative principle, which provides the basis for the implementation of gradient based optimization algorithm . Three examples illustrate the effectiveness, necessity and influence of important parameters of the topology optimization method considering movable non-design domain and complex uncertainty from different aspects.},

The three-field approach is extended to multi-material topology optimization problems . The local constraints are built by introducing porosity and material rate to achieve MaxLSC for the solid and void phases, respectively. A p-mean function is utilized to aggregate the MaxLSC constraints into a single global one. The MinLSC is proposed based on geometric constraints and the indicator functions with a normalization gradient norm. The optimization formulations and the sensitivity analysis of the related optimization responses are subsequently derived. Four numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed LSC methods are effective to control the feature length scales and contribute to improving the manufacturability of the optimized structures. The length scales of the joints between different materials can be effectively controlled by the proposed LSC constraints for the entire solid phases. Besides, the LSC constraints are found to achieve diverse topology designs and achieving structural redundancy .},

  abstract     = {Finding the optimal design of a hydrodynamic or aerodynamic surface is often impossible due to the expense of evaluating the cost functions (say, with computational fluid dynamics) needed to determine the performances of the flows that the surface controls. In addition, inherent limitations of the design space itself due to imposed geometric constraints, conventional parameterization methods, and user bias can restrict all of the designs within a chosen design space regardless of whether traditional optimization methods or newer, data-driven design algorithms with machine learning are used to search the design space. We present a 2-pronged attack to address these difficulties: we propose (1) a methodology to create the design space using morphing that we call Design-by-Morphing (DbM); and (2) an optimization algorithm to search that space that uses a novel Bayesian Optimization (BO) strategy that we call Mixed variable, Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MixMOBO). We apply this shape optimization strategy to maximize the power output of a hydrokinetic turbine. Applying these two strategies in tandem, we demonstrate that we can create a novel, geometrically-unconstrained, design space of a draft tube and hub shape and then optimize them simultaneously with a minimum number of cost function calls. Our framework is versatile and can be applied to the shape optimization of a variety of fluid problems.},

  abstract     = {Explicit time integration methods are an integral part of solving structural dynamics problems such as the propagation of elastic and acoustic waves, impact scenarios including crash tests and many more. One common limitation of this class of time integrators is, however, their conditional stability, meaning that highly distorted, small, or stiff finite elements typically govern the critical time step size. That is to say, even a small number of such elements will result in a significantly decrease of the feasible time step, which in turn drastically increases the computational costs of solving the semi-discrete equations of motion. This is especially true for non-uniform and unstructured meshes. Therefore, an asynchronous explicit solver in parallel is proposed in this article. The idea is to assign different time step sizes to different parts of the mesh, such that the overall computational effort is minimized. To improve the performance of the proposed solver, it is combined with a sophisticated octree meshing framework, where the balanced octrees are used, meaning that the ratio of the element sizes of adjacent elements cannot exceed a value of two. Thus, the critical time step of each element can be estimated straightforwardly. To avoid issues with hanging nodes, a special polyhedral element formulation, the scaled boundary finite element method, is employed. Since there are only a limited number of cell patterns in a balanced octree, the stiffness and mass matrices are pre-computed, significantly reducing the computational cost. Moreover, exploiting an element-by-element technique, the assembly of global stiffness matrices can be avoided. The main advantage of the described methodology is that the asynchronous explicit solver can be easily implemented in a high-performance computing environment. By means of several numerical examples, the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated, as well as its versatility in handling complex engineering problems.},

  abstract     = {Improved understanding of solid surface energy and its role in the overall mechanical properties is of great interest due to the emerging manufacturing techniques of nanostructures, coatings, and synthetic/biological bilayer–polymer hybrids. Continuum numerical modeling of surface stresses efficiently incorporates a zero-thickness membrane bonded to a bulk, intrinsically accounting for surface tension and surface elasticity. Compressive surface stresses are not possible in a purely membrane formulation, ignoring the surface flexural resistance. The extension of material surfaces to account for flexural resistance, i.e., the Steigmann–Ogden model, requires spatial derivatives of second order, posing significant challenges to standard discretization techniques. Hence, the effect of surface curvature resistance on the overall mechanical behavior of complex geometries remains elusive. Here, we develop a three-dimensional computational formulation of curvature-dependent surface energetics at finite strains using surface-enriched isogeometric analysis. Coupled with a hyperelastic bulk, bending-resistance of material surfaces furnishes a new physical length scale, i.e., the elastobending length. We quantify the effect of elastobending deformations for several numerical examples involving soft materials with thin coatings and liquid-shell surfaces, capturing budding-like behavior observed at cell membranes. Our results demonstrate a stiffer overall mechanical behavior when material surfaces resist bending deformations and illustrate how curvature effects lead to complex budding deformations at non-zero initial curvature states. The proposed methodology provides a robust computational foundation to help improve our understanding and mechanical characterization of soft solids, nanostructures, and biological membranes at small scales.},

The procedure can be automated for any convex artificial boundary. This removes restrictions on the domain construction using PML and can therefore reduce computational cost and improve mesh quality. The usage of spline basis functions with higher continuity also improves the accuracy of the PML-approximation and the numerical solution.},

Considerable computational costs are required for iterative solvers to nonlinear state constraints , such as eigenvalue problems , especially in 3D with large-scale degrees of freedom. Recently, multi-level correction methods are developed to improve efficiency in solving nonlinear partial differential equations including eigenvalue problems. These methods involve a multi-step correction in a sequence of finite element spaces and can keep accuracy of the eigenpair approximation . The overall computational cost is nearly equivalent to that of solving linear source problems. In this paper, we propose a new phase field method based on multi-level correction for eigenfrequency topology optimization. Both eigenfrequency optimization problems associated with a scalar type elliptic operator and a vectorial type elastic operator are considered. The Allen–Cahn phase field equation discretized by a semi-implicit scheme and finite-elements can have topological and shape changes in arbitrary shaped design regions. The proposed optimization algorithm based on a multi-level correction solver for eigenvalue problems improves efficiency of the traditional phase field method. A variety of numerical examples in 2D and 3D are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm.},

A key feature of the proposed PGD is the collocation representation equipped with the Dirac-delta function, which handles non-smooth characteristics of frequency responses point-wisely. This strategy replaces direct computations of FOM on a large number of samples and frequencies with iterative solving of the subproblems formulated by the progressive Galerkin approach. In the online stage, the PGD modes acquired from the offline stage are used to generate a reduced-order model (ROM). Solutions for unsampled points are evaluated through ROM, which is further utilized to estimate the statistics of the frequency response function .

The proposed approach employs a multi-level hierarchical data structure and alternates global h h - and p p -refinements with a coarsening step. Thus, at each unrefinement step, we eliminate the basis functions with the lowest contributions to the solution. When solving elliptic problems using energy-norm adaptivity, the removed basis functions are those with the lowest contributions to the energy of the solution. For non-elliptic problems or goal-oriented adaptivity, we propose an upper bound of the error representation expressed in terms of an inner product of the specific equation, leading to error indicators that deliver quasi-optimal h p hp -unrefinements. This unrefinement strategy removes unneeded unknowns possibly introduced during the pre-asymptotical regime. In addition, the grids over which we perform the unrefinements are arbitrary, and thus, we can limit their size and associated computational costs. We numerically analyze our algorithm for energy-norm and goal-oriented adaptivity. In particular, we solve two-dimensional (2D) Poisson, Helmholtz , convection-dominated equations, and a three-dimensional (3D) Helmholtz-like problem. In all cases, we observe exponential convergence rates. Our algorithm is robust and straightforward to implement; therefore, it can be easily adapted for industrial applications.},

While the ductile response is manifested by diffuse shear zones exhibiting volume-preserving inelastic deformations, the brittle response is revealed by very small crack-like defects containing a sequence of fibrillar bridges and elongated micro-voids, thereby resembling the void formation consisting of nucleation and growth stages. Their formation is driven by tensile straining followed by volumetric inelastic deformations. The present study is concerned with the description of shear yielding and crazing in terms of their respective evolution equations. Besides, an extension towards the modeling of the fracture is employed via the crack phase-field approach, accounting for ductile and brittle failure concomitantly. This is granted by the novel failure criterion that features a critical amount of plastic strain and void volume fraction. Such a modality simultaneously models the macroscopic crack initiation and growth leading to ductile or brittle fracture, as such purports to be more physically grounded compared to extant models in the literature. The predictive performance of the proposed model has been demonstrated by fitting of various extant experimental data of homogeneous and inhomogeneous tests in relation to initial boundary value problems.},

  abstract     = {Living membranes can grow as a response to their environment, and they are also known as viscoelastic materials. However, the growth phenomenon and the viscoelastic behavior of these membranes have been studied separately up to now. The main goal of this paper is to develop a general formulation that can account for growth and viscoelastic behaviors in membranes, simultaneously. Therefore, we propose a formulation for growing quasi-linear viscoelastic membranes. The growth model begins with a multiplicative decomposition of the gradient deformation tensor into elastic and growth tensor, where the growth of the membrane is considered as a single scalar-valued parameter. Furthermore, the quasi-linear viscoelasticity theory is utilized in the elastic configuration as additive decomposition of the second Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor . To solve the evolution equations for both growth and quasi-linear viscoelastic relations, two implicit second order accuracy integration methods are employed. Moreover, strain-driven and stress-driven growth phenomena are accounted for based on a Total Lagrangian (TL) finite element formulation. The developed formulations can capture growth phenomena and viscoelastic properties of the membranes, individually, and it also enables to model co-existence of growth and viscoelasticity. Eventually, to evaluate the applicability of the developed formulation, several examples are investigated and compared to those available in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Two-scale simulations are often employed to analyze the effect of the microstructure on a component’s macroscopic properties . Understanding these structure–property relations is essential in the optimal design of materials for specific applications. However, these two-scale simulations are typically computationally expensive and infeasible in multi-query contexts such as optimization and material design. To make such analyses amenable, the microscopic simulations can be replaced by inexpensive-to-evaluate surrogate models . Such surrogate models must be able to handle microstructure parameters in order to be used for material design. A previous work focused on the construction of an accurate surrogate model for microstructures under varying loading and material parameters by combining proper orthogonal decomposition and Gaussian process regression. However, that method works only for a fixed geometry, greatly limiting the design space. This work hence focuses on extending the methodology to treat geometrical parameters. To this end, a method that transforms different geometries onto a parent domain is presented, that then permits existing methodologies to be applied. We propose to solve an auxiliary problem based on linear elasticity to obtain the geometrical transformations. The method has a good reducibility and can therefore be quickly solved for many different geometries. Using these transformations, combined with the nonlinear microscopic problem, we derive a fast-to-evaluate surrogate model with the following key features: (1) the predictions of the effective quantities are independent of the auxiliary problem, (2) the predicted stress fields automatically fulfill the microscopic balance laws and are periodic, (3) the method is non-intrusive, (4) the stress field for all geometries can be recovered, and (5) the sensitivities are available and can be readily used for optimization and material design. The proposed methodology is tested on several composite microstructures, where rotations and large variations in the shape of inclusions are considered. Finally, a two-scale example is shown, where the surrogate model achieves a high accuracy and significant speed up, thus demonstrating its potential in two-scale shape optimization and material design problems.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the patient specific medical scenario has gained increasing popularity in health and engineering research. Unlike the standard medical paradigm (generalized treatment), personalized health techniques are oriented towards suiting the specific demands of a given patient, resulting in solutions that increase the success of the medical procedure. The idea of computer oriented, or in silico , medical experimentation has proven to be an effective tool to permit the implementation of patient specific medicine. Bone remodelling (BR) simulation intends to predict bone distribution changes due to the specific living conditions of a certain bone under the patient’s loading conditions. Unfortunately, it is usually difficult to obtain the simulation conditions affecting this process which are particular in each case. In this sense, the objective of this work is to present a procedure to adjust the patient-dependent biomechanical factors affecting bone growth and ingrowth, in order to reduce the computational uncertainty of the BR simulation. Assuming that the medical image represents a bone distribution in remodelling homeostasis, the optimization of parameters is driven by the search of a stationary remodelling state of the bone. The methodology is tested in a synthetic problem and also applied in the context of a human mandible in which mastication forces are obtained.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing provides new design space for fiber-reinforced composite structures given the flexibility in fiber layout and substrate material distribution. Hence, the present research develops a topology optimization method dedicated for surface fiber reinforcement design. The targeting part is composed of fiber contents reinforcing the boundary contour and isotropic substrate materials infilling the structural interior. The idea of full-scale modeling of the fiber contents and the approach of addressing the bi-modulus reinforcement effect are highlighted. Specifically, under the SIMP framework, the fiber contents (including the fiber materials and the wrapping matrix materials) are identified through boundary layer extraction with double layers of density smoothing and projection, and the reinforcement fiber materials are recognized through analytical skeleton extraction from the boundary layer. In this manner, constant-thickness fiber contents are modeled and more importantly, stringently incorporated into the topology optimization problem formulation. Both the boundary layer thickness and the fiber reinforcement thickness can be explicitly controlled by modifying the projection threshold parameters. Compliance minimization problems are considered in the current study. Sensitivities of the objective and constraint functions are derived to guide the design update. Several numerical and experimental examples are provided to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method, especially disclosing the impact on the derived topological structures by incorporating boundary layer fibers.},

Analytically, we prove that while the FOM–ROM consistency yields optimal error bounds , FOM–ROM inconsistency yields additional terms dependent on the FOM divergence error, which prevent the ROM from recovering the FOM as the number of modes increases.

The hyper singular integral is directly derived and singular terms are canceled due to the form of the tangential derivative at the boundary. The topological derivative is derived through the adjoint variable method(AVM) and the most of the unknowns in the variation of objective function can be canceled by evaluating the adjoint field. However, one of the terms which includes the variation of the tangential derivative of the sound pressure is evaluated using integration by parts . The remaining part having unknown variation of sound pressure is neglected by extending the objective function defined boundary by one elements at its start and end points.

  abstract     = {Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) are capable of finding the solution for a given boundary value problem. Here, the training of the network is equivalent to the minimization of a loss function that includes the governing (partial differential) equations (PDE) as well as initial and boundary conditions. We employ several ideas from the finite element method (FEM) to enhance the performance of existing PINNs in engineering problems. The main contribution of the current work is to promote using the spatial gradient of the primary variable as an output from separated neural networks. Later on, the strong form (given governing equation) which has a higher order of derivatives is applied to the spatial gradients of the primary variable as the physical constraint. In addition, the so-called energy form of the problem (which can be obtained from the weak form) is applied to the primary variable as an additional constraint for training. The proposed approach only required up to first-order derivatives to construct the physical loss functions. We discuss why this point is beneficial through various comparisons between different models. The mixed formulation-based PINNs and FE methods share some similarities. While the former minimizes the PDE and its energy form at given collocation points utilizing a complex nonlinear interpolation through a neural network, the latter does the same at element nodes with the help of shape functions. We focus on heterogeneous solids and check the performance of the proposed PINN model against the solution from FEM on two prototype problems: elasticity and the Poisson equation (steady-state diffusion problem). It is concluded that by properly designing the network architecture in PINN, the deep learning model has the potential to solve the unknowns in a heterogeneous domain without any available initial data from other sources. Finally, discussions are provided on the combination of PINN and data from physical FE simulations for a fast and accurate design of composite materials in future developments.},

Tackling this challenging problem requires correct mathematical descriptions of phase interactions and transformation together with a robust computational framework, both of which are addressed in this paper. The new mathematical model and coupled governing equations based on the continuum mixture theory enable the use of a single set of SPH particles for the descriptions of behaviour, interactions and phase transformation of all five phases of the porous media (soil skeleton, erodible fines particles, fluidised particles, water, and air), including the effect of both saturation and erosion on the shear strength of porous media. A fully explicit and stabilised SPH framework that allows accurate SPH approximations of spatial gradients is proposed for the numerical solutions of coupled governing equations. The proposed computational framework performs well in benchmark tests against available analytical and numerical solutions and achieved reasonable agreements with experiments. Numerical results obtained from the predictions of seepage-induced erosion and failure demonstrate that the proposed computational framework is efficient for addressing challenging problems involving coupled flow-deformation, seepage-induced internal erosions, and large deformation failures of unsaturated/saturated porous media.},

Here we develop an incremental realization of inelastic deformation (IRID) algorithm to deal with finite/large deformation with yet small elastic strain. A large deformation process is decomposed into a sequence of small deformation processes with intervals. At each interval the grids are stretched to accommodate the average inelastic deformation and advection/rotation operations are performed to account for the heterogeneous inelastic deformation. It is shown that Kachaturyan’s Fourier-transform based solutions can be adapted to the stretched grids. The IRID algorithm is compared against literature results regarding growth of a single void under remote stress of different triaxialities. Based on the IRID algorithm a phase-field model is developed that incorporates material microstructure, plasticity, multicomponent diffusion, and surface and grain boundary diffusion. The void growth kinetics and morphology evolution under coupling of diffusion and plasticity under creep are studied and the results show that coupling of the two mechanisms can significantly accelerate growth and coalescence of multiple voids at grain boundaries.},

  abstract     = {The paper presents a new efficient and robust method for rare event probability estimation for computational models of an engineering product or a process returning categorical information only, for example, either success or failure . For such models, most of the methods designed for the estimation of failure probability , which use the numerical value of the outcome to compute gradients or to estimate the proximity to the failure surface, cannot be applied. Even if the performance function provides more than just binary output, the state of the system may be a non-smooth or even a discontinuous function defined in the domain of continuous input variables. This often happens because the mathematical model features non-smooth components or discontinuities (e.g., in the constitutive laws), bifurcations, or even domains in which no reasonable model response is obtained. In these cases, the classical gradient-based methods usually fail. We propose a simple yet efficient algorithm, which performs a sequential adaptive selection of points from the input domain of random variables to extend and refine a simple distance-based surrogate model . Two different tasks can be accomplished at any stage of sequential sampling: (i) estimation of the failure probability, and (ii) selection of the best possible candidate for the subsequent model evaluation if further improvement is necessary. The proposed criterion for selecting the next point for model evaluation maximizes the expected probability classified by using the candidate. Therefore, the perfect balance between global exploration and local exploitation is maintained automatically. If there are more rare events such as failure modes, the method can be generalized to estimate the probabilities of all these event types. Moreover, when the numerical value of model evaluation can be used to build a smooth surrogate, the algorithm can accommodate this information to increase the accuracy of the estimated probabilities . Lastly, we define a new simple yet general geometrical measure of the global sensitivity of the rare-event probability to individual variables, which is obtained as a by-product of the proposed refinement algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel in-silico framework for the design of flexoelectric energy harvesters at finite strains using topology optimisation . The main ingredients of this work can be summarised as follows: (i) a micromorphic continuum approach is exploited to account for size dependent effects in the context of finite strains, thus permitting the modelling and simulation of flexoelectric effects in highly deformable materials such as dielectric elastomers . A key feature of the multi-field (mixed) formulation pursued is its flexibility as it permits, upon suitable selection of material parameters, to degenerate into other families of high order gradient theories such as flexoelectric gradient elasticity. (ii) A novel energy interpolation scheme is put forward, whereby different interpolation strategies are proposed for the various contributions that the free energy density function is decomposed into. This has enabled to circumvent numerical artifacts associated with fictitious high flexoelectric effects observed in the vicinity of low and intermediate density regions, where extremely high strain gradients tend to develop. (iii) A weighted combination of efficiency-based measures and aggregation functions of the stress is proposed to remedy the shortcomings of state-of-the-art efficiency-based functionals, which promotes the development of hinges with unpractical highly localised large strain gradients. Finally, a series of numerical examples are analysed, studying the development of direct flexoelectricity induced by bending, compression and torsional deformations.},

The original WaveHoltz iteration for acoustic Helmholtz problems is a fixed-point iteration that filters the solution of the wave equation with time-harmonic forcing and boundary data. As in the original WaveHoltz method, we reformulate the fixed point iteration as a positive definite linear system of equations that is iteratively solved by a Krylov method. We present two time-stepping schemes, one explicit and one (novel) implicit, which completely remove time discretization error from the WaveHoltz solution by performing a simple modification of the initial data and time-stepping scheme. Numerical experiments indicate an iteration scaling similar to that of the original WaveHoltz method, and that the convergence rate is dictated by the shortest (shear) wave speed of the problem. We additionally show that the implicit scheme can be advantageous in practice for meshes with disparate element sizes.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a computational method for the coupled four-field problem of thermo-fluid–structure interaction (TFSI) using finite elements for all fields is proposed. Residual-based variational multiscale formulations are used for ensuring stable and accurate solutions of the flow as well as the temperature-transport problems. Adequate formulations for considering both the flow of gases and liquids are included in the computational method, with the most prominent representatives of each explicitly considered in the numerical examples contained in this article, that is, air and water, respectively. For air, a variable-density formulation of the Navier–Stokes equations at low Mach number, and for water, an incompressible formulation of the Navier–Stokes equations are utilized. Each of them is coupled to fully nonlinear dynamic equations for the structural field, along with the corresponding nonlinear dynamic equations for temperature transport in both fluid and solid domain. For the two surface couplings and the two volume couplings, a partitioned-monolithic strategy is pursued, in that the surface-coupled problems are solved monolithically, and the volume-coupled problems in partitioned form. On the one hand, choosing a monolithic scheme for the surface-coupled problems is particularly due to the improved performance of such a scheme compared to a partitioned scheme for FSI, as demonstrated by various studies published earlier. On the other hand, by using a partitioned algorithm for the volume-coupled problems, a potentially very large overall system of linear equations encompassing all fields can be avoided, for the time being, by splitting it up into two smaller monolithic systems. The choice is also motivated by the fact that the interaction is typically stronger for the surface-coupled fields in the applications of main interest. The computational method is applied to four numerical examples of increasing complexity, ranging from a rather simple problem of a plate which is subjected to tangential flow via channel flow with single and double elastic walls to the simplified configuration of a complex tube-bundle heat exchanger. The presented approach proves to be robust, and accurate results are obtained for all test cases. In particular, it is shown that the proposed method is capable of simulating a complex technical device such as a heat exchanger under its nominal working conditions.},

  abstract     = {Inhomogeneities in the aortic wall can lead to localized stress accumulations, possibly initiating dissection. In many cases, a dissection results from pathological changes such as fragmentation or loss of elastic fibers. But it has been shown that even the healthy aortic wall has an inherent heterogeneous microstructure. Some parts of the aorta are particularly susceptible to the development of inhomogeneities due to pathological changes, however, the distribution in the aortic wall and the spatial extent, such as size, shape and type, are difficult to predict. Motivated by this observation, we describe the heterogeneous distribution of elastic fiber degradation in the dissected aortic wall using a stochastic constitutive model. For this purpose, random field realizations, which model the stochastic distribution of degraded elastic fibers, are generated over a non-equidistant grid. The random field then serves as input for a uniaxial extension test of the pathological aortic wall, solved with the finite element method. To include the microstructure of the dissected aortic wall, a constitutive model developed in a previous study is applied, which also includes an approach to model the degradation of interlamellar elastic fibers. To then assess the uncertainty in the output stress distribution due to the proposed stochastic constitutive model, a convolutional neural network, specifically a Bayesian encoder–decoder, was used as a surrogate model that maps the random input fields to the output stress distribution obtained from the finite element analysis. The results show that the neural network is able to predict the stress distribution of the finite element analysis while also significantly reducing the computational time. In addition, this provides the probability for exceeding certain rupture stresses within the aortic wall, which could allow for the prediction of delamination or fatal rupture.},

Parametric dependencies are included by considering the parameters that control the geometry configuration as additional dimensions next to the physical space coordinates. The parameters are easily incorporated within the TT-IGA solution framework by introducing a tensor product basis expansion in the parameter space. The discrete Galerkin operators are accordingly extended to accommodate the parameter dependence, thus obtaining a single system that includes the parameter dependency. The system is solved directly in the TT format and a low-rank representation of the parameter-dependent solution is obtained. The proposed TT-IGA solver is applied to several test cases which showcase its high computational efficiency and tremendous compression ratios achieved for representing the parameter-dependent IGA operators and solutions.},

  abstract     = {We present an approximately C 1 C1 -smooth multi-patch spline construction which can be used in isogeometric analysis (IGA). The construction extends the one presented in [1] for two-patch domains. A key property of IGA is that it is simple to achieve high order smoothness within a single patch. However, to represent more complex geometries one often uses a multi-patch construction. In this case, the global continuity for the basis functions is in general only C 0 C0 . Therefore, to obtain C 1 C1 -smooth isogeometric functions, a special construction for the basis is needed. Such spaces are of interest when solving numerically fourth-order problems, such as the biharmonic equation or Kirchhoff–Love plate/shell formulations, using an isogeometric Galerkin method. Isogeometric spaces that are globally C 1 C1 over multi-patch domains can be constructed as in [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] , [6] . The constructions require geometry parametrizations that satisfy certain constraints along the interfaces, so-called analysis-suitable G 1 G1 parametrizations . To allow C 1 C1 spaces over more general multi-patch parametrizations, one needs to increase the polynomial degree and/or to relax the C 1 C1 conditions. Thus, we define function spaces that are not exactly C 1 C1 but only approximately. We adopt the construction for two-patch domains, as developed in [1] , and extend it to more general multi-patch domains. We employ the construction for a biharmonic model problem and compare the results with Nitsche’s method. We compare both methods over complex multi-patch domains with non-trivial interfaces. The numerical tests indicate that the proposed construction converges optimally under h h -refinement, comparable to the solution using Nitsche’s method. In contrast to weakly imposing coupling conditions, the approximate C 1 C1 construction is explicit and no additional terms need to be introduced to stabilize the method/penalize the jump of the derivative at the interface. Thus, the new proposed method can be used more easily as no parameters need to be estimated.},

The new framework has been validated and illustrated to be effective and versatile in diverse FSI problems, including hydrostatic pressure-induced solid deformation, violent free-surface flows and channel flows interacting with flexible structures. Compared with conventional grid-based methods, this particle framework is more user-friendly, since no extra effort is required to update meshes, even when a discontinuity appears during the modeling process. The extendibility and potential of this framework is further demonstrated by the simulation of fluid-driven deformation and crack propagation in elastomers .},

  abstract     = {Triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMSs) have attracted great attention due to their distinct advantages such as high strength and light weight compared to traditional lattice structures. Most previous works focus on forward prediction of the mechanical behaviors of TPMSs. Inverse design of the configurations based on customized loading curves would be of great value in engineering applications such as energy absorption. Inspired by TPMSs, we propose the concept of the shell-based mechanical metamaterial (SMM) in this work, which possesses the main geometrical features and mechanical properties of TPMSs. A novel approach, combining machine learning (ML) for high efficiency and genetic algorithm (GA) for global optimization, is put forward to inversely design the configuration of SMM. Two strategies are introduced to develop artificial neural networks (ANNs) for the prediction of their loading curves under compression. GA is then employed to design objective configurations with customized loading curves. The connection between the loading curves and deformation modes is also illustrated to demonstrate the values of such inverse design. SMM with a strain-hardening curve tends to exhibit globally uniform deformation, while SMM with a strain-softening curve tends to present layer-by-layer deformation during compression, which is demonstrated by experiments and simulations. This work fills the blanks of inverse design of SMM with customized loading curves and contributes to the concept of structure design combining ML and traditional optimization approaches.},

The model relies on a treatment by Lu and Papadopoulos, who made use of the postulate of covariance for an anisotropic elasto-plastic solid and derived constitutive equations of evolving anisotropies at finite strains. The latter is tantamount to the notion of plastic spin. This treatment does not rely on a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient . We test our model on in-plane sheet-metal forming processes, which are governed by the evolution of pre-existing preferred material orientations. Hence, we advocate an orthotropic yield criterion directed by evolving structural tensors to describe this material behaviour. Our formulation yields two key findings. Firstly, the covariant formulation of plasticity yields suitable evolution equations for the structural tensors characterising the symmetry group of the orthotropic yield function. Secondly, the constitutive equations for the plastic variables and the structural tensors, which are both symmetric second-order tensors, give results that are in good agreement with experimental and numerical findings from in-plane sheet forming processes .},

  abstract     = {Fictitious domain methods, such as the Finite Cell Method (FCM), allow for an efficient and accurate simulation of complex geometries by utilizing higher-order shape functions and an unfitted discretization based on rectangular elements. Since the mesh does not conform to the geometry, cut elements arise that are intersected by domain boundaries. For optimal convergence rates and the efficiency of the simulation in general, special integration schemes have to be used in such elements. In this contribution, the often used, robust octree-decomposition-based integration scheme is enhanced by a novel approach reducing the computational effort when evaluating the discontinuous integrals. This is realized by introducing an additional step, in which the local integration mesh is simplified using data compression techniques leading to fewer integration domains/points. An important advantage of the proposed method is that it can be added in a modular fashion to already existing codes. While it inherits all desired properties of the octree-decomposition-based integration scheme, it significantly reduces the number of integration points and has hardly any negative effect on the simulation accuracy. In this paper, the proposed integration scheme is introduced in detail, and investigated by means of numerical examples in the context of 3D non-linear problems.},

  abstract     = {Embedded Runge–Kutta (RK) methods provide an attractive methodology for solution of initial value problems (IVP) by means of adaptive step size control. According to Fehlbergs suggestion, only one extra function calculation is required to estimate the local error of the embedded method. In the present paper, this methodology is applied to three prominent low order implicit RK-schemes. To this end, new embedded Butcher-tableaus are presented for the implicit Euler-method, the trapezoidal-rule and the midpoint-rule by means of corresponding higher order RK-schemes. In order to account for the global error, an asymptotically exact global error estimator is derived for the so-called reversed embedded RK-method. Moreover, a cause of order reduction is illustrated by aid of a weak discontinuous formulation. It is prevented in a new hybrid integration algorithm by means of a Hermite interpolation for the source term of the IVP, and its implementation renders a convenient “node-to-node” stepping scheme for a laser beam simulation. Two numerical examples are presented with the following main results: The higher order convergence behaviors of the proposed new RK-schemes are verified, its successful performances for asymptotically exact global error estimation of the reversed embedded RK-method are shown, the proposed methodology is illustrated for two different global error functions, and the desired effect of the hybrid algorithm to prevent order reduction is illustrated.},

  abstract     = {The outbreak of COVID-19, beginning in 2019 and continuing through the time of writing, has led to renewed interest in the mathematical modeling of infectious disease. Recent works have focused on partial differential equation (PDE) models, particularly reaction–diffusion models, able to describe the progression of an epidemic in both space and time. These studies have shown generally promising results in describing and predicting COVID-19 progression. However, people often travel long distances in short periods of time , leading to nonlocal transmission of the disease. Such contagion dynamics are not well-represented by diffusion alone. In contrast, ordinary differential equation (ODE) models may easily account for this behavior by considering disparate regions as nodes in a network, with the edges defining nonlocal transmission. In this work, we attempt to combine these modeling paradigms via the introduction of a network structure within a reaction–diffusion PDE system . This is achieved through the definition of a population-transfer operator, which couples disjoint and potentially distant geographic regions, facilitating nonlocal population movement between them. We provide analytical results demonstrating that this operator does not disrupt the physical consistency or mathematical well-posedness of the system, and verify these results through numerical experiments. We then use this technique to simulate the COVID-19 epidemic in the Brazilian region of Rio de Janeiro, showcasing its ability to capture important nonlocal behaviors, while maintaining the advantages of a reaction–diffusion model for describing local dynamics.},

A spline is a piecewise-defined function that satisfies continuity constraints between adjacent cells in a mesh. U-splines differ from existing spline constructions, such as Non-Uniform Rational B-splines (NURBS), subdivision surfaces, T-splines, and hierarchical B-splines, in that they can accommodate local variation in cell size, polynomial degree, and smoothness simultaneously over more varied mesh configurations. Mixed cell types (e.g., triangle and quadrilateral cells in the same mesh) and T-junctions are also supported, although the continuity of interfaces with triangle and tetrahedral cells is limited in the present work. The U-spline algorithm introduces a new technique for using local null space solutions to construct basis functions for the global spline null space problem. The U-spline construction is presented for curves, surfaces, and volumes with higher dimensional generalizations possible. A set of requirements are given to ensure that the U-spline basis is positive, forms a partition of unity, is complete, and is locally linearly independent.},

Here, we present a mesoscale infection transmission model for human occupied indoor spaces, by integrating an agent-based human interaction model with a flow physics model for respiratory droplet dynamics and transport. We outline the mathematical and algorithmic details of the modeling framework, and demonstrate its validity using two simple simulation scenarios that verify each of the major sub-models. We then present a detailed case-study of infection transmission in a model indoor space with 60 human occupants; using a systematic set of simulations representing various flow scenarios.

Infection can also modify the mechanical properties of host cells, altering the mechanical equilibrium of tissues. In order to advance our understanding of host–pathogen interactions, simplified in vitro models are normally used. However, in vitro studies present certain limitations that can be alleviated by the use of computer-based models. As complementary tools these computational models, in conjunction with in vitro experiments, can enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of action underlying infection processes. In this work, we extend our previous computer-based model to simulate infection of epithelial cells with the intracellular bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes . We found that forces generated by host cells play a regulatory role in the mechanobiological response to infection. After infection, in silico cells alter their mechanical properties in order to achieve a new mechanical equilibrium. The model pointed the key role of cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix interactions in the mechanical competition of bacterial infection. The obtained results provide a more detailed description of cell and tissue responses to infection, and could help inform future studies focused on controlling bacterial dissemination and the outcome of infection processes.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we study the efficacy of combining machine-learning methods with projection-based model reduction techniques for creating data-driven surrogate models of computationally expensive, high-fidelity physics models. Such surrogate models are essential for many-query applications e.g., engineering design optimization and parameter estimation, where it is necessary to invoke the high-fidelity model sequentially, many times. Surrogate models are usually constructed for individual scalar quantities . However there are scenarios where a spatially varying field needs to be modeled as a function of the model’s input parameters. We develop a method to do so, using projections to represent spatial variability while a machine-learned model captures the dependence of the model’s response on the inputs. The method is demonstrated on modeling the heat flux and pressure on the surface of the HIFiRE-1 geometry in a Mach 7.16 turbulent flow. The surrogate model is then used to perform Bayesian estimation of freestream conditions and parameters of the SST (Shear Stress Transport) turbulence model embedded in the high-fidelity (Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes) flow simulator, using shock-tunnel data. The paper provides the first-ever Bayesian calibration of a turbulence model for complex hypersonic turbulent flows. We find that the primary issues in estimating the SST model parameters are the limited information content of the heat flux and pressure measurements and the large model-form error encountered in a certain part of the flow.},

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, which focus on the estimation of indoor airflow are not conclusive about the impact of using Heat, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems on diseases’ transmission risk while travelling with open windows has shown to be a good strategy to renew the indoor air. In order to estimate the COVID-2 airborne transmission by aerosols, a real urban bus was simulated by CFD. Twenty passengers (containing the driver) were included in the model with a typical inhalation–exhalation breathing cycle. The concentrations of air exhaled by ten of them were tracked during 30 min using Eulerian scalar tracer, and the concentrations inhaled by the twenty passengers were monitored. Then, the well-known Wells &amp; Riley risk model was applied in order to estimate the cumulative inhaled viruses and the subsequent transmission risk. Four scenarios were considered: HVAC off with closed windows (Case 1), HVAC on with closed windows and 100% of air recirculation (Case 2), HVAC on with closed windows and 75% of air recirculation (Case 3), and HVAC off and the bus moving at 20 km/h with some windows opened (Case 4). Results clearly showed that the motionless condition (Case 1) caused the highest transmission risk around the emitters with negligible risk far from them. On the contrary, the HVAC on reduced the maximum risk to only 6% (Case 2) and 3% (Case 3) of the risk estimated for Case 1. Finally, travelling with some open windows promotes a large air renewal, reducing almost completely the transmission risk.},

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the greatest challenges to humanity nowadays. COVID-19 virus can replicate in the host’s larynx region, which is in contrast to other viruses that replicate in lungs only, i.e. SARS. This is conjectured to support a fast spread of COVID-19. However, there is sparse research in this field about quantitative comparison of virus load in the larynx for varying susceptible individuals . In this regard the lung geometry itself could influence the risk of reproducing more pathogens and consequently exhaling more virus. Disadvantageously, there are only sparse lung geometries available. To still be able to investigate realistic geometrical deviations we employ three different digital replicas of human airways up to the 7 7 th level of bifurcation, representing two realistic lungs (male and female) as well as a more simplified experimental model. Our aim is to investigate the influence of breathing scenarios on aerosol deposition in anatomically different, realistic human airways. In this context, we employ three levels of cardiovascular activity as well as reported experimental particle size distributions by means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with special focus on the larynx region to enable new insights into the local virus loads in human respiratory tracts. In addition, the influence of more realistic boundary conditions is investigated by performing transient simulations of a complete respiratory cycle in the upper lung regions of the considered respiratory models, focusing in particular on deposition in the oral cavity, the laryngeal region, and trachea, while simplifying the tracheobronchial tree. The aerosol deposition is modeled via OpenFOAM \protect \relax \special {t4ht=®} by employing an Euler-Lagrangian frame including steady and unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) resolved turbulent flow using the k- ω ω -SST and k- ω ω -SST DES turbulence models. We observed that the respiratory geometry altered the local deposition patterns, especially in the laryngeal region. Despite the larynx region, the effects of varying flow rate for the airway geometries considered were found to be similar in the majority of respiratory tract regions. For all particle size distributions considered, localized particle accumulation occurred in the larynx of all considered lung models, which were more pronounced for larger particle size distributions. Moreover, it was found, that employing transient simulations instead of steady-state analysis, the overall particle deposition pattern is maintained, however with a stronger intensity in the transient cases.},

  abstract     = {A computational framework is developed that researchers in the field can easily implement and subsequently use as an efficient tool to study the immune-response to a vaccine injection. There are three main components to this work: Part I-Digital-twin construction: An approach is developed that efficiently simulates the time-transient proliferation of cells/antibodies (proteins) and regulator/antigens (deactivated toxin) to an injected vaccine within tissue possessing complex heterogeneous microstructure. Here, we use the terms “cells” and “antibodies”, as well as “regulator” and “antigen” interchangeably. The approach utilizes two strongly-coupled conservation laws : (a) Conservation Law 1: comprises (a) rate of change of cells/antibodies, (b) cellular/antibody migration, (c) cellular/antibody proliferation controlled by a cell/antibody mitosis regulating chemical (antigen), (d) cell/antibody apoptosis and (b) Conservation Law 2: comprises (a) rate of change of the cell/antibody mitosis chemical regulator/antigen, (b) regulator/antigen diffusion, (c) regulator production by cells/antibody and (d) regulator/antigen decay. Part II-Efficient computation: A technique based on a voxel (3D “volume pixels”) representation of tissue microstructures and corresponding digital solution methods is developed for the calculations, which avoids computationally expensive steps involved in usual Finite Element procedures such as topologically conforming meshing , mapping, volume integration, stiffness matrix generation and matrix-based solution methods. The process proceeds by converting the tissue microstructure into voxels. The problem then becomes “digital” on a regular “voxel-grid”, directly manipulating voxel values, allowing extremely fast methods to be used to construct derivatives and to iteratively solve the system with minimal memory requirements. Part III-Machine-learning: The rapid and efficient computation allows for many vaccines to be tested quickly and uses a genomic-based Machine-Learning Algorithm to optimize the system. This is particularly useful for rapid design of next-generation vaccines and boosters for disease strain mutations. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the results, with the overall goal being to provide a computational framework to rapidly design and deploy a vaccine for a targeted response.},

While traditional SIR models for infectious diseases can reproduce such waves, they fail to capture two key features. First, SIR models are unable to represent short-duration super-spreader events which often trigger infection waves in a community. Second, SIR models predict exponential decay to an asymptotic state after the infection wave peaks. In contrast, observations suggest a slower algebraic decay. In this paper, we develop models for the basic reproduction number R 0 R0 to capture these features. To generate quantitative estimates for R 0 R0 during super-spreader events, we reconcile the SIR framework with the Wells–Riley model for airborne disease transmission. We also show that algebraic decay emerges naturally if models are modified to account for the behavioral tendency towards relaxing precautions as the infected fraction decreases. This approach merges for the first time behavioral with physicochemical aspects.},

The results show an excellent comparison between the solutions obtained using the continuous model and simulations evaluating the forces on each particle individually. Distinct advantages of the continuous approach are a much lower computational overhead, a better load balance and ease of parallelization.

The model combines computational fluid dynamics and computational crowd dynamics in order to be able to provide accurate tracing of viral matter that is exhaled, transmitted and inhaled via aerosols. The examples shown indicate that even with modest computing resources, the propagation and transmission of viral matter can be simulated for relatively large areas with thousands of square meters, hundreds of pedestrians and several minutes of physical time. The results obtained and insights gained from these simulations can be used to inform global pandemic propagation models, increasing substantially their accuracy.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a newly developed fast model order reduction boundary element method (FMORBEM) for three-dimensional acoustic wave problems with the impedance boundary condition at relatively high frequencies. This method proceeds in two phases: a precomputation phase and a solution phase. In the precomputation phase, a simple yet powerful cutoff technique which benefits from the amplitude decay property of the kernel functions in the Burton–Miller formulation is proposed. Because it does not operate on the underlying boundary element full-order model (FOM), the computational cost and memory consumption in the process of offline constructing a proper subspace are nearly O ( N ) O(N) complexity with N N being the number of degrees of freedom of the FOM. After that, the complete system matrices are computed and projected onto the spanned subspace column-by-column, yielding acceptable computational complexity of O ( N 2 ) O(N2) . In the solution phase, the resulting reduced-order model (ROM) allows for efficient storage and fast analyses, which merely requires O ( n 2 ) O(n2) arithmetic operations by using direct solvers with n n being the dimension of the ROM. Application of this method to the high-frequency scattering analyses of acoustic systems, i.e. simple sphere models and complex scatterers, shows the improved computational efficiency and reduced memory requirement as compared to the conventional boundary element method and further illustrates that it may be competitive with the fast multipole method based on iterative solvers.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the concept of predetermined breaking points in topology optimization . The aim is to propose and investigate a novel formulation to design optimized topologies in which one can control where failure will occur first in case of overload; in addition, the optimized topology must withstand the design load after the damaged part is removed. In order to achieve this goal, a stress-constrained formulation based on two realizations of material distributions is proposed: one realization represents the nominal design, without damage, and the other represents the damaged design. In the nominal design, the predetermined damage region is defined, which is the region where failure is programmed to occur first in case of overload. The design constraints are defined in a way that ensures that a structural member is formed within the predetermined damage region and that the maximum von Mises equivalent stress of this member is slightly larger than the maximum von Mises stress in the rest of the structure. After failure has occurred, stress constraints are employed to ensure that the resulting design without the damaged part still resists the applied load. Two design problems with several variants are addressed: the L-shaped and the MBB beam problems. Numerical investigations demonstrate that: (1) the conventional design is extremely sensitive to localized damage of structural members and, moreover, its almost fully stressed configuration does not allow to predict where failure will occur first in case of overload; (2) the proposed formulation for predetermined breaking points is able to provide optimized structures where one knows in advance the region where failure is expected to occur first; in addition, the structure remains safe after the damaged part is removed.},

  abstract     = {Two of the most significant challenges in uncertainty quantification pertain to the high computational cost for simulating complex physical models and the high dimension of the random inputs. In applications of practical interest, both of these problems are encountered, and standard methods either fail or are not feasible. To overcome the current limitations, we present a generalized formulation of a Bayesian multi-fidelity Monte-Carlo ( BMFMC ) framework that can exploit lower-fidelity model versions in a small data regime. The goal of our analysis is an efficient and accurate estimation of the complete probabilistic response for high-fidelity models. BMFMC circumvents the curse of dimensionality by learning the relationship between the outputs of a reference high-fidelity model and potentially several lower-fidelity models. While the continuous formulation is mathematically exact and independent of the low-fidelity model’s accuracy, we address challenges associated with the small data regime (i.e., only a small number of 50 to 300 high-fidelity model runs can be performed). Specifically, we complement the formulation with a set of informative input features at no extra cost. Despite the inaccurate and noisy information that some low-fidelity models provide, we demonstrate that accurate and certifiable estimates for the quantities of interest can be obtained for uncertainty quantification problems in high stochastic dimensions, with significantly fewer high-fidelity model runs than state-of-the-art methods for uncertainty quantification. We illustrate our approach by applying it to challenging numerical examples such as Navier–Stokes flow simulations and fluid–structure interaction problems.},

In this context, the material degradation is incorporated using an integral-type non-local isotropic damage model. A fully automatic preprocessing is enabled by following the octree-based mesh generation paradigm. To handle neighbouring elements with different sizes and to avoid hanging nodes in the generated mesh, polyhedral elements are implemented within the framework of the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM). A pre-computation approach is advocated to develop a highly efficient solver, where the limited number of master cells in a balanced octree grid are exploited. The parallelisation is carried out using a mesh-partitioning technique and message-passing-interface (MPI) directives, which is highly complementary to the use in high-performance computing (HPC) facilities. In order to showcase the performance of the proposed solver, a problem of practical interest is selected, featuring the analysis of an XCT image-based model of concrete containing about 1 billion voxels. The simulated results have been obtained within minutes by exploiting the computational power of approximately 12k cores.},

  abstract     = {This publication presents a robust and efficient approach for fully CAD-integrated analyses of solids, which aims to reduce the current modeling effort for static and transient problems, including implicit and explicit dynamic simulations. Generating high-quality finite element meshes of solid structures is still a time- and labor-intensive process. Since embedded methods do not require sophisticated boundary-fitted meshes, they have gained popularity in recent years. However, most approaches tend to be computationally expensive due to numerous integration points, especially within trimmed elements. Moreover, their practical applicability in explicit dynamics is often limited because the classically used C 0 C0 continuous discretization field combined with trimming leads to infeasible time steps. In the following, we present methodologies addressing both of these shortcomings. The basic idea is to embed a three-dimensional object into a uniform C p − 1 Cp−1 continuous B-Spline cuboid, where the solid boundary representation provided by CAD is used as trimming surfaces to distinguish between material and void domain. Our primary focus is on constructing highly efficient quadrature rules for both trimmed and full knot spans, which accelerates required matrix formations and, in particular, drastically reduces the simulation times of explicit transient analyses. To fully exploit the potential of the B-Spline bases employed, first- and second-order reduced integration schemes are investigated in addition to optimal quadrature constructions. Despite the appearance of arbitrarily shaped domains, trimmed knot spans are evaluated at most with the same number of integration points as required for full Gaussian quadrature while maintaining optimal convergence in the energy norm. For full knot spans, savings in the number of quadrature points beyond 90% with respect to full Gaussian quadrature are achieved without observing any degradation in accuracy. The proposed methodologies are critically assessed based on scientific benchmarks of increasing complexity and a detailed industrial example, completing the design-through-analysis workflow by performing postprocessing operations directly on the deformed solid CAD model .},

Attention is also paid to the damage evolution tendency in terms of the definition of the yield function. Based on the reviewed features, we originally formulate the proposed model, which separately accommodates two damage variables for elasticity and plasticity. Its constitutive work density consists of elastic, plastic hardening, and damage hardening components. Evolution laws for plasticity and damage are derived by using separate threshold (yield) functions while having similar formats so that those for damage hold variational and thermodynamic consistencies. Also, the proposed model is equipped with thresholds and coefficients to control the amount of damage driving force. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the characteristic features of the proposed model and the ability to mimic the typical fracture behavior of elastoplastic materials.},

  abstract     = {There has been a massive increase in research interest towards applying data driven methods to problems in mechanics, with a particular emphasis on using data driven methods for predictive modeling and design of materials with novel functionality. While traditional machine learning (ML) methods have enabled many breakthroughs, they rely on the assumption that the training (observed) data and testing (unseen) data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d). However, when these standard ML approaches are applied to real world mechanics problems with unknown test environments, they can be very sensitive to data distribution shifts, and can break down when evaluated on test datasets that violate the i.i.d. assumption. In contrast, out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization approaches assume that the data contained in test environments are allowed to shift (i.e., violate the i.i.d. assumption). To date, multiple methods have been proposed to improve the OOD generalization of ML methods. However, most of these OOD generalization methods have been focused on classification problems, driven in part by the lack of benchmark datasets available for OOD regression problems. Thus, the efficiency of these OOD generalization methods on regression problems, which are typically more relevant to mechanics research than classification problems, is unknown. To address this, we perform a fundamental study of OOD generalization methods for regression problems in mechanics. Specifically, we identify three OOD generalization problems: covariate shift, mechanism shift, and sampling bias. For each problem, we create two benchmark examples that extend the Mechanical MNIST dataset collection, and we investigate the performance of popular OOD generalization methods on these mechanics-specific regression problems. Our numerical experiments show that in most cases, while the OOD algorithms perform better compared to traditional ML methods on these OOD generalization problems, there is a compelling need to develop more robust OOD methods that can generalize the notion of invariance across multiple OOD scenarios. Overall, we expect that this study, as well as the associated open access benchmark datasets, will enable further development of OOD methods for mechanics specific regression problems.},

The adaptive-refinement procedure is guided by a two-level hierarchical a-posteriori error estimate, and it effectively resolves the spatial multiscale behavior of the diffuse-interface model. To improve the robustness of the solution procedure and avoid severe time-step restrictions for small-interface thicknesses, we introduce an ɛ ɛ -continuation procedure, in which the diffuse interface thickness ( ɛ ɛ ) are enlarged on coarse meshes, and the mobility is scaled accordingly. To further accelerate the computations and improve robustness, we apply a modified Backward Euler scheme in the initial stages of the adaptive-refinement procedure in each time step, and a Crank–Nicolson scheme in the final stages of the refinement procedure. To enhance the robustness of the nonlinear solution procedure, we introduce a partitioned solution procedure for the linear tangent problems in Newton’s method, based on a decomposition of the NSCH system into its NS and CH subsystems. We conduct a systematic investigation of the conditioning of the monolithic NSCH tangent matrix and of its NS and CH subsystems for a representative 2D model problem. To illustrate the properties of the presented adaptive simulation framework, we present numerical results for a 2D oscillating water droplet suspended in air, and we validate the obtained results versus those of a corresponding sharp-interface model.},

  abstract     = {Mesh adaptation for immersed solid is one of the most challenging topics in computational mechanics. In this contribution, we propose a novel anisotropic adaptive body-fitted mesh method in particular for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) where the boundary layers and the high gradient of a solution at a fluid–solid interface play a major role. It is characterized by its simplicity to implement, and by its generality to tackle complex geometries without additional efforts. It combines two successive iterations, knowing that the order of each one is important. First, a gradient based metric construction uses the gradients of the level-set of any immersed object to generate an anisotropic well adapted mesh. Since the elements are well stretched along the interface, and therefore the interface passes through these elements, a second step is implemented and applied. It is based on R-adaptation and swapping, to provide a sharp anisotropic fitted mesh. The proposed test cases, with and without a CFD solution, show the flexibility and the accuracy of the proposed automated h- and r- adaption framework designed for immersed methods.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a localizing gradient damage model (LGDM) based on the generalized micromorphic theory is adopted to investigate the quasi-brittle fracture behaviour of concrete at mesoscale for the first time. Micro Computed Tomography (CT) image-based realistic concrete models are generated including aggregates, mortar, pores, and aggregate-mortar interfacial transition zones (ITZs). In the LGDM, an additional micro-force equilibrium equation is formulated with a damage-dependent interaction function to prevent spurious energetic interactions during the softening stage. The damage driving forces are evaluated as history variables through the maximum nonlocal equivalent strains at the integration points. The stiffness matrices and residual vectors for displacement and nonlocal equivalent strain fields are formulated through the conventional shape function and strain matrices of finite elements , by using the user-defined element (UEL) subroutine implemented with the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm to improve numerical performance. Typical nonlinear fracture benchmarks are presented to investigate the variability of mesoscale fracture evolution, crack trajectories, and load–displacement curves as well as numerical performance. It is found that the LGDM significantly improves the computational efficiency over the conventional phase-field cohesive zone model (PFCZM) with 60% savings of CPU time, and holds great potential for multiscale fracture evaluation of quasi-brittle composite materials, through the high-fidelity representation of real materials’ microstructures, and flexible simulation of the complicated nonlinear fracture without the need for re-meshing or mesh enrichments.},

We consider three test cases: Cook’s membrane (static, almost incompressible), a twist test (static, incompressible) and a cardiac model (complex material, time dependent, almost incompressible). Our results suggest that quasi-Newton methods should be preferred for compressible mechanics, whereas inexact Newton–Krylov methods should be preferred for incompressible problems . We show that these claims are also backed up by the convergence analysis of the methods. In any case, all methods present adequate performance, and provide a significant speed-up over the standard Newton–Krylov method, with a CPU time reduction exceeding 50% in the best cases.},

Coupling the isogeometric paradigm with the framework of immersed boundary methods is an attractive practical strategy. In this paper, we consider general variable-coefficient Poisson problems and propose a new formulation of an immersed Galerkin discretization based on tensor-product cardinal B-splines. The weakly imposed boundary conditions do not require any tuning of user-defined penalty or stabilization parameters, and the system matrices are symmetric for symmetric problems. We analyze the spectral behavior of such matrices and prove that they enjoy an asymptotic spectral distribution when the matrix size tends to infinity. We provide an explicit description of this asymptotic distribution which turns out to have a canonical structure incorporating the coefficients of the differential operator and the discretization technique. In the spirit of the isogeometric paradigm, trimmed (single-patch) geometry maps can be treated by means of the same immersed approach. Therefore, we are able to describe spectral properties of matrices in the context of trimmed geometries as well. The theoretical findings are complemented with a selection of numerical experiments.},

The condition number is proved to be uniformly bounded under both Stokes and Darcy dominant cases with a deluxe scaling for the parameters with jumps only across the subdomain interface.

This normalized internal variable allows the model to be independent on the sign of the load and dissipate different fracture energies (tensile, compressive and potentially shear) in a natural way.

However, in turn, it raises a critical issue in determining the coupling factor—energy degradation function. This work aims to tackle the problems induced by assigning a degradation function empirically, including the inaccurate reproduction of critical loads and unphysical stiffness reduction prior to fracture. Inspired by the concepts of data-driven computational mechanics, we propose a data-driven phase field scheme to enhance the numerical reproduction of physically consistent fracture responses. This method collaborates a datasets generator, a classifier, a physical-constrained learning algorithm, and the phase field solver in an extensible modular framework, allowing searching for the optimized damage constitutive relation in a carefully designed degradation function space with flexible form. In the case studies, mode I and mode II fracture characteristics of linear elastic and hyperelastic materials are well predicted by the data-driven phase field algorithm, which learns and derives the results from simple scalar datasets, controlling the average error lower than 10%. When introducing the input dataset noise, the model still shows robustness. The results demonstrate the model’s interpretability, thermodynamical consistency, and accuracy.},

In fact, an increase of basis degree may adversely decrease the frequency accuracy for the lumped mass isogeometric analysis of structural vibrations. In this work, it is found that the non-interpolatory property of basis functions attributes to this unfavorable performance of lumped mass isogeometric formulation and the significance of basis interpolation for accurate lumped mass formulation is disclosed. Meanwhile, it is revealed that the continuity rather than positivity of basis functions controls the frequency accuracy in isogeometric structural vibration analysis. Consequently, a set of interpolatory transformed basis functions are introduced to construct accurate isogeometric lumped mass matrices. These transformed basis functions inherit the smoothness and geometry exactness of the original isogeometric basis functions. It turns out that the lumped mass isogeometric formulation based upon the interpolatory transformed basis functions not only improves the frequency accuracy, but also simultaneously eliminates the spurious modes produced by the standard lumped mass isogeometric formulation. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed lumped mass isogeometric formulation with interpolatory transformed basis functions yields much more favorable frequency accuracy in comparison with the standard lumped mass isogeometric approach.},

  abstract     = {Shared rheology elements of soft tissues and additive-manufactured amorphous thermoplastics benefit from a common visco-hyperelastic and visco-plastic constitutive framework. For finite-strain and general visco/elastic/plastic constitutive laws, allowing full anisotropy, we use the Kröner–Lee decomposition of the deformation gradient combined with Mandel stress-based yield function. Relatively weak conditions are necessary for specific laws to be incorporated in this framework. For example, stress-like variables present in visco-elasticity are removed from the list of constitutive unknowns. Constitutive iteration is performed for the elastic Cauchy–Green tensor C e Ce and the plastic multiplier increment Δ λ Δλ . The source is here the right Cauchy–Green tensor provided by any discretization . For the integration of the flow law we adopt a scaled/squared series approximation of the matrix exponential . The exact Jacobian of the second Piola–Kirchhoff stress is determined with respect to this source, consistent with the integrator. The resulting system is produced by symbolic source-code generation for each yield function and hyperelastic strain-energy density function with each of the viscous terms added. The constitutive system is solved by a damped Newton–Raphson algorithm with the corresponding stress error being extensively assessed with stress error maps. A cellular beam structure is analyzed and results compared with experiments from our group. Some of the symbolic calculations and closed-form solutions are beyond what is manually achievable and therefore the symbolic sources for this work are made available in a source code repository.},

  abstract     = {Lattice-like structures can provide a combination of high stiffness with light weight that is useful in many applications, but a resolved finite element mesh of such structures results in a computationally expensive discretization . This computational expense may be particularly burdensome in many-query applications, such as optimization. We develop a stress-constrained topology optimization method for lattice-like structures that uses component-wise reduced order models as a cheap surrogate, providing accurate computation of stress fields while greatly reducing run time relative to a full order model. We demonstrate the ability of our method to produce large reductions in mass while respecting a constraint on the maximum stress in a pair of test problems. The ROM methodology provides a speedup of about 150x in forward solves compared to full order static condensation and provides a relative error of less than 5% in the relaxed stress.},

To tackle this problem, this study proposes a new moment-based method for reliability analysis of complex mechanical systems which incorporates the advanced mixed-degree cubature formula and vine copula function. To start with, a method integrating the vine copula function and Rosenblatt transformation is developed for transferring the uncertainty with dependent random variables , in which the vine copula is applied for depicting the correlation between random variables. An advanced mixed-degree cubature formula is then established for calculating statistical moments of performance function, which enables to capture sufficient uncertainty information of variables after rotating integral node. The Hermite polynomial model is adopted here to reconstruct the probability distribution of performance function with the statistical moments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, four illustrative examples are implemented in this study, in which Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) and dimension-reduction techniques, are performed for comparisons. The results show that the proposed method can handle multi-dimensional correlation effectively and well balance computational accuracy and efficiency for both statistical moments and probability distribution evaluations.},

  abstract     = {Despite many noteworthy contributions, the computational modeling of arbitrary fracture configurations and in particular, the quantification of size effect in quasi-brittle solids, still remains a challenging issue. In this work we proposed a model scaling approach for fracture and size effect simulations in solids. It employs only the geometric transformation relations and thus applies to any material model for fracture. Those popular models, i.e., the cohesive zone model , the smeared crack model and the phase-field cohesive zone model, are considered. With the geometric scaling factor intrinsically incorporated in the formulation, the resulting scaled models are able to predict the energetic size effect of a series of geometrically similar structures by parametric numerical simulations of the reference one. The 1-D analytical results of all the three scaled models are coincident with those from the underlying unscaled counterparts, validating the proposed model scaling approach. As it is independent of the mesh discretization and insensitive to the length scale , the scaled phase-field cohesive zone model ( PF-CZM ) is adopted for application to several representative benchmark tests of concrete and ice with mode-I and mixed I+II failure modes. The numerical results demonstrate that, owing to the strength-based crack nucleation criterion, the energy-based crack propagation criterion and the variational principle based path chooser, as well as the geometric scaling factor , are all incorporated into a standalone framework, the scaled PF-CZM is able to predict both the type II size effect law of pre-cracked quasi-brittle structures and the type I size effect law of intact ones. Moreover, those laborious manual manipulations in the numerical modeling of a large size range of geometrically similar structures, e.g., spatial discretization , enforcement of loading and boundary conditions, postprocessing of output data, etc., need to be done only once on the reference structure. These advantages make the scaled PF-CZM rather promising in the quantification of size effect in quasi-brittle structures.},

In this new framework the so-called bond-associated sub-horizon concept is utilized to enhance the stability and accuracy at extreme large deformation of the solid skeleton. The stabilized nonlocal velocity gradient in the deformed configuration is used to update the effective force state from a critical state based visco-plastic constitutive model for unsaturated soils. The updated Lagrangian periporomechanics paradigm is numerically implemented through an explicit Newmark scheme for high-performance computing.

Here, we present a mathematical model and an algorithm to simulate elasto-capillary problems involving compound droplets. Such problems are of pivotal importance in pharmaceutical, biological and food industrial applications. We adopt a phase-field model described by the ternary Navier–Stokes–Cahn–Hilliard equations for the three immiscible fluids and a neo-Hookean model for the solid. We define a fluid–solid surface energy function, which determines the fluid–solid wettability and the tractions transmitted to the solid at the fluid–solid interface.

  abstract     = {We present a monolithic geometric multigrid preconditioner for solving fluid–solid interaction problems in Stokes limit. The problems are discretized by a spatially adaptive high-order meshless method, the generalized moving least squares (GMLS) with adaptive h h -refinement. For solving fluid–solid interaction problems, we need to deal with a tightly coupled system consisting of the flow field and solid bodies, resulting in a linear system of equations with a block structure. In Stokes limit, solid kinematics can be dominated by the singularities governing the lubrication effects. Resolving those singularities with adaptive h h -refinement can lead to an ill-conditioned linear system of equations. The key ingredients of the multigrid preconditioner include the interpolation and restriction operators and the smoothers. For constructing the interpolation and restriction operators, we utilize the geometric information of hierarchical sets of GMLS nodes generated in adaptive h h -refinement. We build decoupled smoothers through physics-based splitting and then combine them via a multiplicative overlapping Schwarz approach. Through numerical examples with the inclusion of different numbers and shapes of solid bodies, we demonstrate the performance and assess the scalability of the designed preconditioner. As the total degrees of freedom and the number of solid bodies increase, the proposed monolithic geometric multigrid preconditioner can ensure convergence and good scalability when using the Krylov iterative method for solving the linear systems of equations generated from the spatially adaptive GMLS discretization. More specifically, for a fixed number of solid bodies, as the discretization resolution is incrementally refined, the number of iterations of the linear solver can be maintained at the same level, indicating nearly linear scalability of our preconditioner with respect to the total degrees of freedom. When the number of solid bodies N s Ns increases, the number of iterations is nearly proportional to N s Ns , implying the sublinear optimality with respect to the number of solid bodies.},

The proposed method allows us to follow in time the evolution of studied phenomena in a fully-automatic (based on error estimators), precise (respecting user-prescribed accuracies) and efficient (in terms of memory space and computational time) way. This algorithm is based on the multilevel Local Defect Correction (LDC) refinement approach. We first introduce an algorithmic extension of the LDC method to nonlinear quasi-static problems and provide key aspects associated with its practical implementation. Generic still open AMR-related questions associated with dynamic mesh adaptation, such as fields transfer between time steps and discretization error control over time, are then addressed. We propose a straightforward and efficient error non accumulation strategy lying on the introduction of the unbalance residual as an initial source term of the problem. Moreover, a reliable remeshing algorithm is introduced, aiming to limit the number of mesh regenerations over time while guaranteeing the fulfillment of user-prescribed errors. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on several numerical experiments, in 2 D 2D and 3 D 3D , with different types of material behavior as well as evolving loads. Thanks to its natural ability to generate a hierarchy of meshes of limited sizes that dynamically follow the evolution over time of studied phenomena, the proposed extension of the LDC method clearly appears to be of great potential for many challenging applications.},

The CNN approach provides a significant speedup, especially in the context of heterogeneous or functionally graded materials. Another application is uncertainty quantification, where many expansive evaluations are required. However, one bottleneck of this approach is the large number of training microstructures needed. This work closes this gap by proposing a generative adversarial network tailored towards three-dimensional microstructure generation. The lightweight algorithm is able to learn the underlying properties of the material from a single μ μ CT-scan without the need of explicit descriptors. During prediction time, the network can produce unique three-dimensional microstructures with the same properties of the original data in a fraction of seconds and at consistently high quality.},

In particular, by uniting the data structure represented by a graph and the neural networks with learnable parameters, the HIGNN constructs surrogate modeling for the mobility tensor of particles which is the key to predicting the dynamics of particles subject to HI and external forces. To account for the many-body nature of HI, we generalize the state-of-the-art GNN by introducing higher-order connectivity into the graph and the corresponding convolutional operation. For training the HIGNN, we only need the data for a small number of particles in the domain of interest, and hence the training cost can be maintained low. Once constructed, the HIGNN permits fast predictions of the particles’ velocities and is transferable to suspensions of different numbers/concentrations of particles in the same domain and to any external forcing. It has the ability to accurately capture both the long-range HI and short-range lubrication effects. We demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and transferability of the proposed HIGNN framework in a variety of systems. The requirement on computing resource is minimum: most simulations only require a desktop with one GPU ; the simulations for a large suspension of 100,000 particles call for up to 6 GPUs.},

  abstract     = {Inverse problems and, in particular, inferring unknown or latent parameters from data are ubiquitous in engineering simulations. A predominant viewpoint in identifying unknown parameters is Bayesian inference where both prior information about the parameters and the information from the observations via likelihood evaluations are incorporated into the inference process. In this paper, we adopt a similar viewpoint with a slightly different numerical procedure from standard inference approaches to provide insight about the localized behavior of unknown underlying parameters. We present a variational inference approach which mainly incorporates the observation data in a point-wise manner, i.e. we invert a limited number of observation data leveraging the gradient information of the forward map with respect to parameters, and find true individual samples of the latent parameters when the forward map is noise-free and one-to-one. For statistical calculations (as the ultimate goal in simulations), a large number of samples are generated from a trained neural network which serves as a transport map from the prior to posterior latent parameters. Our neural network machinery, developed as part of the inference framework and referred to as Neural Net Kernels (NNK), is based on hierarchical (deep) kernels which provide greater flexibility for training compared to standard neural networks. We showcase the effectiveness of our inference procedure in identifying bimodal and irregular distributions compared to a number of approaches including a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP)-based approach, Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling with both Metropolis–Hastings and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithms, and a Bayesian neural network approach, namely the widely-known Bayes by Backprop algorithm via a pedagogical example. We further apply our inference procedure to two and three dimensional topology optimization problems where we identify the latent parameters in the random field elastic modulus, modeled as a Karhunen–Loéve expansion, considering the high dimensional design iterate-displacement pair as training data. As future research, we discuss the application of this inference approach in identifying constitutive models in nonlinear elasticity and development of fast linear algebraic solvers for large scale similar, i.e. finite element-based inverse problems calculations.},

Loss term is the potential energy, optimized based on the principle of minimum potential energy. The loss term at the interfaces has the lower order derivative compared to the strong form PINN with subdomains. The advantage of the proposed method is higher efficiency, more accurate, and less hyperparameters than the strong form PINN with subdomains. Another advantage of the proposed method is that it can apply to complex geometries based on the special construction of the admissible function. To analyze its performance, the proposed method CENN is used to model representative PDEs, the examples include strong discontinuity, singularity, complex boundary, non-linear, and heterogeneous problems. Furthermore, it outperforms other methods when dealing with heterogeneous problems.},

In this regard, we extend a semi-implicit, pressure Poisson-based FSI scheme for non-Newtonian fluids to incorporate several models crucial for biomechanical applications. We consider Windkessel outlets to account for neglected downstream flow regions, realistic material fibre orientation and stressed reference geometries reconstructed from medical image data . Additionally, we incorporate vital numerical aspects, namely, stabilisations to counteract dominant convective effects and instabilities triggered by re-entrant flow, while a major contribution of this work is combining interface quasi-Newton methods with Robin coupling conditions to accelerate the partitioned (semi-)implicit coupling scheme. The numerical examples presented herein aim to finally bridge the gap to real-world applications, considering state-of-the-art modelling aspects and physiological parameters .

The material data sets of the foam are deduced here from representative microscopic material volumes. These volume elements capture the stochastic characteristics of the open-cell microstructure and the properties of the polyurethane material . Their computation provides the required stress–strain data used in the macroscopic finite element computations without postulating a specific constitutive model. The paper shows how to derive suitable material data sets for the different cases of (non-)linear and (an-)isotropic material behavior efficiently. Exemplarily, we compare data-driven finite element computations with linearized and finite deformations and show that in a data-driven computation the linear kinematic is sufficiently accurate to capture the material’s non-linearity up to 50% of straining. The numerical example of a rubber sealing illustrates possible areas of application, the expenditure, and the proposed strategy’s versatility.},

  abstract     = {The interaction between multiphase fluids and structure in engineering is ubiquitous, in which the capture of the contact line between the multiphase fluids and the moving structure is challenging for numerical simulation. In this work, a surface flux correction-based immersed boundary-multiphase lattice Boltzmann flux solver (IB-MLBFS) is developed and applied to investigate the multiphase fluids–structure interaction. In addition to applying the velocity correction by the immersed boundary method (IBM) that has been widely applied in fluid–structure interaction (FSI) of single-phase flow, the surface flux correction is appended by IBM as well on the contact line between the multiphase fluids and the moving structure so that both the Dirichlet boundary condition and the Neumann boundary condition on the contact line are satisfied, which ensures the successful simulation of multiphase fluids–structure interaction. For the numerical study , the simulation of water entry of a half-buoyant cylinder is carried out first as the validation of the IB-MLBFS by comparing with results of both experiments and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). After that, the phenomena of interface entry and exit of a sphere with different densities from different initial positions are simulated to show the reliability of IB-MLBFS in complicated interface interaction. The instantaneous contours of fluids density and solid boundary are shown to illustrate the interface and the structure, and the hydrodynamic parameters such as the force and the displacement are given. The results conclude that the IB-MLBFS is reliable and has sufficient accuracy so that it can represent the details of the flow field and the dynamic response of the structure. For example, the phenomenon of the separated and the butted fluids surrounding the structure in this simulation has been clearly revealed, which indicates its wide application for multiphase fluids–structure interaction problems in engineering.},

Hence it is not only fully decoupled but also owns some desired properties of linearity and unconditional energy stability. The feature of full decoupling is achieved by introducing some auxiliary variables and designing additional ordinary differential equations which are used for discretizing the coupled and nonlinear terms. The solvability and the unconditional energy stability of the numerical scheme have been further rigorously and numerically proven.

  abstract     = {Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is the “gold standard” for diagnosis of myocardial ischemia. The existing 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) algorithm based on coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) has realized the non-invasive calculation of FFR (FFR CT CT ), but the CFD simulation in 3D coronary arteries is time consuming. The purpose of this study was to develop a reduced-order (0D) cardiovascular model for rapid computation of pressure and flow through coronary arteries and stenosis and to ensure accuracy in prediction of FFR (FFR 0D 0D ). One hundred patients (118 lesions) who had undergone invasive FFR were enrolled retrospectively. Based on coronary CTA, a patient-specific lumped parameter model of the cardiovascular system and coronary system was constructed. In addition, an experimentally validated, theoretical calculation model of stenosis resistance was introduced. Stenosis resistance and flow rate were quantified by coupling the two models, and FFR 0D 0D was calculated according to the coronary pressure distribution. The overall modeling time of FFR 0D 0D was approximately 41.2 min while FFR CT CT was reported to be 3.5 h. Using the clinical cut-off value of FFR (0.8), the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of FFR 0D 0D were 89.8%, 79.2%, 92.6%, 73.1% and 94.6%, respectively, while that of FFR CT CT were reported to be 84.3%, 87.9%, 82.2%, 73.9% and 92.2%, respectively. We successfully proposed a reduced-order cardiovascular model for rapid and accurate prediction of FFR. Compared with FFR CT CT , FFR 0D 0D reduced computational cost and ensured computational accuracy in the case of our limited samples. These advantages represent an advance in the diagnosis and treatment of myocardial ischemia.},

This paper introduces a new alternative where the yield envelope is represented by a manifold of which the topology and the geometry are learned from a set of data points in a parametric space (e.g. principal stress space, π π -plane). Here, deep geometric learning enables us to reconstruct a highly complex yield envelope by breaking it down into multiple coordinate charts. The global atlas that consists of these coordinate charts in return allows us to represent the yield surface via multiple overlapping patches, each with a specific local parametrization. This setup provides several advantages over the classical implicit function representation approach. For instance, the availability of coordinate charts enables us to introduce an alternative stress integration algorithm where the trial stress may project directly on a local patch and hence circumvent the issues related to non-smoothness and the lack of convexity of yield surfaces. Meanwhile, the local parametric approach also enables us to predict hardening/softening locally in the parametric space, even without complete knowledge of the yield surface. Comparisons between the classical yield function approach on the non-smooth plasticity and anisotropic cam-clay plasticity model are provided to demonstrate the capacity of the models for highly precise yield surface and the feasibility of the implementation of the learned model in the local stress integration algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Phase field models for ductile fracture have gained significant attention in the last two decades due to their ability in implicitly tracking the nucleation and propagation of cracks. However, most crack phase field formulations for elastoplastic solids focus only on the effects of plastic deformation , and do not consider the different multi-axial stress states that may arise in practical designs. In this work, a thermodynamically consistent phase field approach coupled with finite strain plasticity, considering multi-axial stress states is presented. In order to account for the coupling between plasticity and stress states, the Stress-Weighted Ductile Fracture Model (SWDFM) is utilized. The SWDFM represents a criterion for predicting ductile crack initiation under both monotonic and cyclic loadings based on histories of an internal plastic variable, stress triaxiality , and the Lode angle parameter. The excellent performance of the SWDFM for predicting ductile crack initiation motivates for its incorporation into a phase field approach for predicting both crack initiation and propagation through degradation of the fracture toughness . Moreover, based on the second law of thermodynamics , exact requirements are imposed on the rate at which the fracture toughness can evolve. A novel function for degrading the plastic yield surface during the evolution of damage is introduced. This function, in line with experimental observations, leads to an accumulation of plastic deformation in damaged regions of a solid, and avoids numerical instabilities arising from concentrations of large plastic deformations in severely damaged regions. For validating the proposed model, results of computational simulations are compared to data from selected tests considering different multi-axial stress states. Comparisons of the numerical results with data from laboratory experiments demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed framework.},

The objective is to optimize the identification procedure by defining an appropriate and flexible numerical methodology that automatically incorporates the limited knowledge on both the used mathematical model (which is always biased, whatever its complexity) and experimental data (which are numerous in the case of DIC, but inevitably noisy). The inverse methodology we propose, denoted DIC-mCRE, is based on the modified Constitutive Relation Error (mCRE) concept which is a convenient tool to deal with reliability of information. In this framework, the designed identification tool is constructed from a hybrid mathematical formulation with a cost function made of weighted modeling and observation error terms. The associated metric thus naturally considers and connects all error and uncertainty sources. We introduce here a consistent setting of the weighting factors with respect to measurement noise, that gives full sense to the quantification of the model quality. Additionally, an integrated version (called mI-DIC) of the methodology is developed, and an extension to nonlinear constitutive models is proposed together with a dedicated solver. The performance of the approach is analyzed and validated on several numerical experiments dealing with linear elasticity or nonlinear models, and using synthetic or real full-field data.},

  abstract     = {In the framework of virtual element discretizations , we address the problem of imposing non homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions in a weak form, both on polygonal/polyhedral domains and on two/three dimensional domains with curved boundaries. We consider a Nitsche’s type method (Nitsche et al. 1970; Juntunen et al. 2009) and the stabilized formulation of the Lagrange multiplier method proposed by Barbosa and Hughes in Barbosa and Hughes (1991) . We prove that also for the virtual element method (VEM), provided the stabilization parameter is suitably chosen (large enough for Nitsche’s method and small enough for the Barbosa–Hughes Lagrange multiplier method), the resulting discrete problem is well posed, and yields convergence with optimal order on polygonal/polyhedral domains. On smooth two/three dimensional domains, we combine both methods with a projection approach similar to the one of Bramble et al. (1972). We prove that, given a polygonal/polyhedral approximation Ω h Ωh of the domain Ω Ω , an optimal convergence rate can be achieved by using a suitable correction depending on high order derivatives of the discrete solution along outward directions (not necessarily orthogonal) at the boundary facets of Ω h Ωh . Numerical experiments validate the theory.},

  abstract     = {Inverse problems are ubiquitous in nature, arising in almost all areas of science and engineering ranging from geophysics and climate science to astrophysics and biomechanics. One of the central challenges in solving inverse problems is tackling their ill-posed nature. Bayesian inference provides a principled approach for overcoming this by formulating the inverse problem into a statistical framework. However, it is challenging to apply when inferring fields that have discrete representations of large dimensions (the so-called “curse of dimensionality”) and/or when prior information is available only in the form of previously acquired solutions. In this work, we present a novel method for efficient and accurate Bayesian inversion using deep generative models. Specifically, we demonstrate how using the approximate distribution learned by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) as a prior in a Bayesian update and reformulating the resulting inference problem in the low-dimensional latent space of the GAN, enables the efficient solution of large-scale Bayesian inverse problems. Our statistical framework preserves the underlying physics and is demonstrated to yield accurate results with reliable uncertainty estimates, even in the absence of information about underlying noise model, which is a significant challenge with many existing methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method on a variety of inverse problems which include both synthetic as well as experimentally observed data.},

Exploiting the full potential of the ALE framework, moving mesh strategy designed in this work is capable of tracking the droplet evolution regardless of the flow regime and without the need for frequent mesh adaptation. Additional attention is invested into the discrete energy balance: possible sources of spurious energy due to the mesh motion are identified and investigated. The overall strategy exhibits a good tradeoff between the stability and efficiency, and demonstrates the ability to perform long-time simulations. The capabilities of the proposed strategy are demonstrated on a couple of fairly complex (3D) scenarios motivated by the industrial applications. In particular, droplet dynamics is simulated for the case of inclined and heterogeneous supporting surfaces, which are designed with the aim to manipulate the droplet motion. Complex dynamics, including sliding, rolling and change in movement direction and wetting area, is successfully captured by the numerical simulation.},

In this work, a phase field model for fatigue fracture in piezoelectric materials is developed by means of the Hamilton principle . Two classical phase field fracture models are unified in the present framework. A cumulative history variable is introduced to quantify the degradation of the fracture toughness under cyclic loading. The proposed model accounts for three representative electric boundary conditions on crack faces describing the fatigue fracture behaviors in different physical situations. The residual controlled staggered scheme is extended to address the fatigue fracture problems in the context of electro-elasticity. The present algorithm overcomes the convergence problem for the monolithic approach and shows higher accuracy with lower computational effort in comparison to the single-pass staggered scheme. Systematic numerical simulations are carried out in 2D and 3D cases. The effects of the electric boundary condition, external electric field , and the geometry of the crack tip on the fatigue fracture behaviors of piezoelectric solids have been discussed. The effect of the electric boundary conditions on the fatigue life varies depending on the direction of the external electric field .

The inelastic material behavior is formulated in terms of thermodynamically consistent internal variables for viscoelastic and plastic strains and isotropic and kinematic hardening variables, as well as accompanying evolution equations. A mixed isogeometric collocation method is applied for the discretization of the strong form of the quasi-static nonlinear differential equations . Thus, the displacements of the centerline curve, the cross-section orientations, and the stress resultants (forces and moments) are discretized as B-spline or NURBS curves .

A unified fluid continuity equation with crack-width dependent permeability, based on the Biot’s poroelastic theory, is used for simultaneous modeling of fluid flow in both fractures and porous media. The fluid pressure is coupled into the governing equations of the phase-field regularized cohesive zone model , which can automatically predict quasi-brittle multi-crack initiation, nucleation, and propagation without remeshing, crack tracking, or auxiliary fields as needed by other methods. An alternate minimization Newton–Raphson iterative algorithm is implemented within the finite element framework to solve the above three-fields coupled problem with nodal degrees of freedom of displacements, fluid pressures, and damages. The method is first validated by three problems with analytical solutions, a problem with experimental results, and a two-crack merging problem with numerical results in published literature, in terms of time evolutions of injected fluid pressures, crack widths and lengths, and final crack paths. Horizontal wellbore fracking problems with parallel hydraulic cracks and random natural fractures are then simulated, with the effects of spacing, number, and angle of perforations investigated in detail. It is found that the developed method is capable of modeling complex multi-crack fracking in both homogeneous media and heterogeneous media with natural fractures, and is thus promising for fracking design optimization of practical exploitation of shale gas and oil.},

The substitution filtering and projection schemes enhance the length scale and solid/void features to accelerate the formation of structural topology in the physical field. Meanwhile, the three-field FPTO method can be extended to robust formulation, which obtains the eroded, intermediate, and dilated designs with the same topology. The most distinct feature of the FPTO method lies in the adoption of the linear material interpolation scheme , which makes many topology optimization problems straightforward. As an example, the proposed three-field FPTO algorithm is further applied to the design of shell-infill structures using the linear multi-material interpolation scheme . The distribution of the shell material is generated through a simple filtering scheme, and the shell thickness is accurately controlled by the filter radius .

  abstract     = {Easy to construct and optimally convergent generalisations of B-splines to unstructured meshes are essential for the application of isogeometric analysis to domains with non-trivial topologies. Nonetheless, especially for hexahedral meshes, the construction of smooth and optimally convergent isogeometric analysis basis functions is still an open question. We introduce a simple partition of unity construction that yields smooth blended B-splines, referred to as SB-splines, on semi-structured quadrilateral and hexahedral meshes, i.e. on mostly structured meshes with sufficiently separated unstructured regions. To this end, we first define the mixed smoothness B-splines that are C 0 C0 continuous in the unstructured regions of the mesh but have higher smoothness everywhere else. Subsequently, the SB-splines are obtained by smoothly blending in the physical space the mixed smoothness B-splines with Bernstein bases of equal degree. One of the key novelties of our approach is that the required smooth weight functions are assembled from the available smooth B-splines on the unstructured mesh. The SB-splines are globally smooth, non-negative, have no breakpoints within the elements and reduce to conventional B-splines away from the unstructured regions of the mesh. Although we consider only quadratic mixed smoothness B-splines in this paper, the construction generalises to arbitrary degrees. We demonstrate the excellent performance of SB-splines studying Poisson and biharmonic problems on semi-structured quadrilateral and hexahedral meshes, and numerically establishing their optimal convergence in one and two dimensions .},

This paper presents a data-driven framework for parametric latent space dynamics identification procedure that enables fast and accurate simulations. The parametric model is achieved by building a set of local latent space model and designing an interaction among them. An individual local latent space dynamics model achieves accurate solution in a trust region . By letting the set of trust region to cover the whole parameter space, our model shows an increase in accuracy with an increase in training data . We introduce two different types of interaction mechanisms, i.e., point-wise and region-based approach. Both linear and nonlinear data compression techniques are used. We illustrate the framework of Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) enable a fast and accurate solution process on various partial differential equations , i.e., Burgers’ equations, radial advection problem, and nonlinear heat conduction problem , achieving O ( 100 ) O(100) x speed-up and O ( 1 ) % O(1)% relative error with respect to the corresponding full order models.},

  abstract     = {This work presents an extension of the highly efficient de-homogenization method for obtaining high-resolution, near-optimal 2D topologies optimized for minimum compliance subjected to multiple load cases . We perform a homogenization-based topology optimization based on stiffness optimal Rank- N N microstructure parameterizations to obtain stiffness optimal multi-scale designs on relatively coarse grids. To avoid relatively thin microstructure features, we regularize the design by introducing a material indicator field which results in well-defined widths and structural boundaries. In order to avoid singularities from the multiple load case problem, the orientations of the microstructures are further regularized. Subsequently, we derive a single-scale interpretation of stiffness optimal multi-scale designs on a fine grid using de-homogenization. The single-scale interpretation can be derived without costly postprocessing analysis on the fine grid, as an implicit boundary formulation is used. The effect of starting guesses is discussed, as they are non-trivial for Rank- N N microstructures. Different numerical examples verify the performance of the inexpensive high-resolution solutions, both in comparison to the Rank- N N based homogenization solutions, to equivalent density-based large-scale solutions, as well as to strict isotropic microstructure solutions. Depending on starting guesses, the approach consistently delivers structural performance values within a few percent of density-based large-scale solutions with a CPU time reduction factor of more than 300. Finally, we confirm that isotropic as well as orthogonal Rank-2 microstructure models are inferior to stiffness optimal anisotropic microstructure models for minimum compliance problems subjected to multiple load cases.},

  abstract     = {The Fokker–Planck equation governs the uncertainty propagation of dynamical systems driven by stochastic processes. The solution of the Fokker–Planck equation is a time-varying Probability Density Function (PDF) that is usually of high dimension with unbounded support. There are also properties that must be conserved in time for the joint and any marginal solution PDF (i.e., a time-varying PDF is a non-negative function that must integrate to unity at any given time.) Satisfying these properties poses a significant challenge to the numerical solution of the Fokker–Planck equation. Another challenge is to capture the tail behavior of the solution PDF with unbounded support, required to predict the probability of rare events like a system failure. Satisfying the conditions of a proper PDF with unbounded support limits the application of traditional grid-based numerical methods, like finite difference and finite element methods. This paper develops a novel numerical method based on physics-based mixture models for the transient and steady-state solutions of the Fokker–Planck equation. In the proposed numerical method, the trial function space consists of the convex combinations of some parametric PDFs (i.e., mixture models) that trivially satisfy the necessary conditions of the solution. Estimating the unknown parameters of the mixture model is via Bayesian inference while considering the constraints on model parameters. Bayesian inference facilitates integrating data on the responses of dynamical systems (e.g., from simulations) with the governing Fokker–Planck equation to estimate the unknown parameters. Since the solution PDF is not observable, combining it with observable data on system responses is far from trivial based on current numerical methods. The formulation of Bayesian inference also introduces a weighting function to reduce the estimation error in specific regions of interest like the tail of the solution PDF. To reduce the computational demand, the paper develops an importance sampling algorithm that generates a small set of collocation points at which the residual of the Fokker–Planck equation is evaluated. The performance of the proposed numerical method is demonstrated with several benchmark problems. The obtained results are compared with analytical solutions when available and otherwise with simulations.},

  abstract     = {Laser powder bed fusion represents the future for metal additive manufacturing . Advance of this emerging technology is bottlenecked by the unavailability of high-fidelity prediction tools for cost-effective optimization on printing design. Simulations of selective laser melting of metals must tackle a complex granular solids and multiphase fluids system that undergoes intra- and inter-phase interactions and thermal-induced phase changes, including melting, vaporization, and solidification, which are challenging to model. We develop a high-fidelity computational tool to provide high-resolution simulations of the multiphase, multiphysics processes of selective laser melting (SLM). Key to this tool is a multi-phase, semi-coupled resolved Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Discrete Element Method (DEM). It contains innovative features including (1) a fully resolved immersed boundary CFD with fictitious particle domain coupling with DEM for resolving mechanical interactions and heat transfers between solid particles and surrounding fluid ; (2) An evaporation model in consideration of the Knudsen layer implemented in the volume of fluid (VOF) method which is enriched by two sharp interface capture schemes, isoAdvector and MULES, for accurate identification of the vaporization process and phase boundaries of fluids with different Courant numbers ; and (3) a ray tracing model compatible with the VOF method for high-resolution of absorbed laser energy. We demonstrate the proposed method can quantitatively reproduce key observations from synchrotron experiments and captures critical interdependent physics involving melt pool morphology evolution, vapor-driven keyhole dynamics and powder motions. This new computational tool opens a new avenue for quantitative design and systematic optimization of laser powder bed fusion and may find wider engineering applications where thermal induced phase changes in a multi-phase system are important.},

  abstract     = {Gas exchange is an essential function of the respiratory system that couples fundamentally with perfusion in respiratory alveoli. Current mathematical formulations and computational models of these two phenomena rely on one-dimensional approximations that neglect the intricate volumetric microstructure of alveolar structures. In this work, we introduce a coupled three-dimensional computational model of pulmonary capillary perfusion and gas exchange that conforms to alveolar morphology. To this end, we derive non-linear partial differential equations and boundary conditions from physical principles that govern the behavior of blood and gases in arbitrary alveolar domains. We numerically solve the resulting formulation by proposing and implementing a non-linear finite-element scheme. Further, we carry out several numerical experiments to validate our model against one-dimensional simulations and demonstrate its applicability to morphologically-inspired geometries. Numerical simulations show that our model predicts blood pressure drops and blood velocities expected in the pulmonary capillaries. Moreover, we replicate partial pressure dynamics of oxygen and carbon dioxide reported in previous studies. This overall behavior is also observed in three-dimensional alveolar geometries, providing more detail associated with the spatial distribution of fields of interest and the influence of the shape of the domain. We envision that this model opens the door for enhanced in silico studies of gas exchange and perfusion on realistic geometries, coupled models of respiratory mechanics and gas exchange, and multi-scale analysis of lung function; furthering our understanding of lung physiology and pathology.

To this end, a higher order function, i.e., the level-set function, is employed to update both shape and fiber placement. The shape evolution relies on a shape sensitivity analysis based on the Tsai–Wu failure criterion. The fiber path evolution depends on the level-set function determined from the shape boundary. A scheme combining the classical level-set method using fixed mesh and a level-set-based mesh evolution method is developed to ensure the efficiency and accuracy of the process. A revision step over fiber orientations along the ridge of the level-set function is introduced to alleviate the local failure index singularity . Manufacturability of the design is further ensured by incorporating a thickness control term, avoiding the appearance of ultra-thin members in the optimized design . The developed scheme is applied to three benchmark examples, showing that the failure index concentration is largely reduced compared with the initial shape, the compliance-based optimized design, and the design with optimized shape but unidirectional fibers.},

In this work, we propose an approximate Bayesian computation approach for estimating model parameters using a low-fidelity Gaussian Process Regression metamodel. We develop an adaptive procedure to build the data-driven surrogate model by sequentially enriching the data set in the parametric space regions where the surrogate is not accurate enough. At the end of the process, we obtain good emulators of the original models over the entire parametric space at a low computational cost.

Aiming at tackling the poor convergence performance of standard Newton schemes, a quasi-Newton (QN) scheme is proposed for the solution of coupled governing equations stemming from the enhanced assumed strain shell formulation in a monolithic manner. The excellent convergence performance of this QN monolithic scheme for the multi-field shell formulation is demonstrated through several paradigmatic boundary value problems , including single edge notched tension and shear, fracture of cylindrical structure under mixed loading and fatigue induced crack growth. Compared with the popular alternating minimization (AM) or staggered solution scheme, it is also found that the QN monolithic solution scheme for the phase field modeling using enhanced strain shell formulation is very efficient without the loss of robustness, and significant computational gains are observed in all the numerical examples . In addition, to further reduce the computational cost in fracture modeling of large-scale thin-walled structures, a specific global–local phase field approach for solid shell elements in the 3D setting is proposed, in which the full displacement-phase field problem is considered at the local level, while addressing only the elastic problem at the global level. Its capability is demonstrated by the modeling of a cylindrical structure subjected to both static and fatigue cyclic loading conditions , which can be appealing to industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {In practical engineering problems, it is frequently challenging to collect sufficient data to construct high-precision probabilistic models. In this case, probabilistic models typically contain cognitive uncertainty and may be biased. Confidence-based design optimization (CBDO) is an effective tool for solving optimization problems with insufficient input data . Therein, epistemic uncertainty is taken into account, and its propagation is quantified by the confidence level of reliability. However, the coupling of reliability analysis and confidence analysis (CA) results in low calculation accuracy and an unacceptable rise in computational cost. To improve the performance of CBDO, a sequential single-loop reliability optimization and confidence analysis method (SROCA) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, a decoupling strategy with a serial of cycles of complete single-loop method (CSLM) and CA is established. In each cycle, CSLM and CA are decoupled from each other. Therein, the CSLM integrates both the reliability and confidence constraints into the deterministic optimization loop, and the performance functions are not required to be evaluated in CA due to the application of a semi-analytic sensitivity method. Additionally, update strategies for both the reliability and confidence indexes are employed to neutralize the linear approximation errors based on the dimension reduction method . Finally, four mathematical and one engineering example are adopted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed SROCA. The results show that the efficiency and accuracy of implementing CBDO achieve significant improvement by the proposed method.},

First, it presents a computational strategy for reducing the total offline cost of nonlinear PMOR by enabling hyperreduction to be performed adaptively within the typical greedy sampling procedure, rather than uniformly at each of its iteration. Then, it presents a more accurate and computationally efficient approach for training hyperreduction based on residual Jacobians rather than residuals. Finally, it demonstrates for a large-scale, industrial-grade, parametric, nonlinear application, that the two aforementioned contributions make both offline and online stages of nonlinear PMOR practical in today’s engineering environments. The paper also shows that despite the so-called Kolmogorov n n -width barrier for the model reduction of convection-dominated transport problems, the current state of the art of nonlinear, Petrov–Galerkin PMOR equipped with the advances proposed in this paper is capable of accelerating by orders of magnitude the accurate solution of shape-parametric, high Reynolds number , viscous flow problems represented by the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations augmented with turbulence modeling . All three contributions are presented and discussed in the contexts of steady-state CFD problems ; however, they are equally applicable to unsteady CFD problems as well as problems in solid mechanics and structural dynamics.},

  abstract     = {We extend the recently proposed framework using reduced quadrature in the Finite Element and Isogeometric methods for solid mechanics to the nonlinear realm. The proposed approach makes use of the governing equations in the updated Lagrangian formulation in combination with the rate form of the constitutive laws. The key ingredient in the framework is the careful development and use of the Taylor series expansion in the integrands of the internal work terms. The resulting formulation relies on the evaluation of stress gradients , for which the evolution equations and update algorithms are developed. The versatility of the proposed approach is demonstrated on an extensive set of numerical examples employing a variety of constitutive models. The resulting formulations are especially effective in alleviating volumetric locking for the cases of nearly-incompressible and plastic deformations .},

Using the so-formulated discrete model of an origami structure, we pursue finite wavenumber-finite frequency (FW-FF) homogenization of the wave motion in a spectral neighborhood of simple, repeated, and nearby eigenfrequencies at an arbitrary wavenumber within the first Brillouin zone . The lynchpin of the proposed approach is the “projection” of the nodal displacements over each unit cell onto a suitable Bloch eigenvector , evaluated at the “center” of the spectral region of interest. For completeness, we make an account for: (i) the source term acting at the nodes of a discrete structure, and (ii) periodic Dirichlet boundary conditions . We obtain the leading-order (system of) effective equation(s) synthesizing the wave motion in a selected spectral neighborhood, and we describe asymptotically the corresponding dispersion relationship . We illustrate the proposed framework by comparing numerically the Bloch dispersion relationship to its asymptotic approximation for (a) a 2D-periodic Miura-ori structure, and (b) a 1D-periodic Miura tube. The dispersion analysis is complemented by evaluating the effective wave motion (in terms of both “macroscopic” and “microscopic” essentials) in a 2D-periodic Miura-ori structure due to spatially-localized source term acting either inside a band gap or within a passband .},

The presented scheme is not only capable of efficiently simulating grains with real shapes but also preserving mass and grains morphology with high fidelity when breakage occurs. Hence, with this approach, further works within the original 3DLS-DEM scheme could take into account other physical phenomena at the grain-scale such as electrostatic induced cohesion, heat transfer, or the presence of a fluid, etc. On the other hand, the breakage process modified grain size and roundness distributions, which, in turn, might change the strength and critical state of the sample. Withal, the overall process seems to suggest that grain breakage may be a sufficient condition to exacerbate the prevalence of shear banding within the sample. Finally, our model is able to perform breakage on several real 3D grains of a sample consisting of thousands of grains in a generalized 3DLS-DEM scheme.},

  abstract     = {Developing a numerical method to accurately simulate the brittle crack propagation phenomenon is crucial for ensuring the safety of large-scale steel structures. Although recent studies have demonstrated that using the local fracture stress criterion as the fracture condition is effective, the most critical issue is that the methods for evaluating local stress in the vicinity of the dynamically propagating crack front have not been established. To address this, this paper proposes a strategy for analysing a dynamically propagating crack in 3D solids on the basis of the s-version finite element method (s-method). In the proposed strategy, the local mesh is defined in the vicinity of the crack front as an ideal structured mesh aligned with both the crack front direction and crack propagation direction to accurately simulate the local stress field . The dynamically propagating crack front was modelled by a combination of the nodal force release method and local mesh update. The proposed strategy was verified by evaluating the accuracies of the local stress in stationary and dynamically propagating circular crack problems as well as those of the stress intensity factor . The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy provides unprecedented accuracy and efficiency of local stress evaluation in problems of dynamic crack propagation in a 3D solid without requiring any complicated remeshing procedures. Therefore, the proposed strategy has potential as the basis of a numeral framework for analysing dynamic brittle crack propagation problems dominated by the local fracture stress criterion.},

  abstract     = {Polynomial chaos expansion has received considerable attention in uncertainty quantification since its great modeling capability for complex systems. However, considering the different variable distribution types and the ‘curse of dimensionality’ of the expansion coefficients , the polynomial chaos expansion has some limitations in the practical engineering application . In this paper, an optimal sparse polynomial chaos expansion is proposed to effectively realize uncertainty quantification with arbitrary probability distribution. This polynomial chaos expansion adopts the derivative λ λ -PDFs and the corresponding Gegenbauer polynomials to implement stochastic characterization for system model. Because of the excellent approximation ability of derivative λ λ -PDFs for arbitrary mono-peak distribution, the proposed polynomial chaos expansion has a wide adaptability to arbitrary distribution. Further, through the structure-selection technique based on error reduction ratio to screen the significant basis polynomials , the optimal sparse polynomial chaos expansion can be built with much fewer model evaluations than unknown coefficients . In view of that, the optimal sparse polynomial chaos expansion is applied to global sensitivity analysis, and the analytical solution of Sobol’ sensitivity indices is derived from the coefficients. Because of the advantages of simple structure, high precision and anti-noise ability, this optimal sparse polynomial chaos can improve the efficiency and accuracy of sensitivity analysis and has better adaptability for complex practical engineering problems. One numerical example and two engineering applications are studied to illustrate the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The critical energy release rate of the crack is always set as an inherent material property (constant value) in the phase-field method (PFM) to depict the compression-shear and mixed-mode failures of the shale rock. However, the recent experimental results about supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2 ) fracturing indicate that the degradation in strength of the porous medium is of significant importance because of the associated effect of fluid infiltration. To capture this tendency, a modified phase-field method is developed to fully consider the mixed-mode failure and shear strength degradation during the SC-CO 2 fracturing (SCF) process. Precisely, the finite element method (FEM) is used to discretize the solution space and staggered scheme is employed to solve the system of non-linear equations derived from the proposed PFM. A new critical energy release rate criterion that considers the pore pressure gradient is generated and a distinction between two different failure modes (Mode-I and Mode-II) is made through the spectral decomposition of strain energy. The model is validated against experimental results and depicts the crack branching behavior with a wide range of fluid viscosities and injection rates. Tension and shear failure modes alternately dominate the behavior of branching, followed by periodic fluctuation of the crack tip velocity and equivalent driving term, which is quantitatively depicted by the phase diagram.},

This is motivated by the ability of the SBFEM to handle polyhedral elements with hanging nodes straightforwardly. Such elements occur in octree meshes, which facilitate rapid transitions in element size and lend themselves to adaptive refinement. The SBFEM also provides an energy-based error indicator, which follows directly from the semi-analytical solution approach and does not require stress recovery. The error indicator is used to ensure the solution accuracy for both fields and combined with a criterion based on phase-field evolution. The computational cost associated with 3D fracture modeling is further reduced by exploiting the geometric similarity of cells occurring in balanced octree meshes. To validate the proposed method, several classical benchmark problems are solved, resulting in efficient and robust solutions compared to the literature.},

In magnetostatic boundary value problems , the interaction between the magnetic solid, externally applied magnetic fields and the surrounding exterior domain is of crucial importance. This interaction generates the magnetic stray field, which diminishes in intensity with increasing distance to the solid. For this reason, the overall infinite domain is simulated using a hybrid formulation of the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) and the finite element method. To this end, the entire domain is divided into a finite and an infinite sub-region, referred to as the interior and the exterior domain. While the interior domain is modeled using finite elements, the exterior domain is reduced onto the boundary of the interior domain by using the SBFEM . The latter provides a semi-analytical solution of the considered magnetostatic problem in an unbounded domain, where the externally applied magnetic fields are taken into account. The advantage of this method is the rigorous representation of the surrounding exterior domain without an explicit discretization . Compared to completely discretized systems, significantly better results can be obtained with smaller systems of equations.},

An iterative algorithm is proposed to compute each triplet of the random variable, spatial vector and temporal function one by one. The original stochastic dynamics problem is firstly transformed into spatial–temporal coupled problems (i.e. deterministic structural dynamics equations), which can be solved efficiently by existing FEM solvers. Based on the solution of the spatial–temporal coupled problem, the original problem is then transformed into stochastic-temporal coupled problems (i.e. one-dimensional second-order stochastic ordinary differential equations), which are solved by a proposed sampling method. All random sources are embedded into the stochastic-temporal coupled problems. The proposed sampling method can solve the stochastic-temporal problems of hundreds of dimensions with low computational costs. Thus the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional stochastic spaces is avoided with great success. Three numerical examples, including low- and high-dimensional stochastic problems, are used to demonstrate the good accuracy and the high efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {A probabilistic approach to phase-field brittle and ductile fracture with random material and geometric properties is proposed within this work. In the macroscopic failure mechanics, materials properties and spatial quantities (of different phases in the geometrical domain) are assumed to be homogeneous and deterministic. This is unlike the lower scale with strong fluctuation in the material and geometrical properties. Such a response is approximated through some uncertainty in the model problem. The presented contribution is devoted to providing a mathematical framework for modeling uncertainty through stochastic analysis of a microstructure undergoing brittle/ductile failure. Hereby, the proposed model employs various representative volume elements with random distribution of stiff inclusions and voids within the composite structure. We develop an allocating strategy to allocate the heterogeneities and generate the corresponding meshes in two- and three-dimensional cases. Then the Monte Carlo Finite Element Method (MC-FEM) is employed for solving the stochastic PDE-based model and approximate the expectation and the variance of the solution field of brittle/ductile failure by evaluating a large number of samples. For the prediction of failure mechanisms, we rely on the phase-field approach which is a widely adopted framework for modeling and computing the fracture phenomena in solids. Incremental perturbed minimization principles for a class of gradient-type dissipative materials are used to derive the perturbed governing equations. This analysis enables us to study the highly heterogeneous microstructure and monitor the uncertainty in failure mechanics. Several numerical examples are given to examine the efficiency of the proposed method.},

However, sometimes, the targeted zone of interest can be varying, and the corresponding topology is very complex, thus the conventional APR method is not able to track these characteristics adaptively. In this study, a novel Block-based Adaptive Particle Refinement (BAPR) method is developed, which is able to provide the necessary local refinement flexibly for any targeted characteristic, and track it adaptively. In BAPR, the so-called activation status of the block array defines the refinement regions, where the transition and activated zones are determined accordingly. A regularization method for the generated particles in the newly activated blocks is developed to render an isotropic distribution of these new particles. The proposed method has been deployed for simulating Fluid–Structure Interaction (FSI) problems. A set of 2D FSI cases have been simulated with the proposed BAPR method, and the performance of the BAPR method is quantified and validated comprehensively. In a word, the BAPR method is viable and potential for complex multi-resolution FSI simulations by tracking any targeted characteristic of interest.},

  abstract     = {NURBS-based discretizations of the Galerkin method suffer from membrane locking when applied to primal formulations of curved thin-walled structures. We consider linear plane curved Kirchhoff rods as a model problem to study how to remove membrane locking from NURBS-based discretizations . In this work, we propose continuous-assumed-strain (CAS) elements, an assumed strain treatment that removes membrane locking from quadratic NURBS for an ample range of slenderness ratios . CAS elements take advantage of the C 1 C1 inter-element continuity of the displacement vector given by quadratic NURBS to interpolate the membrane strain using linear Lagrange polynomials while preserving the C 0 C0 inter-element continuity of the membrane strain. To the authors’ knowledge, CAS elements are the first NURBS-based element type able to remove membrane locking for a broad range of slenderness ratios that combines the following distinctive characteristics: (1) No additional degrees of freedom are added, (2) No additional systems of algebraic equations need to be solved, and (3) The nonzero pattern of the stiffness matrix is preserved. Since the only additional computations required by the proposed element type are to evaluate the derivatives of the basis functions and the unit tangent vector at the knots, the proposed scheme barely increases the computational cost with respect to the locking-prone NURBS-based discretization of the primal formulation. The benchmark problems show that the convergence of CAS elements is independent of the slenderness ratio up to 1 0 4 104 while the convergence of quadratic NURBS elements with full and reduced integration, local B ̄ B̄ elements, and local ANS elements depends heavily on the slenderness ratio and the error can even increase as the mesh is refined. The numerical examples also show how CAS elements remove the spurious oscillations in stress resultants caused by membrane locking while quadratic NURBS elements with full and reduced integration, local B ̄ B̄ elements, and local ANS elements suffer from large-amplitude spurious oscillations in stress resultants. In short, CAS elements are an accurate, robust, and computationally efficient numerical scheme to overcome membrane locking in quadratic NURBS-based discretizations .},

If no appropriate adaptive meshes are utilised, only the convergence rate caused by corner singularities (Blum and Rannacher, 1980), far below the approximation order for smooth functions, can be achieved. The fine approximation with the Argyris FEM produces high-dimensional linear systems and for a long time an optimal preconditioned scheme was not available for unstructured grids . This paper presents numerical benchmarks to confirm that the adaptive multilevel solver for the hierarchical Argyris FEM from Carstensen and Hu (2021) is in fact highly efficient and of linear time complexity. Moreover, the very first display of optimal convergence rates in practically relevant benchmarks with corner singularities and general boundary conditions leads to the rehabilitation of the Argyris finite element from the computational perspective.},

The radial basis function (RBF) is employed to construct the level set function (LSF). Fiber orientations are parameterized by LSF and fiber paths can be determined instinctively for the inherent advantages of the level set approach. Besides, the fast-marching method is employed to extrapolate the primary fiber paths to the secondary fiber paths, which can avoid the manufacturing drawbacks such as gaps and overlaps to a large extent. A detection and filtering technique is proposed here to alleviate the orientation disorder at the intersection of the diffusion surfaces. Two design schemes are developed to optimize both structural topology and fiber path. In a sequential procedure, topology optimization is conducted first with isotropic materials; and then fiber paths are optimized on the basis of fixed topological boundary. In a simultaneous optimization procedure , structural boundaries and fiber paths are optimized alternately through two inner loops. In this study, three numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, and the results show that optimization of fiber path is beneficial to improvement of structural performance. In general, the simultaneous optimization scheme exhibits better optimal outcome in comparison with the sequential optimization scheme.},

Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) algorithms based on nodal damage are recently developed to reduce computational expense. However, these AMR algorithms are unable to simulate the crack initiation accurately without a priori local refinement. To solve this problem, in this work, we have proposed an AMR algorithm based on the effective crack driving energy. A multi-level mark–unmark scheme is developed integrating the effective crack driving energy-based followed by a damage-based scheme, which can capture the crack initiation and propagation very effectively. The proposed AMR algorithm works efficiently on brittle, cohesive, and dynamic fractures. The three popular PFMs, namely AT1 , AT2 , and PF-CZM are selected from the literature, implemented within a single code, and used to study the AMR algorithm. The proposed AMR algorithm reduces the simulation time by 5–50 times, depending on the type of problem, as compared to simulations that adopt a priori non-adaptively refined meshes.},

In this study, an efficient and accurate method is proposed to fully quantify failure probability , considering the uncertainty of the distribution parameters. This method obtains predictive failure probability by integrating the probability space of the conditional reliability index instead of directly utilizing the point-estimate method on the conditional failure probability as in previous studies. In the proposed method, a three-parameter lognormal distribution is suggested to approach the distribution of the conditional reliability index. The first three central moments of the conditional reliability index are estimated utilizing the point-estimate method combined with the bivariate dimension-reduction method. Based on this, the analytical solutions for the quantiles and probability distribution of the conditional failure probability can be readily derived without redundant calculations. Four illustrative examples were investigated to verify the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method produces sufficiently accurate results in an efficient and simple way. It also presents a complete picture of the structural reliability evaluation results considering distribution parameter uncertainty in a wide range of applications.},

  abstract     = {In this work we aim to develop a unified mathematical framework and a reliable computational approach to model the brittle fracture in heterogeneous materials with variability in material microstructures, and to provide statistical metrics for quantities of interest, such as the fracture toughness. To describe the material responses such as the nucleation and growth of fractures in a uniform setting, we consider the peridynamics model. In particular, a stochastic state-based peridynamic model is developed, where the micromechanical parameters are modeled by a finite-dimensional random field, e.g., a combination of truncated random variables determined by the Karhunen–Loève decomposition or the principal component analysis (PCA). To solve this stochastic peridynamic problem, probabilistic collocation method (PCM) is employed to sample the random field that represents the micromechanical parameters. For each sample, the corresponding peridynamic problem is solved by an optimization-based meshfree quadrature rule. We present rigorous analysis for the proposed scheme and verify the convergence rate with a number of benchmark problems. The proposed scheme not only possesses the asymptotic compatibility spatially but also achieves an algebraic or sub-exponential convergence rate in the parametric random space when the number of collocation points grows. Finally, to validate the applicability of this approach on real-world fracture problems, we consider the problem of crystallization toughening in glass-ceramic materials, in which the material at the microstructural scale contains both amorphous glass and crystalline phases. The proposed stochastic peridynamic solver is employed to capture the crack initiation and its growth of the glass-ceramics with different crystal volume fractions, and the averaged fracture toughness are also calculated accordingly. The numerical estimates of fracture toughness show good consistency with data from experimental measurements.},

The special feature of this method is that it can take full advantages of both the BEM and PD to achieve a higher level of accuracy and efficiency. Based on the scale of the structure and the location of cracks, the considered domain can be divided into a non-cracked region and a cracked region. For the non-cracked region, a meshfree boundary-domain integral equation method (meshfree-BDIEM) is employed in the analysis to reduce the dimension by one and to increase the computational efficiency. The bond-based PD is applied to simulate the cracked region, which can model the initiation and propagation of the cracks automatically. The boundary nodes from the BEM on the interfaces can interact with the material points from the PD directly. By using the displacement continuity and force equilibrium conditions on the interfaces, a combined model is obtained by merging the mass, stiffness, and force matrices from each region of the domain. Both the implicit and explicit BEM-PD coupled solution methods can deliver accurate results without inducing the ghost forces. Several benchmark problems of dynamic crack propagation have been modeled by using the method, which demonstrate that the developed BEM-PD coupled approach can be an efficient numerical tool to model the dynamic crack propagation problems.},

The work at hand formulates a brittle damage model based on a gradient micromorphic regularization approach, which, in particular, incorporates a novel Representative Crack Element (RCE) framework to address physically reasonable crack kinematics in the damaged zone. The deformations in the micro cracks within the macro damage zone, which include crack opening, closing (stiff contact), shearing as well as mixed aforementioned deformations, can be comprehensively captured. Thus, the work at hand attempts to resolve the strong-discontinuity problem (within cracks) based on a regularized damage model in a numerically robust manner. The present constitutive model of the gradient damage coupled problem is derived based on a thermodynamic consistent algorithm. In the meantime, a minimization algorithm of the RCE virtual power is employed for the solution of the unknown crack deformations. The formulation is implemented into the context of the conventional Finite Element Method framework. Several representative and meaningful numerical examples are studied to demonstrate the capability of the present model.},

  abstract     = {Certain applications that analyze damping effects require the solution of quadratic eigenvalue problems (QEPs). We use refined isogeometric analysis (rIGA) to solve quadratic eigenproblems. rIGA discretization , while conserving desirable properties of maximum-continuity isogeometric analysis (IGA), reduces the interconnection between degrees of freedom by adding low-continuity basis functions. This connectivity reduction in rIGA’s algebraic system results in faster matrix LU factorizations when using multifrontal direct solvers. We compare computational costs of rIGA versus those of IGA when employing Krylov eigensolvers to solve quadratic eigenproblems arising in 2D vector-valued multifield problems. For large problem sizes, the eigencomputation cost is governed by the cost of LU factorization, followed by costs of several matrix–vector and vector–vector multiplications, which correspond to Krylov projections. We minimize the computational cost by introducing C0 and C1 separators at specific element interfaces for our rIGA generalizations of the curl-conforming Nédélec and divergence-conforming Raviart–Thomas finite elements . Let p be the polynomial degree of basis functions; the LU factorization is up to O((p−1)2) times faster when using rIGA compared to IGA in the asymptotic regime. Thus, rIGA theoretically improves the total eigencomputation cost by O((p−1)2) for sufficiently large problem sizes. Yet, in practical cases of moderate-size eigenproblems, the improvement rate deteriorates as the number of computed eigenvalues increases because of multiple matrix–vector and vector–vector operations. Our numerical tests show that rIGA accelerates the solution of quadratic eigensystems by O(p−1) for moderately sized problems when we seek to compute a reasonable number of eigenvalues.},

The chaotic nature of such problems prevents a stable unsteady adjoint solution, and existing regularization techniques are costly for large simulations. The method presented foregoes the unsteady adjoint and instead relies on a field-inversion machine-learning (FIML) framework, which only requires unsteady primal solutions without full-state storage or checkpointing. The FIML model yields an adjoint for the averaged solution, which is combined with an averaged unsteady residual to obtain an output error estimate and adaptive indicator. This error estimate is shown to be accurate when the FIML model augments the original unsteady equations with corrections that are not excessively large. The unsteady residual comes from sampling fine-space residual evaluations during the unsteady simulation. A novel objective function based on an adjoint-weighted residual is presented for the field inversion to improve the ability of the FIML model to predict output errors and the domain-interior state. The localized output error drives adaptation of the mesh size and approximation order. Results for three aerodynamic problems ranging in Reynolds number demonstrate accuracy of the error estimates and efficiency of the computational meshes when compared to other adaptive strategies, including uniform and residual-based refinement.},

Thus, we present two methods, the small-noise double-loop Monte Carlo and small-noise Monte Carlo Laplace methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that the total complexity of these two approaches remains comparable to the case without nuisance uncertainty. To assess the efficiency of these methods, we present three examples, and the last example includes the partial differential equation for the electrical impedance tomography experiment for composite laminate materials.},

  abstract     = {Efficiency has long been a bottleneck for peridynamics simulation as compared to the grid-based methods. This paper proposes a super-fast peridynamic (SFPD) model for crack and fracture simulations in homogeneous and heterogeneous materials in a most efficient manner. The philosophy behind this SFPD algorithm is to decrease the computational time needed at every simulation step rather than to increase the time step, since the peridynamic stability and convergence depend primarily on a small time step. The proposed SFPD algorithm surpasses the classical models and algorithms as follows: (1) the SFPD is hundreds of times faster than the regular peridynamic approach for the same computational task; (2) the peridynamic convergency is dramatically enhanced despite using a smaller number of particles by adopting a new strategy of time step calculation; (3) the SFPD algorithm can simulate the cracks in a wide range of scales including the subatomic scale; (4) the prediction of crack velocity using the SFPD algorithm is much better than other models’ predictions when compared with experimental measurements. Various cracking problems are investigated in both homogeneous and heterogeneous materials under different boundary conditions. The newly proposed algorithm is well-validated to have huge potential in boosting computational efficiency. Moreover, we recommend adopting this algorithm in the software development of crack simulation packages.},

  abstract     = {Simulating flow through porous media with explicit considerations of complex microstructures is very challenging using conventional sharp-interface methods because of the difficulties in generating meshes conformal to complex geometries . In this work, a diffuse interface embedded boundary method known as the Smoothed Boundary Method (SBM) is utilized to facilitate simulations of fluid dynamics involving complex geometries. In diffuse-interface methods, the geometry is described by a domain parameter. The SBM allows the straightforward reformulation of the time-dependent Navier–Stokes equations in terms of this domain parameter, using only differentiation identities. Thus, enforcing the appropriate boundary conditions at the irregular embedded boundary is greatly simplified. Adaptive mesh refinement is used to increase the accuracy of the diffuse interface method by allowing a thinner interfacial thickness to be used in the domain parameter. The SBM-formulated Navier–Stokes equations are solved with the Finite Difference Method on refined mesh systems. Sharp-interface Finite Element Method simulations using the commercial software COMSOL on body-conforming meshes are also provided for comparison. Favorable agreement between the two methods is observed. Since it is no longer necessary for the mesh to conform to the complex geometry, the grid system for the SBM simulations can be generated rapidly and without additional manual interventions, making the entire simulation process more expedient.},

The two-point entropy conservative (EC) flux is first constructed in the curvilinear coordinates , which is nontrivial in the case of the stiffened EOS. With the aid of the high-order discretization of the geometric conservation laws and the linear combinations of the two-point EC fluxes, the high-order semi-discrete EC schemes are derived. The high-order semi-discrete ES schemes are constructed by adding suitable high-order dissipation term to the EC schemes such that the semi-discrete entropy inequality is satisfied and unphysical oscillations are suppressed. The high-order dissipation term is built on the multi-resolution weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) reconstruction and the newly derived scaled eigenvector matrices. The explicit strong-stability-preserving Runge–Kutta methods are used for the time discretization and the mesh points are adaptively redistributed by iteratively solving the mesh redistribution equations with an appropriate monitor function, which is adapted to the multi-component flow and encodes more physical characteristics of the solutions. Several 2D and 3D numerical tests are conducted on the parallel computer system with the MPI programming to validate the accuracy and the ability to effectively capture the localized structures of the proposed schemes.},

Our approach is based on adding a symmetric positive-definite term to the consistent mass matrix that follows from the integral of the traction jump across element boundaries. The added term is weighted by a small factor, for which we derive a suitable, and simple, element-local parameter choice. We perform numerical experiments for the linear wave equation in one and two dimensions , for quadrilateral elements and triangular elements, and for up to fourth order polynomial basis functions. Despite the increase in critical time-step size, we do not observe adverse effects in terms of spatial accuracy and orders of convergence. To extend the method to non-linear problems, we introduce a linear approximation . Our three-dimensional experiments with tetrahedral and hexahedral elements show that a sizeable increase in critical time-step size can be achieved while only causing minor (even beneficial) influences on the dynamic response.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a novel computational approach for the generalized three-dimensional upper bound limit analysis of curved rigid block structures. This approach allows to discretize structures with complex geometries into a finite number of curved blocks, while retaining an overall exact description of the structural geometry and improving the accuracy of the solution in terms of both collapse load multiplier and failure mechanism. To this aim, the discretization of a given spatial curved structure is obtained by using NURBS solids, where NURBS stands for Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline. A NURBS solid is a closed region of space delimited by NURBS boundary surfaces: no information is provided about the space within the volume, except for the mathematical expression of the boundary surfaces. NURBS solids allow to discretize a complex spatial structure into a finite number of solid elements while maintaining unaffected the initial geometry, independently on the number of elements used. Each NURBS solid element is considered as a rigid and infinitely resistant block and an upper bound limit analysis is applied to the obtained assembly. The external power is evaluated on the original geometry: the resultants of surface and volume forces, and the coordinates of the corresponding loaded points are evaluated through a new boundary integration formula, which allows avoiding any additional discretization based on standard regular elements (voxel or tetrahedral). On the other hand, the internal power is evaluated according to an associated flow rule on the common boundary NURBS surfaces between adjacent solid elements, thus representing zero-thickness interfaces. The upper-bound formulation stems into a linear programming problem, from which the kinematic load multiplier, the generalized velocities of each block, and contact forces at interfaces are obtained. Finally, the Gothic arches with curved cross-sections located within the Carmo Convent (Lisbon, Portugal) and a double curvature groin vault from the St John Hospital (Jerusalem) are studied to prove the effectiveness of the proposed NURBS solid-based approach for the three-dimensional limit analysis of generally shaped rigid block structures.},

  abstract     = {The classical Cauchy continuum theory is suitable to model highly homogeneous materials. However, many materials, such as porous media or metamaterials, exhibit a pronounced microstructure. As a result, the classical continuum theory cannot capture their mechanical behaviour without fully resolving the underlying microstructure. In terms of finite element computations, this can be done by modelling the entire body, including every interior cell. The relaxed micromorphic continuum offers an alternative method by instead enriching the kinematics of the mathematical model . The theory introduces a microdistortion field, encompassing nine extra degrees of freedom for each material point. The corresponding elastic energy functional contains the gradient of the displacement field, the microdistortion field and its Curl (the micro-dislocation). Therefore, the natural spaces of the fields are [ H 1 ] 3 [H1]3 for the displacement and [ H ( curl ) ] 3 [H(curl)]3 for the microdistortion, leading to unusual finite element formulations. In this work we describe the construction of appropriate finite elements using Nédélec and Raviart–Thomas subspaces, encompassing solutions to the orientation problem and the discrete consistent coupling condition. Further, we explore the numerical behaviour of the relaxed micromorphic model for both a primal and a mixed formulation. The focus of our benchmarks lies in the influence of the characteristic length L c Lc and the correlation to the classical Cauchy continuum theory.},

  abstract     = {Image-based physics simulations in heterogeneous media at a microscopic scale are a growing trend in various fields within and around Scientific Computing. We consider the scope of Numerical Homogenization, where micro-computed tomography is used to obtain digital models of physical samples, naturally leading to pixel and voxel-based solutions. In this context, the Finite Element Method (FEM) is commonly employed to solve the governing differential equations, via a system of algebraic equations. As image dimensions increase, the memory allocation due to the matrix associated with the FEM quickly becomes unfeasible, even in sparse format. Assembly-free strategies are adopted to reduce memory usage, with the caveat of increased computational cost. The Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method is widely employed to solve this sort of large-scale sparse linear systems , and is fitting to be adapted for assembly-free implementations. This work focuses on a massively parallel PCG solver applied to finite element analyses of heat conduction and linear elasticity on image-based models. Memory-efficiency is one of our main concerns, in an attempt to make feasible the employment of personal-use GPUs for large-scale simulations. The resulting solver is validated with an analytical benchmark, and by comparing the obtained results for a microtomographic model of a cast iron sample against experimental values found in the literature. Time and memory metrics are presented and discussed. It is shown that the developed program allows for homogenization studies of nearly 500 million degrees-of-freedom to be conducted in personal computers equipped with CUDA-enabled devices of 8 GB RAM, taking seconds or a few minutes per system solution with the PCG method. Up to 400 × × speed-up was observed in comparison to an analogous solver running in a 16-thread CPU. Our GPU implementation makes it possible to conduct, in a matter of minutes, homogenization studies that would take hours, or even days, in personal CPUs.},

In the present work, we propose a highly efficient deep-learning surrogate framework that is able to accurately predict the response of bodies undergoing large deformations in real-time. The surrogate model has a convolutional neural network architecture , called U-Net, which is trained with force–displacement data obtained with the finite element method . We propose deterministic and probabilistic versions of the framework. The probabilistic framework utilizes the Variational Bayes Inference approach and is able to capture all the uncertainties present in the data as well as in the deep-learning model. Based on several benchmark examples, we show the predictive capabilities of the framework and discuss its possible limitations.},

  abstract     = {Constitutive modeling based on continuum mechanics theory has been a classical approach for modeling the mechanical responses of materials. However, when constitutive laws are unknown or when defects and/or high degrees of heterogeneity are present, these classical models may become inaccurate. In this work, we propose to use data-driven modeling, which directly utilizes high-fidelity simulation and/or experimental measurements to predict a material’s response without using conventional constitutive models. Specifically, the material response is modeled by learning the implicit mappings between loading conditions and the resultant displacement and/or damage fields, with the neural network serving as a surrogate for a solution operator. To model the complex responses due to material heterogeneity and defects, we develop a novel deep neural operator architecture, which we coin as the Implicit Fourier Neural Operator (IFNO). In the IFNO, the increment between layers is modeled as an integral operator to capture the long-range dependencies in the feature space . As the network gets deeper, the limit of IFNO becomes a fixed point equation that yields an implicit neural operator and naturally mimics the displacement/damage fields solving procedure in material modeling problems. To obtain an efficient implementation , we parameterize the integral kernel of this integral operator directly in the Fourier space and interpret the network as discretized integral (nonlocal) differential equations, which consequently allow for the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) and accelerated learning techniques for deep networks. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed method for a number of examples, including hyperelastic, anisotropic and brittle materials . As an application, we further employ the proposed approach to learn the material models directly from digital image correlation (DIC) tracking measurements, and show that the learned solution operators substantially outperform the conventional constitutive models in predicting displacement fields.},

The linear multigrid algorithm is adopted to accelerate convergence. We further analytically prove the unique solvability, modified energy dissipation law, and mass conservation in time-discretized version. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme via various two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulations.

  abstract     = {We present a method for solving linear and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) based on the variable projection framework and artificial neural networks. For linear PDEs, enforcing the boundary/initial value problem on the collocation points gives rise to a separable nonlinear least squares problem about the network coefficients. We reformulate this problem by the variable projection approach to eliminate the linear output-layer coefficients, leading to a reduced problem about the hidden-layer coefficients only. The reduced problem is solved first by the nonlinear least squares method to determine the hidden-layer coefficients, and then the output-layer coefficients are computed by the linear least squares method. For nonlinear PDEs, enforcing the boundary/initial value problem on the collocation points gives rise to a nonlinear least squares problem that is not separable, which precludes the variable projection strategy for such problems. To enable the variable projection approach for nonlinear PDEs, we first linearize the problem with a Newton iteration, using a particular linearization formulated in terms of the updated approximation field. The linearized system is solved by the variable projection framework together with artificial neural networks. Upon convergence of the Newton iteration, the neural-network coefficients provide the representation of the solution field to the original nonlinear problem. We present ample numerical examples to demonstrate the performance of the method developed herein. For smooth field solutions, the errors of the current method decrease exponentially as the number of collocation points or the number of output-layer coefficients increases. We compare extensively the current method with the extreme learning machine (ELM) method from a previous work. Under identical conditions and configurations, the current method exhibits an accuracy significantly superior to the ELM method.},

The formulation comprises the following technical components: (i) an ensemble Kalman filter to tractably handle high-dimensional, strongly nonlinear dynamical models; (ii) multi-fidelity forecast models, where ROM-based coarse fidelities are constructed on-the-fly; and (iii) hyperreduction for the ROM, based on proper orthogonal decomposition and the empirical quadrature procedure, constructed using the ensemble of full order model trajectories. We show that the multi-fidelity statistical estimates based on efficient, on-the-fly construction of the ROM enables rapid and reliable state estimation for practical nonlinear dynamical systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework to estimate the state of a separated flow around an airfoil by (i) showing that the ROM-based multi-fidelity method is more accurate than the single-fidelity method for comparable computational cost and (ii) showing that multi-fidelity statistics enable the use of a less accurate surrogate when compared against ROM-only filters, at negligible cost.},

  abstract     = {Topology optimization for multi-material structures has become an important and hot research topic due to their great application potential in modern industries. Unfortunately, most existing multi-material topology optimization methods assume that the interface is perfectly bonded, and those that do not, ignore the strength difference between different interfaces, limiting their application in the design of multi-material structures with more than two solid phases. In this study, a multi-material topology optimization method considering a tension/compression-asymmetric piecewise interface stress constraint is proposed to improve the overall interface strengths of the multi-material structure under the SIMP method framework. Firstly, a new interpolation scheme is developed to identify interfaces between two arbitrary materials and classify the interfaces into different pieces based on the two neighbor materials. Then, a novel piecewise interface stress constraint is developed to describe different targeted strengths at multiple material interfaces . In this constraint, the equivalent interfacial stress considering the tension/compression-asymmetric characteristics is defined by tensile stresses and shear stresses at material interfaces . The maximum stresses at material interfaces are measured by the global p-norm aggregation function which makes imposing the constraint easy. After that, the proposed piecewise tension/compression-asymmetric interface stress constraint is introduced into multi-material topology optimization for compliance minimization. The sensitivity analyses are derived by the adjoint method. Several benchmark 2D examples are provided to discuss the influence of some parameters on optimization problems , such as the interface width, strength scaling factor and the filter radii . Other numerical examples include complex 3D problems and problems involving more than three materials. In all examples, the results show that the proposed algorithm with the tension/compression-asymmetric piecewise interface stress constraint can effectively control interface stress levels and improve structural safety.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, 2-D hp local adaptive procedure is developed based on Control Volume Isogeometric Analysis (CV-IGA) and Hierarchical Fup (HF) basis functions. Contrary to the most common truncated hierarchical splines, HF enables local hp adaptation because higher resolution levels do not include only basis with smaller compact support or higher frequencies, but also with higher order. Consequence of this property is spectral convergence of the proposed adaptive algorithm which is presented on classical benchmarks such as L-shape benchmark and advection dominated problems. Even in non-smooth problems, spectral convergence is achieved contrary to the application of uniform grid. CV-IGA ensures local and global mass conservation which is potentially very important for fluid mechanics problems. 2-D proposed algorithm chooses regular control volumes in parametric space at all resolution levels closely related to the Greville points (vertices) of basis functions. Therefore, methodology is very simple requiring only overlapping of control volumes in the areas where different levels are connected, while its computational cost lies between Galerkin and collocation formulations.},

  abstract     = {To solve boundary integral equations for potential problems using collocation Boundary Element Method (BEM) on smooth curved 3D geometries, an analytical singularity extraction technique is employed. By adopting the isoparametric approach, curved geometries that are represented by mapped rectangles or triangles from the parametric domain are considered. The singularity extraction on the governing singular integrals can be performed either as an operation of subtraction or division, each having some advantage. A particular series expansion of a singular kernel about a source point is investigated. The series in the parametric coordinates consists of functions of a type R p x q y r Rpxqyr , where R R is a square root of a quadratic bivariate homogeneous polynomial with coefficients corresponding to the first fundamental form of a smooth surface , and p , q , r p,q,r are integers, satisfying p ≤ − 1 p≤−1 and q , r ≥ 0 q,r≥0 . By extracting more terms from the series expansion of the singular kernel, the smoothness of the regularized kernel at the source point can be increased. Analytical formulae for integrals of such terms are obtained from antiderivatives of R p x q y r Rpxqyr , using recurrence formulae , and by evaluating them at the edges of rectangular or triangular parametric domains. Numerical tests demonstrate that the singularity extraction technique can be a useful prerequisite for a numerical quadrature scheme to obtain high order of convergence for the governing singular integrals in 3D collocation BEM with respect to the number of quadrature nodes or with respect to size of the discretization mesh cells.},

Discrete diffusion is added to the established precondition operator, which is heuristically motivated by Darcy’s law—a homogenization result of Stokes’ equations on perforated domains. As proof of concept , we embed the operator into a block-diagonal precondition matrix for MINRES and solve the stationary Stokes saddle-point system. For domains with complex geometries , the number of iterations required to meet a certain tolerance is significantly reduced.

Additionally, both NURBS basis functions and Lagrange polynomials are employed to discretize the fluid domain for comparison. Several numerical examples indicate that the proposed cavitation formulation can provide more accurate and robust solutions when combined with the mortar method and NURBS basis functions.

  abstract     = {In the numerical discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs) with moving frames on curved surfaces, the discretization error does not converge for a high p ≥ 5 p≥5 . Moreover, the conservation error remains significant even in a refined mesh and does not converge as the polynomial order p p increases. We postulate that the inaccurate location of the internal grid points of curved elements causes this problem; this is called the internal point error . This bottleneck of convergence persists even when the vertices of the elements are located exactly on the curved domain. We first theoretically explain the effects of the internal point error on numerical accuracy. We then computationally validate the postulation by using a high-order mesh with a negligible internal point error, even for a high-order polynomial of order p p . For computational validations, four differential operators and four PDEs are numerically solved using moving frames on the unit sphere to demonstrate the effect of the internal point error.},

  abstract     = {A thermodynamically consistent model proposed in this work introduces a generative symbolic framework for computational components, which can capture the inelastic behavior of interfaces with 3D kinematics in response to monotonic, cyclic, and fatigue loading histories. It contributes to a long list of existing cohesive zone models by introducing novel forms of potentials for free energy, threshold function, and dissipation to deliver the following model properties: (i) the evolution equations derived from the potentials are linked in such a way that damage develops along with the cumulative measure of plastic sliding, (ii) the convex, continuous, and smooth shape of the threshold function introduced in the effective stress domain enables a general and efficient time integration that automatically handles unloading and reloading, and (iii) the non-associative flow potential includes a scalable degree of coupling between normal and tangential damage evolution. The studies performed in the paper demonstrate that these model ingredients lead to a consistent coverage of arbitrary non-proportional loading scenarios in tangential and normal directions. For monotonic loading , the presented examples illustrate the ability of the model to reproduce the shear dilatancy , pressure sensitivity including the vertex effect, stiffness recovery in compression, and abrasion due to sliding. For cyclic fatigue loading , the studies show that the model reflects the link between the hysteretic behavior and the fatigue damage evolution. This link constitutes the basis for a physically sound description of fatigue degradation along material interfaces . It manifests itself in the presented energy breakdown with distinguished fractions of energy release due to damage and plasticity ascribed to normal and tangential directions . Two calibration and validation examples using pull-out tests exposed to monotonic and cyclic loading are provided to show the applicability of the model for the characterization of the bond between steel bars and concrete. A publicly available implementation using a computer algebra system (CAS) is provided in the form of an interactive Jupyter notebook to document the reproducibility of the results.},

Motivated by the control net of B-splines with non-repetitive end knots, the subdivision surface is parameterized on the non-boundary elements, where no special subdivision rules and evaluation needed for the boundaries. This idea together with the Nitsche’s method which is adopted for weakly imposing boundary conditions is used to solve the non-optimal convergence rate problem for extended Loop subdivision even without extraordinary points (EPs). For the EPs, we define a new rule with a parameter λ λ ( 0 &lt; λ &lt; 1 . 0 0&amp;lt;λ&amp;lt;1.0 ), which is exactly the second maximum eigenvalue of the subdivision matrix. The MLSS is defined by combining the two ideas, which is global C 2 C2 -continuous except G 1 G1 and curvature bounded around the EPs. The MLSS limit surface has comparable shape quality as Loop subdivision surface. Besides that, the numerical experiments show that MLSS can achieve the optimal convergence rate in the Poisson problem both in the L 2 L2 and H 1 H1 norm.},

  abstract     = {We present a computational framework to obtain nonlinearly elastic constitutive relations of special Cosserat rods with surface energy. The framework allows the rod’s cross-section to have arbitrary shape and the rod material to obey arbitrary three-dimensional material model for its bulk volume and arbitrary surface energy model for its lateral surface. The kinematics of the Helical Cauchy–Born rule is used to first construct a family of six-parameter (corresponding to the six strain measures of rod theory) helical rod configurations in which the generated three-dimensional strain field is uniform in the rod’s arc-length coordinate. This uniformity allows the three-dimensional nonlinear equations of elasticity to reduce to just the rod’s cross-sectional plane wherein the cross-section’s boundary also experiences traction due to the inherent surface energy in the rod’s lateral surface. The solution of this cross-sectional problem yields the induced in-plane displacement and out-of-plane warping in the cross-section for arbitrarily prescribed strain measures of the rod. We then derive expressions for the induced internal contact force, moment and stiffnesses of the rod in terms of the solution of the deformed cross-section and the prescribed strains of the rod. A finite element formulation is presented to solve the nonlinear cross-sectional deformation problem and further obtain the induced internal contact force, moment and stiffnesses. The presented framework will be useful for modeling of nanorods where surface energy plays a dominant role. Several numerical examples are presented using the presented framework to illustrate the effect of surface energy parameters on the deformation of the nanorod’s cross-section and the nanorod’s bending, torsional, extensional and shearing stiffnesses. We also derive improved analytical formulas for the extensional and bending stiffnesses of isotropic rectangular nanorods in their reference state . These formulas reduce to the existing widely used formulas for a special choice of material parameters, i.e., when the surface Poisson’s ratio and the bulk Poisson’s ratio match thus highlighting the limitation of the existing formulas.},

The bisectional algorithm accurately calculates the Lagrangian multiplier of the volume constraint in each iteration. In addition to expressing the optimized structure smoothly, the proposed method is highly efficient. For instance, it only takes 20 iterations to solve the cantilever and MBB beams in 2D.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a hyperplane modelling technique aided polymorphic uncertainty quantification strategy for various engineering applications. Accumulative experiences from industrial applications have continuously revealed that probability distribution characteristics for system properties cannot always be precisely determined, due to the scarcity of available information. Thus, the polymorphic uncertainty is introduced to consider fuzzy and random uncertainty simultaneously. To tackle such uncertainty quantification challenges, Multiple Target Strategy (MTS) and Single Target Strategy (STS) are proposed. MTS is a generalized polymorphic uncertainty quantification strategy, capable of providing sufficient amounts of the statistical information of the concerned structural response. On the contrary, STS considers the polymorphic uncertainty quantification in a more precise and efficient manner. Both strategies are implemented based on their respective hyperplane models. For hyperplane model construction, a newly developed ensemble meta-regression technique, namely AdaBoost Extended Support Vector Regression (Ada-X-SVR), is embedded with a novel kernel function. The proposed hyperplane modelling aided polymorphic uncertainty quantification framework provides the feasibility of both generalized and targeted estimations, auto-learning and information update features. Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability and computational efficiency of the proposed strategies, a benchmark analysis with an available analytical solution and three engineering applications with linear and nonlinear performance are fully investigated.},

Deep neural networks are able to learn complex material response without the constraints of closed-form models. However, data-driven approaches do not a priori satisfy physics-based mathematical requirements such as polyconvexity, a condition needed for the existence of minimizers for boundary value problems in elasticity. In this study, we use a recent class of neural networks , neural ordinary differential equations (N-ODEs), to develop data-driven material models that automatically satisfy polyconvexity of the strain energy. We take advantage of the properties of ordinary differential equations to create monotonic functions that approximate the derivatives of the strain energy with respect to deformation invariants . The monotonicity of the derivatives guarantees the convexity of the energy. The N-ODE material model is able to capture synthetic data generated from closed-form material models, and it outperforms conventional models when tested against experimental data on skin, a highly nonlinear and anisotropic material. We also showcase the use of the N-ODE material model in finite element simulations of reconstructive surgery. The framework is general and can be used to model a large class of materials, especially biological soft tissues. We therefore expect our methodology to further enable data-driven methods in computational mechanics.},

Although many modifications have been proposed, there is a need for a global approach that improves both mass conservation and momentum conservation. The key to such a global method is to control local conservation, which is weaker than to control the residual everywhere. Accordingly, a new method named conservation–prioritized​ Moment Least-Squares (CMLS) is developed. The CMLS method emerges from the moment conditions . Among these moment conditions, the zero-order moment, which exactly expresses the local conservation condition on the element, is prioritized over the others; thereby, good local conservation can be achieved. The advantages of the CMLS method over the LS method are demonstrated by conservation errors, convergence studies, and numerical accuracy in nonlinear Navier–Stokes tests. Besides, the CMLS method retains the merits of the LS method: it has a symmetric positive-definite global matrix and the same interpolation for both velocity and pressure.},

  abstract     = {Complex shells and curvilinear stiffeners are promising for the lightweight design of aerospace structures. Along with the increasing of structural size and geometric characteristics , traditional finite element analysis (FEA) requires fine grids to content the analysis accuracy, which is extremely time-consuming. In this study, a novel NURBS-based degenerated stiffener element is proposed. Based on the 6 degree of freedom (DOF) degenerated beam element, the proposed stiffener element solves the issue of direct coupling between the beam element and 5 DOF degenerated shell element. Skin and stiffener are characterized by NURBS surface and curve, respectively. Meanwhile, the buckling behavior of stiffened panels is investigated based on isogeometric analysis (IGA), which reduces the geometric discrete error and realizes the integration of modeling and analysis. In addition, since the grids of skin and stiffeners are always unmatched, a strong coupling method based on NURBS interpolation and projection algorithm is constructed to merge non-conforming grids. The degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) of stiffeners is eliminated in the equilibrium equation , which greatly reduces the calculation scale. Furthermore, an improved point-to-surface projection algorithm is proposed, which improves the computational efficiency and solves the problem of unstable convergence of Newton iteration . Finally, the static and buckling analyses are performed for different types of stiffened plates and shells. Displacement solutions, von Mises stress solutions and buckling modes are discussed in detail. The prediction accuracy and meshes are compared with the shell-type model and beam-shell-type model in ABAQUS software, which indicates the high applicability and efficiency of the proposed analysis method for various types of stiffened panels.},

  abstract     = {A Lagrangian–Eulerian stabilized collocation method (LESCM) for the fluid–structure interaction problems involving free surface flow is presented in this work, in which the structure is modeled by a rigid body . This method is an evolution of the material point method and particle-in-cell methods which are based on the hybrid Lagrangian–Eulerian description. The problem domain of the fluid and structures is discretized into the Lagrangian particles which carry the information, and the problem domain covering the entire movement space is discretized into the uniformly distributed Eulerian background nodes. The coupling governing equations of the fluid, structures and interfaces are solved by the meshfree stabilized collocation method (SCM) employing the reproducing kernel (RK) approximation on the Eulerian nodes. The solution is very efficient since the Eulerian nodes are set to be the initial positions in each time step and it is no need to reconstruct the shape function. The information mappings between the Lagrangian particles and the Eulerian nodes are also conducted by the RK approximation which can keep the mass and momentum conservation of the solution. The cell-cut algorithm is introduced to couple the fluid and the structures which can solve the fluid pressure and the fluid–structure interactional force simultaneously and avoid the complicated iterations of the traditional interaction algorithms. Several numerical examples including the collapse of water column with a rigid barrier, water entry of a half-buoyant circular cylinder and a rigid box rotating and sinking in water are simulated, which demonstrate the high accuracy, high efficiency and good stability of the proposed method. This method can be extensively applied to the engineering applications of fluid–rigid body interactions .},

The objective of predicting failure locations presents an extreme case of class imbalance since most of the material in the specimens does not fail. In response to this challenge, we develop and demonstrate the effectiveness of data- and loss-based regularization methods. Since there is considerable sensitivity of the failure location to the particular configuration of voids, we also use variational inference to provide uncertainties for the neural network predictions. We connect the deterministic and Bayesian convolutional neural network formulations to explain how variational inference regularizes the training and predictions. We demonstrate that the resulting predicted variances are effective in ranking the locations that are most likely to fail in any given specimen.},

The total Lagrangian discrete formulation with explicit time integration is then developed for the coupled displacement and phase fields within the framework of the material point method (MPM) to handle the massive deformation involving fracture. Considering the impact and collision of soft materials, an improved contact algorithm based on particles in the TLMPM is developed to deal with the contact and self-contact response. Furthermore, the staggered single-iteration scheme is implemented to effectively solve the coupling discrete displacement and phase field governing equations. Two representative examples are presented to demonstrate the mesh convergence and accuracy of the proposed method. Finally, the collision of rings, the compression of hyperelastic blocks and the impact of a metal ball on a soft membrane are simulated and analyzed to illustrate the good performance of the proposed phase-field TLMPM in dealing with the dynamic fracture of soft materials with contact and self-contact involving massive deformation.},

  abstract     = {Within the scope of our recent approach for Efficient Unsupervised Constitutive Law Identification and Discovery (EUCLID), we propose an unsupervised Bayesian learning framework for discovery of parsimonious and interpretable constitutive laws with quantifiable uncertainties. As in deterministic EUCLID, we do not resort to stress data, but only to realistically measurable full-field displacement and global reaction force data; as opposed to calibration of an a priori assumed model, we start with a constitutive model ansatz based on a large catalog of candidate functional features; we leverage domain knowledge by including features based on existing, both physics-based and phenomenological, constitutive models. In the new Bayesian-EUCLID approach, we use a hierarchical Bayesian model with sparsity-promoting priors and Monte Carlo sampling to efficiently solve the parsimonious model selection task and discover physically consistent constitutive equations in the form of multivariate multi-modal probabilistic distributions. We demonstrate and validate the ability to accurately and efficiently recover isotropic and anisotropic hyperelastic models like the Neo-Hookean, Isihara, Gent–Thomas, Arruda–Boyce, Ogden, and Holzapfel models in both elastostatics and elastodynamics. The discovered constitutive models are reliable under both epistemic uncertainties — i.e. uncertainties on the true features of the constitutive catalog – and aleatoric uncertainties – which arise from the noise in the displacement field data, and are automatically estimated by the hierarchical Bayesian model.},

Despite the merit, this algorithm can only solve problems with one objective. To solve complex multi-objective optimization problems, including engineering design problems , a multi-objective AHA (MOAHA) is developed in this study. In MOAHA, an external archive is employed to save Pareto optimal solutions , and a dynamic elimination-based crowding distance (DECD) method is developed to maintain this archive to effectively preserve the population diversity. In addition, a non-dominated sorting strategy is merged with MOAHA to construct a solution update mechanism, which effectively refines Pareto optimal solutions for improving the convergence of the algorithm. The superior results over 7 competitors on 28 benchmark functions in terms of convergence, diversity and solution distribution are demonstrated with a suite of comprehensive tests. The MOAHA algorithm is also applied to 5 real-world engineering design problems with multiple objectives, demonstrating its superiority in handling challenging real-world multi-objective problems with unknown true Pareto optimal solutions and fronts.

  abstract     = {The latest generation wafer scanners use extreme ultraviolet light to project a pattern of electronic connections onto a silicon wafer. A significant part of the projection light is absorbed by the mirrors in the projection system. This causes the mirrors to heat up and expand, which leads to a significant reduction in the imaging quality of the wafer scanner. The imaging quality can be improved by applying an additional actuation heat load to the mirrors. Because the wafer scanner can be used with a large number of different illumination settings (which lead to different load cases) and the number of thermal actuators is limited, designing an effective actuation heater layout is an important but nontrivial task. To assist this design process, this paper proposes a computational framework to optimize a small number of spatial actuation heat load shapes with their corresponding intensities for a large number of load cases. It is guaranteed that the obtained actuation heat load shapes can keep the steady-state temperature in the optical surface of the mirror sufficiently close to a desired temperature in all considered load cases. The proposed computational framework is applied to a representative three-dimensional finite element model of a mirror. The obtained actuation heat load shapes and their corresponding intensities provide insights for the design of a thermal actuation layout for mirror heating.},

The governing equations of peridynamics are coupled via a multi-direct immersed boundary method with the incompressible formulation of the Navier–Stokes equations, which are used to govern the dynamics of the fluid phase. The synchronization of the solution is achieved via a fully explicit, weak-coupling strategy that allows for fast and efficient computations. A detailed description of the methodology is provided, together with the results of several validation benchmarks. The qualitative results of the unsteady hydraulic fracture of a porous medium are also presented to show the potential of the proposed approach.

The PD equilibrium equations as well as the PD form of the traction components are constructed by using these elements and solved within the ANSYS framework through implicit methods. The domain is divided into three regions in order to satisfy the equilibrium equations and to directly impose the displacement and traction boundary conditions without a fictitious layer. The results are free of displacement kinks; thus, removing the unphysical stress concentrations. Also, the displacement predictions maintain the smoothness throughout the domain. Its accuracy is demonstrated by considering isotropic elastic plates subjected to various types of boundary conditions under quasi-static loading conditions. For all combinations of boundary conditions, the displacement predictions agree well with FE results. Failure is introduced gradually through the KILL option in ANSYS.},

The method features: 1) forming local problems for individual and interactive cracks; and 2) parallel solving local problems and returning local solutions as part of the trial solution for global iteration. It has been demonstrated analytically (through a simple 1D problem) and numerically (through several benchmarking examples) that, the proposed method can substantially improve the robustness of the global solution process and significantly reduce the costly global iteration for convergence. The demonstrated improvement in numerical efficiency is up to 20 ∼ 40 % 20∼40% for mildly unstable problems. For problems with severely unstable crack initiation and propagation, the improvement can be more significant.

The formulation is exemplified by stiffness optimization in which the overhang is limited by adding mechanical or thermal compliance as a measure of the cost of partially manufactured designs. Convergence of the model as the approximate layer-by-layer model is refined is shown theoretically, and an extensive numerical study indicates that this convergence can be fast, thus making it a computationally viable approach useful for including AM-related issues into topology optimization. The examples also show that drips and sharp corners associated with some geometry-based formulations for overhang limitation can be avoided.

In this work, we propose a multilevel concurrent integration algorithm associated with scheduling that brings one extra degree of possible speedup. Because of one extra degree of possible speedup, we analyze the concurrent integration inside elements. The scheduling algorithm is intended for strongly related hierarchical architectures of a GPU . Using trace theory and Foata Normal Form, we verify integrity of the proposed solution. Summing up, we propose a general method for analyzing concurrency of the integration algorithm.

Those materials are modeled on both micro- and macroscale , with a scale transition of volume averaging type satisfying the Hill–Mandel condition. A nonuniform transformation field analysis is performed on the microscopic inelastic strain fields for a model reduction. Reduced variables are deduced from a space–time decomposition of those inelastic strain fields. Closed-form constitutive relations are derived from some dissipative considerations, thus resulting into a reduced order homogenization problem. The resulting model error is sufficiently small for the considered class of materials, thus leaving the discretization error of the finite element method as a main error source. For ease of error estimate , we rewrite the reduced order problem in a multifield formulation. Based on duality techniques, a backward-in-time dual problem is derived from a Lagrange method , rendering error representations of a user-defined quantity of interest. Combining a patch recovery technique, a computable error estimator is developed to quantify both spatial and temporal discretization errors. By means of a localization technique, local error estimators are used to drive a greedy adaptive refinement algorithm in space and time.

  abstract     = {Modeling nonlinear materials with arbitrary microstructures and loading paths is crucial in structural analyses with heterogeneous materials with uncertainty. However, it is computationally prohibitive because (1) fine meshes are required to resolve the microstructures for nonlinear simulations, (2) enormous model evaluations are expected to simulate stochastic microstructures and the loading variabilities, and (3) nonlinear material models are generally expensive to solve. In this paper, we present the microstructure-guided deep material network (MgDMN), a deep-learning-based approach to model multi-phase materials and efficiently predict their mechanical response under virtually any loading paths and microstructure definitions considering plasticity. This work is built upon the earlier development of the deep material network (DMN) method for fast predictions of nonlinear homogenized responses of multi-phase materials using linear elastic training data for a predefined microstructure. We extend DMN to MgDMN for any microstructure definition by parameterizing the microstructure space, mapping a small set of DMNs to their respective microstructure parameters, and interpolating the DMNs to generate new models in the microstructure space. The proposed method achieves superb efficiency and accuracy since the interpolated DMNs do not need additional training to predict nonlinear behavior of any new microstructures. We demonstrate our approach via modeling and uncertainty quantification of short fiber reinforced polymer (SFRP) composites. We show that for this dual-phase material, only four base DMNs are needed to predict the nonlinear stress responses for any loading path given any fiber volume fraction , orientation states, and constituent properties as long as the combination is within the microstructure space enclosed by the base models. The accelerated modeling process enables complex structural simulations of heterogeneous materials and nonlinear stochastic analyses with uncertain microstructures, which are essential in computational materials engineering and multiscale modeling . Our research also draws insights into the impact of microstructure uncertainties on linear and nonlinear material behaviors .},

An efficient decoupled scheme is proposed to implement by the gradient flow approach to decrease the objective function. In each loop, we first update the velocity field by solving the Stokes equation with the phase field variable given in the previous iteration, which is followed by updating the phase field variable by solving an Allen–Cahn-type equation using a stabilized scheme. We then take the cut-off post-processing for the phase-field variable to constrain its value in [ 0 , 1 ] [0,1] . In the last step of each loop, the Lagrangian parameter is updated with an appropriate artificial time step. We rigorously prove that the proposed scheme permits an unconditionally monotonic-decreasing property. To enhance the overall efficiency of the algorithm, in each loop we update the phase field variable and Lagrangian parameter several time steps but update the velocity field only one time. Numerical results for various shape optimizations are presented to validate the effectiveness of our numerical scheme .},

  abstract     = {Fracture is a very challenging and complicated problem with various applications in engineering and physics. Although it has been extensively studied within the context of mesh-based numerical techniques , such as the finite element method (FEM), the research activity within the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) community remains scarce. SPH is a particle-based numerical method used to discretize equations of continuum media. Its meshfree nature makes it ideal to simulate fracture scenarios that involve extreme deformations. However, to model fracture, SPH researchers have mostly relied on ad-hoc empirical local damage models, cohesive zone approaches, or pseudo-spring models, which come with a set of drawbacks and limitations. On the other hand, phase field models of brittle fracture have recently gained popularity in academic circles and provide significant improvements compared to previous approaches. These improvements include the derivation from fundamental fracture theories, the introduction of non-locality, and the ability to model multiple crack initiation, propagation, branching, and coalescence, in situations where no prior knowledge of the crack paths is available. Nevertheless, phase field for fracture has not been studied within SPH. In this proof-of-concept paper we develop and implement a phase field model of brittle fracture within the context of SPH. Comprehensive mathematical and implementation details are provided, and several challenging numerical examples are computed and illustrate the proposed method’s ability to accurately and efficiently simulate complex fracture scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The mechanical behavior of inelastic materials with microstructure is very complex and hard to grasp with heuristic, empirical constitutive models. For this purpose, multiscale, homogenization approaches are often used for performing reliable, accurate predictions of the macroscopic mechanical behavior of solids and structures. Nevertheless, the calculation cost of such approaches is extremely high and prohibitive for real-scale applications involving inelastic materials. Recently, data-driven approaches based on machine learning and, in particular, deep learning have risen as a promising alternative to replace ad-hoc constitutive laws and speed-up multiscale numerical methods. However, such approaches require huge amounts of high quality data, fail to give reliable predictions outside the training range and they lack a rigorous frame based on the laws of physics and thermodynamics. As a result, their application to model materials with complex microstructure in inelasticity is not yet established. Here, we propose the so-called Thermodynamics-based Artificial Neural Networks (TANN) for the constitutive modeling of materials with inelastic and complex microstructure. Our approach integrates thermodynamics-aware dimensionality reduction techniques and thermodynamics-based deep neural networks to identify, in an autonomous way, the constitutive laws and discover the internal state variables of complex inelastic materials. The ability of TANN in delivering high-fidelity, physically consistent predictions is demonstrated through several examples both at the microscopic and macroscopic scale. The efficiency and accuracy of TANN in predicting the average and local stress–strain response, the free-energy and the dissipation rate is demonstrated for both regular and perturbed two- and three-dimensional lattice microstructures in inelasticity. TANN manage to identify the internal state variables that characterize the inelastic deformation of the complex microstructural fields. These internal state variables are then used to reconstruct the microdeformation fields of the microstructure at a given state. Finally, a double-scale homogenization scheme (FEM × × TANN) is used to solve a large scale boundary value problem. The high performance of the homogenized model using TANN is illustrated through detailed comparisons with microstructural calculations at large scale. An excellent agreement is shown for a variety of monotonous and cyclic stress–strain paths.},

The new formulation considers local self-adjustable time integration parameters that are defined for each element of the adopted spatial discretization procedure, following the properties of the discretized model. Thus, the explicit/implicit subdomains of the analysis are established at an element level, taking into account automated computations. Two types of explicit approaches are considered here, allowing extended stability limits to be provided and more efficient analyses performed. Controllable numerical dissipation is also enabled following the locally defined adaptive time integrators of the method. In this sense, optimally designed time integration parameters are developed, providing null spectral radii for the highest sampling frequency of the elements, and close to one values for the important low-frequency response domain. Thus, the influence of spurious high-frequency modes is very effectively extinguished and reduced dissipative and dispersive errors are introduced into the analysis. At the end of the paper numerical results are provided, illustrating the excellent performance of the proposed new methodology.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the authors propose a dimension reduction level set method (DR-LSM) for shape and topology optimization of heat conduction problems on general free-form surfaces utilizing the conformal geometry theory. The original heat conduction optimization problem defined on a free-form surface embedded in the 3D space can be equivalently transferred and solved on a 2D parameter domain utilizing the conformal invariance of the Laplace equation along with the extended level set method (X-LSM). Reducing the dimension can not only significantly reduce the computational cost of finite element analysis but also overcome the hurdles of dynamic boundary evolution on free-form surfaces. The equivalence of this dimension reduction method rests on the fact that the covariant derivatives on the manifold can be represented by the Euclidean gradient operators multiplied by a scalar with the conformal mapping. The proposed method is applied to the design of conformal thermal control structures on free-form surfaces. Specifically, both the Hamilton–Jacobi equation and the heat equation, the two governing PDEs for boundary evolution and thermal conduction phenomena, are transformed from the manifold in 3D space to the 2D rectangular domain using conformal parameterization. The objective function, constraints, and the design velocity field are also computed equivalently with FEA on the 2D parameter domain with properly modified forms. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method are systematically demonstrated through five numerical examples of heat conduction problems on the manifolds.},

  abstract     = {The nearly singular integral , arising in simulating thin coatings or close-boundary physical quantities , are not adequately dealt with in the isogeometric boundary element method (IGABEM), especially in 3D problems. In this paper, we propose a semi-analytical approach for the nearly singular integrals of 3D potential problems. We first expand all the kernel items by Taylor series up to second order accuracy. In order to employ the semi-analytical formulae when integrating in parametric space , coordinate ( ξ , η ) (ξ,η) is further transformed to polar coordinate ( ρ , θ ) (ρ,θ) . We then use the subtraction technique to separate the integrals to near-singular parts and regular parts. For the near-singular parts, a semi-analytical treatment is performed where the integrations with respect to ρ ρ are expressed by analytical formulae recursively, while the ones related to θ θ are computed by Gaussian quadrature . The remaining regular integrals are treated numerically by the sinh sinh transformation method. By adding them together, we could efficiently handle the nearly singular integrals and therefore obtain accurate close-boundary potentials and flux densities in 3D potential problems. The accuracy of the presented method for nearly singular integrals to a curved element with different orders of singularities , namely the nearly weakly, strongly and highly singular integrals, are first tested. We then further consider potential problems of three typical 3D structures. All the presented results are compared with the recently proposed improved sinh sinh transformation method and analytical solutions. The above numerical examples fully show the efficiency and competitiveness of the presented semi-analytical schemes.},

This study investigates the seepage-induced suffusion and slope instability using a hierarchical multiscale finite–discrete element method (FEM–DEM). An erosion law with the critical hydraulic gradient for the onset of suffusion is proposed. Two examples, including one-dimensional suffusion and biaxial compression tests, are performed to verify the proposed scheme. Emphases are placed on reproducing suffusion and progressive slope failure process under seepage flow. The results indicate that a shear band is initiated from the slope toe and gradually extends to the crest. The increase of erosion rate accelerates the process of suffusion and slope failure, whereas a higher critical hydraulic gradient plays an opposite role. In addition, fines loss caused by suffusion occurs mainly on the slope surface, especially near the slope toe. Microscopic analyses on locally embedded representative volume elements (RVEs) indicate that RVEs inside the shear band experience severe deformation and microstructural changes, manifested by the rearrangement of soil skeletons and variation of contact force chains.},

This work develops a new element-based topology optimization algorithm by explicitly considering strong, weak or intermediate interfaces, and the interfacial width can also be controlled precisely. Under the explicit expression of a graded interface, a linear multi-material interpolation scheme is proposed to gradually achieve realistic graded physical field within the interfacial zone, where the interdiffusion or reaction inevitably happens and leads to the gradual transition of the interface property. The compliance minimization of multi-material structures with different types of graded interfaces is formulated under multiple volume fraction constraints. The sensitivity of the objective function and constraints with respect to design variables are derived. Numerical examples demonstrate that the optimized designs resulting from the proposed method always achieve a lower compliance, compared with those of the traditional multi-material designs. A phase diagram is presented to describe the sensitivity of the topological design on the interface behavior.},

The closure relation for the moment systems derives from minimization of a suitable φ φ -divergence. We present sufficient conditions such that this divergence-based closure yields a hierarchy of tractable symmetric hyperbolic moment systems that retain the fundamental structural properties of the Boltzmann equation. The resulting combined space-time DGFE moment method corresponds to a Galerkin approximation of the Boltzmann equation in renormalized form. We propose a renormalization map that facilitates the approximation of multidimensional problems in an implicit manner. Moreover, upper and lower entropy bounds are derived for the proposed DGFE moment scheme. Numerical results for benchmark problems governed by the BGK-Boltzmann equation are presented to illustrate the approximation properties of the new DGFE moment method, and it is shown that the proposed velocity-space-time DGFE moment method is entropy bounded.},

A novel approach, based on moment fitting, is introduced to restore the diagonal mass matrix property in elements intersected by interfaces, thus enabling the use of explicit time integrators. Since this approach can lead to significantly decreased critical time steps for intersected elements, a “leap-frog” algorithm is employed to locally comply with this condition, thus introducing only a small computational overhead. The resulting method is tested through a series of numerical examples of increasing complexity, where it is shown that it offers increased accuracy compared to other similar approaches. Due to these improvements, components of interest for structural health monitoring-related tasks can be effectively discretized, while maintaining a performance comparable or only slightly worse than the standard spectral element method .},

To date, a proper extension of second-order homogenisation to a thick shell model, such as the 5-parameter formulation, remains non-trivial due to the difficulties in projecting the macroscopic transverse shear strains to the fine scale whilst satisfying the stress boundary conditions on the top and bottom faces. To overcome this, the paper proposes a novel volumetric constraint on the fluctuation moment field, that is used in conjunction with a set of constraints obtained through an orthogonality condition. The result is a consistent downscaling procedure that can properly downscale all the macroscopic shell strains. More notably, a pure transverse shear deformation can be achieved, thus producing a uniform parabolic shear stress distribution in homogeneous materials. The key equations for upscaling are obtained through the modified Hill–Mandel condition. In particular, the shell tangent operators are derived in closed form as a function of the Taylor upper bound and softening terms coming from the fluctuation matrices. The proposed framework is general and can incorporate full geometric and material nonlinearities across all the length scales of interest. Through a series of benchmarks, it is demonstrated that the constitutive tangents computed through the present framework correspond well with analytical solutions. Finally, excellent agreements in model responses, including through-thickness stress distributions are found between the multi-scale ( FE 2 FE2 ) and the full-scale models in the numerical benchmarks, featuring the nonlinear loading of thin and thick heterogeneous panels.},

  abstract     = {The high computational cost of topology optimization has prevented its widespread use as a generative design tool. To reduce this computational cost, we propose an artificial intelligence approach to drastically accelerate topology optimization without sacrificing its accuracy. The resulting AI-driven topology optimization can fully capture the underlying physics of the problem. As a result, the machine learning model, which consists of a convolutional neural network with residual links, is able to generalize what it learned from the training set to solve a wide variety of problems with different geometries, boundary conditions, mesh sizes, volume fractions and filter radius. We train the machine learning model separately from the topology optimization, which allows us to achieve a considerable speedup (up to 30 times faster than traditional topology optimization). Through several design examples, we demonstrate that the proposed AI-driven topology optimization framework is effective, scalable and efficient. The speedup enabled by the framework makes topology optimization a more attractive tool for engineers in search of lighter and stronger structures, with the potential to revolutionize the engineering design process. Although this work focuses on compliance minimization problems, the proposed framework can be generalized to other objective functions, constraints and physics.},

  abstract     = {Computational models of the human head are promising tools for estimating the impact-induced response of the brain, and thus play an important role in the prediction of traumatic brain injury. The basic constituents of these models (i.e., model geometry, material properties, and boundary conditions) are often associated with significant uncertainty and variability. As a result, uncertainty quantification (UQ), which involves quantification of the effect of this uncertainty and variability on the simulated response, becomes critical to ensure reliability of model predictions. Modern biofidelic head model simulations are associated with very high computational cost and high-dimensional inputs and outputs, which limits the applicability of traditional UQ methods on these systems. In this study, a two-stage, data-driven manifold learning-based framework is proposed for UQ of computational head models. This framework is demonstrated on a 2D subject-specific head model, where the goal is to quantify uncertainty in the simulated strain fields (i.e., output), given variability in the material properties of different brain substructures (i.e., input). In the first stage, a data-driven method based on multi-dimensional Gaussian kernel-density estimation and diffusion maps is used to generate realizations of the input random vector directly from the available data. Computational simulations of a small number of realizations provide input–output pairs for training data-driven surrogate models in the second stage. The surrogate models employ nonlinear dimensionality reduction using Grassmannian diffusion maps, Gaussian process regression to create a low-cost mapping between the input random vector and the reduced solution space, and geometric harmonics models for mapping between the reduced space and the Grassmann manifold. It is demonstrated that the surrogate models provide highly accurate approximations of the computational model while significantly reducing the computational cost. Monte Carlo simulations of the surrogate models are used for uncertainty propagation. UQ of the strain fields highlights significant spatial variation in model uncertainty, and reveals key differences in uncertainty among commonly used strain-based brain injury predictor variables.},

  abstract     = {In this manuscript, we expand the conforming to interface structured adaptive mesh refinement (CISAMR) algorithm for modeling complex two-dimensional (2D) crack growth problems involving contact/friction along the crack surface and interaction between multiple cracks. The CISAMR algorithm transforms a structured mesh into a high-quality conforming mesh non-iteratively, which is an attractive feature for modeling the evolution of the crack geometry with minimal changes to the underlying mesh structure. To model such problems, the mesh structure is first adaptively refined and updated near the crack tip to form a spider-web pattern of elements for the accurate approximation of the energy release rate and thereby predicting the new crack path. In each step of the crack advance simulation, a small subset of elements in the vicinity of the crack tip is detected using a tree data structure and then deleted/regenerated to simulate the crack growth. The construction of a high-quality mesh with appropriate element aspect ratios in the algorithm allows the use of an explicit dynamic solver, which is essential to simulate the nonlinear response of the problem caused by contact forces along crack faces. Several benchmark fracture problems are presented to study the accuracy of the proposed algorithm, as well as two more complex problems to demonstrate its ability for modeling interaction of multiple growing cracks with one another and with embedded heterogeneities in the domain.},

We propose improved adaptive shape and domain refinement strategies for the embedding domain discretization method (EDD) to achieve numerically and geometrically accurate designs of the flexure hinges. Furthermore, to account for durability and manufacturability of the flexure hinges, we employed local stress constraints and a curvature constraint. The local stress constraints are integrated into an augmented Lagrange functional together with the output displacement to form a combined objective response. The design update is realized by employing and adapting the traction method for the specifics of the embedded boundary. Hence, the curvature constraint does not appear in a standard response form, but is rather introduced into the auxiliary boundary value problem (BVP) of the traction method via a penalty functional. The novelties of this work include: (1) enhanced adaptive shape and domain refinement strategies for EDD; (2) geometrically nonlinear shape optimization using EDD; (3) adapted traction method with curvature constraint.},

The first key ingredient of the present development is regularized variational formulation , recast in terms of stress resultants (bending moments and shear forces), which allows any convenient interpolations. The discrete approximation is here constructed by using the lowest order Raviart–Thomas vector space employed to discretize bending moment and shear force fields, providing the continuity of the stress resultants projections across the boundary between adjacent plate elements. The latter is of particular interest for dynamic analysis for it can capture smooth approximation for wave propagation phenomena. This particular space discrete approximation is further combined with the most appropriate time-integration schemes capable of enforcing either energy conservation or decay of high frequency modes, which delivers the schemes with higher stability and robustness in long-term computations. The developments are carried out for viscoplastic constitutive behavior of plate material, where the corresponding evolution equations are obtained by appealing to the penalty-like form of the principle of maximum plastic dissipation . The choice of viscoplasticity (rather than plasticity) is crucial in that allows development of second-order scheme by integrating simultaneously the momentum balance and viscoplastic strains evolution equations. Several numerical simulations are given to illustrate a very satisfying performance of the proposed hybrid-stress discrete approximation for thick plate element and of the energy conserving/decaying schemes.},

  abstract     = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have received significant attention as a unified framework for forward, inverse, and surrogate modeling of problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Training PINNs for forward problems , however, pose significant challenges, mainly because of the complex non-convex and multi-objective loss function. In this work, we present a PINN approach to solving the equations of coupled flow and deformation in porous media for both single-phase and multiphase flow . To this end, we construct the solution space using multi-layer neural networks. Due to the dynamics of the problem, we find that incorporating multiple differential relations into the loss function results in an unstable optimization problem , meaning that sometimes it converges to the trivial null solution, other times it moves very far from the expected solution. We report a dimensionless form of the coupled governing equations that we find most favorable to the optimizer. Additionally, we propose a sequential training approach based on the stress-split algorithms of poromechanics. Notably, we find that sequential training based on stress-split performs well for different problems, while the classical strain-split algorithm shows an unstable behavior similar to what is reported in the context of finite element solvers. We use the approach to solve benchmark problems of poroelasticity, including Mandel’s consolidation problem, Barry–Mercer’s injection-production problem, and a reference two-phase drainage problem.

  abstract     = {The complex geometries of real-world problems pose a considerable challenge to the preprocessing of the standard finite element method (FEM), wherein the mesh conforms to the physical domain. In this regard, an unfitted FEM with the physical domain embedded in a relatively simple mesh can be a promising substitute for the fitted FEM. However, the use of the unfitted FEM for poroelasticity problems with continuous interpolation is seldom reported. Hence, in this study, we propose a symmetric weak formulation based on the modification of Nitsche’s method for the numerical computation of fully coupled two-field poroelasticity using the FEM with general unfitted meshes. Furthermore, three stabilization terms based on the ghost penalty method are introduced to address the ill-conditioning caused by the small cut ratio of the physical part of an element to the whole element. Benchmark problems and a geotechnical engineering problem are solved using the proposed methodology. It is numerically demonstrated that the condition number of the coefficient matrix is bounded even when there is a tiny cut ratio. Both the condition numbers and the accuracies remain stable irrespective of how the boundary cuts the mesh. More importantly, optimal convergence rates concerning both space and time are preserved. This study substantially facilitates the numerical computation of poroelasticity problems with complex geometries.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning may encounter the generalization issue for uncertainty propagation due to the limited number of training data, especially when the training and test sample points follow different probability distributions. To overcome this challenge, this paper presents a latent adaptation-based deep learning approach to enhance the accuracy of deep networks for reliability-based design optimization under data constraint. By collecting training data from a source domain, an autoencoder is first utilized to introduce a meaningful low-dimensional latent space. Then a feedforward neural network is trained to link the original inputs to latent variables. To address the generalization issue, a latent adaptation strategy is proposed to link the latent variables across the target and source domains. A Gaussian process model is then constructed to learn the limit state function for the target domain in the latent space. Monte Carlo simulation is employed for reliability analysis in target domains. The latent adaptation-based deep learning is then integrated with reliability-based design optimization, and the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through two examples.},

  abstract     = {The phase-field method is a popular modeling technique used to describe the dynamics of microstructures and their physical properties at the mesoscale. However, because in these simulations the microstructure is described by a system of continuous variables evolving both in space and time, phase-field models are computationally expensive. They require refined spatio-temporal discretization and a parallel computing approach to achieve a useful degree of accuracy. As an alternative, we present and discuss an accelerated phase-field approach which uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) to learn the microstructure evolution in latent space. We perform a comprehensive analysis of different dimensionality-reduction methods and types of recurrent units in RNNs. Specifically, we compare statistical functions combined with linear and nonlinear embedding techniques to represent the microstructure evolution in latent space. We also evaluate several RNN models that implement a gating mechanism, including the long short-term memory (LSTM) unit and the gated recurrent unit (GRU) as the microstructure-learning engine. We analyze the different combinations of these methods on the spinodal decomposition of a two-phase system. Our comparison reveals that describing the microstructure evolution in latent space using an autocorrelation-based principal component analysis (PCA) method is the most efficient. We find that the LSTM and GRU RNN implementations provide comparable accuracy with respect to the high-fidelity phase-field predictions, but with a considerable computational speedup relative to the full simulation. This study not only enhances our understanding of the performance of dimensionality reduction on the microstructure evolution, but it also provides insights on strategies for accelerating phase-field modeling via machine learning techniques.},

  abstract     = {An image-based deep learning framework is developed to predict nonlinear stress distribution and failure pattern in microstructural representations of composite materials in this paper. The work is motivated by the complexity and computational cost of high-fidelity simulations of such materials. The proposed deep learning framework predicts the post-failure full-field stress distribution and the crack pattern in two-dimensional representations of the composites based on their microstructures. The deep learning framework contains two stacked fully-convolutional networks, namely, Generator 1 and Generator 2, trained sequentially. First, Generator 1 learns to translate the microstructural geometry to the full-field post-failure stress distribution. Then, Generator 2 learns to translate the output of Generator 1 to the failure pattern. A physics-informed loss function is also designed and incorporated to further improve the performance of the proposed framework and facilitate the validation process. The material of interest is selected to be a unidirectional carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composite. 4500 microstructural representations are synthetically generated and simulated using an efficient finite element framework to provide a sufficiently large data set for training and validating the deep learning framework. It is shown that the proposed deep learning approach can predict the composites’ post-failure full-field stress distribution and failure pattern, two of the most complex phenomena to simulate in computational solid mechanics , with an impressive accuracy of 90%.},

However, MD simulations come with a high computational cost and offer access to only a narrow window of time and length scales . We propose here to resort to the discrete element method (DEM) to mitigate the computational cost. Using DEM particles with contact and cohesive forces, we reproduce the key mechanisms observed with MD, while having particle diameters and system sizes an order of magnitude higher than with MD. The pairwise forces are tuned to obtain a solid with reasonably approximated elastic and fracture properties . The simulations of single asperity wear performed with MD are successfully reproduced with DEM using a range of particle sizes, validating the coarse-graining procedure. More complex simulations should allow the study of wear particles and the evolution of worn surfaces in an adhesive wear context, while reaching scales inaccessible to MD.},

  abstract     = {The paper introduces a reduced order model (ROM) for numerical integration of a dynamical system which depends on multiple parameters. The ROM is a projection of the dynamical system on a low dimensional space that is both problem-dependent and parameter-specific . The ROM exploits compressed tensor formats to find a low rank representation for a sample of high-fidelity snapshots of the system state. This tensorial representation provides ROM with an orthogonal basis in a universal space of all snapshots and encodes information about the state variation in parameter domain. During the online phase and for any incoming parameter, this information is used to find a reduced basis that spans a parameter-specific subspace in the universal space. The computational cost of the online phase then depends only on tensor compression ranks, but not on space or time resolution of high-fidelity computations. Moreover, certain compressed tensor formats enable to avoid the adverse effect of parameter space dimension on the online costs (known as the curse of dimension). The analysis of the approach includes an estimate for the representation power of the acquired ROM basis. We illustrate the performance and prediction properties of the ROM with several numerical experiments, where tensorial ROM’s complexity and accuracy is compared to those of conventional POD-ROM.},

Like many machine learning frameworks, GNNs are limited by excessive data generation costs and limited generalizability outside of a narrow training domain. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multi-Fidelity Graph Neural Network (MFGNN), a supervised machine learning framework that uses low-fidelity projections to inform high-fidelity modeling across arbitrary subdomains represented by subgraphs. We implement the MFGNN for two-dimensional elastostatic problems with finite element training data . The MFGNN is trained to produce accurate analysis given low-fidelity evaluations and emulate the convergence behavior of traditional finite element analysis (FEA). Through subdomain abstraction, we also extend the MFGNN as a general model for new boundary conditions and material domains outside of the training domain.},

To realize the combination of distributed memory parallel computing technology and parameterized level set topology optimization using unstructured meshes, several means are taken: (1) the shape functions in finite element analysis are employed to parameterize the level set function ; (2) the data structure called directed acyclic graph is adopted to represent the unstructured mesh; (3) the passive domain and boundary conditions are imposed directly on the geometry entities of the structures; (4) a multiple averaging filter is introduced to reduce the tiny structural members in the optimized results for the requirement of manufacturability. Several computing tests are presented in this paper, which verify the stability, efficiency, scalability, and the potential to discover new structure styles of the framework.},

As a result, the intrinsic mechanism governing the observed system cannot be accurately identified. In this study, we propose a robust physics discovery method via pattern recognition. In this method, the Euler Characteristic (EC), an efficient topological descriptor for complex data, is used as the feature vector for characterizing the spatiotemporal data collected from dynamical systems. Unsupervised manifold learning and supervised classification results show that EC can be used to efficiently distinguish systems with different while similar governing models. We also demonstrate that the machine learning approaches using EC can improve the results of sparse regression methods of physics discovery without hard-thresholding or hyperparameter tuning.},

Considering the increasing importance of additive manufacturing techniques using this type of “aging” materials, which typically undergo large deformations during the extrusion and deposition processes , a consistent finite strain model is required that takes evolving material properties and the proper characterization of the large deformation kinematics into account. In the proposed formulation, the problem of evolving stiffness is solved, in contrast to hypoelastic rate formulations typically used for this type of problems, by means of a multiplicative split of the deformation gradient into elastic and non-recoverable aging parts and the adoption of a hyperelastic potential. The existence of a hyperelastic potential is an advantage as it easily allows accounting for thermodynamic consistency. By introducing an internal aging parameter, a hyperelastic model based on principal logarithmic strains is adopted, to derive a novel and consistent evolution law for the aging part of the deformation gradient. The incremental and temporal discretization of the proposed constitutive model leads to a stress update scheme, which is reduced to a single multiplication of the principal logarithmic strains by a certain factor. As only minor adaptions are necessary, the proposed model is very attractive for implementations in already existing numerical models. In a benchmark study, the main aspects of the formulation are discussed, and the applicability of the proposed model is demonstrated by a computational analysis of a 3D printed concrete wall.},

The functions modeling the material’s frequency-dependent behavior are approximated in rational form and the resulting transfer function is used in a Krylov based moment matching method. The approximation is performed automatically using the adaptive Antoulas–Anderson algorithm. As robust and efficient automatic reduction algorithms are vital for an efficient design process of vibro-acoustic structures, we also show an adaptive procedure to automatically find a reasonably sized reduced model for a given system under a certain tolerance.

First we derive, following the discrete de Rham (DDR) and Virtual Element (VEM) paradigms, pressure-robust methods for the Stokes equations that support arbitrary orders and polyhedral meshes. Unlike other methods presented in the literature, pressure-robustness is achieved here without resorting to an H ( div ) H(div) -conforming construction on a submesh, but rather projecting the volumetric force onto the discrete H ( curl ) H(curl) space. The cancellation of the pressure error contribution stems from key commutation properties of the underlying DDR and VEM complexes . The pressure-robust error estimates in h k + 1 hk+1 (with h h denoting the meshsize and k ≥ 0 k≥0 the polynomial degree of the DDR or VEM complex) are proven theoretically and supported by a panel of three-dimensional numerical tests. The second major contribution of the paper is an in-depth study of the relations between the DDR and VEM approaches. We show, in particular, that a complex developed following one paradigm admits a reformulation in the other, and that couples of related DDR and VEM complexes satisfy commuting diagram properties with the degrees of freedom maps.},

  abstract     = {Gels are a mixture of cross-linked polymers and solvents, and have been widely studied in recent years for a diverse range of biomedical applications . Because gels can undergo large, reversible shape changes due to swelling, their complex physical response must be modeled by coupling large reversible deformation and mass transport . An ongoing challenge in this field is the ability to capture swelling or residual swelling-induced of such stimuli-responsive gels from initially flat two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) curved shapes. Specifically, because such shape changes typically involve large deformations , shape changes, and the exploitation of elastic instabilities, it remains an open question as to what external stimulus should be prescribed to generate a specific target shape. Therefore, we propose a novel formulation that tackles, using both nonlinear kinematics and material models, the coupling between elasticity and solvent transport using Kirchhoff–Love shell theory discretized using isogeometric analysis (IGA). Second, we propose an inverse methodology that chemomechanically couples large deformation and mass transport to identify the external stimuli prescribed to generate a specific target shape. Our numerical examples demonstrate the capability of identifying the required external stimuli, with the implication that the reconstructed target shapes are accurate, including cases where the shape changes due to swelling involve elastic instabilities or softening. Overall, our study can be used to effectively predict and control the large morphological changes of an important class of stimuli-responsive materials.},

  abstract     = {The convergence of the continuous Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) solution to the advection–diffusion equation is established in this paper. As a by-product of this result, the convergence of the SPH heat equation is also established. The most prevalent SPH approximations to diffusion operators are considered. The convergence is demonstrated using Fourier Analysis . First, the Fourier representation of the SPH approximation to the Hessian matrix is obtained. Next, the Fourier representations of the SPH diffusion operators are derived. Finally, the convergence of the SPH solution to the advection–diffusion equation (which includes, in particular, the case of the heat equation) is established in the Fourier space . The proof of convergence requires a certain condition over the Fourier transform of the SPH kernel to be satisfied. An example of kernel not satisfying this condition is numerically tested, leading to non-convergent solutions. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first proof of convergence of an SPH equation involving the Laplacian operator . These analytical results are illustrated with a variety of numerical verification cases. In particular, the influence of the choice of the kernel on the nature of convergence is thoroughly studied.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an uncertainty quantification method that combines compressed sensing and POD-Kriging that inherits the benefits of each key element. The compressed sensing is used to calculate the covariance matrix from a coarse grid. POD is used to significantly reduce the number of response surface constructions. The Gaussian process is used to compensate for the lack of predictive ability of the trend function in the highly non-linear region, thereby improving the ability to predict the local details of the flow field. Two CFD test cases are used to test the effectiveness and accuracy of the method proposed in this paper. The test cases examine the compressible flow around NLR7301 wing and heat removal by forced convection in a cooling system using fins. The results show that compared to full PCE, the compressed sensing combined with POD-Kriging method can significantly reduce the number of low and high-fidelity CFDs required to quantify uncertainty with the same computation accuracy, and computational cost is significantly reduced.},

However, challenges remain in generating smooth boundaries to improve the finite element analysis accuracy and achieve structural aesthetics. This work develops a body-fitted triangular/tetrahedral mesh generation algorithm to yield smooth boundaries in the BESO method. The optimization problem is regularized by adding a diffusion term in the objective function. We found that the first has the best regularization effect of Lorentzian, Tikhonov, Perona–Malik, Huber, and Tukey functions. The void elements are excluded from spatial optimization to save computation costs and computer memory. Numerical examples show that the proposed method converges quickly, only taking dozens of iterations to converge. Also, the smooth boundaries of the optimized structures in 2D/3D scenarios are naturally obtained from the proposed method, not from smoothing post-processing. Compared with the optimization toolbox in Abaqus, the example of the automotive control arm demonstrates smoother boundaries and lower average mean compliance.},

Compared with models from literature, our models correctly consider the spatial and temporal change of soil porosity. For numerical discretization , two overlapping layers of SPH particles are used to represent the two phases independently. The water phase is modeled as weakly-compressible Newtonian fluid , and the soil phase is modeled using an elastoplastic constitutive model. A corrected Shepard filter is proposed to achieve C 1 C1 particle consistency. A new method is proposed to realize the free-slip boundary condition. Some other issues in numerical implementation such as interface treatment, and simulation initialization are discussed. Through three validation cases, it is demonstrated that both models provide accurate simulations well corroborated by analytical results. Moreover, the intrinsic density-based formulation (IDF) gives more accurate numerical results and more stable simulations. Finally, a submerged landslide is simulated to demonstrate the capability of the proposed SPH model in solving the dynamic soil–water coupling problems.},

  abstract     = {Casting nonlocal problems in variational form and discretizing them with the finite element (FE) method facilitates the use of nonlocal vector calculus to prove well-posedness, convergence, and stability of such schemes. Employing an FE method also facilitates meshing of complicated domain geometries and coupling with FE methods for local problems. However, nonlocal weak problems involve the computation of a double-integral, which is computationally expensive and presents several challenges. In particular, the inner integral of the variational form associated with the stiffness matrix is defined over the intersections of FE mesh elements with a ball of radius δ δ , where δ δ is the range of nonlocal interaction. Identifying and parameterizing these intersections is a nontrivial computational geometry problem. In this work, we propose a quadrature technique where the inner integration is performed using quadrature points distributed over the full ball, without regard for how it intersects elements, and weights are computed based on the generalized moving least squares method. Thus, as opposed to all previously employed methods, our technique does not require element-by-element integration and fully circumvents the computation of element–ball intersections. This paper considers one- and two-dimensional implementations of piecewise linear continuous FE approximations, focusing on the case where the element size h h and the nonlocal radius δ δ are proportional, as is typical of practical computations. When boundary conditions are treated carefully and the outer integral of the variational form is computed accurately, the proposed method is asymptotically compatible in the limit of h ∼ δ → 0 h∼δ→0 , featuring at least first-order convergence in L 2 L2 for all dimensions, using both uniform and nonuniform grids. Moreover, in the case of uniform grids, the proposed method passes a patch test and, according to numerical evidence, exhibits an optimal, second-order convergence rate. Our numerical tests also indicate that, even for nonuniform grids, second-order convergence can be observed over a substantial pre-asymptotic regime.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in 3D printable micro-architected materials offer unprecedented possibilities for the development of highly tailored orthopaedic implants. These devices, which are typically made from fully solid materials, significantly alter load transmission to the surrounding bone tissue, potentially leading to interface instability and bone resorption . In this work, we present computational methods to synthesize three dimensional (3D), patient-specific, implants with heterogeneous micro-architecture. Our method simultaneously minimizes the risks of load-induced interface fracture and peri-prosthetic bone remodelling , while taking into account functional and manufacturing constraints. We first develop a novel parametric micro-architecture with desirable functional attributes and a wide range of effective mechanical properties, including both positive and negative Poisson’s ratios. We then present formulations which optimize the spatial configuration of micro-architecture parameters in order to simultaneously minimize the risk of load-induced interface fracture and post-operative bone remodelling. To that end, a novel bone remodelling objective is devised, taking into account both bone apposition and resorption, predicted via a model based on strain–energy density. The interface fracture objective is defined as the maximum value of the multi-axial Hoffman failure criterion along the interface. The procedure is applied to the design of 3D titanium hip implants with prescribed conventional geometries and compared, in silico, to both a conventional solid implant and a homogeneous low-stiffness lattice design. The optimized implant results in a performance improvement of 64.0% in terms of bone remodelling, and 13.2% in terms of interface fracture risk, compared to a conventional solid implant design.},

The FSI problems with multi-material fluid flow and extreme structure deformation accompanied with fractures and crack growth are less explored areas. In these problems, the interface reconstruction, multi-material advection , interface interaction on the complicated fluid structure interface and potential structure fragmentation must be all taken into account. This paper aims to present an effective monolithic approach of immersed multi-material arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian material point method (IALEMPM) by immersing the MPM particles in the MMALE grid. In this novel method, the interfaces between the fluid and structure are tracked implicitly by the MPM particles and the interface interactions are implicitly implemented by assembling the nodal force and the nodal momentum from both the solid particles and fluid cells. The consistence time integration scheme, rezoning phase and remapping phase are also established to guarantee the consistence requirements during the whole simulation. Numerical examples , including a shock-obstacle interaction, a blast-plate interaction and a structure fragmentation are studied by using the IALEMPM, and all the numerical results show good agreement with the benchmark and the experiment data, which indicates that the IALEMPM is effective for solving these complicated FSI problems.},

With the aim of achieving reliable prediction of temperature-driven failures in thin-walled structures, this research is concerned with the development of a thermodynamically consistent framework for the coupled thermo-mechanical phase-field model for thin-walled structures using fully-integrated solid shell finite elements . This enables the use of three-dimensional constitutive thermo-mechanical models for the materials. The proposed thermo-mechanical phase-field models are equipped with the Enhanced Assumed Strain (EAS) in order to alleviate Poisson and volumetric locking pathologies. This technique is further combined with the Assumed Natural Strain (ANS) method leading to a locking-free thermo-mechanical solid shell phase-field element. Attention is also paid to the evaluation of the corresponding thermodynamic consistency and the variational formalism leading to the non-linear coupled equations. Moreover, the same degradation function is used for both displacement field and thermal field. The coupled equations are numerically solved with ad hoc efficient solution schemes for non-linear problems. Several numerical examples (straight and curved shells) are provided to assess the reliability of the proposed modelling framework. Representative examples assess stable and unstable crack propagation along with their thermo-mechanical interactions.},

To cope with large scale constraints, the maximal von Mises stress is measured by the global p -norm stress aggregation approach. The density filter BESO method is developed while the sensitivity expressions of proposed indices with respect to design variables are derived. Influences of varying damage threshold and p -norm parameter on final designs are investigated through 2D and 3D numerical tests. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further validated in comparison with the stiffness maximization design. It is revealed that the smaller value of the damage threshold results in higher strength while the damage in the majority of solid material increases. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve stress minimization design by simultaneously considering nonlinear continuum damage.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel variational phase-field model for different fracture processes in fully saturated porous media . As a key feature, the model employs a micromechanics-based theory for the description of brittle-tensile and compressive–ductile fracture. As such, the field variables are linked to physical mechanisms at the microcrack level, with damage emerging as the consequence of microcrack growth. Similarly, plasticity emerges as a consequence of the frictional sliding of closed microcracks. In this way, the evolution of opening microcracks in tension leads to (mode I) brittle fracture , while the evolution of closed microcracks in compression/shear leads to (mode II) ductile fracture . These failure mechanisms are coupled to fluid flow, resulting in a Darcy–Biot–type hydromechanical model. Therein, in the tensile regime, plasticity naturally vanishes, while damage is driven by poroelastic energy, accounting for the pressure in fluid-filled opening microcracks. On the other hand, in the compressive/shear regime, the plastic driving force naturally follows as a Terzaghi-type effective stress in terms of the local stress field acting on the microcrack surfaces, while damage is solely driven by the frictionally blocked free energy. As another important feature, the model includes a non-associative frictional plasticity law. Nevertheless, a thermodynamically consistent variational framework is employed, for which different energetic principles are discussed. Finally, the numerical simulations show that the model captures relevant hydromechanical coupling effects in benchmark problems, including mechanically induced shear fracture and hydraulically induced tensile fracture.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a phase field cohesive zone model (PFCZM) combined with the cell-based smoothed finite element method (CSFEM) is presented to investigate the quasi-brittle fracture behaviour of concrete at mesoscale . An automatic quadtree decomposition technique is employed to discretise the CT image-based meso-structures including aggregates, mortar and pores, with local mesh adaptively refined at material boundaries. The resultant quadtree elements with hanging nodes are naturally treated as CSFEM polygons. In the proposed CSFEM-PFCZM, the stiffness matrices and residual vectors for displacement and damage fields are formulated by the Wachspress shape function and smoothed strain matrices . The crack driving forces are evaluated as history variables at the integration points of CSFEM subcells. Four nonlinear fracture benchmarks are presented to validate the proposed method regarding the variability of mesoscale fracture processes, crack topology and load–displacement curves. It is found that the CSFEM-PFCZM combined with the quadtree decomposition significantly improves the computational efficiency over the traditional FEM counterparts, and shows great potential for multiscale fracture evaluation of quasi-brittle composite materials. This is due to the fast mesh generation and flexible simulation of complicated nonlinear fracture using the CSFEM-PFCZM without the need for remeshing or mesh enrichments.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a fully adaptive method to estimate the probability density function (PDF) of the responses for stochastic structures under static and dynamic loads. The PDF is described by a recently published direct probability integral method (DPIM). In DPIM, the key smoothing parameter σ σ and the number of samples N s Ns , which have significant impacts on the determination of PDF and the efficiency of stochastic response calculation, are still difficult to determine in a completely adaptive manner. To this end, we derive a weighted kernel density estimation (weighted-KDE) method to adaptively obtain the σ σ by minimizing the mean integrated squared error between the estimated PDF and the real PDF. In addition, a new iterative sampling strategy is proposed to adaptively determine the N s Ns , in which a candidate sample pool is generated firstly, then the samples are gradually selected from the pool. This strategy ensures that the used samples in each iteration can fill the probability space in a ‘highly uniform’ manner. Based on the standard deviation calculated by the estimated PDF, a stopping criterion is presented to stop the iterative process. Moreover, the detailed steps of the proposed fully adaptive method is given by combining the weighted-KDE method and the sampling strategy. Four engineering examples validate the adaptive ability, efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.},

Significant advances have been achieved in the context of high-order of convergence methods, but many questions remain unsolved in the quest of practical, accurate, and efficient approaches. In particular, the discretisation of problems with arbitrary curved boundaries has been the subject of intensive research, where the conventional practice consists in employing curved meshes to avoid accuracy deterioration. The present work proposes a novel approach, the reconstruction for off-site data method, which employs polygonal meshes to approximate arbitrary smooth curved boundaries with linear piecewise elements. The Navier–Stokes equations are discretised with a staggered finite volume method , and the numerical fluxes are computed on the polygonal mesh elements. Boundary conditions are taken into account via polynomial reconstructions with specific linear constraints defined for a set of points on the physical boundary. The very-high order of convergence is preserved without relying on the full curve parametrisation , avoiding the limitations of curved mesh approaches, such as sophisticated mesh generation algorithms, cumbersome quadrature rules, and complex non-linear transformations. A comprehensive verification benchmark is provided, with numerical test cases for several fluid flow problems , to demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach to achieve very high-orders of convergence.},

  abstract     = {Variable-density cellular structures can overcome connectivity and manufacturability issues of topologically optimized structures, particularly those represented as discrete density maps. However, the optimization of such cellular structures is challenging due to the multiscale design problem. Past work addressing this problem generally either only optimizes the volume fraction of single-type unit cells but ignoring the effects of unit cell geometry on properties, or considers the geometry–property relation but builds this relation via heuristics. In contrast, we propose a simple yet more principled way to accurately model the property to geometry mapping using a conditional deep generative model, named Inverse Homogenization Generative Adversarial Network (IH-GAN) . It learns the conditional distribution of unit cell geometries given properties and can realize the one-to-many mapping from properties to geometries. We further reduce the complexity of IH-GAN by using the implicit function parameterization to represent unit cell geometries. Results show that our method can 1) generate various unit cells that satisfy given material properties with high accuracy ( R 2 R2 -scores between target properties and properties of generated unit cells &gt; 98 % &amp;gt;98% ) and 2) improve the optimized structural performance over the conventional variable-density single-type structure. In the minimum compliance example, our IH-GAN generated structure achieves a 79.7% reduction in concentrated stress and an extra 3.03% reduction in displacement. In the target deformation examples, our IH-GAN generated structure reduces the target matching error by 86.4% and 79.6% for two test cases, respectively. We also demonstrated that the connectivity issue for multi-type unit cells can be solved by transition layer blending.},

Furthermore, an adaptive ground structure approach driven by movable nodes is also developed to regularize the optimization process. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method can not only achieve clear material distribution and component placement, but also has the capability of easily controlling the feature sizes of the components, which is very important for preventing the components from local failure/buckling. In addition, benefiting from the explicit geometry description of the structural components, the optimized designs can be seamlessly imported into CAD systems for subsequent treatment without resorting to any post-processing process. This is very helpful for practical engineering applications . Some representative numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {The Monte Carlo method is widely used for the estimation of uncertainties in mechanical engineering design. However, while flexible, this method remains impractical in terms of computational time and scalability. To bypass these limitations, other more efficient approaches such as the Galerkin stochastic finite element method (GSFEM) or the collocation method have been proposed. GSFEM provides accurate output statistics, has the advantage of being sampling independent and can be modular in terms of operations, albeit code intrusive. While linear elasticity has been extensively covered in the literature, the application of GSFEM to nonlinear mechanical behaviour remains relatively unexplored, in part due to the difficulty to capture nonlinear effects with the traditional GSFEM interpolants. To this end, we propose a seamless and efficient modular framework avoiding the need to know a priori the material law. In particular, the method makes use of a wavelet based formulation able to capture simultaneously continuous and discontinuous behaviours, and stochastic operators are proposed to straightforwardly adapt any material model. Finally, the flexibility of this approach is illustrated with two problems: (i) a 3D hyperelastic example with nonlinear behaviour arising from buckling uncertainty, and (ii) the evaluation of the displacement of a point within a structure based on how much of the external accessible structural deformation is known.},

Rooted in the framework of the Craig–Bampton component mode synthesis methodology, these techniques decompose the unit cell into interior and boundary degrees-of-freedom that are nominally described, respectively, by sets of normal modes and constraint modes. In this paper, we generalize the BMS approach by state-space transformation to extend its applicability to generally damped periodic materials that violate the Caughey–O’Kelly condition for classical damping. In non-classically damped periodic models, the fixed-interface eigenvalue problem may, in general, produce a mixture of underdamped and overdamped modes. We examine two mode-selection schemes for the reduced-order model and demonstrate the underlying accuracy–efficiency trade-offs when qualitatively distinct mixtures of underdamped and overdamped modes are incorporated. The proposed approach provides a highly effective computational tool for analysis of large models of phononic crystals and acoustic/elastic metamaterials with complex damping properties .},

The BMMR aims to obtain background equivalent particle distributions in the two sides of a border between sub-domains with a 2:1 resolution ratio so that a single resolution framework is adopted to near-border particles calculations. The novelty of the BMMR is that it obtains the background grid from the mapping of the actual particle distribution in the border and, as a result, the location of the particles in the background grid exactly matches the location of the actual particles. In this way, such technique aims to reduce the error from the interpolation of the physical quantities in the background grid and to avoid sudden changes in the particle distribution that may lead to unstable local pressure calculation. In the coarse side of the border, the refinement is made by a triangulation and by placing fictitious particles in the midpoints of the triangles. In the fine side of the border, the derefinement is made by defining a set of fine particles that result in a particle distribution that best resembles a coarse one. The accuracy and computational performance of the BMMR implemented in a moving particle semi-implicit (MPS) simulation system are verified by using benchmark test cases of 2D free surface flows.},

Then we discretize the resulting semi-discrete system in time by using a symplectic integrator. This ensures the conservation properties of the fully discrete system of equations. For the Symplectic Hamiltonian HDG method, we present numerical experiments which confirm its optimal orders of convergence for all variables and its conservation properties for the total linear and angular momenta, as well as the total energy.

In a first part, we present a mathematical analysis of a general methodology that allows for estimating a posterior probability model for a stochastic boundary value problem from a prior probability model of a control parameter. The given targets are statistical moments of the QoI for which the underlying realizations are not available. Under these conditions, the Kullback–Leibler minimum principle is used for estimating the posterior probability measure. The constraints are represented by an implicit nonlinear mapping for which a statistical surrogate model is introduced. The MCMC generator and the necessary numerical elements are given to facilitate the implementation of the methodology. In a second part, an application is presented to illustrate the proposed theory and is also, as such, a contribution to the three-dimensional stochastic homogenization of heterogeneous linear elastic media in the case of a non-separation of the microscale and macroscale. Consequently, the macroscale is another mesoscale at larger scale with random effective/apparent elastic properties. For the construction of the posterior probability measure by using the probabilistic learning inference, in addition to the constraints defined by given statistical moments of the random effective/apparent elasticity tensor, the second-order moment of the random normalized residue of the stochastic partial differential equation has been added as a constraint. This constraint guarantees that the algorithm seeks to bring the statistical moments closer to their targets while preserving a small residue.},

Previous researches on finite element methods for sliding beams have not taken into account the equation of configurational momentum and boundary condition of equilibrium of configuration forces at the sliding interfaces. In this paper, dual quaternions are used to represent the exact kinematics of rigid-section motion of the beam. Hamilton’s principle of variation of action is applied to derive the equations of mechanical and configurational momentum, and also boundary conditions of equilibrium of mechanical and configurational forces. The material and mesh motions of the cross-sections, material and mesh variations of motions, and also variation of the non-material domain due to sliding motion are correctly considered to get the complete set of governing equations and boundary conditions. In the finite element implementation, proper integration by parts is employed to weakly enforce natural boundary conditions of mechanical and configurational forces, and also to avoid terms of higher order spatial derivatives in the inertial forces . The configurational variables of internal nodes are associated with the arclength coordinates at the beam’s tips to avoid redundancy of the configurational momentum equation. These proposed strategies lead to robust ALE elements for geometrically exact beams. Numerical examples of increasing complexities are presented to validate correctness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Metamaterials are engineered microstructures or composites which exhibit novel properties that are not found in nature. Structural optimization methods for shape and topology optimization have been developed in designing metamaterials. The computational cost of the traditional topology optimization methods is high due to the high-dimensional design space. Shape optimization and topology optimization are also performed separately. To improve the search efficiency, a new structural optimization method based on periodic surface modeling is proposed to simultaneously optimize the shape and topology of metamaterials. A wide variety of topology can be represented with a small number of parameters in the periodic surface models. Therefore, the search space is significantly reduced. A mixed-integer Bayesian optimization method is also developed with a new Gaussian process kernel, which incorporates both discrete and continuous design parameters in the periodic surface models. Both the mixed-integer Bayesian optimization method and conventional population-based genetic algorithms are used to solve the structural optimization problem . The design of mechanical metamaterials with high strength–weight ratio and negative Poisson’s ratio is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Contact is crucial in many lumped-mass explicit analyses, such as for high-rate impact, and enforcement methods for higher-order elements are generally less mature than for first-order ones. In this paper, basic lumped-mass explicit capabilities are pursued for three-dimensional contact/impact that account for arbitrary-order elemental curvature but with reasonable computational costs. Deformable-to-rigid and deformable-to-deformable surface-to-surface contact are considered with both triangular and/or quadrilateral faces for large deformation/sliding. Double-pass node-to-face contact searching and enforcement approaches are presented for general three-dimensional C 0 higher-order Lagrange type elements in nonlinear solid dynamics using typical lumped-mass central difference time integration. This study uses classical kinematically compliant and penalty methods as well as presents modified versions better suited for higher-order Lagrange type elements. It also presents a general outer-loop iterative framework for increased accuracy and examines the simplifying practice of partitioning (subdivision) of higher-order element faces into first-order ones. Assessments are made with benchmark and practical high-rate impact applications involving elastic, hyperelastic, and elastic–plastic material models. Although subdivision into bilinear elements can sometimes be effective, it is demonstrated that they can also fail and that more precise treatment of even only modest amounts of curvature can be more reliable and improve performance.},

The smoothed gradient field of each element is constructed by utilizing the gradient fields of the adjacent elements within the corresponding homogeneous region. In addition, we propose a multiscale variant of the proposed GSM, which results in an accurate numerical solution even if a computational grid coarser than the scale of the heterogeneity is utilized. While existing GSMs have stiffness matrices with larger bandwidth than the standard finite element method (FEM) in general, the proposed multiscale GSM has the same bandwidth as the plain multiscale FEM. Hence, its online computational cost is essentially the same as that of the plain one. Improved performance of the proposed methods is demonstrated through various numerical examples .},

By precisely computing the overlaps between the meshes before and after the rezoning step in the arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) framework, our method does not limit the range of mesh movements and has wider applications. This also makes our remapping process simpler to attain high-order accuracy. We use the third order multi-resolution WENO reconstruction procedure in this paper as an example, in which we reconstruct three polynomials of different orders via nested central spatial stencils and distribute nonlinear weights based on the smoothness of the polynomials, ensuring optimal accuracy in the smooth region while avoiding numerical oscillations in the non-smooth region. The multi-resolution WENO procedure involves fewer high-order reconstruction polynomials and can use arbitrary positive linear weights, making it more effective for our 3D remapping problem. We incorporate an efficient local limiting to preserve positivity for the positive physical variables involved in the ALE framework without sacrificing the original high-order accuracy and conservation. A set of numerical tests are provided to verify properties of our remapping algorithm, such as high-order accuracy, conservation, essentially non-oscillatory performance, positivity-preserving and efficiency.},

It leads for instance to complex failure behaviours and crack paths in polycrystalline or architected materials. This paper focuses on modelling anisotropy of brittle fracture by means of a variational phase-field approach. More precisely, we study different models including several phase (or damage) variables corresponding to different damage mechanisms. First, we recall a multi-mechanism gradient damage model based on an anisotropic non-local fracture energy . We then consider a model accounting for an anisotropic degradation of the elasticity stiffness tensor . Both types of anisotropies are compared in terms of their influence on analytical homogeneous solutions under uniaxial and biaxial tensile loadings. Weak and strong anisotropies are captured via the chosen multi-mechanism damage framework. The models are implemented numerically by using a finite element discretization . In order to improve numerical performance, we implement an algorithm based on a hybrid direct–iterative resolution of the displacement sub-problem. Accuracy of model prediction is assessed by comparing numerical results to theoretical solutions under uniaxial loading. Benchmark numerical tests on notched and perforated plates highlight the role of material parameters on the fracture anisotropy. Furthermore, both models are able to retrieve zig-zag crack patterns observed in prior numerical and experimental studies. Finally, we discuss the predictions of a model combining both types of anisotropies.},

However, gaps remain in the understanding of even the simplest applications, including linear elasticity — the area where finite elements were first developed as a serious technique for the approximation of partial differential equations by engineers interested in the stress analysis of structures. For nearly incompressible materials, such as rubber, the standard, conforming finite element method sometimes exhibits suboptimal convergence rates for the energy and/or stresses. This type of behavior, termed “locking” or “non-robustness”, is still not completely understood despite receiving a great deal of investigation. This paper reviews the concept of locking in conforming finite element approximations to planar linear elasticity and seeks to quantify the effects of locking for the h h - and p p -version finite element method with a particular emphasis on quantifying the effect of mesh topology and geometry. As a by-product, we show that the inf–sup constant, which is responsible for locking, is independent of the mesh size h h and polynomial degree p p when p ≥ 4 p≥4 . Numerical examples are provided throughout to illustrate the theoretical results.},

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first class of (arbitrarily) high-order accurate schemes for the PNP equations that simultaneously achieve all these three properties. This is accomplished via (1) using finite elements to directly approximate the so-called entropy variable ≔ u i ≔ U ′ ( c i ) = log ( c i ) ui≔U′(ci)=log(ci) instead of the density variable c i ci , where U ( c i ) = ( log ( c i ) − 1 ) c i U(ci)=(log(ci)−1)ci is the corresponding entropy, and (2) using a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization in time. The entropy variable formulation, which was originally developed by Metti et al. (2016) under the name of a log-density formulation , guarantees both positivity of densities c i = exp ( u i ) &gt; 0 ci=exp(ui)&amp;gt;0 and a continuous-in-time energy stability result. The DG in time discretization further ensures an unconditional energy stability in the fully discrete level for any approximation order, where the lowest order case is exactly the backward Euler discretization and in this case we recover the method of Metti et al.

The results match well with analytical solutions and experimental observations, demonstrating this model’s capability to efficiently solve complex fluid–solid–particle interactions with large deformations.

The GNN framework is trained on the dataset generated by XFEM-based fracture simulator. Our framework achieves high prediction accuracy on the test set (compared to an XFEM-based fracture simulator) by engineering a sequence of GNN-based predictions. The first prediction stage determines Mode-I and Mode-II stress intensity factors (which can be used to compute the stress evolution by LEFM), the second prediction stage determines which microcracks will propagate, and the final stage actually propagates crack-tip positions for the selected microcracks to the next time instant. The trained GNN framework is capable of simulating crack propagation , coalescence and corresponding stress distribution for a wide range of initial microcrack configurations (from 5 to 19 microcracks) without any additional modification. Lastly, the framework’s simulation time shows speed-ups 6x–25x faster compared to an XFEM-based simulator. These characteristics, make our GNN framework an attractive approach for simulating microcrack propagation and stress evolution in brittle materials with multiple initial microcracks.},

A set of background particles is used to specify either geometry-based spatial resolution, where the resolution is a function of distance to a solid body , or solution-based adaptive resolution, where the resolution is a function of the computed solution. This allows us to simulate problems using particles having length variations of the order of 1:250 with much fewer particles than currently reported with other techniques. The method is designed to automatically adapt when any solid bodies move. The algorithms employed are fully parallel. We consider a suite of benchmark problems to demonstrate the accuracy of the approach.

The advantages of FEqa include utilizing a single qubit per degree of freedom, enforcing Dirichlet boundary conditions a priori , reaching arbitrary solution precision, and eliminating the possibility of the annealer generating invalid results. FEqa is scalable on the classical portion of the algorithm due to its Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) nature and does not rely on ground state solutions from the annealer. The exponentially large number of collocation points used in quantum annealing are investigated for their cosine measures, and new iterative techniques are developed to exploit their properties. The quantum annealer has clear advantages in computational time over simulated annealing, for the example problems presented in this paper solved on the D-Wave machine.

  abstract     = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and moving particle semi-implicit (MPS) methods are representative meshfree particle methods used to compute Lagrangian mechanics . The approximations of differential operators in the SPH and MPS methods have several similarities, but the theoretical discussion of the difference between them is limited. This study mathematically describes the difference via a comprehensive derivation of the first- and second-order derivative operators for each method. The comprehensive derivation indicates that the SPH and MPS operators are consistent with the pressure Poisson equation and moving least-squares approximation, respectively. The variation in consistency can explain the difference in the schemes of the incompressible flow problem. Additionally, the comprehensive derivation of the MPS operators can result in novel second-order and anisotropic operators. This study strengthens the theoretical understanding of the SPH and MPS methods and facilitates the selection of the appropriate method by users. Furthermore, the proposed MPS operators contribute to developing methods with adaptive or multiscale particle distributions.},

The primary focus of the present study is the analysis of the failure mechanisms that may occur in thin layer-flexible substrate systems: crack propagation through the layers, delamination at interfaces, and mixed-mode mechanisms. The phase-field (PF) approach, formulated for hyperelastic materials, is herein exploited through a series of tests to prove its capabilities in simulating the mechanical response and the crack propagation mechanisms of these composite structures. While the PF approach already captures the competition between crack propagation and delamination at the interface for bilayer composites having properties mismatch, as in the case of metallic or ceramic layers on rubber-like substrates, the framework has been further enriched with a Cohesive Zone Model (CZM) approach to model imperfect interfaces . The benefit of the coupled method can be noticed, especially for mixed-mode failure patterns, where this combination of failure mechanisms is successfully captured.},

  abstract     = {It is well-known that the convergence rate of non-overlapping domain decomposition methods (DDMs) applied to the parallel finite-element solution of large-scale time-harmonic wave problems strongly depends on the transmission condition enforced at the interfaces between the subdomains . Transmission operators based on perfectly matched layers (PMLs) have proved to be well-suited for configurations with layered domain partitions. They are shown to be a good compromise between basic impedance conditions, which can lead to slow convergence, and computational expensive conditions based on the exact Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map related to the complementary of the subdomain. Unfortunately, the extension of the PML-based DDM for more general partitions with cross-points (where more than two subdomains meet) is rather tricky and requires some care. In this work, we present a non-overlapping substructured DDM with PML transmission conditions for checkerboard (Cartesian) decompositions that takes cross-points into account. In such decompositions, each subdomain is surrounded by PMLs associated to edges and corners. The continuity of Dirichlet traces at the interfaces between a subdomain and PMLs is enforced with Lagrange multipliers . This coupling strategy offers the benefit of naturally computing Neumann traces, which allows to use the PMLs as discrete operators approximating the exact Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps. Two possible Lagrange multiplier finite element spaces are presented, and the behavior of the corresponding DDM is analyzed on several numerical examples .},

The exact geometry of the beam structure is expressed by non-uniform rational B-splines. According to Timoshenko beam theory, the isogeometric beam stiffness matrix is calculated, and static analysis is carried out. Using Taylor’s formulation and interval extension of the function, the manufacturing tolerance interval optimization model of the beam structure is transformed into a deterministic optimization model. The section size and tolerance of the beam structure are taken as design variables, the mass is taken as the objective function, and the torsional stiffness and bending stiffness are taken as constraint functions. The calculation formulation of second-order sensitivity is deduced, and the optimized results of the beam structure are obtained by using the method of moving asymptotes. The effectiveness of the optimization strategy of this method is proven by three numerical examples . This paper provides isogeometric analysis method to realize the section interval optimization of beam structures without meshing , which guides the lightweight design of beam structures.},

  abstract     = {A new microstructure reconstruction algorithm, fully integrated with a non-iterative meshing algorithm named CISAMR, is introduced for synthesizing finite element (FE) models of chopped fiber composite (CFC) microstructures. This automated computational framework enables generating densely-packed CFC microstructures with desired statistical descriptors such as the volume fraction, diameter distribution, and spatial arrangement of fibers. The reconstruction process involves two main phases, starting with a virtual packing algorithm relying on Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) representation of fiber centerlines to efficiently detect/eliminate overlapping fibers. An explicit dynamic FE compression simulation is then pursued to increase the fiber volume fraction by modeling them as rigid shells and taking into account contact forces between fibers during the simulation. The shape/location of fibers excessively close to domain boundaries or intersecting them at sharp angles are then slightly modified in the resulting microstructure to ensure the construction of a high-quality conforming mesh using parallel CISAMR. Several example problems are provided to show the ability of this modeling framework for synthesizing and simulating the linear elastic response of polymer matrix CFCs with embedded glass fibers. We also demonstrate the application of high-fidelity FE models generated using CISAMR for simulating the nonlinear failure response of such composites.},

A verification exercise is first carried out to rigorously establish the convergence rate of the method. Then, the accuracy and robustness are demonstrated for a flow around a pitching ellipse at different regimes. A comparison with a grid deformation technique and a sensitivity study with respect to the location of the sliding interface are also investigated. Finally, the flow around a vertical-axis wind turbine configuration is simulated to show the potentiality of the proposed approach to deal with more complex geometries.},

In this work, a shape optimization scheme for fracture-resistant structures is developed using the energy release rate approximation . In the gradient-based optimization scheme, the domain and its boundary are defined implicitly using level-set functions. The level-set functions of arbitrary geometries are constructed using Boolean operations from the level-set functions of simple primitives.

Under the philosophy of the GIFT framework, industry-standard multi-patch Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) definition of the geometry is considered, and the adaptive discretization is achieved with the help of PHT-splines. The approach tracks the variation of density of an element, refining the sub-domains such that the boundary between the material and the non-material domain has a proper resolution. The proposed approach has threefold merits: (i) Complex multi-patch NURBS geometries could be constructed in any professional computer-aided design package and exported for analysis; (ii) The topology optimization problem could initially be solved on a relatively coarse mesh and refined progressively for substantial computational gains; (iii) Taking benefit of the GIFT framework, we can exactly represent conic sections in our computational model , thus altogether avoiding any geometric error during refinement. The accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed framework are studied by comparing the adaptive solution to the non-adaptive solution. The proposed approach achieves a 30%–60% reduction in degree’s-of-freedom and an 80%–90% reduction in CPU time compared to the non-adaptive case.},

We first review the two expressions to show that the volumetric shape derivative places weaker regularity requirements, which, unlike the requirements for boundary-based shape derivatives, are satisfied in most finite element approximations. We then analyze the error in the degree- k k polynomial finite element approximations of the two expressions; we show that, for sufficiently regular problems, the boundary-based and volumetric shape derivatives provide k k th and 2 k 2k -th order accurate approximations, respectively, of the true shape derivative.

Although there has been considerable research on the treatment of near-incompressibility in the traditional material point method, the issue has not been studied in depth for higher order material point methods. Using the B ¯ B¯ and F ¯ F¯ methods as our point of departure we develop an appropriate projection technique for material point methods that use higher order shape functions for the background discretization . The approach is based on the projection of the dilatational part of the appropriate strain rate measure onto a lower dimensional approximation space, according to the traditional B ¯ B¯ and F ¯ F¯ techniques, but tailored to the material point method.

The contact damping and contact friction are also implemented. Based on Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), the proposed contact algorithm can be parallelized with much less thread unbalance and register usage than the existing energy-conserving contact algorithms due to the simplified computational process. Several numerical tests are performed to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed contact algorithm. The contact friction model is validated against theoretical solutions with a block sliding test, and the results show that the proposed contact algorithm outperforms the original contact algorithm in both normal and friction force evaluation. For both quasi-static and dynamic scenarios, the simulated results are in good agreement with those generated by the original contact algorithm, as well as the experimental measurements. The computational efficiency tests show that the computation time is linearly proportional to the number of potential contact pairs, and the speedup ratio of the parallelized version of proposed contact algorithm relative to the serial version of original contact algorithm can reach up to 565.1 (Nvidia Quadro GP100), which indicates the proposed contact algorithm is capable to be employed in the simulation of large-scale problems. Besides, the proposed contact algorithm can be applied to the cases where the polyhedrons with more than four vertexes are employed.},

  abstract     = {We consider an input-to-response (ItR) system characterized by (1) parameterized input with a known probability distribution and (2) stochastic ItR function with heteroscedastic randomness. Our purpose is to efficiently quantify the extreme response probability when the ItR function is expensive to evaluate. The problem setup arises often in physics and engineering problems, with randomness in ItR coming from either intrinsic uncertainties (say, as a solution to a stochastic equation) or additional (critical) uncertainties that are not incorporated in a low-dimensional input parameter space (as a result of dimension reduction applied to the original high-dimensional input space). To reduce the required sampling numbers, we develop a sequential Bayesian experimental design method leveraging the variational heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression (VHGPR) to account for the stochastic ItR, along with a new criterion to select the next-best samples sequentially. The validity of our new method is first tested in two synthetic problems with the stochastic ItR functions defined artificially. Finally, we demonstrate the application of our method to an engineering problem of estimating the extreme ship motion probability in irregular waves, where the uncertainty in ItR naturally originates from standard wave group parameterization, which reduces the original high-dimensional wave field into a two-dimensional parameter space.},

  abstract     = {Topology optimization of modular structures and mechanisms enables balancing the performance of automatically-generated individualized designs, as required by Industry 4.0 , with enhanced sustainability by means of component reuse. For optimal modular design, two key questions must be answered: (i) what should the topology of individual modules be like and (ii) how should modules be arranged at the product scale? We address these challenges by proposing a bi-level sequential strategy that combines free material design, clustering techniques , and topology optimization. First, using free material optimization enhanced with checkerboard suppression, we determine the distribution of elasticity tensors at the product scale. To extract the sought-after modular arrangement, we partition the obtained elasticity tensors with a novel deterministic clustering algorithm and interpret its outputs within Wang tiling formalism. Finally, we design interiors of individual modules by solving a single-scale topology optimization problem with the design space reduced by modular mapping, conveniently starting from an initial guess provided by free material optimization. We illustrate these developments with three benchmarks first, covering compliance minimization of modular structures, and, for the first time, the design of non-periodic compliant modular mechanisms. Furthermore, we design a set of modules reusable in an inverter and in gripper mechanisms, which ultimately pave the way towards the rational design of modular architectured (meta)materials.},

Three optimization criteria , evaluated with this model, are proposed to minimize defects caused by additive manufacturing : vertical displacements, residual stresses and deflection of the part after baseplate separation. Combining these criteria with a constraint on the compliance for the final use of the part leads to optimization problems which deliver optimized manufacturable shapes with only a slight loss on the final use performance. The numerical results are assessed by manufacturing some optimized and reference geometries . These experimental results are also used to calibrate the inherent strain model by an inverse analysis. The same type of optimization is applied to supports in the case of a fixed non-optimizable part.

To achieve fourth-order accuracy in space, two main ingredients are proposed in the SL FV formulation. Firstly, we introduce a so-called cubic-curved quadrilateral upstream cell and applying an efficient clipping method to evaluate integrals on upstream cells. Secondly, we construct a new WENO reconstruction operator, which recovers a P 3 P3 polynomial from neighboring cell averages. Mass conservation is accomplished with the mass conservative nature of the reconstruction operator and the SL formulation . A positivity-preserving limiter is applied to maintain the positivity of the numerical solution wherever appropriate. For nonlinear kinetic models, the SL scheme is coupled with a fourth-order Runge–Kutta exponential integrator for high-order temporal accuracy. Extensive benchmarks are tested to verify the designed properties.},

High-order accuracy is achieved via high-order quadrature rules for implicitly-defined domains and boundaries, whilst a cell-merging strategy addresses the presence of small cut cells. The framework is used to discretize the governing equations of elastodynamics, written using a first-order hyperbolic momentum-strain formulation, and an exact Riemann solver is employed to compute the numerical flux at the interface between dissimilar materials with general anisotropic properties. The space-discretized equations are then advanced in time using explicit high-order Runge–Kutta algorithms. Several two- and three-dimensional numerical tests including dynamic adaptive mesh refinement are presented to demonstrate the high-order accuracy and the capability of the method in the elastodynamic analysis of single- and bi-phases solids containing complex geometries .},

  abstract     = {De-homogenization is becoming an effective method to significantly expedite the design of high-resolution multiscale structures, but existing methods have thus far been confined to simple static compliance minimization problems . There are two critical issues in accommodating general design cases: enabling the design of unit-cell orientation and using free-form microstructures. In this paper, we propose a generalized de-homogenization method to address these two issues, significantly increasing its applicability in various multiscale design cases. Instead of using conventional square cells with rectangular holes, we devise a parameterized microstructure composed of bars in different directions to provide more diversity in stiffness while retaining geometrical simplicity. The microstructural geometry-property relationship is then surrogated by a multi-layer neural network to avoid costly homogenization analysis during optimization. A Cartesian representation of the rotation angle is incorporated into homogenization-based optimization to design the unit-cell orientation. Corresponding high-resolution multiscale structures are obtained from the homogenization-based designs through a conformal mapping constructed with sawtooth function fields. This allows us to morph complex microstructures into an oriented and compatible tiling pattern, while preserving the local homogenized properties. To demonstrate our method with a specific application, we optimize the frequency response of structures under harmonic excitations within a given frequency range. It is the first time that the de-homogenization framework, enhanced by the sawtooth function, is applied for complex design scenarios beyond static compliance minimization. The examples illustrate that high-resolution multiscale structures can be generated with high efficiency and much better dynamic performance compared with the macroscale-only optimization. Beyond frequency response design, our proposed framework can be applied to general static and dynamic problems .},

  abstract     = {The phase-field method is widely established for modeling crack propagation in material science. It shows good agreement with analytical solutions and is able to describe a complex fracture behavior . Nevertheless, the models are mostly introduced for homogeneous systems , and there are only a few approaches for heterogeneous systems . So models, that are able to describe the crack propagation in such systems, are highly desirable. Based on a classic crack propagation phase-field approach, existing models are discussed, and a new model is derived. The first model, which is based on an already existing approach, uses homogenized properties and a single-crack order parameter, while the second model, a new approach, introduces multiple crack order parameters, each of which only tracks the damage of a corresponding phase. Furthermore, the issues of the single-crack order parameter model are demonstrated, such as the ability to reproduce the quantitative surface energies for an interfacial crack and the non-physical behavior of a crack propagating along a sloped material interface . In contrast, the novel multi-crack order parameter model prevents distortions for an interfacial crack and propagates along the interface in a more physical manner. In comparison with an analytical solution, based on linear elastic fracture mechanics , the novel model shows a good agreement, even for strongly sloped interfaces, where the single-crack order parameter model fails to reproduce the analytical solution. In a subsequent application to fiber-reinforced polymers, the new model has proven to be able to predict fractures in complex systems, including crack nucleation, branching, and merging. Finally, the applicability to a 3D system is illustrated.},

However, restricted by the layer-by-layer style of additive manufacturing techniques , the designed fiber orientations should be parallel to the print plane, and that will result in a reduced design space for the orientation optimization. To enlarge the orientation design space under this constraint, this paper proposes a new optimization method for FRC parts. The optimized structure is composed of several groups of components, and the fiber orientation of each group of components is constrained to a specific plane. Based on the composite additive manufacturing technology , these components can be fabricated separately and joined together to form the whole structure. The number of the component groups (also the fiber print planes) is predefined. In this method, the structure is optimized by concurrently designing the topology, the components partitioning and the fiber orientations. The structural topology and components partitioning are described by the SIMP interpolation scheme and discrete material optimization (DMO) interpolation scheme , respectively. The discrete-continuous parameterization (DCP) method with two sub-intervals is applied in the orientation optimization to avoid the local optimum of the angle variables, and a unified formulation is given for the concurrent optimization design. Furthermore, a density projection strategy with self-adaptive threshold parameters for multi-material optimization problems is proposed to get the distinct component interfaces. A stable convergence can be obtained without manually adjusting the projection parameters during the optimization iterations. The corresponding angle filtering method is developed to smooth the optimized fiber orientations. Numerical examples and manufacturing experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The main contribution of this paper is to show that in formulations requiring gauging, as in the vector potential formulation of magnetostatic equations, one can remove the discrete kernel subspace from the mortared spaces by the graph-theoretical concept of a tree–cotree decomposition. The tree–cotree decomposition is done based on the control mesh, it works for non-contractible domains, and it can be straightforwardly applied independently of the degree of the B-spline bases.

  abstract     = {We present a novel method to perform numerical integration over curved polyhedra enclosed by high-order parametric surfaces . Such a polyhedron is first decomposed into a set of triangular and/or rectangular pyramids, whose certain faces correspond to the given parametric surfaces. Each pyramid serves as an integration cell with a geometric mapping from a standard parent domain (e.g., a unit cube), where the tensor-product Gauss quadrature is adopted. As no constraint is imposed on the decomposition, certain resulting pyramids may intersect with themselves, and thus their geometric mappings may present negative Jacobian values. We call such cells folded cells and refer to the corresponding decomposition as a folded decomposition. We show that folded cells do not cause any issues in practice as they are only used to numerically compute certain integrals of interest. The same idea can be applied to planar curved polygons as well. We demonstrate both theoretically and numerically that folded cells can retain the same accuracy as the cells with strictly positive Jacobians. On the other hand, folded cells allow for a much easier and much more flexible decomposition for general curved polyhedra, on which one can robustly compute integrals. In the end, we show that folded cells can flexibly and robustly accommodate real-world complex geometries by presenting several examples in the context of immersed isogeometric analysis, where involved sharp features can be well respected in generating integration cells.},

  abstract     = {No literature has reported an explicit integration algorithm to achieve controllable numerical dissipation and identical third-order accuracy simultaneously. This paper develops two novel explicit integration algorithms to achieve this goal well without increasing computational complexity. In detail, two novel methods are identical third-order accuracy, so avoiding the order reduction for solving damped and forced vibrations, and both of them provide a full range of dissipation control via adjusting their unique algorithmic parameter. Apart from these two highlights, two novel methods embed another two enjoyably advantages. One is to present a significantly larger stability limit than the published third-order explicit schemes. Two novel methods provide the maximum stability limit, reaching 2 3 in the non-dissipative case, getting close to four. The other is to maintain a relatively little computational cost. Two novel methods require explicit solutions only twice within each time step. Therefore, two novel methods are significantly superior to other composite sub-step explicit schemes with respect to the accuracy, stability, dissipation control, and computational cost. Numerical examples are also performed to confirm the numerical performance and superiority of two novel explicit methods.},

To further improve performance, deflation is combined, in a multiplicative way, with a block-Jacobi preconditioner, which removes high frequency components of the error as well as near-linear dependencies introduced by enrichment.

  abstract     = {In this study, novel physics-informed neural network (PINN) methods for coupling neighboring support points and their derivative terms which are obtained by automatic differentiation (AD), are proposed to allow efficient training with improved accuracy. PINNs constrain their training loss function with ordinary and partial differential equations , to ensure outputs obey the governing physics. The computation of differential operators required for loss evaluation at collocation points are conventionally obtained via automatic differentiation. Although AD method has the advantage of being able to compute the exact gradients at any point, such PINNs can only achieve high accuracies with large numbers of collocation points—otherwise they are prone to optimizing towards unphysical solution. To make PINN training fast, the dual ideas of using numerical differentiation (ND)-inspired method and coupling it with AD are employed to define the loss function. The ND-based formulation for training loss can strongly link neighboring collocation points to enable efficient training in sparse sample regimes, but its accuracy is restricted by the interpolation scheme . The proposed coupled-automatic–numerical differentiation framework–labeled as can- PINN–unifies the advantages of AD and ND, providing more robust and efficient training than AD-based PINNs, while further improving accuracy by up to 1–2 orders of magnitude relative to ND-based PINNs. For a proof-of-concept demonstration of this can- scheme to fluid dynamic problems, two numerical-inspired instantiations of can- PINN schemes for the convection and pressure gradient terms were derived to solve the incompressible Navier–Stokes (N-S) equations. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed can- schemes have smaller dispersion and dissipation errors than the baseline ND-based schemes. The superior performance of can- PINNs is demonstrated on several challenging problems, including the flow mixing phenomena, lid driven flow in a cavity, and channel flow over a backward facing step. The results reveal that for challenging problems like these, can- PINNs can consistently achieve very good accuracy whereas conventional AD-based PINNs fail.},

The homogenization methodology is based on a systematic nano/micro/macro coupling between detailed atomistic MD simulations and a variational approach through the Hill–Mandel lemma. The proposed methodology is applied in model glassy polybutadiene/silica nanocomposites for different nanoparticle (NP) volume fractions. Initially, using MD simulations, the polymer/NP interphase in PNCs is directly examined by probing the density distribution and the stress profile at equilibrium. By using a continuum mechanics based approach, we can compute effective deformation gradients for each atom, allowing us to probe the distribution of the (local) stress and strain fields in the atomistic model. With this new approach, the effective Young modulus and the Poisson ratio of the polymer/NP interphases are directly calculated, exhibiting a higher rigidity compared to the polymer matrix. In the last part of the proposed approach, the mechanical properties at the interphases and the polymer are used together with the homogenization approach to develop a continuum model for predicting the mechanical properties of the PNCs, which are found to be in very good agreement with the effective mechanical properties calculated through atomistic MD simulations.},

Mesh adaptivity naturally suggests itself as a means of supplying spatial resolution where needed while simultaneously keeping the computational size of the model as small as possible. Here, a variational-based spatial adaptivity is proposed for a phase-field model of fracture. An extension of the conventional phase-field model is achieved by allowing spatial variation of the regularisation length ε ε in the energy functional. Similar to the displacement and phase fields, the optimal regularisation length is obtained by minimising the energy functional. This extended phase-field model serves as the foundation for an adaptive mesh refinement strategy, in which the mesh size is determined locally by the optimal regularisation length. The resulting solution procedure is implemented in the framework of the finite element library FEniCS. According to the selected numerical experiment, the spatially adaptive phase-field model converges marginally faster than the conventional phase-field model but with a vastly superior constant, resulting in significant computational savings.},

It is demonstrated that on one hand, machine learning can be employed to represent the key but implicit inter-relationships implied by asymptotic analysis, and the evaluations of the homogenised quantities, as well as the sensitivities of the design variables, become quite efficient. On the other hand, the use of asymptotic analysis informs the settings of machine learning models, and also a computational routine for data acquisition. The efficacy of the present scheme equipped with the asymptotic-analysis-informed neural networks (AINNs) is examined with numerical examples. On a normal four-core workstation, the present algorithm outputs a two-dimensional optimised multiscale structure in hundreds of seconds, and a three-dimensional optimised result in an hour or two, which qualifies the present scheme as one of the most efficient algorithms used for the compliance optimisation of configurations infilled with complex microstructures.},

As the large strain gradient leads to a strong flexoelectric effect , the design of flexoelectric nano-structure via topology optimization has seen growing attentions. In the present work, an explicit topology optimization framework is proposed for flexoelectric structures design. To achieve this purpose, the Moving Morphable Void (MMV)-based approach is employed in the context of Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) combined with the Trimming Surface Analysis (TSA). Energy conversion factor and effective electric polarizability are respectively optimized to improve the flexoelectric performance of the nanostructure. Performing design under the explicit framework coupled with IGA can bring several advantages. Due to the use of NURBS basis functions of IGA, the required continuity in the approximation of the PDEs of flexoelectricity can be satisfied straightforwardly. Furthermore, with the use of the TSA technique, the occurrence of weak/gray material, which may cause numerical instability in flexoelectricity design, can be avoided. Also due to the explicit geometry description in MMV, the optimized result can be imported to the CAD system directly, which is significant for nanoscale structure from manufacturing perspective. Several representative numerical examples for topology optimization of flexoelectric structures are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Thermo–hydro–mechanical (THM) coupling prevails in all sorts of underground activities, and numerical simulation is an effective tool to understand THM coupling. The essence of performing THM coupling simulation lies in solving a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) with displacements (U), pore pressure (P) and temperature (T) as the primary variables. In previous studies, only the UPT and U-PT schemes are reported to solve the system PDEs. Another promising scheme UP-T was rarely explored. In addition, although multiple solution schemes are theoretically possible, the performance thereof varies. Few studies have ever compared the performance of different solution schemes. Moreover, the rock mass in hydrothermal fields is highly permeable wherein heat advection dominates. Advection-dominated heat transfer may lead to numerical oscillation, but how to stabilize the simulation in the 3D case was inadequately reported. In this study, we developed a new THM coupling simulator HENGYI in the context of the finite element method. The UP-T solution scheme was verified to be robust enough to simulate large engineering problems. The Streamline Upwind Petrov Galerkin method was generalized to 3D and applied to HENGYI to address the advection-dominated heat transfer. The performance of the UPT, UP-T and U-PT schemes was compared and the applicability of different solution schemes was found to be highly associated with the degree of coupling between primary variables. Great details are provided regarding the development of HENGYI. Thus HENGYI not only bridges the research gaps mentioned above but also provides a comprehensive understanding of THM coupling simulation techniques.},

  abstract     = {Numerical homogenization enables efficient computational analysis and design of multiscale structures made of micro-architected materials including lattice unit cells. However, predicting yield is nontrivial because it requires accurate and efficient predictions of the maximum stress inside the homogenized unit cells. To address this challenge, we develop a macroscale anisotropic yield function for micro-architected materials. The yield function depends on the three-dimensional macroscale stress state and the parameters describing a family of micro-architectures, such as the radii of the struts in a lattice unit cell. To ensure accuracy, we determine the maximum stress using three-dimensional continuum finite-element analysis. To ensure efficiency, we construct surrogate models from the aforementioned high-fidelity results for yield prediction. To reduce simulation costs and surrogate modeling complexity, we leverage orthotropic symmetry commonly found in lattice unit cells. In this paper, we provide a thorough presentation of group representations and the systematic procedure to exploit orthotropic domain symmetry in homogenization and surrogate modeling. We illustrate the use of linear homogenization results to predict yield in specific unit cells without further simulations. We furthermore show that surrogate modeling presents a viable option for anisotropic yield prediction in a continuously parametrized family of micro-architectures. More specifically, despite the dimensionality and degree of nonlinearity in the maximum micro von Mises stress within the unit cell, the surrogate models can predict it with less than 5% error at least 90% of the time. Moreover, the largest under-prediction error, which is more critical than the over-prediction error, is typically less than 10%.},

  abstract     = {The favored phase field method (PFM) has encountered challenges in the finite strain fracture modeling of nearly or truly incompressible hyperelastic materials. We identified that the underlying cause lies in the innate contradiction between incompressibility and smeared crack opening. Drawing on the stiffness-degradation idea in PFM, we resolved this contradiction through loosening incompressible constraint of the damaged phase without affecting the incompressibility of intact material. By modifying the perturbed Lagrangian approach , we derived a novel mixed formulation. In numerical aspects, the finite element discretization uses the classical Q1/P0 and high-order P2/P1 schemes, respectively. To ease the mesh distortion at large strains, an adaptive mesh deletion technology is also developed. The validity and robustness of the proposed mixed framework are corroborated by four representative numerical examples . By comparing the performance of Q1/P0 and P2/P1, we conclude that the Q1/P0 formulation is a better choice for finite strain fracture in nearly incompressible cases. Moreover, the numerical examples also show that the combination of the proposed framework and methodology has vast potential in simulating complex peeling and tearing problems.},

  abstract     = {Particles of complex morphologies and their surrounding soft interphase are main constituents that play a significant role in the transport properties of particle-reinforced composites (PRCs). It has been a crucial but unresolved issue how to derive the volume fraction of soft interphase around three-dimensional (3D) irregular concave particles, as well as it remains to be virgin to explore the effective transport properties of three-phase PRCs composed of homogeneous matrix, 3D irregular concave particles of a relatively high packing density and their surrounding soft interphase. To this end, this work initially develops a discrete element modeling (DEM) of 3D irregular concave particles with monodispersity in size to generate random dense packing structures, where an innovative mathematical-controllable parameterized method is proposed to devise diverse irregular concave particle shapes. The proposed particle design method is not only universal and controllable to generate a given particle shape, but also can be directly linked with an experimental measurement using digital scanning. In addition, an efficient two-step numerical strategy is presented to check the inter-particle contact detection and collision. Then, the volume fraction of soft interphase around monodisperse concave particles is numerically derived for the first time by using the Monte Carlo random point sampling simulation. The Monte Carlo simulation has good accuracy to obtain the soft interphase volume fraction, which is confirmed by comparing with the theoretical formulae for spherical particle systems. Next, a dual-probability-Brownian motion (DP-BM) scheme along with the level set algorithm is extended to investigate the effective transport properties like thermal conductivity of three-phase PRCs. Comparison against the finite element method (FEM), the proposed DP-BM scheme is more user-friendly and efficient to estimate the effective transport properties of PRCs within an accuracy level. The proposed DP-BM scheme can overcome the two intrinsic limitations of the classical effective medium approximations that one limitation is the ellipsoidal inclusion shape and another is a relative dilute level of inclusion volume fraction. Moreover, the effects of the concave particle shape and packing density, and the interphase dimension on the volume fraction of soft interphase and the effective normalized transport properties of PRCs are evaluated. The results elucidate rigorous component-structure–property relations, which can provide sound guidance for durability evaluation and material design of PRCs.},

  abstract     = {The phase-field fracture free-energy functional is non-convex with respect to the displacement and the phase field. This results in a poor performance of the conventional monolithic solvers like the Newton–Raphson method. In order to circumvent this issue, researchers opt for the alternate minimization (staggered) solvers. Staggered solvers are robust for the phase-field based fracture simulations as the displacement and the phase-field sub-problems are convex in nature. Nevertheless, the staggered solver requires very large number of iterations (of the order of thousands) to converge. In this work, a robust monolithic solver is presented for the phase-field fracture problem. The solver adopts a fracture energy-based arc-length method and an adaptive under-relaxation scheme. The arc-length method enables the simulation to overcome critical points (snap-back, snap-through instabilities) during the loading of a specimen. The use of an under-relaxation scheme stabilizes the solver by preventing the divergence due to an ill-behaving stiffness matrix. The efficiency of the proposed solver is further amplified with an adaptive mesh refinement scheme based on PHT-splines within the framework of isogeometric analysis. The numerical experiments presented in the manuscript demonstrate the efficacy of the solver. All the codes and data-sets accompanying this work will be made available on GitHub ( https://github.com/rbharali/IGAFrac ).},

The optimized topological configuration and periodic constant are taken as the design variables, and a soil parameter is treated as a condition variable considering its influence on bandgaps. To improve the quality of samples and control the design space reasonably, Configuration Generation (CG) rules are formulated to guide the generation of a topology dataset. The design performance of the deep learning methodology is tested by a large number of samples based on numerical simulations, and it is found that the designed bandgaps are highly consistent with the targeted ones. Multiple designed results are given for the same target, revealing the “one-to-many” nature of the design problem. Two metabarriers are designed for vibration mitigation in the main frequency ranges of a practical example, and considerable blocking effects are observed.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the inverse problem of accurately identifying the shape, size and location of 2D objects or voids in a given medium via the measurement of waves scattered from them. Examples of scatterers include an obstacle in a 2D acoustic medium or a small hole in a membrane. To fix ideas, the latter example, governed by the scalar wave equation, serves here in demonstrating the method. In the proposed method, a known source generates waves that propagate in the membrane, and these time-dependent waves are measured by a small number of sensors located at chosen points. Based on these measurements, an iterative process is performed to find the closed curve that represents the boundary of the scatterer. Mathematically, the iterative process aims at minimizing a cost functional that represents the difference between the measured wave signals and the wave signals obtained in the presence of a candidate scatterer. The gradient of this functional, which represents its sensitivity to the scatterer geometry, is calculated efficiently using the adjoint method. Finite elements are used to discretize the spatial domain, the Newmark method is used for time-stepping, and a smoothed gradient method is used for the functional minimization. The unknown boundary of the scatterer is discretized from the outset, which allows a simpler derivation of the adjoint procedure compared to a fully variational treatment. The unknown curve is defined by a parametric representation, that is completely general and does not make any preliminary assumptions about the scatterer geometry. Multiple sources are used to enhance the identification. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated via numerical examples . It is shown that excellent identification is obtained even in the presence of noise, with a small number of sensors, and with no need for regularization (other than that induced by the discretization).},

Nevertheless, these solvers require a regular discretization of the investigated domain and periodic boundary conditions. Local multi-grid methods appear as an appropriate framework to perform simulations involving local refinement with FFT solvers. A coarse (global) discretization is improved by one or several local refined discretizations defined in subdomains overlapping the global grid. The Local Defect Correction (LDC) method is adapted to couple the resolution on the global coarse grid problem with the resolution of the local grids problems. Numerical tests demonstrate a significant reduction of CPU time and memory consumption with a relatively low loss in accuracy in comparison to the computation on one fully refined global grid. This approach also provides a baseline for extensions to the coupling of FFT codes with other solvers in a multi-scale and multi-physics framework.},

  abstract     = {In case of Lagrangian finite element formulation, three-dimensional (3-D) stress-based hybrid solid elements have shown excellent coarse mesh accuracy for a wide range of applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no work available towards the development of 3-D stress-based hybrid solid elements for isogeometric analysis (IGA). In this work, we propose stress-based hybrid solid elements to alleviate the issue of locking arising in non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS)-based IGA. The present work primarily focuses on the linear elasticity , though the formulation can be extended to the non-linear regime. We believe that the excellent coarse mesh accuracy provided by the proposed elements will further enhance the IGA in various applications, especially involving structures with high aspect ratios and nearly incompressible materials . The proposed elements are constructed based on a two-field Hellinger–Reissner variational statement, where stress and displacement fields are interpolated separately. The stress interpolation functions have been derived systemically for various orders of NURBS displacement interpolation functions . Further, we show mathematically that the choice of the stress interpolation functions is free from spurious zero-energy modes. Lastly, the results of numerous 3-D linear-elastic benchmark problems are presented to demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of the proposed elements. The results confirm the superior coarse mesh accuracy for structures with high aspect ratios and almost incompressible materials.},

  abstract     = {The Generalized/eXtended Finite Element Method (G/XFEM) has been established as an approach to provide optimally convergent solutions for classes of problems that are challenging for the standard version of the Finite Element Method (FEM). For problems with non-smooth solutions, as those within the Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) context, the FEM convergence rates are often not optimal and are bounded by the strength of the singularity in the analytical solution. This can be overcome by G/XFEM and many researches have focused on delivering first-order convergent solutions for LEFM problems. The difficulty in obtaining higher-order accurate approximations , however, relies mainly on also controlling the growth rate of the stiffness matrix condition number . In this paper, well-conditioned and optimally convergent second-order G/XFEMs are proposed for LEFM simulations by augmenting second-order Lagrangian FEM approximation spaces. More specifically, two strategies are proposed in order to accurately represent second-order discontinuous functions along a crack. Also, a third strategy that essentially improves the use of linear Heaviside functions in the sense that these enrichments no longer cause linear dependencies among the set of G/XFEM shape functions is proposed. The numerical experiments show the robustness of the formulations presented herein for a set of crack topologies.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven constitutive modeling is an emerging field in computational solid mechanics with the prospect of significantly relieving the computational costs of hierarchical computational methods. Additionally, this data-driven paradigm could enable a seamless connection of experimental data probing material responses with numerical simulations at the structural level. Traditionally, these surrogates have just been trained using datasets which map strain inputs to stress outputs for elastic and inelastic materials directly. Recently, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have instead been trained to additionally incorporate the underlying physical laws in the construction of these models. However, ANNs do not offer convergence guarantees from an engineering point of view and are majorly reliant on user-specified parameters. In contrast to ANNs, Gaussian process regression (GPR) is based on nonparametric modeling principles as well as on fundamental statistical knowledge and hence allows for strict convergence guarantees. Motivated by the recent work by Frankel et al. (2021) which is based on rewriting the stress output as a linear combination of an irreducible integrity basis, in this work we present a physics-informed and data-driven constitutive modeling approach for isotropic and anisotropic hyperelastic materials at finite strain. The trained surrogates are able to respect physical principles such as material frame indifference, material symmetry, thermodynamic consistency, stress-free undeformed configuration, and the local balance of angular momentum . Our approach is based on probabilistic machine learning and uniquely can be used in the big data context while maintaining the benefits of GPR. As sampling in the mixed invariant space poses a unique challenge, we additionally present the first sampling approach that directly generates space-filling points in the invariant space corresponding to a bounded domain of the deformation gradient tensor . The sampling technique is based on simulated annealing and provides more efficient and reliable physics-informed constitutive models. Overall, the presented approach is tested on synthetic data from isotropic and anisotropic constitutive laws and shows surprising accuracy even far beyond the limits of the training domain, indicating that the resulting surrogates can efficiently generalize as they incorporate knowledge about the underlying physics.},

  abstract     = {Real-time dynamic simulation remains a significant challenge for spatiotemporal data of high dimension and resolution. In this study, we establish a transformer neural network (TNN) originally developed for natural language processing and a separate convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate five-dimensional (5D) spatiotemporal brain–skull relative displacement resulting from impact (isotropic spatial resolution of 4 mm with temporal resolution of 1 ms). Sequential training is applied to train (N = 5184 samples) the two neural networks for estimating the complete 5D displacement across a temporal duration of 60 ms. We find that TNN slightly but consistently outperforms CNN in accuracy for both displacement and the resulting voxel-wise four-dimensional (4D) maximum principal strain (e.g., root mean squared error (RMSE) of ∼ ∼ 1.0% vs. ∼ ∼ 1.6%, with coefficient of determination, R 2 R2 &gt;0.99 vs. &gt;0.98, respectively, and normalized RMSE (NRMSE) at peak displacement of 2%–3%, based on an independent testing dataset; N = 314). Their accuracies are similar for a range of real-world impacts drawn from various published sources (dummy, helmet, football, soccer, and car crash; average RMSE/NRMSE of ∼ ∼ 0.3 mm/ ∼ ∼ 4%–5% and average R 2 R2 of ∼ ∼ 0.98 at peak displacement). Accuracy in strain rate is also illustrated in one case (NRMSE of 7.8% and of 0.91). Sequential training is effective for allowing instantaneous estimation of 5D displacement with high accuracy, although TNN poses a heavier computational burden in training. This work enables efficient characterization of the intrinsically dynamic brain strain in impact critical for downstream multiscale axonal injury model simulation. This is also the first application of TNN in biomechanics and biomedical engineering, which offers important insight into how real-time dynamic simulations can be achieved across diverse engineering fields.},

To reduce computing costs, the time-dependent shear modulus is expressed in the form of Prony series, and the memory stress is calculated by using the genetic integral. Since the fundamental solution of elastostatics is applied to derive the boundary integral equations, which leads to the existence of domain integrals. To ensure that this algorithm only needs to discretize the boundary, we use radial integration method (RIM) to transform the domain integrals related to body force and memory stress into equivalent boundary integrals through applied points. Moreover, the strongly singular integral of the boundary integral equation is solved by the rigid-body displacement technique after a simple transformation between control points and collocation points , and the power series expansion method is used to solve the weakly singular integrals in RI-IGABEM. Furthermore, the 3D surface traction recovery method (TRM) of the viscoelastic mechanics is proposed to solve the strain and stress of the boundary points, and the regularized strain and stress integral equations are given in this work to solve the strain and stress of the internal points . Some 3D examples are applied to prove the effectiveness of the present method for the viscoelastic problems with body force.},

The viscoplastic size-dependent nonlocal granular fluidity (NGF) constitutive model has successfully provided a quantitative description of experimental flows in many different configurations in literature. This research develops a numerical approach , within a hyperelasticity framework, for implementing the dynamical form of NGF in three-dimensional material point method (3D MPM, an appropriate numerical solver for granular flow modeling). This approach is thermodynamically consistent to conserve energy, and the dynamical form includes the nonlocal effect of flow cessation. Excavation data, both quantitative measurements and qualitative visualization, are collected experimentally via our robotic equipment to evaluate the model with respect to the flow geometry as well as interaction forces. The results are further compared with the results from a recent modified plastic Drucker–Prager constitutive model, and in other configurations including wheel–soil interactions, a gravity-driven silo, and Taylor–Couette flow.},

  abstract     = {Arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) is a newly well-developed meta-heuristic algorithm that is inspired by the distribution behavior of main arithmetic operators in mathematics. Although the original AOA has shown well competitive performance with popular meta-heuristic algorithms, it still faces the issues of insufficient exploitation ability, ease of falling into local optima and low convergence accuracy in large-scale applications. In order to ameliorate these deficiencies, an enhanced hybrid AOA named CSOAOA, integrated with point set strategy, optimal neighborhood learning strategy and crisscross strategy, is developed in this paper. First, a good point set initialization strategy is added to obtain a higher-quality initial population, which improves the convergence speed of the algorithm. Then, the optimal neighborhood learning strategy is adopted to guide the individual’s search behavior and avoid the algorithm falling into the current local optimum, which boosts the search efficiency and calculation accuracy. Finally, by combining AOA with the crisscross optimization algorithm, the exploration and utilization ability of the crisscross algorithm are integrated into the CSOAOA. These strategies collaborate to enhance AOA in accelerating overall performance. The superiority of the proposed CSOAOA is comprehensively verified by comparing with the original AOA, six improved AOA and numerous celebrated and newly developed algorithms on the well-known 23 classical benchmark functions, IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) 2019 test suite and IEEE CEC 2020 benchmark functions, respectively. Meanwhile, the practicability of CSOAOA is also highlighted by solving eight real-world engineering design problems. Furthermore, the statistical testing of CSOAOA has been conducted to validate its significance. Experimental results and statistical comparisons manifest the superior performance of CSOAOA over the comparison algorithms in terms of precision, convergence rate and solution quality. Therefore, CSOAOA is potentially a powerful and competitive meta-heuristic algorithm for solving complex engineering optimization problems.},

The algorithm has been crafted to be explicable, require no training data and behave uniformly in all axes or orientations. It consists of four phases: (1) segmenting fibre regions using a scale-dependent Iterative Difference of Gaussians approach, (2) extracting directionality using the structure tensor minimum eigenvector , (3) automatically placing the seeds near a set of user-defined restricting surfaces, and (4) tracking fibres using a streamline-based integration method. The algorithm cost grows in relation to the target fibre diameter and is proportional to the number of voxels in the input volume. Its behaviour, ability to process very curved fibres, and error have been assessed using both synthetic and real datasets. The C++ implementation is performant and parallelizable, and produces helpful visualisations to gain insight of the intermediate and final results .},

The construction is cast within the framework of information theory , which is invoked to derive a least-informative model while ensuring consistency with theoretical requirements in finite elasticity. Specifically, almost sure polyconvexity and uniform growth conditions are enforced through proper repulsion constraints and regularization , hence making the forward problem of uncertainty propagation well posed. In addition, transformations arising from the linearization procedure are introduced for consistency and induce statistical dependencies in the primary variables. The latter include material moduli, a weight balancing between the isotropic and anisotropic contributions, and the angle defining the structural tensors . The identification of the model is subsequently performed, using an existing database on human arterial walls. Maximum likelihood estimators are obtained and provided for the adventitia, media, and intima layers, which enables the use of the proposed model as a generative surrogate for, e.g., training and classification in data-driven approaches integrating inter-patient variability. Finally, uncertainty propagation on a realistic, patient-specific geometry is conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the stochastic modeling framework.},

We then propose a semidiscrete continuous-in-time approximation on simplicial grids based on the Raviart–Thomas elements of degree k ≥ 0 k≥0 for the pseudostress tensor and discontinuous piecewise polynomials of degree k k for the velocity and the velocity gradient . In addition, by means of the backward Euler time discretization , we introduce a fully discrete finite element scheme. We prove well-posedness and derive the stability bounds for both schemes, and under a quasi-uniformity assumption on the mesh, we establish the corresponding error estimates .

  abstract     = {In this paper, a variational framework is proposed for the constitutive update of thermomechanical constitutive models in the special case where their input results from quantities directly updated by hyperbolic conservation laws . Both a continuum and a consistent first order accurate discrete settings are derived. The originality of this work lies in that the constitutive update is driven by the rates of some strain measure and the internal energy density in the continuum setting, leading to a rate-type description of the local constitutive problem, and by the updated values at some discrete time of these strain measure and internal energy density in the discrete setting. These quantities are updated by the solution of a system of discrete conservation laws including the first principle of thermodynamics, ensuring that the right shock speeds will be computed. This point is of crucial importance when simulating impact on structures for instance. The proposed variational approach is illustrated for thermo-hyperelastic-viscoplastic solid media, especially using the parameterization of the flow rule direction based on pseudo-stresses proposed by Mosler &amp; co-workers. The proposed discrete variational solver is then coupled with the second order accurate flux difference splitting finite volume method , which permits to solve the set of conservation laws. Comparisons are performed on a set of test cases with numerical solutions obtained with finite elements coupled to an explicit time-stepping and to a temperature-driven variational constitutive update. They allow to show the good behavior of the proposed approach.},

To this end, the local heat flux scheme of TRT model is derived. The intrinsic drawbacks inherent to BGK model may be effectively cured by TRT model. It is interesting that an optimum convergence parameter exists in TRT model, which may maximize the convergence speed without losing computational accuracy . To determine the optimum convergence parameters, the influences of the microstructure distributions, volume fractions , thermal conductivity ratios and grid numbers are investigated in a systematic manner. For application, an empirical formula is developed to estimate the optimum convergence parameters, which may work for various multi-phase media. Under the guidance of this formula, the convergence speed of TRT model may be thousands of times faster the BGK counterpart. The present work may be readily extended to the predictions of effective electrical conductivity and elasticity modulus.},

Firstly, a similarity distribution-based identification method is presented to eliminate the data deviation caused by outliers. For the problem with dispersed samples, a fuzzy equivalence relation-based clustering method is subsequently introduced, where the number of clusters is adaptively determined by the prior similarity levels. On the basis of the above data preprocessing procedure, a more precise multi-ellipsoid modeling framework is constructed, in which the statistical information of existing samples is utilized to derive the explicit expression of ellipsoid models. Meanwhile, to improve the computational efficiency of uncertainty propagation analysis under the multi-ellipsoid model, the back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN) is constructed as the surrogate model of the original time-consuming simulation model. Eventually, two numerical examples are provided to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

However, the finite element analysis of such problems often suffers from severe volumetric locking effects and numerical instabilities. In this paper, we present novel methods to overcome volumetric locking phenomena for using stabilized P1–P1 elements. We introduce different stabilization techniques and demonstrate the high robustness and computational efficiency of the chosen methods. In two benchmark problems from the literature as well as an advanced application to cardiac electromechanics, we compare the approach to standard linear elements and show the accuracy and versatility of the methods to simulate anisotropic, nearly and fully incompressible materials.

This paper presents the high-order version of the method, its mathematical analysis, and numerical experiments. The proposed method retains optimal accuracy for any order of the finite element interpolation spaces despite the surrogate boundary is piecewise linear. As such, the proposed approach bypasses the problematic issue of meshing complex geometries with high-order body-fitted boundary representations, without the need of complex data structures for the integration on cut cells.},

The violation of this property can degrade the performance of the formulations in predicting structural responses. In the setting of linear analysis, the invariance of planar beam formulations has already been studied, but a similar investigation for spatial beam formulations is not yet carried out. Most of the spatial beam formulations are developed in the local coordinate frame, and components of unknown kinematics in this frame are discretized by using rational B-spline basis functions. Unfortunately, those formulations are found to be non-invariant under such a discretization scheme , and the degradation in their performance is demonstrated. On the other hand, the local coordinate frame is widely defined by the so-called natural Frenet–Serret frame. The sole utilization of this frame does not allow the consideration of beams having twisting configuration. In this study, these shortcomings are resolved.},

In order to solve this issue, we propose a simple way to embed different failure criteria into the PFM in this work. On one hand, an activation parameter is introduced into the PFM’s driving force to control the fracture timing, and the parameter’s value is one if the specified criterion is satisfied and is zero otherwise. On the other hand, a structural tensor is introduced into the PFM’s surface density function to reflect the fracture direction predicted by the specified criterion. The fracture evolution direction is enforced in line with the criterion through a penalty parameter.

  abstract     = {The appearance of snapping phenomena is frequent in structural analyses involving nonlinearities such as the propagation of localized damage zones, or cracks, as encountered in quasi-brittle materials. In the presence of snapping effects, the standard Newton-based algorithms cannot predict the equilibrium curves correctly by usual displacement or force control. This problem can be circumvented by using path-following techniques. This study proposes a numerical approach for nonlinear structural analysis based on the Boundary Element Method (BEM) coupled with a partitioned path-following strategy. In this strategy, the acting loads are divided into two groups: (a) those perfectly known and (b) those in which only the direction is known, while the magnitude (or load factor/multiplier) is determined to respect the equilibrium of the boundary fields (indirectly controlled) and an additional problem equation, the path-following constraint equation. The resulting nonlinear system is solved using an incremental iterative scheme . For each iteration, the corrections to the boundary fields are obtained in a partitioned manner. First, the portion coming from the unbalanced boundary fields is calculated. Then the correction resulting from a unit load in the direction of the load to be indirectly controlled is obtained. Finally, the load factor is calculated independently using the path-following constraint equation, which can be linear, nonlinear, differentiable, or not. In the numerical tests, the Control of the Nodal Displacement Increment (CNDI) is chosen as path-following constraint equation for the sake of illustration. The results show that the proposed approach can efficiently capture the equilibrium curve even in the presence of severe snap-backs. The approach is designed to be implemented in existing BEM codes straightforwardly, provided that the influence matrices can be accessed. Moreover, no additional pre-conditioning technique is required.},

  abstract     = {We present an enriched radial basis function (RBF) interpolation, which is combined with a symmetric Galerkin method to solve finite strain problems. Specifically, Wendland compact support radial basis functions (RBF) are enriched with a quadratic polynomial , whose parameters are condensed-out during the shape-function construction phase. A total Lagrangian technique is adopted and for finite strain plasticity the formalism with the Mandel stress is adopted. These recent developments are especially convenient from the implementation perspective, as RBF formulations for finite strain plasticity have been limited by interpolation updating. We also note that, although tetrahedra are adopted for quadrature in the undeformed configuration, mesh deformation is of no consequence for the results. Four benchmark tests are successfully solved, with extensive convergence studies and showing clear advantages with respect to finite-element in terms of robustness and with respect to classical Element-Free Galerkin (EFG) formulations in terms of efficiency.},

  abstract     = {High-fidelity cardiac models using attribute-rich finite element based models have been developed to a very mature stage. However, such finite-element based approaches remain time consuming, which have limited their clinical use. There remains a need for alternative methods for novel cardiac simulation methods capable of high fidelity simulations in clinically relevant time frames. Surrogate models are one approach, which traditionally use a data-driven approach for training, requiring the generation of a sufficiently large number of simulation results as the training dataset. Alternatively, a physics-informed neural network can be trained by minimizing the PDE residuals or energy potentials. However, this approach does not provide a general method to easily using existing finite element models. To address these challenges, we developed a hybrid approach that seamlessly bridged a neural network surrogate model with a differentiable finite element domain representation (NNFE). Given its importance in cardiac simulations, we applied this approach to simulations of the hyperelastic mechanical behavior of ventricular myocardium from recent 3D kinematic constitutive model (J Mech Behav Biomed Mater, 2020 doi: 10.1016/j.jmbbm.2019.103508). We utilized a cuboidal domain and conducted numerical studies of individual myocardium specimens discretized by a finite element mesh and assigned with experimentally obtained myofiber architectures. Both parameterized Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions were studied. We developed a second-order Newton optimization method, instead of using a stochastic gradient descent method, to train the neural network efficiently. The resulting trained neural network surrogate model demonstrated excellent agreement with the corresponding “ground truth” finite element solutions over the entire physiological deformation range. More importantly, the NNFE approach provided a significantly decreased computational time for a range of finite element mesh sizes for online predictions. For example, as the finite element mesh size increased from 2744 to 175615 elements, the NNFE computational time increased from 0.1108 s to 0.1393 s, while the “ground truth” FE model increased from 4.541 s to 719.9 s. These results suggest that NNFE run times can be significantly reduced compared with the traditional large-deformation based finite element solution methods. The trade-off is to train the NNFE off-line within a range of anticipated physiological responses. However, training time would only have to be performed once before any number of application uses. Moreover, since the NNFE is an analytical function its computational performance will be amplified when the corresponding problem becomes more complex.},

  abstract     = {The problem addressed in this paper concerns the frictional contact between an elastomer and a rigid body with randomly rough surfaces. The work is accomplished on the basis of two crucial elements: a framework for generating random geometries and a robust frictional contact algorithm, both of which are realised in the approach of Isogeometric analysis (IGA) for its high accuracy and robustness. For the former, a new Isogeometric framework for random geometry modelling is proposed, which combines the random field generation based on Karhunen–Loève expansion theory with Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) interpolation method. For the latter, a mortar-based frictional contact algorithm in 2D large deformation regime is adopted incorporating a modified closest point projection method for detection of contact. Numerical experiments are conducted with several settings such as ‘rough–smooth’, ‘smooth–rough’ and ‘rough–rough’ contact, depending on which side of the contact pair the randomly rough surface belongs to. The ratio of the global coefficient of friction to the prescribed local one and the ratio of true contact area to the nominal contact area are characterised under these settings, and factors like the root mean square roughness and correlation length of the random surface and the external traction are discovered to have a significant influence on the two ratios.},

Acoustic waves propagating in a narrow channel are damped by viscous and thermal boundary layers. To estimate these viscothermal effects, we first introduce a sequential linearized Navier–Stokes model based on three weakly coupled Helmholtz equations for viscous, thermal, and acoustic pressure fields. Then, the optimization problem is formulated, where a sound-absorbing structure comprising air and an isothermal rigid medium is targeted, and its sound absorption coefficient is set as an objective function. The adjoint variable method and the concept of the topological derivative are used to approximately obtain design sensitivity. A level set-based topology optimization method is used to solve the optimization problem. Two-dimensional numerical examples are provided to support the validity of the proposed method. Moreover, the mechanisms that lead to the high absorption coefficient of the optimized design are discussed.},

  abstract     = {In this manuscript we present a mathematical theory and a computational algorithm to study optimal design of mesh-like structures such as metallic stents by changing the stent strut thickness and width to optimize the overall stent compliance. The mathematical constrained optimization problem is to minimize the “compliance functional” over a closed and bounded set of constraints. The compliance functional is the stent’s overall elastic energy. The constraints are the minimal and maximal strut thickness, and a given fixed volume of the stent material . We prove the existence of a minimizer, thereby proving that the constrained optimization problem has a solution. A numerical scheme based on an iteration procedure is introduced, and implemented within a Finite Element Method framework. Optimal design of three different stent prototypes is considered: (1) a single zig-zag ring, which can be found in many complex stent designs on the US market as a basic cell in the modular stent design, (2) a Palmaz–Schatz type stent consisting of 6 zig-zag rings, and (3) a Cypher(TM) type stent consisting of zig-zag rings with sinusoidal connectors. Several interesting optimization solutions are found, some of which have already been implemented in the design of the currently available stents on the US market. The resulting computational algorithm is compared to a Genetic Algorithm , and it is shown that our computational approach outperforms the Genetic Algorithm in the following three key aspects: (1) computation time , (2) accuracy, and (3) maintaining the symmetry of the solution.},

  abstract     = {We recently derived the unified continuum and variational multiscale formulation for fluid–structure interaction (FSI) using the Gibbs free energy as the thermodynamic potential. Restricting our attention to vascular FSI, we now reduce this formulation in arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) coordinates by adopting three common modeling assumptions for the vascular wall. The resulting semi-discrete formulation, referred to as the reduced unified continuum formulation, achieves monolithic coupling of the FSI system in the Eulerian frame through a simple modification of the fluid boundary integral. While ostensibly similar to the semi-discrete formulation of the coupled momentum method introduced by Figueroa et al., its underlying derivation does not rely on an assumption of a fictitious body force in the elastodynamics sub-problem and therefore represents a direct simplification of the ALE method. Furthermore, uniform temporal discretization of the entire FSI system is performed via the generalized- α α scheme. In contrast to the predominant approach yielding only first-order accuracy for pressure, we collocate both pressure and velocity at the intermediate time step to achieve uniform second-order temporal accuracy. In conjunction with quadratic tetrahedral elements, our methodology offers higher-order temporal and spatial accuracy for quantities of clinical interest, including pressure and wall shear stress. Furthermore, without loss of consistency, a segregated predictor multi-corrector algorithm is developed to preserve the same block structure as for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in the implicit solver’s associated linear system. Block preconditioning of a monolithically coupled FSI system is therefore made possible for the first time. Compared to alternative preconditioners, our three-level nested block preconditioner, which achieves improved representation of the Schur complement, demonstrates robust performance over a wide range of physical parameters. We present verification of our methodology against Womersley’s deformable wall theory and additionally develop practical modeling techniques for clinical applications, including tissue prestressing. We conclude with an assessment of our combined FSI technology in two patient-specific cases.},

  abstract     = {Morphological instabilities play a key role in the evolution of form and function in growing biomaterials. Spatially varying differential growth, in particular, leads to residual stresses that for soft materials or slender geometries are favourably relieved by out-of-plane buckling or wrinkling. While the onset of instability in growing biomaterials has been studied extensively, the post-critical regime remains poorly understood. To this end, this paper presents a robust computational modelling framework for morphoelastic instabilities and associated post-critical pattern formation. The seven-parameter shell element—commonly used for elasto-plastic analysis of engineering materials—is implemented alongside the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor into a growth and an elastic part. The governing nonlinear equations are solved using a generalised path-following/numerical continuation solver that facilitates comprehensive exploration of the stability landscape through pinpointing of critical points and branch switching at bifurcations. The utility and power of the computational framework is demonstrated by unveiling complex pattern formation phenomena that arise as a result of sequentially occurring morphological instabilities. In particular, we highlight the central role that exponential edge growth plays in fractal wrinkling patterns, the blooming of doubly-curved flower petals, and wavy daffodil trumpets. In addition, the ability of the solver to track critical points through parameter space enables efficient sensitivity studies into the role of material parameters on pattern formation. The presented computational framework is thus a versatile tool for modelling the evolution of form and function in growing biological systems and the design of biotechnology applications.},

In this way, hardening/softening plasticity reduces to elastic-perfect plasticity, and the GSPC is ideally suited to hardening/softening plasticity with no need to revise.

The main concept of UM-STAGN approach is to get rid of the elements where the error estimators reach the prescribed accuracy at each adaptation step, and then assemble the rest elements as the new subsystems to be solved at the next stage. By reducing the scale of the computational domains gradually, this method achieves efficiency to some degree, though, since it fails to transfer the error information across subsystems, the error of Q uantity o f I nterest (QoI) cannot arrive at an expected precision. For this reason, we introduce E-STAGN methodology, wherein the error indicator of each element is reassessed at every adaptive cycle through solving the whole system again. In this case, the QoI error is able to be convergent to an acceptable accuracy. Nevertheless, as the error is accumulated with time in the time-domain problem, E-STAGN method based on the energy-norm error estimation is unable to expose the source of the error so that it fails to offer an efficient refinement. This is the motivation to establish the G-STAGN technique, where the error estimation drives from our proposed first-order D ual W eight R esidual (DWR) method. G-STAGN strategy can detect the origin of QoI error, and hence it leads to a remarkably economical refinement. Numerical examples are carried out in both single-patch and multi-patch structures. It is demonstrated that both UM-STAGN and E-STAGN methods can catch the propagation of stress wave for the primal problem, while G-STAGN technique is capable to track the travel path of dual stress. Therefore, the G-STAGN strategy achieves an optimal convergent rate, compared to that obtained by UM-STAGN, E-STAGN and uniform space–time h h -refinement approaches.},

In this paper, l 1 l1 norm based dynamic analysis of flexible multibody system modeled with trimmed isogeometry is presented, in which, (1) the exact shape deformation of regular NURBS element after trimming is characterized by geometric transformation , (2) the l 1 l1 norm optimization is employed to select the predominant modal shapes for accurate dynamic analysis under rapidly changed loads, and (3) motion equations are sampled by considering the acceleration of control variables influence on control variables variation to obtain stable dynamic results. Finally, the presented approach is validated with three examples. The dynamic response results show that the trimmed isogeometric analysis can be employed to achieve considerable accuracy. As the continuity between NURBS elements increases from C 0 to C 1 , the degree of freedom is reduced by 75%, and the computational time of l 1 l1 norm based dynamic analysis is about 35% of the full order modal shapes method. Furthermore, the proposed sampling method can be utilized to reduce the 33% sampling number compared with the Latin Hypercube sampling method.},

Additionally, a novel investigation of the contributions of the two distinctive terms of the VE matrix, the consistency and stabilization terms, in the context of mesh adaptivity is performed.

  abstract     = {We propose a novel, time adaptive, strongly-coupled partitioned method for the interaction between a viscous, incompressible fluid and a thin elastic structure . The time integration is based on the refactorized Cauchy’s one-legged ‘ θ − θ− like’ method, which consists of a backward Euler method using a θ τ n θτn -time step and a forward Euler method using a ( 1 − θ ) τ n (1−θ)τn -time step. The bulk of the computation is done by the backward Euler method, as the forward Euler step is equivalent to (and implemented as) a linear extrapolation . The variable τ n τn -time step integration scheme is combined with the partitioned, kinematically coupled β − β− scheme, used to decouple the fluid and structure sub-problems. In the backward Euler step, the two sub-problems are solved in a partitioned sequential manner, and iterated until convergence. Then, the fluid and structure sub-problems are post-processed/extrapolated in the forward Euler step, and finally the τ n τn -time step is adapted. The refactorized Cauchy’s one-legged ‘ θ − θ− like’ method used in the development of the proposed method is equivalent to the midpoint rule when θ = 1 2 θ=12 , in which case the method is non-dissipative and second-order accurate. We prove that the sub-iterative process of our algorithm is linearly convergent, and that the method is unconditionally stable when θ ≥ 1 2 θ≥12 . The numerical examples explore the properties of the method when both fixed and variable time steps are used, and in both cases shown an excellent agreement with the reference solution.},

In this paper, the method is extended to homogenization towards a micromorphic continuum. It allows us to capture the deformation of composites with soft inclusions in the absence of scale separation and the size effects therein. Besides the displacement field, additional morphic fields are employed at the macroscale to characterize the micro-scale heterogeneity. Compared with the classical FE 2 2 approach, the only effort in the development of the Direct FE 2 2 is to formulate the macro–micro transition as kinematic constraints between the macro and micro DOFs, that are implemented through multi-point constraints (MPC) in Abaqus®. Automatically, the MPCs enable the micro–macro transition in an energetically consistent way and correlate the microscopic traction back to the macroscopic nodal internal force. The performance of the novel Direct FE 2 2 modeling is benchmarked with three representative numerical simulations, where a better predictive capability than the classical one is demonstrated in situations without a clear separation of scales.},

A hypo-elastic–plastic corotational formulation is chosen, where the tensors are contracted in a way that naturally degenerate to the rigid plastic formulation. The consistent algorithmic tangent modulus is derived, and a fast and very stable open-source implicit implementation into a finite element software is explained and demonstrated for simulations of the necking of a single crystal and for deformation of a polycrystalline representative volume element .

  abstract     = {In topology optimization , the state of structures is typically obtained by numerically evaluating a discretized PDE-based model. The degrees of freedom of such a model can be partitioned in free and prescribed sets to define the boundary conditions. A multi-partition problem involves multiple partitions of the same discretization , typically corresponding to different loading scenarios. As a result, solving multi-partition problems involves multiple factorization/preconditionings of the system matrix , requiring a high computational effort . In this paper, a novel method is proposed to efficiently calculate the responses and accompanying design sensitivities in such multi-partition problems using static condensation for use in gradient-based topology optimization. A main problem class that benefits from the proposed method is the topology optimization of small-displacement multi-input–multi-output compliant mechanisms . However, the method is applicable to any linear problem. We present its formulation and an algorithmic complexity analysis to estimate computational advantages for both direct and iterative solution methods to solve the system of equations, verified by numerical experiments. It is demonstrated that substantial gains are achievable for large-scale multi-partition problems. This is especially true for problems with both a small set of number of degrees of freedom that fully describes the performance of the structure and with large similarities between the different partitions. A major contribution to the gain is the lack of large adjoint analyses required to obtain the sensitivities of the performance measure .},

In this work, a concurrent three-scale scheme FE-SCA 2 is proposed for predicting the macroscopic nonlinear behavior of braided composites associated with the microscopic plastic and damage of the constituents, where FE and SCA are short for finite element method and self-consistent clustering analysis, respectively. In this concurrent scheme, the macroscale behavior of the braided composites is handled by FE analysis, and the microscale and mesoscale behavior of the constituents are handled by SCA simultaneously with the data-driven clustering discretization . To demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed scheme, we first predict the asymmetric anisotropic yield and failure surfaces for braided composites and then analyze the nonlinear behavior of a braided composite plate under bending. The computational results are compared with FE method results and experimental data from the literature, with good agreement in cases where such data is available. It is shown that the microscale, mesoscale, and macroscale nonlinear behavior of braided composites can be captured simultaneously using the proposed FE-SCA 2 , which would be difficult to be characterized by experimental methods. The proposed multiscale method could be applied for composite structures with various properties of micro-structures and constituents to expedite the design and structural optimization.},

Specifically, our method permits to create a reduced-order model (ROM), written as a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) wherein the forcing term, given by the right-hand side, consists of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), that possibly depends on a set of parameters associated with the electromechanical model to be surrogated. This method is non-intrusive, as it only requires a collection of pressure and volume transients obtained from the full-order model (FOM) of cardiac electromechanics. Once trained, the ANN-based ROM can be coupled with hemodynamic models for the blood circulation external to the heart, in the same manner as the original electromechanical model, but at a dramatically lower computational cost. Indeed, our method allows for real-time numerical simulations of the cardiac function. Our results show that the ANN-based ROM is accurate with respect to the FOM (relative error between 10−3 and 10−2 for biomarkers of clinical interest), while requiring very small training datasets (30–40 samples). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two relevant contexts in cardiac modeling. First, we employ the ANN-based ROM to perform a global sensitivity analysis on both the electromechanical and hemodynamic models. Second, we perform a Bayesian estimation of two parameters starting from noisy measurements of two scalar outputs. In both these cases, replacing the FOM of cardiac electromechanics with the ANN-based ROM makes it possible to perform in a few hours of computational time all the numerical simulations that would be otherwise unaffordable, because of their overwhelming computational cost, if carried out with the FOM. As a matter of fact, our ANN-based ROM is able to speedup the numerical simulations by more than three orders of magnitude.},

We tested gPINNs extensively and demonstrated the effectiveness of gPINNs in both forward and inverse PDE problems. Our numerical results show that gPINN performs better than PINN with fewer training points. Furthermore, we combined gPINN with the method of residual-based adaptive refinement (RAR), a method for improving the distribution of training points adaptively during training, to further improve the performance of gPINN, especially in PDEs with solutions that have steep gradients.},

A series of high-order spatial reconstruction procedures using unequal-sized stencils and a time discretization method with the natural continuous extension (NCE) of the Runge–Kutta method are applied to design this scheme. By gradually deteriorating from the fifth-order to the third-order, and eventually to the first-order in non-smooth areas, this new MRC-WENO method may preserve the original fifth-order accuracy in smooth regions while maintaining sharp shock transitions without solving any local Riemann problems on staggered meshes. Unlike many traditional central WENO schemes which employ many equal-sized stencils on staggered meshes, the new MRC-WENO scheme employs smaller unequal-sized stencils, easily makes the choice of the stencils, and uses arbitrary positive linear weights provided their summation is one. This is the first time that only three unequal-sized hierarchical central spatial stencils are used in multi-dimensional spatial reconstruction procedures on staggered meshes. This MRC-WENO scheme is simple to construct and can be easily implemented to arbitrary high-order accuracy in higher dimensions . And it is suitable for large scale engineering applications . Some benchmark one-dimensional and two-dimensional viscous examples are supplied to demonstrate the good performance of this new finite volume MRC-WENO scheme on staggered meshes.},

We derive the contact pressure from a smooth barrier energy function that is designed to satisfy the non-penetration constraint. Likewise, we make use of a smoothed friction law in which the stick–slip transition is described by a continuous function of the slip displacement. We discretize the formulation using the extended finite element method to embed interfaces inside elements, and devise an averaged surface integration scheme that effectively provides stable solutions without traction oscillations. Subsequently, we develop a way to tailor the parameters of the barrier method to embedded interfaces, such that the method can be used without parameter tuning. We verify and investigate the proposed method through numerical examples with varied levels of complexity. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method is remarkably robust for challenging frictional contact problems, while requiring low cost comparable to that of the penalty method.},

  abstract     = {We propose and analyze a class of temporal up to fourth-order unconditionally structure-preserving single-step methods for Allen–Cahn-type semilinear parabolic equations . We first revisit some up to second-order exponential time different Runge–Kutta (ETDRK) schemes, and provide unified proofs for the unconditionally maximum-principle-preserving and mass-conserving properties. Noting that the stabilized ETDRK schemes belong to a special class of parametric Runge–Kutta schemes, we introduce the stabilized integrating factor Runge–Kutta (sIFRK) formulation to construct new high-order parametric single-step methods, and propose two strategies to eliminate the exponential effects of sIFRK: (1) a recursive approximation ; (2) a combination of exponential and linear functions. Together with the nonnegativity of coefficients and non-decreasing of abscissas, the resulting two families of improved stabilized integrating factor Runge–Kutta (isIFRK) schemes can unconditionally preserve the maximum-principle and conserve the mass. The order conditions, linear stability and convergence in the l ∞ l∞ -norm are analyzed rigorously. We demonstrate that the proposed framework, which is explicit and free of limiters or cut-off post-processing, offers a simple, practical, and effective approach to developing high-order unconditionally structure-preserving algorithms. Comparisons with traditional schemes demonstrate the necessity of developing high-order unconditionally structure-preserving schemes. A series of numerical experiments verify theoretical results of proposed isIFRK schemes.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new stochastic method by integrating spline dimensional decomposition (SDD) of a high-dimensional random function and isogeometric analysis (IGA) on arbitrary multipatch geometries to solve stochastic boundary-value problems from linear elasticity. The method, referred to as SDD-mIGA, involves (1) analysis-suitable T-splines with significant approximating power for geometrical modeling, random field discretization, and stress analysis; (2) Bézier extraction operator for isogeometric mesh refinement; and (3) a novel Fourier-like expansion of a high-dimensional output function in terms of measure-consistent orthonormalized splines. The proposed method can handle arbitrary multipatch domains in IGA and uses standard least-squares regression to efficiently estimate the SDD expansion coefficients for uncertainty quantification applications. Analytical formulae have been derived to calculate the second-moment properties of an SDD-mIGA approximation for a general output random variable of interest. Numerical results, including those obtained for a 54-dimensional, industrial-scale problem, demonstrate that a low-order SDD-mIGA is capable of efficiently delivering accurate probabilistic solutions when compared with the benchmark results from crude Monte Carlo simulation.},

Accurate modeling of their microstructures and fast generation of the finite element meshes play a vital role in investigating many micromechanical phenomena and improving understanding of the underlying failure mechanisms. Due to the exceedingly intricate multiscale internal structures that they possess, the modeling and meshing of their microstructures still remain difficult in general. In this work, we present a computational framework and methodology for the representation, simulation, and mesh generation of 3D stochastic microstructures of particulate composites. Towards this goal, we propose a multi-level multiscale scheme that allows for capturing the multiscale structures of particulate composite materials at both the coarse and fine scales. A briging scale approach based on heat kernel smoothing is also presented to seamlessly link the coarse and fine scales. In addition to the microstructural modeling of particulate composite materials, we also develop an adaptive curvature-based surface and volume mesh generation algorithm for particulate composite microstructures with complex surface texture. Following the implementation of the morphology and mesh generation algorithm, a series of numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the capability and potential of the proposed method.},

In this method, the fluid domain is discretized by an improved incompressible material point method (iMPM) using both Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions , while the solid domain is solved by finite element method (FEM). The interaction between the iMPM and FEM is handled by a sharp immersed interface approach. Moreover, weighted tracing points are designed to track the fluid–structure interface with a low time complexity; a particle rearranging method is developed to eliminate the numerical cavities, which are non-physical voids caused by the highly disordered particle distribution, from which the original iMPM for FSI problems suffers. Various free surface FSI problems are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method. The computational results are compared with analytical, experimental, and simulation data from the literature, with good agreement in cases where such data is available.

The transition region between the micro and macroscale is represented by a smooth blending function . To address the issues with ill-conditioning of the multiscale system matrix due to the arbitrary intersections in cut elements and the transition region, we add stabilization terms acting on the jumps of the normal gradient (ghost-penalty stabilization). We show that our multiscale framework is stable and is capable to reproduce mechanical responses for heterogeneous structures in a mesh-independent manner.

  abstract     = {This paper presents the first unified finite element strategy for coupled hydro-mechanical (HM) analysis of fractured porous media where cracks arbitrarily intersect standard finite elements. This strategy is built by employing a discrete strong discontinuity approach and a coupling finite elements framework for the mechanical displacement and fluid pressure fields, respectively. The unified nature of the formulation means that both fracture network and bulk do not need to conform while relying only on standard finite element shape functions. The crack framework is directly embedded in the standard finite elements in both mechanical and fluid field approximations by applying two simple coupling statements. These establish the transmission of displacements due to crack openings accounted by shear and normal stiffness, as well as the internal compatibility of the longitudinal pressure field within the crack network and bulk. Uniquely, the coupling techniques presented here do not require additional degrees of freedom. In addition, the traction at discontinuities and its interaction with the fluid pressure within the discontinuity have a direct physical meaning, and are automatically accounted for in the coupled HM model. Since only standard shape functions are used, the implementation remains simple despite the complexity of the problem being simulated, and no special integration procedures within split domains are required. This is a novelty that contrasts with many existing formulations based on the partition of the unity method and non-matching meshes. Five numerical verification examples are used to assess the performance of the proposed method against existing reference solutions. A good agreement is found between the proposed method and reference solutions.},

At the initial moment, particles of arbitrary shapes constructed by spheres, superquadric equations, spherical harmonic functions, and polyhedral models were discretized using spatial level set functions, and complex structures were discretized into a series of triangular elements. Hence, the contact problem between arbitrarily shaped particles and complex structures was solved using the proposed contact algorithm between level set functions and triangular elements. Meanwhile, particle–particle contact points in mixed granular systems containing multiple non-spherical DEM models were calculated using the level set method . To examine the conservation, accuracy, and robustness of the proposed model, four sets of tests were performed and compared with the theoretical and experimental results, including a plane impacted by a single particle, the elastic collision between two particles, the accumulation of multiple particles, and the mixed granular flow in complex structures. The corresponding numerical results are in good agreement with the theoretical and experimental results, verifying that the present DEM model can accurately predict the motion characteristics of different non-spherical DEM models and can be widely applied to mixed granular flows involving multiple DEM models in complex structures.},

  abstract     = {Prediction of complex fluid flows from sparse and noisy sensor measurements is widely applied to many engineering fields. In the present study, a novel compressed sensing reduced-order modeling framework has been proposed to predict unsteady flow fields from sparse and noisy sensor observations, which includes offline learning and online forecasting. In the offline learning stage, the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model is used for modeling the dynamic evolution of the sensor signals. Moreover, the sparsity-promoting Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) algorithm is applied to extract spatio-temporal coherent structures from high-dimensional fluid dynamic system and choose optimal DMD modes for flow reconstruction. In order to establish the correlation between sensor space and feature-based coherent structures space, the Deep Neural Network (DNN) is employed. In the online forecasting stage, the trained framework is applied to predict the flow fields from limited sensor measurements in the actual experiment setup. In the current work, the proposed framework is applied in two numerical examples, including the flow past a circle cylinder at R e = 100 Re=100 characterized by laminar flow and at R e = 3900 Re=3900 characterized by turbulent flow. It is shown that the proposed framework performs accurately and robustly in both prediction of sensor measurements and unsteady flow fields. Especially, the important physical features and quantities can be well maintained for both laminar and turbulent flow, even if high level noise is involved. Therefore, the proposed framework is a promising tool for sparse representation from complex flow fields in realistic experiments.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose a novel framework coupling state-of-the-art multi-fidelity Gaussian Process modeling techniques with input-space warping for a cost-efficient construction of a stochastic surrogate model. During model generation, we achieve high computational efficiency by combining a large number of cheap estimates (low-fidelity model) with only a few, computationally expensive, high-fidelity measurements. We base the fidelity hierarchy on coarse-grid approximations of high-fidelity numerical simulations and show its successful application within the proposed framework. Utilizing coarse-grid approximations for multi-fidelity modeling is attractive for many practical applications, since it often allows for multi-fidelity data generation with a single simulator. As benchmark, we apply this framework to generate a surrogate model for crystal growth velocities in directional dendritic solidification. The derivation of a relation between this tip velocity and process parameters, such as undercooling, thermal diffusivity, capillarity, and capillary anisotropy, has been in the focus of research for decades due to its important role on microstructure evolution during solidification. It defines the thermo-mechanical properties of the solidified part and influences its behavior in subsequent manufacturing steps. As data generator, we use the open-source simulation framework ALPACA, applying a conservative sharp-interface level-set model. We assess the accuracy of the multi-fidelity tip velocity model by using cross-validation techniques. Compared to single-fidelity models purely based on high-fidelity data, our approach improves prediction accuracy significantly but only requires a little cost overhead for data generation. The stochastic nature of the resulting surrogate model allows for quantifying the uncertainty associated with predictions. This motivates the application of the model in Bayesian-optimization algorithms for inverse problems. Also, it may serve as input for microstructure simulations which rely on accurate relations between local solidification velocities and process parameters such as undercooling to predict grain-scale crystalline structures and which need material-dependent model calibration.},

The anisotropic phase-field approach is further adopted to describe the interface interaction associated with a crack. The phase-field equations are solved using the isogeometric-meshfree collocation approach to achieve high computational efficiency.

  abstract     = {Recently, physics informed neural networks have successfully been applied to a broad variety of problems in applied mathematics and engineering. The principle idea is the usage of a neural network as a global ansatz function for partial differential equations . Due to the global approximation , physics informed neural networks have difficulties in displaying localized effects and strong nonlinear solution fields by optimization. In this work we consider nonlinear stress and displacement fields invoked by material inhomogeneities with sharp phase interfaces. This constitutes a challenging problem for a method relying on a global ansatz. To overcome convergence issues, adaptive training strategies and domain decomposition are studied. It is shown, that the domain decomposition approach is capable to accurately resolve nonlinear stress, displacement and energy fields in heterogeneous microstructures obtained from real-world μ μ CT-scans.},

  abstract     = {An adaptive peridynamics material point method (APDMPM) is proposed for modeling dynamic fracture problems to fully take advantage of both the peridynamics (PD) and material point method (MPM). The PD is used to model the crack region of a continuum, while the MPM is used to model the remaining regions of the continuum. A hand-shake region is employed to transfer the interaction between the PD and MPM particles. The simulation region is initially discretized by MPM particles, which will be adaptively converted to PD particles based on their stress condition or connect relation to make the PD sub-region fit the damage area automatically. Several numerical examples , including spallation of Hopkinson bar , plate with a pre-existing crack and plate with a circular cutout under velocity boundary conditions, are studied to verify the proposed method. The numerical results show that the APDMPM can successfully predict the initiation and propagation of cracks without explicitly tracking crack surface, meanwhile improve the calculation efficiency and accuracy of the rest of the region.},

In practice, the buckling load and its deviation from theoretical prediction is often handled through the development of knock-down factors in shell structure design. Uncertainty-informed analysis based design is an alternative path that has been aggressively pursued in recent years. In this study, we use a novel representation of the stochastically imperfect shell geometry to investigate the buckling behavior of imperfect cylindrical shells . The representations rest on a non-Gaussian random field model , obtained by translating a latent Gaussian field defined as the solution to a stochastic partial differential equation and allows for the construction of topology-aware spatially correlated imperfections on nonconvex domains. We perform finite element analysis of buckling for imperfect shells and gain new insights into how the interplay between random imperfections and topological features influences buckling behavior.},

  abstract     = {Neural operators can learn nonlinear mappings between function spaces and offer a new simulation paradigm for real-time prediction of complex dynamics for realistic diverse applications as well as for system identification in science and engineering. Herein, we investigate the performance of two neural operators, which have shown promising results so far, and we develop new practical extensions that will make them more accurate and robust and importantly more suitable for industrial-complexity applications. The first neural operator, DeepONet , was published in 2019 (Lu et al., 2019), and its original architecture was based on the universal approximation theorem of Chen &amp; Chen (1995). The second one, named Fourier Neural Operator or FNO , was published in 2020 (Li et al., 2020), and it is based on parameterizing the integral kernel in the Fourier space. DeepONet is represented by a summation of products of neural networks (NNs), corresponding to the branch NN for the input function and the trunk NN for the output function; both NNs are general architectures, e.g., the branch NN can be replaced with a CNN or a ResNet. According to Kovachki et al. (2021), FNO in its continuous form can be viewed conceptually as a DeepONet with a specific architecture of the branch NN and a trunk NN represented by a trigonometric basis. In order to compare FNO with DeepONet computationally for realistic setups, we develop several extensions of FNO that can deal with complex geometric domains as well as mappings where the input and output function spaces are of different dimensions. We also develop an extended DeepONet with special features that provide inductive bias and accelerate training, and we present a faster implementation of DeepONet with cost comparable to the computational cost of FNO, which is based on the Fast Fourier Transform. We consider 16 different benchmarks to demonstrate the relative performance of the two neural operators, including instability wave analysis in hypersonic boundary layers, prediction of the vorticity field of a flapping airfoil, porous media simulations in complex-geometry domains, etc. We follow the guiding principles of FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) for scientific data management and stewardship. The performance of DeepONet and FNO is comparable for relatively simple settings, but for complex geometries the performance of FNO deteriorates greatly. We also compare theoretically the two neural operators and obtain similar error estimates for DeepONet and FNO under the same regularity assumptions.},

  abstract     = {Stability is a fundamental feature of a time integration method in long simulations of elastic bodies in large deformations . It is well known that energy conservation is the key to achieve it. The implicit one-step conserving method of Simo and Tarnow is simple and effective for quadratic strain measures. However, the issue of unconditional stability does not yet have a definitive solution for general nonlinear strain measures and multi-body couplings. This article shows how to reach this goal by a simple modification of the Simo and Tarnow method. In practice, the mean internal force vector of the time step is evaluated using the average value of the stress at the end-points and an integral mean of the strain–displacement tangent operator over the step computed by time integration points. Compared to other proposals, the approach conserves energy for any structural model regardless of its spatial finite element discretization and does not require Lagrange multipliers , discrete derivatives, approximations of the strain–displacement law or special iterative solutions. Long term stability is proved using dynamic analyses of Reissner beams and Kirchhoff–Love shells, discretized spatially with Lagrangian and isogeometric elements respectively. Moreover, the proposed energy-conserving scheme is extended to multi-body analyses with nonlinear couplings by means of a penalty formulation, with focus on the rotational continuity for generic multi-patch Kirchhoff–Love shells.},

  abstract     = {In predicting failure of a material, small scale material properties are critical, and yet small scale random heterogeneities are difficult to characterize accurately and efficiently. In building fracture models, work has focused on statistical characterization of local random microstructure at small to intermediate scales (termed micro- or mesoscale). Many materials can be characterized as effectively isotropic and homogeneous at a large scale. In contrast, at a micro- or mesoscale, Statistical Volume Elements (SVE) often show significant anisotropy and heterogeneity. Characterizing the properties of SVE presents challenges because modeling choices, such as the length scale, boundary conditions applied, and boundary shape chosen, may introduce modeling bias. Modeling bias must be separated from the actual prediction of anisotropic and heterogeneous characteristics at the SVE level, in order to provide an accurate basis for fracture simulation. Much literature has been devoted to characterizing the size of an RVE in order to effectively homogenize a material, however, there is less study of the effective isotropic limit. The representative size may be different when approaching the homogeneous limit or the isotropic limit. In this work, elastic and strength properties will be evaluated at multiple scales using SVE with square and circular (so-called “regular”) geometry. A Voronoi tessellation based geometry, where aggregation of Voronoi cells is achieved using square or circular grids, is studied and compared with regular partitioning methods. Models will be tested on two types of microstructures, one that is isotropic at the macroscale, and one which contains a slight directional bias. Results for different SVE geometries will be compared to demonstrate how SVE modeling choices affect the characterization of anisotropy and heterogeneity at the micro- and mesoscale.},

  abstract     = {Isogeometric analysis (IGA) was introduced to integrate methods for analysis and computer-aided design (CAD) into a unified process. High-quality parameterization of a physical domain plays a crucial role in IGA. However, obtaining high-quality parameterizations for complex geometries retains a challenge. Triangle configuration based bivariate simplex splines (TCB-splines) and their rational extensions provide an attractive alternative to classical nonuniform rational B-splines (NURBS) in the context of IGA, as they not only share many desired properties with NURBS but also can be defined over general polygonal domains. In this work, using TCB-splines in IGA is suggested to overcome the limits posed by the tensor-product structure of NURBS. We present the methodology for IGA to use rational TCB-splines over general polygonal domains. Then a method to generate the parametric domain according to given physical domain boundaries is proposed. This allows us to obtain a high-quality parameterization easily without resorting to the optimization method. Several numerical examples with complex physical domains demonstrate the flexibility of our TCB-spline-based IGA method, the high quality of the parameterization, and the accuracy of the numerical solutions.},

  abstract     = {A mechanistically informed data-driven approach is proposed to simulate the complex plastic behavior of microstructured/homogenized solids subjected to cyclic loading, especially to simulate the Masing effect. Our proposed approach avoids the complicated mathematical construction of an appropriate yield surface, and does not require a large amount of data for training, by virtue of its mechanistic character, which couples the methods and tools of data science to the principles of mechanics. Specifically, a data-processing method is herein advanced to extract specific internal variables that characterize cyclic plastic behavior, which cannot be measured directly via physical experiments. A yield surface, represented by an artificial neural network (ANN), is then trained by stress–strain data and the extracted internal variables. Finally, the ANN is integrated into a finite element computational framework to solve different boundary value problems (BVPs). Results for demonstrative examples are presented, which illustrate the effectiveness and the reliability of the proposed approach for solids containing voids and particles in their microstructure. Compared with direct numerical simulation (DNS), our approach seems to predict the average levels of stress and plastic strain under cyclic loading more efficiently, as well as the regions of strain localization . In addition, results for a homogenized three-dimensional truss structure demonstrate that our approach can accurately describe the evolution of key internal variables. Our mechanistic approach requires much less data than the general pure data-driven methods, which shows a possible computational efficiency compared with the pure data-driven approach. Limitations of our proposed approach are also discussed.},

To elucidate this, the effect of autoencoder architecture on its associated ROM is studied through the comparison of deep CAEs against two alternatives: a simple fully connected autoencoder, and a novel graph convolutional autoencoder. Through benchmark experiments, it is shown that the superior autoencoder architecture for a given ROM application is highly dependent on the size of the latent space and the structure of the snapshot data, with the proposed architecture demonstrating benefits on data with irregular connectivity when the latent space is sufficiently large.},

  abstract     = {Variable density incompressible flows are governed by parabolic equations . The artificial compressibility method makes these equations hyperbolic-type, which means that they can be solved using techniques developed for compressible flows , such as Godunov-type schemes. While the artificial compressibility method is well-established, its application to variable density flows has been largely neglected in the literature. This paper harnesses recent advances in the wider field by applying a more robust Riemann solver and a more easily parallelisable time discretisation to the variable density equations than previously. We also develop a new method for calculating the pressure gradient as part of the second-order reconstruction step. Based on a rearrangement of the momentum equation and an exploitation of the other gradients and source terms , the new pressure gradient calculation automatically captures the pressure gradient discontinuity at the free surface . Benchmark tests demonstrate the improvements gained by this robust Riemann solver and new pressure gradient calculation .},

  abstract     = {This article is an attempt at offering a new perspective for the mechanics of solids using Cartan’s moving frames, specifically discussing a mixed variational principle in non-linear elasticity. We treat quantities defined on the co-tangent bundles of reference and deformed configurations as primary unknowns along with deformation. Such a treatment invites compatibility of the fields (defined on the co-tangent bundle) with the base-space (configurations of the solid body) so that the configuration can be realized as a subset of the Euclidean space . Using the moving frame, we rewrite the metric and connection through differential forms. These quantities are further utilized to write the deformation gradient and Cauchy–Green deformation tensor in terms of frame and co-frame fields. The geometric understanding of stress as a co-vector valued 2-form fits squarely within our overall program. We also show that, for a hyperelastic solid, an equation similar to the Doyle–Ericksen formula may be written for the co-vector part of the stress 2-form. Using this kinetic and kinematic understanding, we rewrite a mixed functional in terms of differential forms, whose extremum leads to the compatibility of deformation, constitutive relations, and equations of equilibrium. Finite element exterior calculus is then utilized to construct a finite-dimensional approximation for the differential forms appearing in the variational principle . These approximations are then used to construct a discrete functional which can be numerically extremized. The discretization leads to a mixed model as it involves independent approximations of differential forms related to stress and deformation gradient. The mixed variational principle is then specialized for the 2D case, whose discrete approximation is applied to problems in nonlinear elasticity. From the numerical study , it is found that the present discretization does not suffer from locking and related convergence issues.},

This feature effectively improves the structural robustness in supporting impact waves or defending the failure extensions. Imitate the achievements from bio-inspired laminating, shell is laminated in a coat-base structure and assigned as orthotropic with optimal orientation. Without introducing any new variables, the interpolation model extended from the two-step filter and the multi-gradient topology optimization process precisely defines the location of candidate materials. Besides, another smoothing and projection in the Gradient Norm after the two-step filtration is applied to eliminate the interference of adjacent boundary. Four typical materials are introduced in each layer, and their orientations are optimized by the energy approach at the Base and the gradient approach at the border. We discusses two benchmark problems and an application case in result to demonstrate the effectiveness and orientation independence of the procedure. The optimized structures are evaluated compared to the single-coated result through stress and buckling analysis.

In the NPM, PINN is applied to globally approximate field variables , and the high-order Implicit Runge–Kutta (IRK) method is used to treat the time integration. The NPM can easily achieve incompressibility and deal with the free-surface problem. However, the NPM is currently limited to inviscid hydrodynamics problems and is computationally expensive. In this work, we developed a general NPM (gNPM) for viscous hydrodynamics modeling. In the gNPM, a single pressure is output as the predicted pressure field rather than the multiple pressures in the original NPM. Thus, the size of the neural network is greatly reduced, making the gNPM computationally more efficient. Besides, the spatial derivatives in the governing equations are calculated with respect to the current spatial coordinates rather than the predicted space. In this manner, the gNPM is more straightforward to be implemented. Furthermore, by considering the viscous term in the conservation of momentum, the gNPM can be applied for viscous hydrodynamics modeling. The effectiveness and robustness of the gNPM have been demonstrated through several hydrodynamics benchmark cases with different boundary conditions. We highlight that the proposed gNPM is able to cope with highly uneven particle distributions, while the traditional meshfree method can produce severe failure.},

While these methods have been widely applied, in this paper it is shown that the use of these non-symmetric matrices is incompatable with the conservation of energy in elastodynamics. First, the consistency between the continuous forms of the momentum equation and the energy equation is examined. It is shown that the conservation of linear momentum is equivalent to conservation of energy provided the solution is sufficiently smooth. The semi-discrete counterparts are then analyzed, where it is demonstrated that they are also equivalent, but only conditionally: the mass and stiffness matrices must be symmetric. As a result, employing a non-symmetric method in elastodynamics may artificially generate or dissipate energy. The fully discrete forms with Newmark time integration are then examined where it is shown that unconditionally unstable algorithms may arise. An energy-conserving time integration algorithm is then proposed which provides stability in the solutions of non-symmetric systems. The collocation and finite-volume methods are employed in numerical examples to demonstrate stability issues and the effectiveness of the proposed time integration methodology.},

This nonlinear problem is solved by Newton iteration and a set of efficient algorithms for the resolution of the arising inner linear systems is proposed.

  abstract     = {This study introduces a general approach for the imposition of local boundary conditions in non-ordinary state-based peridynamics (NOSB PD) to eliminate the displacement kinks near the boundary without a fictitious layer under quasi-static loading conditions. It identifies the underlying reason for the unphysical displacement kinks. Under an imposed linear displacement field, the NOSB PD equilibrium equation is not satisfied near the boundary due to the unsymmetric horizon of material points. However, the equilibrium equation derived by using the PD differential operator is satisfied at such material points. Therefore, the material body is divided into three regions to satisfy the equilibrium equations and to impose displacement and tractions boundary conditions. This approach does not deviate from the original NOSB PD; however, it provides a simple solution to eliminate the displacement kink near the boundary, which leads to unphysical stress concentrations. Its efficacy is demonstrated by considering elastic rectangular and square plates subjected to various types of boundary conditions leading to homogeneous as well as nonhomogeneous deformations. The creep response of a rectangular plate further proves the robustness of the present approach. Also, a quasi-static crack propagation from a pre-existing crack in a square plate under mode-I, mode-II and mixed-mode loading conditions demonstrates its capability for failure prediction based on the critical stretch criteria. Finally, its applicability for 3D analysis is demonstrated by considering a rectangular prism under applied stretch and normal stress.},

  abstract     = {The work explores the computational modeling of propagating shocks in hyperelastic materials to be considered in the context of numerical analysis and design of mechanical energy absorbing materials. The computational approach can be classified as shock-capturing , since it aims at capturing the effects of the shock formation and propagation on the mechanical response in the solid, as opposed to the shock-fitting approach, an alternative focusing on determining the exact shock wave-front position in the propagation domain. Numerical simulation of the onset and propagation of discontinuous strain waves ( mechanical shocks ) across a solid is performed in that specific approach, and it is computationally assessed in different loading situations. The concept of extrinsic dissipation , arisen by breaking some of the polyconvexity aspects in hyperelastic materials, is recalled and exemplified via a large strains neo-Hookean polyconvex hyperelastic model which is perturbed in a number of different formats. The obtained mechanical responses, exhibiting propagating mechanical shocks, and the corresponding extrinsic dissipation, are explored together with the inherited computational issues, by means of numerical examples selected as representative for the aimed purposes. In a second stage, the problem of the dynamic impact of a rigid solid on low-density shock-absorbing specimens made of these perturbed hyperelastic materials is analyzed, and the amount and time-evolution of the resulting extrinsic dissipation are evaluated to characterize their performance for shock-absorbing purposes. Also, the exhibited property of shape recovery after impact is highlighted as a distinctive feature in front of alternative shock-absorbing materials. In the work, the analysis and numerical modeling are made at the single (macroscopic) scale, but the objective of the research is to constitute the first exploration of a more general setting, to be developed in future works: the multiscale design of shock-absorbing metamaterials.},

The overall approach is composed of three main building blocks : target clusters selection criterion, adaptive cluster analysis, and computation of cluster interaction tensors. In addition, an adaptive clustering solution rewinding procedure and a dynamic adaptivity split factor strategy are suggested to further enhance the adaptive process. The ASCA method is shown to perform better than its static counterpart when capturing the multi-scale elasto-plastic behavior of a particle–matrix composite and predicting the associated fracture and toughness.

The algorithm controls the particle spatial distribution through an implicit minimization problem, related to the particle concentration gradient and therefore, to the particles’ anisotropy. This results in accurate particle distributions, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the IIPS algorithm is tested within a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) framework, with static and kinematic cases, by examining the particle distributions and the corresponding spatial accuracy. Further, the computational cost of the proposed methodology is reported and it is shown that it introduces minimal overhead.

  abstract     = {Inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs) are widely used in science and engineering. Although such problems are generally ill-posed, different regularisation approaches have been developed to ameliorate this problem. Among them is the Bayesian formulation, where a prior probability measure is placed on the quantity of interest. The resulting posterior probability measure is usually analytically intractable. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method has been the go-to method for sampling from those posterior measures. MCMC is computationally infeasible for large-scale problems that arise in engineering practice. Lately, Variational Bayes (VB) has been recognised as a more computationally tractable method for Bayesian inference , approximating a Bayesian posterior distribution with a simpler trial distribution by solving an optimisation problem . In this work, we argue, through an empirical assessment, that VB methods are a flexible and efficient alternative to MCMC for this class of problems. We propose a natural choice of a family of Gaussian trial distributions parametrised by precision matrices , thus taking advantage of the inherent sparsity of the inverse problem encoded in its finite element discretisation . We utilise stochastic optimisation to efficiently estimate the variational objective and assess not only the error in the solution mean but also the ability to quantify the uncertainty of the estimate. We test this on PDEs based on the Poisson equation in 1D and 2D. A Tensorflow implementation is made publicly available on GitHub.},

Here, we illustrate via 1D numerical examples the quadrature problems that may arise in these applications and propose several alternatives to overcome them, namely: Monte Carlo methods, adaptive integration, polynomial approximations of the Neural Network output, and the inclusion of regularization terms in the loss. We also discuss the advantages and limitations of each proposed numerical integration scheme. We advocate the use of Monte Carlo methods for high dimensions (above 3 or 4), and adaptive integration or polynomial approximations for low dimensions (3 or below). The use of regularization terms is a mathematically elegant alternative that is valid for any spatial dimension; however, it requires certain regularity assumptions on the solution and complex mathematical analysis when dealing with sophisticated Neural Networks.},

Also, a Neumann boundary condition needs to be accounted for. As the values of the design function are only known in discrete points, both of these problems require a numerical approximation . Previous approaches fail depending on the type of the used finite element mesh. In this contribution, we show how the Taylor series can be combined with the weighted least square method to obtain approximations for these problems when the values of the design function are given in arbitrary point clouds. We show simulation results for common benchmark problems for various types of meshes proving the mesh independence, versatility and reliability of the novel method.},

It is an important scientific and engineering subject to manipulate or control the trajectories of particles by the drag force in steady-state or transient fluids. The drag force varies with the material properties of fluid, and the velocity differences between fluid and particles cause the particles to move. Despite some research regarding the shape and topological optimization frameworks for particles in steady-state flow, the optimization of transient particle motion in transient laminar flow is still a difficult subject. Thus, this study presents a new topology optimization scheme that considers the transient motion of particles in transient laminar flow. Owing to the time variation in the direction and magnitude of the fluid, the optimization of particle motion requires a new development of the transient sensitivity analysis. For efficient optimization, a two-scale time integration scheme for the fluid and particle was developed. The developed coupled analysis and optimization framework were applied to determine optimal layouts for transient fluids and particles. Several optimization problems were formulated and solved to validate the present scheme.},

We realize the coupling between the patches using a symmetric interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (SIPG) approach. Previously, we have assumed that the interfaces between patches always consist of whole edges. In this paper, we drop this requirement and allow T-junctions. This extension is vital for the consideration of sliding interfaces, for example between the rotor and the stator of an electrical motor. One critical part for the handling of T-junctions in IETI-DP solvers is the choice of the primal degrees of freedom. We propose to add all basis functions that are non-zero at any of the vertices to the primal space. Since there are several such basis functions at any T-junction, we call this concept “fat vertices”. For this choice, we show a condition number bound that coincides with the bound for the conforming case.},

The method decomposes the magnetic materials into local sources, consisting of volume and surface elements. Then, the magnetic field from the local sources is computed with the magnetization and demagnetization tensors of the elements. The demagnetization tensors are derived as a closed-form according to the geometry of the elements, which can be further converted into multipoles based on the distance between an observation point and the elements for computational efficiency. Additionally, the MMDMP is applied to the FM and EM by analyzing the magnetization of both materials due to existing magnetic fields. Magnetic interactions among the materials are computed by the sum of the elemental forces, which are forces on the local sources. The computational accuracy and efficiency are verified by field distribution and the force and torque interaction between the PM and an iron-core EM in 3D space. The results are compared to numerical solutions from a finite element method (FEM) and fundamental integral form equations such as Biot–Savart law. Finally, the MMDMP is applied to analyze the magnetic field of a brushless direct current (BLDC) motor and validated by the FEM and experiments. The results show that the MMDMP can provide fast and accurate analysis of magnetic characteristics of electromechanical systems .},

Specially, in QBTO, the sensitivities only require to be calculated at the sample corresponding to the quantile instead of all MCS samples, which can drastically reduce the computational effort . Furthermore, a sequential update strategy of Kriging metamodel is developed to efficiently calculate the quantile by evaluating the true constraint at fewer samples, rather than all MCS samples.

Compared with the most frequently used optimizer, the method of moving asymptotes (MMA), the step-based subproblem adopted in the TRMA method shows better accuracy in approximating the response surface near the current iterative point. Also, a criterion to judge the quality of the trial step is introduced in the trust region scheme which is regarded as an adaptive process for automatically adjusting the expansion parameters of the moving asymptotes. The above features endow the TRMA method with inherent numerical robustness and efficiency. Three benchmark problems (including the compliance minimization problem and the stress constraint problem) are considered to investigate the performance of the TRMA method. Although those problems are well addressed by many other creative strategies, which always involve modification of the optimization formulations, few studies focus on the development of the algorithms directly. Hence, the inherent complexity of those formulations (like the high nonlinearity introduced by aggregation and the large-scale constraints when the aggregation-free formulation is adopted) is still a great difficulty for the existing optimizers. Results show that the TRMA method is a powerful optimizer for handling problems with high nonlinearity and large-scale constraints and may promote the exploration and application of the topology optimization methods, even when the traditional MMA becomes inefficient.},

Fluid and structure computational domains are separated by interfaces made of triangular elements whose position is updated during the simulation following the structural deformation. The coupling of the two media at the fluid–structure interfaces is handled by the introduction of solid and fluid boundary particles.

This is the same idea we utilized in Zou et al. (2021), but the rules therein produced negative weights for certain non-uniform meshes. The present work improves upon Zou et al. (2021) in that the weights are guaranteed to be positive for all meshes. The reduced Gauss quadrature rule is built element-wise according to the element basis degree and smoothness. The Gauss–Greville quadrature rule combines the proposed reduced Gauss quadrature and Greville quadrature Zou et al. (2021). Both quadrature rules involve many fewer quadrature points than the full Gauss quadrature rule and avoid negative quadrature weights for arbitrary knot vectors . The proposed quadrature rules are stable and accurate, and they can be constructed without solving nonlinear equations , therefore providing efficient and easy-to-use alternatives to full Gauss quadrature. Various numerical examples , including curved shells, demonstrate that they achieve good accuracy, and for p = 5 p=5 and 6 eliminate locking.},

  abstract     = {A multi-scale model which couples a macro-scale strain-gradient theory with a classical continuum at representative volume element (RVE) level is formulated in this contribution for quasi-static problems. It enables modelling the inelastic response of heterogeneous materials at finite strains incorporating their microstructural size and accounting for non-uniform macroscopic deformation fields within the RVE. The development of the multi-scale model is based on the Method of Multi-Scale Virtual Power from which equilibrium equations and homogenisation relations are derived, ensuring a variationally consistent scale transition. The kinematical constraints at the RVE level are enforced with the Lagrange multiplier method and particularised for direct, periodic and minimal conditions. It is shown that the homogenised stresses can be obtained exclusively from the Lagrange multipliers . The finite element solution of the micro and macro equilibrium problems is presented in detail together with the numerical implementation. An efficient strategy is devised to compute the consistent macroscopic tangents required for the FE 2 framework. The Newton–Raphson scheme is employed for the iterative solution of the corresponding non-linear system of equations at both scales. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the numerical strategy. A systematic analysis of the influence of the RVE length, the number and size of the micro-constituents, with different constitutive laws at the micro-scale and subjected to several macroscopic deformation states , is performed. The determination of an RVE that is both representative and descriptive of the macroscopic characteristic length is discussed. The accuracy of the numerical results is assessed against a reference direct numerical simulation .},

We synthesize the recent SAV idea, the ensemble timestepping and the energy stable open boundary conditions, and develop efficient ensemble algorithms that only require a single matrix assembly for all realizations and all time steps. Moreover, the proposed algorithms are unconditionally stable without any restricting assumptions on the variance of the viscosities or the time steps, and they always produce positive values for the auxiliary variables. The second order algorithm is numerically tested on three benchmark flow problems with open boundaries, and is shown to be both accurate and effective in preventing the backflow instabilities.},

  abstract     = {An anisotropic continuum-molecular model based on pair potentials for describing the linear static and dynamic behavior of periodic heterogeneous Cauchy materials is derived in the framework of peridynamic theory. Non-central pairwise actions are assumed as work-conjugates to specific pairwise deformation variables. A pairwise constitutive law, depending trigonometrically on the material fiber direction and preserving the elastic symmetries of the material, is properly defined. Based on this theoretical ground, a bond-based type continuum model with oriented material points, governed by six independent material micro-moduli, is obtained. Considering microstructured materials featuring periodic rigid massive blocks connected by soft elastic interfaces, the elastic potential functions of the continuum-molecular model are consistently identified in terms of geometrical and constitutive parameters of the microstructure. The identification is based on the formal analogy with the overall constitutive tensors of a homogeneous continuum obtained through continualization schemes and equivalent to the microstructured material. Consequently, the macroscopic elastic properties of the continuum-molecular model are described in terms of pairwise material properties, but its micro-moduli are also explicitly related to the specific properties of the linear elastic interfaces of the microstructured material. The accuracy of the proposed model in the static and dynamic response is successfully verified by comparison with high-fidelity finite element models of an auxetic tetrachiral block lattice considering different periodic cell orientations and elastic interface properties, as well as by comparison with analytical solutions for fully anisotropic elasticity.},

Existing approaches for constructing QSE shape functions are linear combinations of the pair-wise products of generalized barycentric coordinates with linear precision, restricted to the convex polygonal domain or resort to numerical optimization . We extend the construction to general polygons with no more than three collinear consecutive vertices. This is done by defining coefficients of the linear combination as the oriented area of triangles with vertices from the polygonal domain, which can be either convex or concave. The proposed shape functions possess linear to quadratic precision. We prove the interpolation error estimates for mean value coordinate-based QSE shape functions on convex and concave polygonal domains satisfying a set of geometric constraints for standard finite element analysis. We also tailor a polygonal mesh generation scheme that improves the uniformity and avoids short edges of Voronoi diagrams for their use in the QSE-based polygonal finite element computation . Numerical tests for the 2D Poisson equations on various domains are presented, demonstrating the optimal convergence rates in both the L 2 L2 -norm and the H 1 H1 -seminorm.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a local–global multiscale method for highly heterogeneous stochastic groundwater flow problems under the framework of reduced basis method and the generalized multiscale finite element method (GMsFEM). Due to incomplete characterization of the medium properties of the groundwater flow problems, random variables are used to parameterize the uncertainty. As a result, solving the problem repeatedly is required to obtain statistical quantities. Besides, the medium properties are usually highly heterogeneous, which will result in a large linear system that needs to be solved. Therefore, it is intrinsically inevitable to seek a computational-efficient model reduction method to overcome the difficulty. We will explore the combination of the reduced basis method and the GMsFEM. In particular, we will utilize residual-driven basis functions, which can provide highly accurate reduced order solution. This local–global multiscale method is more efficient than applying the GMsFEM or reduced basis method individually. We first construct parameter-independent multiscale basis functions that include both local and global information of the permeability fields, and then use these basis functions to construct several global snapshots and global basis functions for fast online computation with different parameter inputs. We provide rigorous analysis of the proposed method and extensive numerical examples to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the local–global multiscale method.},

Many methodologies that have recently been proposed are based on the pre-processing of the full-order solutions to accelerate the Kolmogorov N − N− width decay thereby obtaining smaller linear subspaces with improved accuracy. These methods however must rely on the knowledge of the characteristic speeds in phase space of the solution, limiting their range of applicability to problems with explicit functional form for the advection field. In this work we approach the problem of automatically detecting the correct pre-processing transformation in a statistical learning framework by implementing a deep-learning architecture. The purely data-driven method allowed us to generalise the existing approaches of linear subspace manipulation to non-linear hyperbolic problems with unknown advection fields. The proposed algorithm has been validated against simple test cases to benchmark its performances and later successfully applied to a multiphase simulation.},

The method is based on a novel tensor-product construction of B-Splines for the update of the basis functions in one direction of the parametric space . With basis functions “floating” deformation-dependently in this direction, mesh distortion is overcome for problems in which extreme deformations occur predominantly along the associated (possibly curved) physical axis. In doing so, we preserve the numerical advantages of splines over many meshless basis functions, while avoiding remeshing. We employ material point integration for numerical quadrature, thus attributing a Lagrangian character to our technique. The paper introduces the method and reviews the fundamental properties of the FLIGA basis functions, including a numerical patch test. The performance of FLIGA is then numerically investigated on the benchmark of Newtonian and viscoelastic Taylor–Couette flow. Finally, we simulate a viscoelastic extrusion-based additive manufacturing process , which served as the original motivation for the new approach.},

Taking as point of departure a Total Lagrangian setting and considering as referential configuration an intermediate configuration of the deformation process , the equation of conservation of linear momentum and three geometric conservation laws (for the deformation gradient , its cofactor and its determinant) are re-written leading to a very generic system of first order conservation laws . The key feature of the formulation is a suitable multiplicative decomposition of the conservation variables, leading to a very simple final set of equations with striking similarities to the conventional Total Lagrangian system albeit re-written in terms of alternative Referential Updated conservation variables which are evolved in time. Taking advantage of this new Updated Reference Lagrangian formalism, a second order entropy-stable SPH upwinding stabilisation method will be introduced. With respect to previous publications by the group, a new three-stage Runge–Kutta time integration method is implemented in order to increase the CFL stability restriction. Finally, and to demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the methodology, a wide spectrum of challenging problems will be presented and compared, including some benchmark three-dimensional large deformation elasto-plasticity problems. To facilitate its ease of implementation, the paper explores the use of a series of novel expressions for the evaluation of kernels and the gradients of kernels to provide the SPH user the freedom to choose amongst various options, all leading to equally convincingly robust results.},

  abstract     = {A primary challenge for isogeometric analysis (IGA)-suitable parameterization is to efficiently decompose a complex computational domain into a small number of high-quality IGA-suitable patches without internal singularities. Aiming at domains with arbitrary topology, we propose integrating frame field and polysquare structure, resulting in a structure associated with a frame field that is locally integrable everywhere, i.e. a closed differential form or closed-form. Such a structure is more general than a common polysquare but has no internal singularity as well, which makes it suitable for IGA because it usually has fewer undesired boundary corners and low distortion. Since IGA prefers a small number of patches in the parameterization structure, we further propose a patch simplification method with distortion control. A key challenge in simplification is to prevent the resulting patches from degenerating. Previous methods rely on a mesh of the domain to characterize the non-degenerate condition. In sharp contrast, our approach simply uses the boundary of the domain, which obviously improves efficiency because the number of variables is much lower. The patch degeneration issue in such a boundary-only strategy is addressed by solving a constrained optimization problem with a set of automatically constructed inequality constraints. We prove that such constraints are sufficient to make the common polysquare structure homeomorphic to the input shape. We also demonstrate that it prevents the patches from degenerating for the structure of closed-form polysquares, and it can be extendedly applied to 3D closed-form polycubes. Numerical experiments using bi-quadratic B-spline surfaces with C 1 C1 -constraints are also provided to justify the accuracy of applying the resulting planar parameterization for IGA application.},

The solution of the radiation or scattering problem can be found by solving a sparse linear system which is set from the dynamic stiffness matrices of several scaled layers around the radiating body.

  abstract     = {We present an energy-preserving mechanic formulation for dynamic quasi-brittle fracture in an Eulerian–Lagrangian formulation, where a second-order phase-field equation controls the damage evolution. The numerical formulation adapts in space and time to bound the errors, solving the mesh-bias issues these models typically suffer. The time-step adaptivity estimates the temporal truncation error of the partial differential equation that governs the solid equilibrium. The second-order generalized- α α time-marching scheme evolves the dynamic system. We estimate the temporal error by extrapolating a first-order approximation of the present time-step solution using previous ones with backward difference formulas; the estimate compares the extrapolation with the time-marching solution. We use an adaptive scheme built on a residual minimization formulation in space. We estimate the spatial error by enriching the discretization with elemental bubbles; then, we localize an error indicator norm to guide the mesh refinement as the fracture propagates. The combined space and time adaptivity allows us to use low-order linear elements in problems involving complex stress paths. We efficiently and robustly use low-order spatial discretizations while avoiding mesh bias in structured and unstructured meshes . We demonstrate the method’s efficiency with numerical experiments that feature dynamic crack branching, where the capacity of the adaptive space–time scheme is apparent. The adaptive method delivers accurate and reproducible crack paths on meshes with fewer elements.},

In this paper, we introduce a variational approach based on perturbed eigenvalue analysis that eliminates outlier frequencies without negatively affecting the accuracy in the remainder of the spectrum and modes. We then propose a pragmatic iterative procedure that estimates the perturbation parameters in such a way that the outlier frequencies are effectively reduced. We demonstrate that our approach allows for a much larger critical time-step size in explicit dynamics calculations.

  abstract     = {In this contribution we present a least-squares finite element formulation to model steady-state flow of incompressible, non-Newtonian fluids in three dimensions including data assimilation. The approach is based on the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations and the nonlinear viscosity is considered by means of the Carreau–Yasuda viscosity model, which can account for shear-thickening and shear-thinning behavior of generalized Newtonian fluids . We outline the procedure how to integrate given data into the numerical solution of flow problems without additional computational cost using the least-squares FEM. Assimilation of experimental data provides the opportunity to reduce model errors resulting in a solution which more closely approximates reality. Furthermore, the preprocessing of the available data using Kriging interpolation is also described briefly. The presented formulation is first validated by investigating the flow in a cube with an exact solution without data assimilation. Convergence is evaluated based on the error in velocities and pressure compared to the exact solution. Then the effect of data assimilation is shown by modeling blood flow through a carotid bifurcation model and integrating data either along lines or over entire cross-sectional areas. The improvement of the numerical solution by means of data assimilation is revealed by comparing the calculated velocity profiles with experimental and numerical reference values .},

  abstract     = {A general and fast convolution-based method (FCBM) for peridynamics (PD) is introduced. Expressing the PD integrals in terms of convolutions and computing them by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), the computational complexity of PD models drops from O( N 2 N2 ) to O( N log 2 N Nlog2N ), with N N being the number of discretization nodes. Initial neighbor identification and storing neighbor information is not required, and this means memory allocation scales with O( N N ) instead of O( N 2 N2 ), common for existing methods. FCBM is applicable to bounded domains with arbitrary shapes and boundary conditions via an “embedded constraint” (EC) approach. The formulation is shown for certain bond-based and state-based, linear and nonlinear, PD models of elasticity and dynamic brittle fracture , as applications. The method is verified on a 3D elastostatic problem and it is shown that the FCBM-PD reduces the computational time from days to hours and from years to days, compared with the original meshfree discretization for PD models. Large-scale computations of PD models are feasible with the new method, and its versatility is demonstrated by simulating, with ease, the difficult problem of cascading crack branching in a brittle plate.},

  abstract     = {The recently developed phase-field evolution within the Representative Crack Element framework has been demonstrated to yield physically reasonable crack kinematics, including crack opening, closing, shearing as well as mixing aforementioned deformations. The work at hand presents cohesive fracture by elaborating phase-field modeling within the Representative Crack Element approach. A traction–separation law is postulated in the crack surfaces of the Representative Crack Element, which phenomenologically leads to cohesive adhesion in the RCE description. According to a continuous interpretation of an intact material and a fully broken material by the phase-field degradation function, a realistic material status is obtained with respect to different loading states, i.e. an opening or a shearing crack leads to cohesive adhesion failure but closing crack only shows a physical material contact behavior. This methodological constitutive relation is based on a straightforward variational approach and is derived out of the virtual power principles from both the RCE and the continuous descriptions. The unknown crack deformations are consistently resolved by a minimization algorithm of the RCE virtual power. Implemented into the context of the Finite Element Method framework, several demonstrative numerical examples are investigated. Some meaningful findings are pointed out and potential perspectives are proposed to consequently close this paper.},

The integrated solver is validated and its performance is analysed through several cases. Considerable reductions of more than 65% in computational time are achieved when the hash table is adopted instead of the binary tree . Moreover, hash table offers more benefits to 3D cases with larger numbers of nodes.

However, it has not yet been extended to hydromechanical coupling . This study presents the development of a two-phase one-point stable NS-PFEM (SNS-PFEM) for solving large deformation hydromechanical coupled geotechnical problems. First, the soil–water coupling is achieved by the v–w formulation based on Biot’s mixture theory , which automatically ensures the consistency between water pressure and stress that the former should be interpolated one order lower than that of velocity. Secondly, the node-based strain smoothing method with linear strain fields over the smoothed domain on 3-node triangular elements is adopted and implemented to obtain a stable nodal integration. Thirdly, a novel efficient water pressure stabilisation scheme based on an inverse distance interpolation algorithm is implemented to cure spurious spatial water pressure oscillations. The performance of the hydromechanical SNS-PFEM is primarily validated by both static and dynamic 1D consolidation and 2D wave propagation, and then applied to analyse the progressive landslide and the Selborne cutting slope involving large deformation. All results demonstrate that the proposed method is powerful and easily extensible for analysing large deformation hydromechanical problems in geotechnical engineering .},

  abstract     = {The FE 2 method systematically translates macro kinematic constraints to the underlying (micro) RVEs and extracts the effective RVE responses to macro continuum in an energetically consistent manner. In the literature, many researchers have demonstrated the predictive capability of FE 2 across a wide range of problems. The conventional FE 2 2 numerical framework adopts a staggered solution strategy between the macro and micro analyses. This limits the adoption of FE 2 2 method by inexperienced researchers/ engineers to solve practical engineering problems using commercial FE software. To this end, a Direct FE 2 2 method has been proposed in Tan et al. (2020) and implemented in the commercial software ABAQUS, where macro kinematic constraints are applied directly on the RVEs superimposed on the macro elements. This results in a monolithic numerical framework, without the need to write any subroutines. Compared to the conventional FE 2 implementation using commercial software, the number of floating-point operations is also reduced because the nested FE calculations are condensed into one in Direct FE 2 (Raju et al., 2021). In this contribution focusing on thin plate structures, the Direct FE 2 method is extended based on Kirchhoff–Love thin plate kinematics and implemented in ABAQUS without the need for subroutines. The performance of the Direct FE 2 method for this higher order formulation is demonstrated by comparing against reference solutions from direct numerical simulations.

This new approach is based on the partition of unity finite element method , which defines the solution fields as weighted sums of local fields, supported by the different grids. Here, the discrete weak formulation of the problem is re-set in cG(1)cG(1) stabilized form, which has the dual benefit of lowering grid resolution requirements for convection dominated flows and allowing for the use of velocity and pressure discretizations which do not satisfy the inf–sup condition. Additionally, we provide an outline of our implementation within an existing distributed parallel application and identify four key options to improve the code efficiency namely: the use of cache to store mapped quadrature points and basis function gradients, the intersection volume splitting algorithm, the use of lower order quadrature schemes, and tuning the partition weight associated with the interface elements. The new method is shown to have comparable accuracy to the single mesh boundary-fitted version of the same stabilized solver based on three transient flow tests including both 2D and 3D settings, as well as low and moderate Reynolds number flow conditions . Moreover, we demonstrate how the four implementation options have a synergistic effect lowering the residual assembly time by an order of magnitude compared to a naive implementation , and showing good load balancing properties.},

The Navier–Stokes equations, in Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian framework, are used as the governing equations for the blood flow dynamics, the vessel wall mechanics is represented through an elastic constitutive law, and the fluid domain deformation problem is explicitly solved by exploiting the layered structure of the geometry discretization associated to the mid-fidelity model. The result is an approximation strategy able to take into account the wall deformation at nearly zero added cost when compared with a rigid wall model.

In this paper, we propose a new phase field scheme to explore the progressive failure mechanism of single and multiple stitches, leveraging the advantages of the phase field method for complex fractures without introducing additional failure criteria. We reconstruct the phase field driving force by considering both tensile and compressive components of strain energy in the phase field evolution to deal with multiple forms of damage simultaneously. The fracture energy is modified to distinguish mode-I and mode-II fracture toughness. The zero-thickness smeared interface model is derived from the original allocation with a thin interphase layer by asymptotic analysis , effectively approximating the coherent imperfect interface between sutures and polymer matrix . The feasibility of the developed phase field scheme is verified through benchmark examples and experiments. The stepped fracture process and strength of 3D stitched composites with various stitching patterns are examined and compared with each other to reveal the fracture laws and damage mechanism. This study implies that the failure of the stitching system is strongly associated with the structural symmetry, closure, and distribution of the hole positions. On this basis, a new stitching strategy is proposed with a 13% enhancement in tensile strength with identical stitching density, which can be further extended to optimize the bearing capacity of multilayer structures with more complex stitching patterns.},

  abstract     = {To exploit the advantageous properties of isogeometric analysis (IGA) in a scan-based setting, it is important to extract a smooth geometric domain from the scan data ( e.g. , voxel data). IGA-suitable domains can be constructed by convoluting the grayscale data using B-splines. A negative side-effect of this convolution technique is, however, that it can induce topological changes in the process of smoothing when features with a size similar to that of the voxels are encountered. This manuscript presents an enhanced B-spline-based segmentation procedure using a refinement strategy based on truncated hierarchical (TH)B-splines. A Fourier analysis is presented to explain the effectiveness of local grayscale function refinement in repairing topological anomalies. A moving-window-based topological anomaly detection algorithm is proposed to identify regions in which the grayscale function refinements must be performed. The criterion to identify topological anomalies is based on the Euler characteristic, giving it the capability to distinguish between topological and shape changes. The proposed topology-preserving THB-spline image segmentation strategy is studied using a range of test cases. These tests pertain to both the segmentation procedure itself, and its application in an immersed IGA setting.},

  abstract     = {A new time-domain probabilistic technique based on hierarchical Bayesian modeling (HBM) framework is proposed for calibration and uncertainty quantification of hysteretic type nonlinearities of dynamical systems. Specifically, probabilistic hyper models are introduced respectively for material hysteretic model parameters as well as prediction error variance parameters, aiming to consider both the uncertainty of the model parameters as well as the prediction error uncertainty due to unmodeled dynamics. A new asymptotic approximation is developed to simplify the process of nonlinear model updating and substantially reduce the computational burden of the HBM framework. This asymptotic approximation is further employed to provide insightful expressions on the hyper parameters for both the model and prediction error variance parameters. Given a large number of data points within a dataset, the hyper model parameters are formulated to be independent of the hyper parameters for prediction error variance parameter. Two numerical examples are conducted to verify the accuracy and performance of the proposed method considering Bouc–Wen (BW) hysteretic type nonlinearities. Model error is manifested as uncertainty due to variability in the measured data from multiple datasets. Results from a five-story numerical structure indicate that the model error is the main source of error that can affect the uncertainty in the model parameters due to the variability in the experimental data. It is also demonstrated that the parameter uncertainty due to the variability arising from model error depends on the sensor locations. It is shown that the proposed approach is robust for not only quantifying uncertainties of structural parameters and prediction error parameters, but also predicting the system quantities of interests (QoI) with reasonable accuracy and providing reliable uncertainty bounds, as opposed to the conventional Bayesian approach which often severely underestimates the uncertainty bounds.},

The model is an extension of finite difference type discretization of Kirchhoff–Love rod from Discrete Differential Geometry, with 4 unknowns, including translational displacements of the axis and the axial cross-sectional rotation. The orthogonality of the rod axis and cross-section is guaranteed by parallel transport in pseudotime. A newly defined unified discrete curvature with five weighting function schemes is presented. Three of them are proposed by reducing the max nonlinear term of the Taylor expansion of the rotation vector . Theory and numerical tests show that these three methods can increase the accuracy of the model compared to the traditional method. Scheme 5 performs the best out of the recommended schemes. A transformation of freedoms to the translational displacements and end rotations is introduced to the Discrete Differential Geometry model. By using this technique, rigid connections between rod segments, rotational boundaries and external ending moments can be realized conveniently and naturally. Important properties such as convergence, objectivity and insensitivity to the slenderness ratio are also verified and investigated with several suitable numerical examples . Furthermore, results show the use of discrete curvature has better performance for the stiff bar system with flexible connections than the continuous beam.},

  abstract     = {The generalized finite element method (GFEM) is versatile and powerful in the numerical analysis of various engineering problems. However, its application to large deformation analysis of elastoplastic solids is rare, especially in three dimensions (3D), since it suffers from singular system matrix and awkward implementation. This issue is caused by the extra degrees of freedom (DOFs) of GFEM. In this work, a nonlinear GFEM for large deformation analysis of elastic and elastoplastic solids in 3D is developed by using the extra-DOF-free enrichments proposed by Tian (2013) Updated Lagrangian (UL) formulation incorporating both geometric and material nonlinearities is employed and hyperelastic and hypoelastic–plastic constitutive models are considered. As a result of the elimination of the extra DOFs, implementation of the developed method is much more convenient than the standard GFEM and singular system matrix does not present. The capability of the proposed nonlinear GFEM in modeling three-dimensional large elastoplastic deformations is investigated by several typical examples. Numerical results demonstrate that, in comparison to the traditional finite element method , the proposed nonlinear GFEM is remarkably more accurate and stable. Particularly, in analysis of extreme deformations, the commercial software ABAQUS fails even when sophisticated elements are used, however the proposed nonlinear extra-DOF-free GFEM is still stable and converged results can be obtained.},

For the latter, a Darcy model is considered in a thin porous layer attached to a solid boundary in the limit of infinitesimal thickness. The resulting computational model is both mechanically consistent and simple to implement. The FSI coupling and the contact conditions are imposed weakly by means of a unified Nitsche approach. We analyse the approach in detailed numerical studies with both thick- and thin-walled solids, within a fully Eulerian and an immersed approach and using fitted and unfitted finite element discretisations .},

Typically, it is a tough non-linear problem often requiring several Newton iterations to converge and causing troubles also in the solution to the related linear systems. When contact is modeled with the aid of Lagrange multipliers, the impenetrability condition is enforced exactly, but the associated Jacobian matrix is indefinite and needs a special treatment for a fast numerical solution. In this work, a constraint preconditioner is proposed where the primal Schur complement is computed after augmenting the zero block. The name Reverse is used in contrast to the traditional approach where only the structural block undergoes an augmentation. Besides being able to address problems characterized by singular structural blocks, often arising in contact mechanics, it is shown that the proposed approach is significantly cheaper than traditional constraint preconditioning for this class of problems and it is suitable for an efficient HPC implementation through the Chronos parallel package. Our conclusions are supported by several numerical experiments on mid- and large-size problems from various applications.

Discretization of such geometries and solution of the contact problem on the internal interfaces can be computationally challenging. We employ an unfitted Finite Element (FE) framework for the discretization of the domains and develop a tailored, globally convergent, and efficient multigrid method for solving contact problems on the internal interfaces. In the unfitted FE methods, structured background meshes are used and only the underlying finite element spaces are modified to incorporate the discontinuities. The non-penetration conditions on the embedded interfaces of the domains are discretized using the method of Lagrange multipliers . We reformulate the arising variational inequality problem as a quadratic minimization problem with linear inequality constraints. Our multigrid method can solve such problems by employing a tailored multilevel hierarchy of the FE spaces and a novel approach for tackling the discretized non-penetration conditions. We employ pseudo- L 2 L2 projection-based transfer operators to construct a hierarchy of nested FE spaces from the hierarchy of non-nested meshes. The essential component of our multigrid method is a technique that decouples the linear constraints using an orthogonal transformation . The decoupled constraints are handled by a modified variant of the projected Gauss–Seidel method, which we employ as a smoother in the multigrid method. These components of the multigrid method allow us to enforce linear constraints locally and ensure the global convergence. We will demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and level independent convergence property of the proposed method for Signorini’s problem and two-body contact problems.},

The aim of this paper is to alleviate the three main problems of volume integral methods. First, the computation of the inductance matrix elements is slow and also delicate because of the singularity in the integral equation. This paper introduces novel face basis functions that allow a much faster inductance matrix construction with respect to the standard one based on the Rao–Wilton–Glisson (RWG) or Raviart–Thomas (RT) basis functions. Second, our basis functions work for polyhedral elements formed by any number of faces (including prisms, hexahedra and pyramids), while producing the same results as RWG and RT basis functions for tetrahedral meshes. Third, the new basis functions allow to factorize the inductance matrix and to introduce a novel family of groundbreaking low-rank inductance matrix compression techniques that show several orders of magnitude improvement in memory occupation and computational effort than state-of-the-art alternatives, allowing to solve problems that otherwise cannot be faced.},

However, isogeometric discretizations are not as flexible as standard finite elements ones, especially in the context of crack propagation analysis with continuous and complex remeshing. This paper presents a domain decomposition technique for introducing and propagating cracks in an isogeometrically discretized solid. In this technique, a standard triangular finite element mesh is overlapped to the isogeometric model and the basis functions of both discretizations are modified and blended over a region of the physical domain, leading to a new space of functions. This technique allows the insertion and propagation of discontinuities over an isogeometric discretization without modifying the original mesh. The proposed approach is applied to large and small displacements 2D linear elastic fracture mechanics problems, demonstrating to be a very robust, accurate and versatile tool.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel bio-inspired algorithm inspired by starlings’ behaviors during their stunning murmuration named starling murmuration optimizer (SMO) to solve complex and engineering optimization problems as the most appropriate application of metaheuristic algorithms . The SMO introduces a dynamic multi-flock construction and three new search strategies, separating, diving, and whirling. The separating search strategy aims to enhance the population diversity and local optima avoidance using a new separating operator based on the quantum harmonic oscillator . The diving search strategy aims to explore the search space sufficiently by a new quantum random dive operator, whereas the whirling search strategy exploits the vicinity of promising regions using a new operator called cohesion force . The SMO strikes a balance between exploration and exploitation by selecting either a diving strategy or a whirling strategy based on the flocks’ quality. The SMO was tested using various benchmark functions with dimensions 30, 50, 100. The experimental results prove that the SMO is more competitive than other state-of-the-art algorithms regarding solution quality and convergence rate. Then, the SMO is applied to solve several mechanical engineering problems in which results demonstrate that it can provide more accurate solutions. A statistical analysis shows that SMO is superior to the other contenders.},

  abstract     = {Numerically predicting the performance of heterogeneous structures without scale separation is a challenging task owing to the critical requirements related to computational scalability and efficiency that must be satisfied. In addition, adopting a sufficiently fine mesh to consider the small-scale heterogeneities results in prohibitive computational costs, whereas neglecting them tends to drastically over-stiffen the rigidity of the structure. Thus, this study proposed an approach for constructing new material-aware shape (basis) functions per element for a coarse discretization of the structure considering each curved bridge node (CBN) that is defined along the boundaries of the elements. Rather than formulating their derivation by regarding them as a nonlinear optimization problem, the shape functions were constructed mapping the CBNs to the interior nodes and were subsequently presented in an explicit matrix form as a product of Bézier interpolation and boundary–interior transformations. The CBN shape function captures the heterogeneity of the coarse element with greater flexibility, overcomes the important and challenging issues of inter-element stiffness and displacement discontinuity across interfaces between coarse elements, and improves the analysis accuracy by several orders of magnitude. Moreover, they satisfy the basic geometric properties of shape functions, thereby avoiding non-physical analysis results. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed approach was tested and demonstrated through extensive numerical examples , including a 3D industrial example of billions of degrees of freedom, and comparisons with results obtained from classical approaches were made.},

The proposed Balancing Domain Decomposition by Constraints (BDDC) preconditioner allows to use conjugate gradient iterations, albeit the algebraic linear systems arising from the discretization of the problem are indefinite, ill-conditioned, and of saddle point nature. The condition number of the resulting positive definite preconditioned system is adaptively controlled by means of deluxe scaling operators and suitable local generalized eigenvalue problems for the selection of optimal primal constraints. Numerical results confirm the theoretical estimates and the reliability of the adaptive procedure, with the experimental condition numbers always very close to the prescribed adaptive tolerance parameter. The scalability and quasi-optimality of the preconditioner are demonstrated, and the performances of the proposed solver are compared with state-of-the-art parallel direct solvers and block preconditioning techniques in a distributed memory setting.},

In this work, we present a 3D biventricular electromechanical model coupled with a 0D closed-loop model of the whole cardiovascular system that addresses the two former crucial factors. With this aim, we introduce a boundary condition for the mechanical problem that accounts for the neglected part of the domain located on top of the biventricular basal plane and that is consistent with the principles of momentum and energy conservation. We also discuss in detail the coupling conditions behind the 3D and the 0D models. We perform electromechanical simulations in physiological conditions using the 3D–0D model and we show that our results match the experimental data of relevant mechanical biomarkers available in the literature. Furthermore, we investigate different arrangements in cross-fibers active contraction. We prove that an active tension along the sheet direction counteracts the myofiber contraction, while the one along the sheet-normal direction enhances the cardiac work. Finally, several myofiber architectures are analyzed. We show that a different fiber field in the septal area and in the transmural wall affects the pumping functionality of the left ventricle.},

  abstract     = {For the multi-material structural topology optimization , most of works are based on the ideal interface hypothesis (the interfaces of material are considered to be ideal connection), which leads to the optimized structures tend to dangerous. Thus, this paper proposes a topology optimization method to minimize the maximum von Mises stress of multi-material structures with graded interfaces. A filter-based method is proposed to search and determine the locations of the multi-material interfaces, and the widths of the interfaces are determined by the filter radius . The mechanical properties of the multi-material interfaces are interpolated by gradient, and the gradient transition between the multi-material interface is realized. An extended Bi-directional Evolutionary Structural Optimization (BESO) method based on discrete variables is adopted to avoid the stress singularity problem. The maximum stress is measured by the global p -norm stress aggregation method. The adjoint method is used to derive the sensitivities of elements. Benchmark numerical examples are investigated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that the multi-material structure with graded interface can be described and optimized effectively. The width of the interfacial zone and the properties of the graded interface can be well controlled and defined, respectively. The topological results, for stress design, indicate that the maximum stress can be effectively reduced compared with stiffness design. The maximum stress of the topological structure considering the graded interface is higher than that without the graded interface, which indicates that the structure designed considering the graded interface is more safe. The proposed approach can achieve a reasonable design that effectively controls the stress level and reduces the stress concentration effect at the critical stress areas of multi-material structures with graded interfaces.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is an unsupervised machine learning method that has attracted considerable attention in recent years owing to its equation-free structure, ability to easily identify coherent spatio-temporal structures in data, and effectiveness in providing reasonably accurate predictions for certain problems, particularly over short-to-medium time frames. Despite these successes, the application of DMD to certain problems featuring highly nonlinear transient dynamics remains challenging. In such cases, DMD may not only fail to provide acceptable predictions but may indeed fail to recreate the data in which it was trained, restricting its application to diagnostic purposes (i.e., feature identification and extraction). For many such problems in the biological and physical sciences, the structure of the system obeys a compartmental framework, in which the transfer of mass, energy, or some other quantity of interest within the system moves across states. In these cases, the behavior of the system may not be accurately recreated by applying DMD to a single quantity within the system, as proper knowledge of the system dynamics , even for a single compartment, requires that the behavior of other compartments is taken into account in the DMD process . In the present work, we demonstrate, theoretically and numerically, that, when performing DMD on a fully coupled PDE system with compartmental structure, one may recover useful predictive behavior, even when DMD performs poorly when acting compartment-wise. We also establish that important physical quantities , such as mass conservation, are maintained in the coupled-DMD extrapolation. The mathematical and numerical analysis suggests that DMD, properly applied, may be a powerful tool for this common class of problems In particular, we show interesting numerical applications to a continuous delayed-SIRD model for Covid-19, and to a problem from additive manufacturing considering a nonlinear temperature field and the resulting change of material phase from powder, liquid, and solid states.},

Motivated by this, the present work tries to understand the equivalence, or its lack thereof, of the continuum scale Eulerian Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (ESPH) and Total Lagrangian Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (TLSPH) with the atomistic scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The equivalence is studied using four simple problems — (i) uniaxial tensile testing of a beam, (ii) stress profile in a pre-notched plate under small extension, (iii) head-on collision of two elastic rubber-like rings, and (iv) large deformation of a cantilever beam subjected to an impact at the free end. Using MD simulation data as the pseudo-experimental data, we show that both ESPH and TLSPH provide results that are qualitatively and quantitatively in agreement with the MD simulations if the properties at the continuum scale are obtained directly from the MD simulations, and the same initial conditions are chosen. The comparisons are based on the stress–strain behavior, the distribution of normal and shear stresses, the temporal evolution of the variables such as kinetic energy, etc.},

With the utilisation of conformal mapping, the porous structures here can be generated by two controlling field variables, the (logarithm of) the local scaling factor and the rotational angle of the matrix cell, and they are interrelated through the Cauchy–Riemann equations. Thus the design variables are simply reduced to the logarithm values of the local scaling factor on selected boundary points. Other attractive features shown by the present method are summarised as follows. Firstly, with the condition of total differential automatically met by the two controlling field variables, the integrability problem which necessitates post-processing treatments in many other similar methods can be resolved naturally. Secondly, according to the maximum principle for harmonic functions, the minimum feature size can be explicitly monitored during optimisation. Thirdly, the rotational symmetry possessed by the matrix cell can be fully exploited in the context of conformal mapping, and the computational cost for solving the cell problems for the homogenised elasticity tensor is maximally abased. In particular, when the design domain takes a rectangle shape, analytical expressions for the controlling fields are available. The homogenised results are shown, both theoretically and numerically, to converge to the corresponding fine-scale results, and the effectiveness of the proposed work is further demonstrated with more numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Failure trajectories, probable failure zones, and damage indices are some of the key quantities of relevance in brittle fracture mechanics. High-fidelity numerical solvers that reliably estimate these relevant quantities exist but they are computationally demanding requiring a high resolution of the crack. Moreover, independent simulations need to be carried out even for a small change in domain parameters and/or material properties. Therefore, fast and generalizable surrogate models are needed to alleviate the computational burden but the discontinuous and complex nature of fracture mechanics presents a major challenge to developing such models. We propose a physics-informed variational formulation of DeepONet (V-DeepONet) for brittle fracture analysis. V-DeepONet is trained to map the initial configuration of the defect to the relevant fields of interests (e.g., damage and displacements). Once the network is trained, the entire global solution can be rapidly obtained for any initial crack configuration and loading steps on that domain. While the original DeepONet is solely data-driven, we take a different path to train the V-DeepONet by imposing the governing equations in a variational form with some labeled data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of V-DeepOnet through two benchmarks of brittle fracture and verify its accuracy using results from high-fidelity solvers. Encoding the physical laws to the model with data enhancement in training renders the surrogate model capable of accurately performing both interpolation and extrapolation tasks. Considering that fracture modeling is very sensitive to fluctuations, the proposed V-DeepONet with a hybrid training strategy is able to predict the quantities of interests with good accuracy, which can be easily extended to a wide array of dynamical systems with complex responses.},

  abstract     = {Phase field approaches have been developed to analyze the failure behavior of ductile materials. In the previous phase field models, a constant critical energy or strain threshold is commonly introduced to the formulation of the driving force , aiming to avoid damage initiation at a low level of elastic and plastic deformations . However, it may not suffice to describe complex ductile fracture behavior of materials subject to various stress states . In this study, a new phase field approach is proposed to consider the effects of stress triaxiality and Lode angle , by incorporating phenomenological ductile fracture criteria . The proposed models are formulated using variational principles and implemented numerically in the finite element framework. Analytical homogeneous solutions for uniaxial tension, simple shear, and equibiaxial tension loads are derived to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models. Three groups of numerical examples , covering a wide range of stress states, are utilized to further examine the proposed models. The results show that the models can reproduce the experimental response of the specimen in terms of force versus displacement curve, crack initiation, and crack propagation under various loading conditions. The proposed models are able to capture the stress-state dependence of fracture behavior of ductile materials.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian updating provides a sound mathematical framework for probabilistic calibration as new information emerges. Bayesian Updating with Structural reliability methods (BUS) reformulates the acceptance domain in rejection sampling as a failure domain in reliability analysis, offering considerable potential for higher efficiency and accuracy. Kriging-based Monte Carlo Simulation has been studied to facilitate the application of BUS for problems with expensive-to-evaluate likelihood functions. Nevertheless, as the implementation of BUS often involves a rare event, the number of required Monte Carlo samples can become unaffordable. This gap is addressed here through Bayesian Updating with Active learning Kriging-based Adaptive Importance Sampling (BUAK-AIS). An importance sampling density based on Gaussian mixture distribution is introduced, and the discrepancy between the adopted and theoretically best sampling densities is measured through the Kullback–Leibler cross entropy. The proposed method includes an active learning framework that adaptively extends the training set and optimizes the parameters of the Gaussian mixture distribution based on the cross entropy and the current Kriging model. As BUS uses accepted samples to estimate the posterior distribution, the present work discusses the estimate for the first moment of the posterior distribution, and proposes a criterion to check the sufficiency of the number of accepted samples to guarantee robust estimations. A new stopping criterion is also developed by quantifying the error introduced by Kriging. Three numerical examples and an engineering application concerning model updating of cable-stayed bridges in the construction process are investigated, demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Numerical solution of hyperbolic differential equations, such as the advection equation , poses challenges. Classically, this issue has been addressed by using a scheme known as the upwind scheme . It simply invokes more points from the upwind side of the flow stream when calculating derivatives. This study presents a generalized upwind scheme, referred to as directional nonlocality , for the numerical solution of linear and nonlinear hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using the peridynamic differential operator (PDDO). The PDDO provides the nonlocal form of the differential equations by introducing an internal length parameter (horizon) and a weight function. The weight function controls the degree of interaction among the points within the horizon. A modification to the weight function, i.e., upwinded-weight function, accounts for directional nonlocality along which information travels. This modification results in a stable PDDO discretization of hyperbolic PDEs. Solutions are constructed in a consistent manner without special treatments through simple discretization . The capability of this approach is demonstrated by considering time dependent linear and nonlinear hyperbolic equations as well as the time invariant Eikonal equation . Numerical stability is ensured for the linear advection equation and the PD solutions compare well with the analytical/reference solutions.},

The shells may undergo large deformations and exhibit heterogeneous micro-structures consisting of nonlinear materials and cohesive interfaces . Appropriate use of an attached coordinate system , for the projection of the strain measures, enables the elimination of large rotations from the kinematic constraints that are imposed at the Representative Volume Element (RVE), simplifying this way the boundary value problem (BVP) to be solved at the micro-structural level. This way, the BVP formulation refers to the local coordinate system of the RVE in which the imposition of the plane stress condition becomes totally independent from the current orientation of the midsurface of the shell. Emanating from Hill’s averaging theorem, which is satisfied by use of appropriated averaging relations, the principle of virtual work is formulated in the attached auxiliary system basis, where a consistent tangent stiffness matrix is analytically derived. The resulting methodology is assessed against popular benchmarks for thin shells and allows for a straight forward integration of Kirchhoff–Love shells under large deformations in existing F E 2 FE2 codes. The simulation possibilities originating from this formulation are countless and are related to the wide applicability of the Kirchhoff Love theory in many fields of engineering.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new metaheuristic algorithm called dwarf mongoose optimization algorithm (DMO) to solve the classical and CEC 2020 benchmark functions and 12 continuous/discrete engineering optimization problems. The DMO mimics the foraging behavior of the dwarf mongoose. The restrictive mode of prey capture (feeding) has dramatically affected the mongooses’ social behavior and ecological adaptations to compensate for efficient family nutrition. The compensatory behavioral adaptations of the mongoose are prey size, space utilization, group size, and food provisioning. Three social groups of the dwarf mongoose are used in the proposed algorithm, the alpha group, babysitters, and the scout group. The family forage as a unit, and the alpha female initiates foraging, determines the foraging path, the distance covered, and the sleeping mounds. A certain number of the mongoose population (usually a mixture of males and females) serve as the babysitters. They remain with the young until the group returns at midday or evening. The babysitters are exchanged for the first to forage with the group (exploitation phase). The dwarf mongooses do not build a nest for their young; they move them from one sleeping mound to another and do not return to the previously foraged site. The dwarf mongoose has adopted a seminomadic way of life in a territory large enough to support the entire group (exploration phase). The nomadic behavior prevents overexploitation of a particular area. It also ensures exploration of the whole territory because no previously visited sleeping mound is returned. The performance of the proposed DMO algorithm is compared with seven other algorithms to show its effectiveness in terms of different performance metrics and statistics. In most cases, the near-optimal solutions achieved by the DMO are better than the best solutions obtained by the current state-of-the-art algorithms. Matlab codes of DMO are available at https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/105125-dwarf-mongoose-optimization-algorithm .},

  abstract     = {For considering topological changes in a CAD-based framework, an isogeometric phase-field based shape and topology optimization is developed. In this case, the diffuse interface, between a material and void phases, describes the boundaries of the geometry. The descent direction to minimize the objective function is found by using a bulk energy function, which is written in terms of the sensitivities of the objective function with respect to the design variables. The design variables are the local values of the phase-field variable. The evolution of the phase-field is determined by solving the time-dependent Allen–Cahn equation. The phase-field topology optimization approach is used to optimize flexoelectric structures, a problem for which we exploit the advantages of using NURBS to discretize the geometry and the solution fields. The C 1 C1 continuity required for the solution of the flexoelectric PDE is easily obtained using NURBS as basis functions. The adjoint method is used to compute the sensitivity analysis. The results of the optimal flexoelectric geometries are compared to the optimal geometries in case piezoelectric materials are used. Different geometries, boundary conditions and material configurations are considered to demonstrate the robustness of the method. Compared to pure piezoelectricity, the electric output of piezo-flexoelectric microbeams under bending is larger. In contrast, for a structure under compression, the minimized value of the objective function is larger for piezoelectricity. In general, the enhancement of the energy conversion factor is larger when flexoelectricity is considered together with piezoelectricity. The optimal results show the relevance of considering flexoelectricity at microscales (3 ∼ ∼ 5 μ m μm ).},

Besides, for some high-precision equipment, e.g. space telescope mirror substrate and rocket motor casings, their complex and diverse modals directly affect the performance. Thus, a novel optimization algorithm was proposed, which applies to achieve eigenvector-based modal control and vibration suppression. The eigenvectors were defined as the objective function, and Nelson’s method without truncation error was used to calculate the sensitivity information. Due to the introduction of dynamic equations, the non-linearity of the objective function is prominent. Then, an improved solver that can handle this non-linear topology optimization problem was proposed. The optimization was performed under a multi-material framework, and the extended multi-material interpolation scheme was proposed to readily realize the optimization with three or more materials. In addition, the consistent mass matrix constructed by multi-material interpolation was used to describe the mass matrix without concentrated mass in the dynamic equation. Moreover, the modal assurance criterion was used to track jumping modals. Finally, the modal controllability was achieved through several numerical examples , which verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

We show that WICSP performs well in the case of tensor-product spline discretizations, both with respect to the rate of convergence and computational complexity. In particular, we observe experimentally an optimal rate of convergence for odd degree basis functions and obtain a dimension-independent computational complexity O ( n p ) O(np) for matrix-free applications, similar to other approaches such as weighted quadrature (Calabrò et al., 2017) and clustered collocation (Montardini et al., 2017). We explore how these results extend to the case of adaptively refined THB-spline discretizations. We observe that WICSP is compatible with THB-spline refinement, exhibiting good accuracy and low computational costs. In fact, we get a complexity of O ( n p 2 d ) O(np2d) for matrix assembly and O ( n p d ) O(npd) for the matrix-free case. This compares well with the available methods for isogeometric THB-spline discretizations.},

  abstract     = {A new numerical method, which is based on the coupling between semi-Lagrangian (SL) method and element free Galerkin (EFG) method, is developed for convection–diffusion partial differential equations with dominated convection terms. It is the first time that the SL method combined with the EFG method to solve the transient convection–diffusion equations. This combination has been more effective than expected. Compared with the existing SL methods, the proposed method shows several new advantages. Firstly, it takes full advantages of meshfree methods, therefore, the implementation difficulties of the SL method in backward tracing and departure point interpolation are greatly reduced. As interpolating the function values to a departure point, complex searching algorithm is not needed to determine which grid cell contains the departure point, and higher order interpolation is not essential to ensure the global accuracy. Meanwhile, in addition to having good stability and allowing the use of large time-step sizes, the new method realizes the continuous transition from convection–diffusion equation to pure convection equation and provides a uniform numerical format for these two kinds of equations. A problem with available analytical solution is solved to analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method. It is demonstrated that the method can achieve the optimal convergence rate. Subsequently, the method is applied to solve the 1D and 2D Burgers’ equations. The results show that the proposed method can indeed obtain surprisingly good results for the Burgers’ equations in the very challenging convection-dominated and pure convection cases. These results are better than almost all the ones we have seen in literature. The good performance of this method in solving the challenging Burgers’ equations makes us believe that it will be a very promising method for solving convection-dominated problems.},

  abstract     = {Efficient and accurate calculation of spatial integrals is of major interest in the numerical implementation of peridynamics (PD). The standard way to perform this calculation is a particle-based approach that discretizes the strong form of the PD governing equation. This approach has rapidly been adopted by the PD community since it offers some advantages. It is computationally cheaper than other available schemes, can conveniently handle material separation, and effectively deals with nonlinear PD models. Nevertheless, PD models are still computationally very expensive compared with those based on the classical continuum mechanics theory, particularly for large-scale problems in three dimensions. This results from the nonlocal nature of the PD theory which leads to interactions of each node of a discretized body with multiple surrounding nodes. Here, we propose a new approach to significantly boost the numerical efficiency of PD models. We propose a discretization scheme that employs a simple collocation procedure and is truly meshfree; i.e., it does not depend on any background integration cells. In contrast to the standard scheme, the proposed scheme requires a much smaller set of neighboring nodes (keeping the same physical length scale) to achieve a specific accuracy and is thus computationally more efficient. Our new scheme is applicable to the case of linear PD models and within neighborhoods where the solution can be approximated by smooth basis functions. Therefore, to fully exploit the advantages of both the standard and the proposed schemes, a hybrid discretization is presented that combines both approaches within an adaptive framework. The high performance of the developed framework is illustrated by several numerical examples, including brittle fracture and corrosion problems in two and three dimensions.},

In particular, second-order extrapolations based on Taylor series expansions are employed to transfer the solution and retain high order of accuracy.

This method paves the way to a new class of shock-tracking techniques truly independent on the mesh structure and flow solver.

The material point method enables us to simulate large deformation problems while circumventing the potential mesh distortion without remeshing. To eliminate rotational motion damping and loss of angular momentum during the projection, we introduce the mapping for microinertia and angular momentum between particles and grids through the affine particle-in-cell approach. The microrotation and the curvature at each particle are updated through zero-order forward integration of the microgyration and its spatial gradient. We show that the microinertia and the angular momentum are conserved during the projections between particles and grids in our formulation. We verify the formulation and implementation by comparing with the analytical dispersion relation of micropolar waves under the small strain and small microrotation, as well as the analytical soliton solution for solids undergoing large deformation and large microrotation. We also demonstrate the capacity of the proposed computational framework to handle a wide spectrum of simulations that exhibit size effects in the geometrical nonlinear regime through three representative numerical examples, i.e., a cantilever beam torsion problem, a fragment-impact penetration problem, and a micropolar fluid discharging problem.},

  abstract     = {Extensive developments on various generalizations of the Finite Element Method (FEM) for the interface problems, with unfitted mesh, have been made in the last few decades. Typical generalizations and techniques include the immersed FEM, the penalized FEM, the generalized or the extended FEM (GFEM/XFEM). The GFEM/XFEM achieves good approximation by augmenting the finite element approximation space with enrichment functions, which require additional degrees of freedom (DOF). However these additional DOFs, in general, deteriorate the conditioning of the GFEM/XFEM. In this study, we propose a condensed GFEM (CGFEM) for the interface problem based on the partition of unity method and a local least square scheme. Compared to the conventional GFEM/XFEM, the CGFEM possesses the same number of DOFs as in the FEM, yields good approximation, and is well-conditioned. In comparison with the immersed FEM, the construction of shape functions of CGFEM is independent of the equation types and the material coefficients of the interface problem. As a result, the CGFEM could be applied to more general interface problems, e.g., problems with anisotropic materials and elasticity systems, in a unified approach. Moreover, the shape functions of CGFEM are continuous, and thus do not need any penalty terms and parameters. The optimal order of convergence of the CGFEM has been analyzed and established theoretically in this paper. Numerical experiments for isotropic and anisotropic interface problems and comparisons with the conventional GFEM/XFEM have also been presented to illuminate the theory and effectiveness of CGFEM.},

  abstract     = {Red blood cells (RBCs) experience significant cyclic deformation through large elastic stretching and relaxation as they circulate in the bloodstream. Such hundreds of thousands times cell deformation causes cumulative fatigue damage to the circulating RBCs, leading to alterations in cell deformability and membrane viscoelasticity. Here, we employ a two-step multiscale computational framework based on coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) to probe the viscoelastic properties of the surface-altered RBCs in aging and mechanical fatigue, using experimental information on the molecular structures of both RBC membrane and cytosolic Hb as well as Hb concentration of RBC cytosol. We perform CGMD simulations to compute the shear modulus and membrane viscosity of a small RBC patch with altered horizontal connectivity within spectrin network; meanwhile, we compute the shear viscosity of RBC cytosol under different Hb concentrations. We then use these computed parameters as inputs for a more coarse-grained DPD-based RBC model at the whole-cell level to probe cell deformation, dynamic relaxation, viscoelastic performance of the altered RBC membrane. We find that the RBC membrane rigidity increases with the enhanced horizontal connectivity within spectrin network, but by a factor less than the effective membrane viscosity, resulting in an elevated characteristic relaxation time with increasing fatigue cycles. In addition, we quantify the two-dimensional storage and loss moduli of RBC membrane under time-dependent loading, revealing that the loss modulus is much larger than the storage modulus throughout the entire frequency range covered by the simulations, especially under enhanced connectivity in the cytoskeletal network, which is analogous to the performance of typical viscoelastic materials. These quantitative findings provide unique insights into the progressive damage of circulating RBCs, and demonstrate the capability of the two-step multiscale framework in effectively predicting the altered viscoelastic properties of RBCs influenced by in vivo aging and mechanical fatigue.},

Such structures can be designed to efficiently control and manipulate sound waves and are referred to as acoustic metamaterials or sonic crystals. Our methods subdivide the geometry into boxes which correspond to the unit cell. A boundary element discretization is applied and interactions between well separated boxes are approximated by a fast multipole expansion . Due to the periodicity of the underlying geometry, certain operators of the expansion become block Toeplitz matrices . This allows to express matrix–vector products as circular convolutions which significantly reduces the computational effort and the overall memory requirements. The efficiency of the presented techniques is shown based on an acoustic scattering problem. In addition, a study on the design of sound barriers is presented where the performance of a wall-like sound barrier is compared to the performance of two sonic crystal sound barriers.},

  abstract     = {Partial differential equations (PDEs) with spatial derivatives of order higher than two are receiving increasing attention, partially due to the current popularity of the phase-field method. In the finite element community, the growth of Isogeometric Analysis and other discretization schemes that employ approximation spaces with high-order continuity has fostered the use of variational formulations that avoid the use of auxiliary unknowns representing derivatives of the solution. However, one of the caveats of this approach is the accurate and efficient imposition of boundary conditions, especially on complex geometries. This paper proposes a new method to impose boundary conditions naturally in the weak form of higher-order PDEs. Our method is based on a specially-designed weak form in which the boundary conditions to be imposed are weighted by derivatives of the weight functions. This requires multiple integrations by parts which are allowed due to the smoothness of the basis functions. The Cahn–Hilliard equation and the isothermal Navier–Stokes–Norteweg equations are used as examples to demonstrate the proposed method. We show that if the solutions of the PDEs are smooth enough, the proposed variational equations and the original PDEs are equivalent. We discretize the variational equations using Isogeometric Analysis. Convergence results of the proposed method agree with the best approximation errors of the basis functions. Numerical examples illustrate the applicability of the approach to mapped geometries with non-conformal grids.},

  abstract     = {Based on the deep learning method, the physical information of Reynolds equation is introduced into the neural network, and a deep learning network frame (ReF-nets) is built to predict the flow fields and aerodynamic characteristics of gas bearing. The prediction results of neural network have high enough accuracy comparing with those from finite difference method (FDM). Furthermore, a comprehensive investigation of unsupervised learning, supervised learning and semi-supervised learning in PDE (partial differential equation) solution prediction is carried out, which is the first time these three learning strategies are fully compared in PDE solving field to our best knowledge. The advantages and disadvantages of the three learning methods are illustrated in detail from the perspectives of physics interpretability and prediction accuracy. It is found that the unsupervised learning method has the strongest physics interpretability in predicting the flow field. The supervised learning method has the highest prediction accuracy, but it has nearly no physics interpretability. While semi-supervised learning method can take into account the advantages of both methods, and perform well when there are some known flow field data.},

  abstract     = {A novel structural health monitoring approach is developed by coupling the inverse finite element method (iFEM) and peridynamic theory (PD) for real-time shape sensing analysis and crack propagation monitoring of plate structures. This hybrid method, called iFEM-PD, can account for deformation, stress, and damage states of any sensor-equipped structure in real time without the need for loading knowledge and regardless of the complexity of structural topology or boundary conditions. The integrated iFEM-PD approach first reconstructs continuous (full-field) deformations from discrete strain measurements and then utilizes them to obtain full-field strains within the structure. Subsequently, iFEM-reconstructed strains are employed with a suitable damage diagnosis index to quantify the critical (possibly damaged/cracked) zone of the structural domain. Next, this critical zone is modeled by populating PD material points and establishing non-local interactions between the material points. Enforcing the real-time deformations predicted by iFEM to the boundary material points of the PD domain as displacement boundary conditions , the deformations of the material points located internal to the damaged zone is recalculated through PD analysis. During this simulation, the damage prognosis is achieved by precisely modeling structural discontinuities (crack etc.) and analyzing crack propagation based on non-local particle interactions. The shape sensing and damage monitoring capabilities of the iFEM-PD method are numerically verified for crack monitoring problems of composite structures subjected to various static/dynamic loads. Also, the high accuracy of the iFEM-PD formulation is experimentally validated by comparing the numerical results with those of digital image correlation Overall, the merits of the new approach are revealed for precise crack growth monitoring in composite structures.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a numerical multiscale formulation for analysis of the transient heat and fluid flow in deformable heterogeneous porous media. Due to the heterogeneity of the media, the direct numerical simulation of the micro-structures leads to high computational costs. Hence, the multi-scale method can provide an efficient computational procedure. To this end, the first-order computational homogenization is adopted for two-scale simulation of THM problems. The governing equations of the problem contain a stress equilibrium equation, a mass continuity equation and an advection–diffusion equation in a fully coupled manner. Accordingly, the proper virtual power relations are defined as a bridging stage between the scales. The boundary conditions of the microscopic domain are specified in terms of the macroscopic information to fulfill the averaging constraints. In order to consider the transient effects, the micro-inertial terms are included in the micro-scale simulation, and then the microscopic boundary conditions are enhanced to assess the efficiency and accuracy. The macroscopic properties including the homogenized tangent operators and equivalent quantities are determined from the microscopic solution through the appropriate mathematical procedures. Moreover, an upwind finite element squared method is employed for highly advective heat transfer to achieve the accurate spatial results. Finally, several comprehensive examples are simulated to study the effectiveness and validity of the proposed computational model, particularly the boundary conditions; moreover, different case studies are discussed such as the highly advective flow, pure conduction heat transfer and a combined conduction–convection heat transfer.},

  abstract     = {Owing to the influence of manufacturing and assembly errors, material performance degradation, external loads and unpredictability of the environment during service, structural response analysis should consider the time-invariant uncertainties and time-variant uncertainties simultaneously. In this paper, a mixed uncertainty model with random variable and stochastic process is adopted to handle this issue. A time-variant uncertain structural response analysis method is proposed based on recurrent neural network using gated recurrent units (GRU) combined with ensemble learning. In the proposed method, by performing Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) of random variables, multiple GRU networks can be trained to estimate the time-variant system response under fixed random variables. During the process of training GRU models, an active learning strategy is developed and applied to improve model accuracy and reduce training samples. On this basis, a set of augmented data is generated using the trained GRU models. Then the mapping relationship between random variables and structural responses through the Gaussian process (GP) regression is built accordingly. Eventually, the global surrogate model of time-variant uncertain structural response can be obtained by integrating the GRU networks and the GP models. Two numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed method can effectively calculate the expectation and standard deviation of the system response under the mixed uncertainty model with random variables and stochastic processes. In addition, it has higher computational efficiency under the premise of ensuring the calculation accuracy.},

  abstract     = {To investigate the two-phase seepage–stress coupling process in fractured porous medium, this study extends the cohesive element-based numerical manifold method (Co-NMM) by incorporating a two-phase seepage–stress coupling model considering the effect of matrix-fracture interface on the two-phase flow and fracture propagation induced by the two-phase seepage pressure. The proposed two-phase flow solving framework implicitly calculates the fluid pressure and saturation of the two-phase flow based on a two-phase unified pipe network method. Furthermore, to more realistically model the hydraulic behaviour of two-phase flow in fractured porous medium, a matrix-fracture interface condition called the extended capillary pressure condition is incorporated into the two-phase flow solving framework to capture the interactions among fluid flow in the fractures and matrix. Due to the inheritance of the Co-NMM, one key advantage of the extended method is the simulation of complex multi-fracture propagation caused by the two-phase seepage–stress coupling. The two-phase flow solving framework is first validated by reproducing the water displacing oil in a single fracture and the gas displacing water in a single-fractured porous medium against analytical and numerical solutions, respectively. The two-phase seepage–stress coupling procedure is then verified by performing a one-dimensional consolidation problem of soil column, in which comparisons between the numerical and analytical results regarding the pore pressure and compression displacement are presented. Finally, with the extended method, CO 2 -enhanced oil recovery in fractured reservoir is preliminarily studied by considering the effect of gas injection rate and capillary pressure on the evolution of two-phase flow and fracture propagation. The results elucidate that high CO 2 injection rate can lead to fracture propagation in the reservoir, and both capillary pressure and fractures have a significant effect on the CO 2 distribution.},

The proposed DT virtual model consists of three modules (namely one crack tracking model, one high-precision approximating model and one dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) inference model) and operates in offline and online stages. The offline stage employs the extended finite element method (XFEM) to establish the crack tracking model, which will generate sufficient labeled datasets to train the high-precision approximating model. In the online stage, the model parameters are updated by the DBN inference model based on the well-trained approximating model, where real-time information exchange from the physical model of the structure is performed. As a result, unexpected uncertainties of the model parameters can be significantly reduced. Numerical examples are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed DT-driven approach and the analysis results demonstrate that the fatigue crack growth can be efficiently and accurately predicted.},

  abstract     = {The effect of hydrogen on crack propagation has been studied extensively using various numerical algorithms. Recently, phase-field models have been developed that can predict crack propagation with very good resemblance of the crack paths with the experimental results. Solving the coupled equations of hydrogen transport, mechanical equilibrium and phase-field models is computationally expensive requiring a large number of time steps and high spatial resolution. Often, the spatial resolution is achieved a priori in known regions where the cracks may propagate. This leads to a large number of degrees of freedom to be solved for a large number of time steps for the coupled equations in simulating hydrogen-assisted cracking. In the present work, an adaptive refinement scheme is proposed that will remove the burden of very high uniform spatial resolution in non crack regions eventually leading to fewer degrees of freedom and hence decreases the computational cost. Several case studies are considered and the efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated.},

The framework is presented in a general manner and is implemented using the finite element method . Two software implementations are developed, one using FEniCS and the other in Abaqus . A detailed analysis of the numerical schemes used to model the surrounding air is made and their pros and cons are discussed. The proposed framework is used to simulate two model geometries that are directly relevant to recent applications of MREs. The first two-dimensional example simulates a mechanically soft beam consisting of a single wavy-chain of hard or soft magnetic particles. The beam is subjected to transverse magnetic actuation loads that induce important vertical deflections. Despite the overall small local strains in the beam, a significant viscoelastic effect is observed when high-rate magnetic fields are applied. A torque model for the particles is also used to analyze the beam geometry and is found to be in relatively good agreement with the rest of the approaches for small actuation fields. The second example discusses the rotation of a three-dimensional ellipsoid embedded in a cubic elastomer domain, while the ensemble lies inside a larger cubic air domain. Non-monotonic uniaxial and rotating magnetic fields are applied leading to complex, non-monotonic rotations of the ellipsoidal particle. The hard and soft magnetic cases exhibit significant differences, whereas viscoelasticity is found to induce strong coupling with the magnetization rotation but not with the dissipative magnetization amplitude. Extensive supplementary material provides all details of our implementations as well as animated visualization of results.},

Meanwhile, a coarse-grid solver is sufficient for obtaining accurate solution snapshots for the convection–diffusion equation with a large diffusivity. We aim to adapt the POD basis functions extracted from the solution snapshots of a large diffusivity for the construction of a reduced-order model at a small diffusivity without resorting to a fine-grid solver. Our POD basis adaptation method exploits the implicit dependence of solutions on diffusivity. The POD basis functions are adapted through an iterative algorithm, where the full-order model simulation at a large diffusivity and the POD-based reduced-order model simulation at a small diffusivity are implemented, alternatively. We also provide convergence analysis for our POD basis adaptation method. The algorithm and convergence analysis can be generalized to other types of linear parametric PDEs without any difficulty.

  abstract     = {Analysis-suitable T-splines (AST-splines) are a promising candidate to achieve a seamless integration between the design and the analysis of thin-walled structures in industrial settings. In this work, we allow multiple extraordinary points per face, i.e., we remove the restriction of preceding works that required extraordinary points to be at least four rings apart from each other. We do so by mathematically showing that AST-splines with multiple extraordinary points per face are linearly independent and their polynomial basis functions form a non-negative partition of unity . This extension of the subset of AST-splines drastically increases the flexibility to build geometries using AST-splines; e.g., much coarser meshes can be constructed around small holes. The AST-spline spaces detailed in this work have C 1 C1 inter-element continuity near extraordinary points and C 2 C2 inter-element continuity elsewhere. For the convergence studies performed in this paper involving second- and fourth-order linear elliptic problems with manufactured solutions, we have not found any drawback caused by allowing multiple EPs per face in either the first refinement levels or the asymptotic behavior . To illustrate a possible isogeometric framework that is already available, we design the B-pillar and the side outer panel of a car using T-splines with the commercial software Autodesk Fusion360, import the control nets into our in-house code to build AST-splines, and import the Bézier extraction information into the commercial software LS-DYNA to solve eigenvalue problems . The results are compared with conventional finite elements and good agreement is found between AST-splines and conventional finite elements .},

This structure leads to a complex material response upon loading where the load for a given displacement becomes highly dependent upon the current volume fraction of voids in the deformed foam. This complex behavior makes it challenging to develop constitutive models for flexible foams where typically only the homogenized response of the foam is considered during model development, calibration, and eventual deployment. To overcome these challenges we utilize a micromechanics finite element method simulation-informed machine learning framework to develop new constitutive models with idealized foam microstructures of moderate density in mind. Several different machine learned models will be presented and validated against micromechanics finite element simulation which were absent from the training dataset. Specifically, traditional data-driven machine learned regression models will be compared with machine learned models which learn the deviation of representative volume element data from a traditional homogenized constitutive model. A discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of each of the approaches will be presented.},

  abstract     = {Multi-fidelity data exist in almost every engineering and science discipline, which can be from simulation, experiments, and a hybrid form. High fidelity data are usually associated with higher accuracy and expense (e.g., high resolution experimental testing or finer scale simulation), while low-fidelity data are on the opposite side in terms of the accuracy and cost. Multi-fidelity data aggregation (MDA) in this study refers to the process of combining two or multiple sources of different fidelity data to have a high accuracy estimation and low computational cost. MDA has a wide range of application in engineering and science, such as multiscale simulation, multi-resolution imaging, and hybrid simulation-testing. This paper presents a novel framework named Multi-fidelity Data Aggregation using Convolutional Neural Networks (MDA-CNN) for multi-fidelity modeling. The MDA-CNN architecture has three components: multi-fidelity data compiling, multi-fidelity perceptive field and convolution, and deep neural network for mapping. This framework captures and utilizes implicit relationships between any high-fidelity datum and all available low-fidelity data using a defined local perceptive field and convolution. Most existing strategies rely on the collocation method and interpolation, which focuses on the single point relationship. The proposed method has several unique benefits. First, the proposed framework treats the multi-fidelity data as image data and processes them using CNN, which is very scalable to high dimensional data with more than two fidelities. Second, the flexibility of nonlinear mapping in neural network facilitates the multi-fidelity aggregation and does not need to assume specific relationships among multiple fidelities. Third, the proposed framework does not assume that multi-fidelity data are at the same order or from the same physical mechanisms (e.g., assumptions are needed for some error estimation-based multi-fidelity model). Thus, the proposed method can handle data aggregation from multiple sources across different scales, such as different order derivatives and other correlated phenomenon data in a single framework. The proposed MDA-CNN is validated using extensive numerical examples and experimental data with multi-source and multi-fidelity data. Discussions are given to illustrate the benefits and limitations of the proposed framework. Conclusions and future work are presented based on the observations in the current study.},

  abstract     = {Numerical investigation of compressible flows faces two main challenges. In order to accurately describe the flow characteristics, high-resolution nonlinear numerical schemes are needed to capture discontinuities and resolve wide convective, acoustic and interfacial scale ranges. The simulation of realistic three-dimensional (3D) problems with state-of-the-art finite-volume method (FVM) based on approximate Riemann solvers with weighted nonlinear reconstruction schemes requires the usage of high-performance computing (HPC) architectures. Efficient compression algorithms reduce computational and memory load. Fully adaptive multiresolution (MR) algorithms with LTS have proven their potential for such applications. While modern central processing units (CPUs) requires multiple levels of parallelism to achieve peak performance, the fine-grained MR mesh adaptivity results in challenging compute/communication patterns. Moreover, local time stepping (LTS) incurs strong data dependencies which challenge a parallelization strategy. We address these challenges with a block-based MR algorithm, where arbitrary cuts in the underlying octree are possible. This allows for a parallelization on distributed-memory machines via the Message Passing Interface (MPI). We obtain neighbor relations by a simple bit-logic in a modified Morton Order. The block-based concept allows for a modular setup of the source code framework in which the building blocks of the algorithm, such as the choice of the Riemann solver or the reconstruction stencil, are interchangeable without loss of parallel performance. We present the capabilities of the modular framework with a range of test cases and scaling analysis with effective resolutions beyond one billion cells using O ( 1 0 4 ) O(104) cores.},

Crystal plasticity relaxes stresses at the phase interface, which leads to subsequent coalescence of the precipitates. The fully implicit model employs the extended finite element method (XFEM) in conjunction with level sets. The level set is advected in a velocity field computed by the stress-modified Gibbs-Thomson interface condition. Mechanical equilibrium and level set update are solved in a staggered procedure. Jump quantities are treated by means of a suitable enriched least square smoothing. Multiple schemes for the computation of curvature of surfaces in the context of the XFEM are presented and compared. Equilibrium shapes at different levels of misfit are computed. A cuboidal equilibrium shape is retrieved in a rotated mesh in order to quantify mesh-independence, a linear volume-time relationship during Ostwald ripening is reproduced and merging of particles under tension is reported.},

  abstract     = {The Reliability-Based Design Optimization (RBDO) provides an effective way to obtain the optimum design in the presence of random uncertainties which follow the precise probability distribution function in the structural optimization design. However, in many practical engineering problems, the probability distribution which describes the stochastic nature of the uncertainties cannot be precisely obtained due to limited information. To quantify this kind of imprecise uncertainties, a probability-interval hybrid model emerged, where all uncertain variables are treated as random variables while some distribution parameters can only be given variation intervals. For such kind of uncertainties, this paper establishes a hybrid reliability-based design optimization model and proposes a single-loop solution algorithm. The interval parameters lead to an interval of reliability for each constraint function, thus giving rise to a triple-loop optimization problem for the hybrid RBDO, which is difficult to solve due to the unaffordable computational effort and the hinder of convergency. In this paper, the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions of the inner loops are imposed as equivalent deterministic equality constraints. The original triple-loop optimization is thus converted into an equivalent single-loop problem, which alleviates the computational demand significantly. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed Single-Loop Method (SLM) is verified through several practical engineering problems.},

  abstract     = {Krylov subspace recycling is a powerful tool when solving a long series of large, sparse linear systems that change only slowly over time. In PDE constrained shape optimization, these series appear naturally, as typically hundreds or thousands of optimization steps are needed with only small changes in the geometry. In this setting, however, applying Krylov subspace recycling can be a difficult task. As the geometry evolves, in general, so does the finite element mesh defined on or representing this geometry, including the numbers of nodes and elements and element connectivity. This is especially the case if re-meshing techniques are used. As a result, the number of algebraic degrees of freedom in the system changes, and in general the linear system matrices resulting from the finite element discretization change size from one optimization step to the next. Changes in the mesh connectivity also lead to structural changes in the matrices. In the case of re-meshing, even if the geometry changes only a little, the corresponding mesh might differ substantially from the previous one. Obviously, this prevents any straightforward mapping of the approximate invariant subspace of the linear system matrix (the focus of recycling in this paper) from one optimization step to the next; similar problems arise for other selected subspaces. In this paper, we present an algorithm to map an approximate invariant subspace of the linear system matrix for the previous optimization step to an approximate invariant subspace of the linear system matrix for the current optimization step, for general meshes. This is achieved by exploiting the map from coefficient vectors to finite element functions on the mesh, combined with interpolation or approximation of functions on the finite element mesh. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach numerically with several proof of concept studies for a specific meshing technique.},

  abstract     = {The availability of high-quality three-dimensional (3D) microstructures is an essential prerequisite to understanding the macroscopic behaviours of heterogeneous media. Considering the high cost of 3D microscopy imaging, it is an economical way to derive large numbers of virtual 3D microstructures from limited morphological information of 2D cross-sectional images. This paper presents an efficient method that incorporates machine learning-based characterization of 2D images to statistically reconstruct 3D microstructures. The latent stochasticity of 2D images is mastered by fitting supervised machine learning models, which essentially characterize the local morphological statistics. A morphology integration scheme is developed to project the 2D morphological statistics into the 3D space, and new equivalent 3D microstructures can then be synthesized by sequentially generating voxel values from probability sampling. The new method is tested on a series of heterogeneous media with distinct morphologies, and it is also compared with two classical methods (i.e. stochastic optimization-based reconstruction and Gaussian random field transformation) in terms of reconstruction accuracy and efficiency. Besides, various microstructural descriptors are used to quantify the discrepancies between the reconstructed and target microstructures. The results confirm that the proposed method provides a highly cost-effective and widely applicable way to reproduce 3D realizations that precisely preserve the statistical characteristics, geometrical irregularities, long-distance connectivity and anisotropy that exist in 2D cross-sectional images.},

In addition, a formulation of self-contact is proposed to deal with the dynamic frictional contact mechanism between the generated shear planes. In order to ensure the smoothness of the discontinuity surface during localization propagation, a hybrid implicit–explicit description of discontinuity is assumed by employing the level-set method and a point cloud approach. Several numerical examples are investigated to assess the accuracy and demonstrate the capability of the proposed XMPM approach in simulating the shear band evolution of different engineering problems in both 2D and 3D. The proposed formulation also exhibits minor sensitivity with respect to mesh refinements in predicting the shear-band path. To show the optimum performance compared to the regular MPM approach, a simulation of large-deformation heterogeneous slope failure is presented as one of the applications of the proposed method towards simulating real-scale engineering problems.},

  abstract     = {Representative volume element (RVE)-based analysis plays a central role in understanding the response of heterogeneous materials to properties and geometry of the constituents. However, the accuracy of RVE analysis on real-life materials requires extra effort on the identification of material constituents and characterization of imperfections (e.g., voids and cracks) introduced in the fabrication process. For these reasons, together with the multiscale and spatially varying nature of heterogeneities, analysis of heterogeneous materials can be prohibitively time-consuming. In this work, a fully convolutional network (FCN)-based framework called RVE-net is proposed to take advantage of the state-of-art use of FCNs in image segmentation and feedforward neural networks in universal approximation to accelerate multiscale analysis, identify microscale material properties, and automatically characterize defects in materials. In contrast with standard numerical methods (e.g., the finite element method), which depend heavily on domain discretization and local interpolations, the RVE-net takes microstructure images — parameterized by a coupled Heaviside and level-set field representation — and loading conditions as inputs. The aim is to directly learn the nonlinear interaction between the microstructures and their local responses in a hierarchical manner. This avoids burdensome discretization and interpolations, makes it possible to transfer the learned structure-response from one microstructure to another, and thus significantly accelerates the modeling of heterogeneous materials. Several numerical examples are performed to examine the performance of the proposed RVE-net. It is demonstrated that the RVE-net can leverage the power of graphics processing units (GPUs) in RVE analysis, inverse derivation of material constituents, and characterization of defects.},

  abstract     = {Despite the great promise of the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in solving forward and inverse problems , several technical challenges are present as roadblocks for more complex and realistic applications. First, most existing PINNs are based on point-wise formulation with fully-connected networks to learn continuous functions, which suffer from poor scalability and hard boundary enforcement. Second, the infinite search space over-complicates the non-convex optimization for network training. Third, although the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based discrete learning can significantly improve training efficiency, CNNs struggle to handle irregular geometries with unstructured meshes . To properly address these challenges, we present a novel discrete PINN framework based on graph convolutional network (GCN) and variational structure of PDE to solve forward and inverse partial differential equations (PDEs) in a unified manner. The use of a piecewise polynomial basis can reduce the dimension of search space and facilitate training and convergence. Without the need of tuning penalty parameters in classic PINNs, the proposed method can strictly impose boundary conditions and assimilate sparse data in both forward and inverse settings. The flexibility of GCNs is leveraged for irregular geometries with unstructured meshes. The effectiveness and merit of the proposed method are demonstrated over a variety of forward and inverse computational mechanics problems governed by both linear and nonlinear PDEs .},

The full coupling is provided with Biot porous media theory, Bishop effective stress concept and nonlinear Richards’s equation for the unsaturated fluid flow. The relation between suction and saturation state is given through the van Genuchten constitutive model. The capabilities of the model are presented with the three representative simulations.

According to the RCC description, the recoverable adhesive interface behaviour derives from a free surface energy and a surface dissipation pseudo-potential. The obtained interface law describes both the de-bonding process of adhesive links due to tangential and normal interface deformation, and reversely, the bonding process that takes place when two surfaces approach close enough. We then propose an associated formulation coupling 3D extended interface law and Blatz–Ko hyperelastic material, that enables modelling large deformations of foam type soft matters under conditions of contact and friction with recoverable adhesion. In the end, the subsequent local contact nonlinear equations are solved using a Newton-like algorithm within the bi-potential framework.

  abstract     = {Artificial Neural Networks (NNWs) are appealing functions to substitute high dimensional and non-linear history-dependent problems in computational mechanics since they offer the possibility to drastically reduce the computational time . This feature has recently been exploited in the context of multi-scale simulations, in which the NNWs serve as surrogate model of micro-scale finite element resolutions. Nevertheless, in the literature, mainly the macro-stress–macro-strain response of the meso-scale boundary value problem was considered and the micro-structure information could not be recovered in a so-called localization step. In this work, we develop Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) as surrogates of the RVE response while being able to recover the evolution of the local micro-structure state variables for complex loading scenarios. The main difficulty is the high dimensionality of the RNNs output which consists in the internal state variable distribution in the micro-structure. We thus propose and compare several surrogate models based on a dimensionality reduction: (i) direct RNN modeling with implicit NNW dimensionality reduction, (ii) RNN with PCA dimensionality reduction, and (iii) RNN with PCA dimensionality reduction and dimensionality break down, i.e. the use of several RNNs instead of a single one. Besides, we optimize the sequential training strategy of the latter surrogate for GPU usage in order to speed up the process. Finally, through RNN modeling of the principal components coefficients, the connection between the physical state variables and the hidden variables of the RNN is revealed, and exploited in order to select the hyper-parameters of the RNN-based surrogate models in their design stage.},

  abstract     = {A physics informed neural network (PINN) incorporates the physics of a system by satisfying its boundary value problem through a neural network’s loss function. The PINN approach has shown great success in approximating the map between the solution of a partial differential equation (PDE) and its spatio-temporal coordinates. However, the PINN’s accuracy suffers significantly for strongly non-linear and higher-order time-varying partial differential equations such as Allen Cahn and Cahn Hilliard equations. To resolve this problem, a novel PINN scheme is proposed that solves the PDE sequentially over successive time segments using a single neural network. The key idea is to re-train the same neural network for solving the PDE over successive time segments while satisfying the already obtained solution for all previous time segments. Thus it is named as backward compatible PINN (bc-PINN). To illustrate the advantages of bc-PINN, the Cahn Hilliard and Allen Cahn equations are solved. These equations are widely used to describe phase separation and reaction–diffusion systems. Additionally, two new techniques have been introduced to improve the proposed bc-PINN scheme. The first technique uses the initial condition of a time-segment to guide the neural network map closer to the true map over that segment. The second technique is a transfer learning approach where the features learned from the previous training are preserved. We have demonstrated that these two techniques improve the accuracy and efficiency of the bc-PINN scheme significantly. It has also been demonstrated that the convergence is improved by using a phase space representation for higher-order PDEs. It is shown that the proposed bc-PINN technique is significantly more accurate and efficient than PINN.},

  abstract     = {Physicochemical and mechanical stimuli can trigger fluid transport and inelastic solid deformations in the fracture process of anisotropic hydrogel composites. The underlying mechanisms for the time-dependent deformation and fracture behaviour of hydrogel composites remain elusive and poorly understood. The present work develops an anisotropic poro-visco-hyperelastic-damage model based on the theory of porous media (TPM) to analyse the relationship between the coupled time-dependent behaviours, i.e. visco-hyperelasticity and fluid transport, and the fracture behaviour of hydrogel composites. The visco-hyperelasticity of the polymer networks resulting from the breaking and reforming kinetics of physical bonds is described by introducing internal variables based on the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor into elastic and inelastic parts. The fluid transport through the porous polymer networks is governed by Darcy’s law. A continuum damage model is proposed to describe the mechanical degradation of the anisotropic hydrogel composites, e.g., the cross-link unzipping and chain scission in polymer networks as well as the damage and breaking of embedded nanofibres. An integral-type nonlocal averaging algorithm is employed in the proposed damage model to eliminate the mesh dependence of numerical simulations. Furthermore, an operator split integration algorithm and an exponential mapping algorithm are applied to integrate evolution equations for internal variables and stresses. The resulting exponential tensor function is computed via spectral decompositions. The consistent tangent operators for an implicit finite element procedure are derived in detail in this contribution. Three representative numerical examples are used to validate the proposed model and investigate the mechanisms of the time-dependent fracture behaviour of anisotropic hydrogel composites. The computational results demonstrate that the proposed model can capture the fracture behaviour of hydrogel composites with different fibre orientations.},

The method takes into account the complex structure of reservoirs, a large number of operating wells, various methods of specifying the dependences of the properties of phases on pressure and mass fractions of their components, the transition of components from one phase to another, as well as compressibility and gravity. The method provides a sufficiently high computational efficiency, local conservation of mass for each component and protects the requirement of constraint of phases saturations from violation due to the following aspects. To calculate the phase flows we use a combination of continuous Galerkin finite element method (CG FEM) with a new balancing method. This combination provides high accuracy of flows calculated from the pressure field on rather coarse meshes. We also propose to use the grouping of finite elements, which allows us to remove strict restrictions on the time step when calculating the phase flows between cells. Verification of the proposed method is performed by comparing with the results of SPE tests. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated both on simple model problems and on problems of modeling a complex reservoir. For a real field of high-viscosity oil in Tatarstan (Russia), a good agreement between the computed and observed data is obtained for all high-rate wells over a fairly long period of field development.},

  abstract     = {Cellular structures in nature have attracted great attention in the field of structural optimization. This paper proposes a Kriging-assisted topology optimization method for design of functionally graded cellular structures (FGCS), which are infilled by smoothly-varying lattice unit cells (LUCs). Specifically, LUCs are depicted by level set functions and the shape interpolation method is employed to generate sample LUCs. Then, one Kriging metamodel is constructed to predict the mechanical properties of LUCs within FGCS, so as to reduce the computational expense involved in finite element analysis of LUCs. Meanwhile, the other Kriging metamodel is created to predict the values of shape interpolation function, and a Kriging-assisted morphological post-process method is put forward to achieve the smooth transition between adjacent graded LUCs. In the proposed method, the effective densities, mechanical properties, and geometrical configurations of LUCs are coupled by Kriging metamodels, so that the multiscale design of FGCS can be realized at a low computational burden by optimizing the distribution of elemental densities, and this also paves the way for design of FGCS with irregular geometries by morphological post-process and geometry reconstruction. Numerical examples are presented to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method for design of FGCS. What is more, the design of a pillow bracket with a slightly complex geometry is provided to illustrate the engineering application of the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed method is effective and universal for designing FGCS with smoothly-varying LUCs.},

The primary goal is to ensure optimized designs are manufacturable, and more specifically, are optimized considering the geometric restrictions associated with the considered manufacturing process. Herein we consider the manufacturing process of machining, which imposes a challenging set of geometric restrictions compared to free-form topology optimization. We consider the case of 2.5 axis machining, as well as more general 5-axis machining, and use a projection-based approach for ensuring designed voids have a direct path to the boundary of the design domain along a candidate machining axis, and at a minimum feature size of the machining tool. As with other projection approaches, these manufacturing constraints are achieved through the projection operations and explicit constraints are not needed. Intermediate volume fractions are prevented through SIMP penalization and sensitivities are computed by the adjoint method for use in a typical gradient-based optimizer. Various 2D and 3D minimum compliance examples are presented, and solutions are shown to respect the imposed 2.5 axis and 5 axis machining constraints with near 0/1 (void/solid) final distributions of material.},

On the other hand, the Kriging-based RBDO methods still ensue high computational demands for complex RBDO problems and especially those with implicit objective and constraint functions. To enhance the computational efficiency of the Kriging-based RBDO methods, this study proposes an efficient local adaptive Kriging approximation method with single-loop strategy (LAKAM-SLS), in which Kriging models are employed to replace both the objective and constraint functions. Two different criteria are developed to identify whether Kriging model of performance function in probability constraint is active in each iteration. If the criterion is satisfied, approximate inverse most probable point (IMPP) derived by combining sing-loop approach with Kriging will be used to refine the corresponding Kriging model. For the objective function, its Kriging model is sequentially refined through points selected by a newly proposed learning function from the sample pool generated by taking the optimal solution from each iteration as the sampling center. Four benchmark examples and an application example of head pressure shell are implemented to evaluate the computational performance of the currently proposed LAKAM-SLS against other Kriging-based RBDO methods. The result comparison shows that the currently proposed LAKAM-SLS substantially reduces the computational expense to a relatively low level.},

  abstract     = {In numerical simulations where complex fracture behavior plays a prominent role in the material’s mechanical behavior, particle methods are an attractive computational tool since they adequately accommodate arbitrary discontinuities. However, existing particle methods are either limited in their constitutive flexibility, like the Discrete Element Method (DEM), or prone to instabilities, like Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and Peridynamics . In this paper we present an alternative particle formulation, referred to as the Continuum Bond Method (CBM). The method has the same constitutive flexibility as conventional continuum methods like the Finite Element Method (FEM), while still being able to incorporate arbitrary discontinuities as in particle methods like DEM, SPH and Peridynamics. In CBM, the continuum body is divided into a series of material points where each material point carries a fraction of the body’s mass. A triangulation procedure establishes the bonds between the particles that interact with each other. The deformation gradient tensor is determined via a volume weighted averaging procedure over the volumes spanned by pairs of nearest neighboring particles . The obtained approximation of the continuum deformation field on the particles allows for a straightforward implementation of continuum constitutive laws. To assess this property in CBM, simulation outcomes for an elastic nonlinear plastic tensile bar are compared to FEM and SPH results. While the stress–strain curves obtained by FEM, CBM and SPH coincide quite accurately, it is found that the local plastic strains obtained by CBM are much closer to the FEM reference solution than the SPH results. The ability of CBM to account for arbitrary discontinuities is demonstrated via a series of dynamic fracture simulations. It is shown that, without the need of additional crack tracking routines, CBM can account for fracture instability phenomena like branches. In conclusion, CBM is suitable for the implementation of continuum constitutive behavior while maintaining the advantageous discontinuous fracture properties of particle methods.},

In this frame, the formation of peridynamic interface bond force is presented for nonlocal interface modeling, and the energy release rate and mode mixity of interface cracks are computed with peridynamic model. A modified critical energy density (MCED) criterion considering both interfacial and materials fracture toughness is proposed for peridynamic bond failure analysis, and the bond failure competition strategy is considered for crack path selection of an interface crack along or kinking out of the interface. Then, four tests of a bimaterial plate under uniform tensile stress, asymmetric bimaterial cantilever beams (ABCB), bimaterial single edge notched (BSEN) and four-point shearing (FPS) tests are investigated for the model verification and application. The deformation and fracture behaviors of these specimens are predicted with the proposed peridynamic models, and compared to those from FEM, theoretical and experimental solutions. The results show that the proposed peridynamics-based method can successfully capture the characteristics of bimaterial interface fracture, including the delamination fracture, kinking nucleation and crack path selection of interface cracks.},

  abstract     = {A novel isogeometric analysis-based stiffness spreading method (IGA-based SSM) is proposed for the truss layout optimization design within a continuum, where the topology, geometry, and cross-sectional areas of the truss elements can be simultaneously optimized. The IGA-based SSM based on energy conservation is employed to obtain the spreading stiffness matrices of the truss elements that are embedded in weak IGA background grids. The IGA background grids are constructed using high-order continuous isogeometric elements that can overcome the limitation of discontinuous sensitivity derived by traditional C 0 C0 elements. Because the sensitivity required for the optimization can be obtained analytically, gradient-based optimization algorithms can be easily implemented. To verify the effectiveness of the IGA-based SSM for truss layout optimization design, typical illustrative examples are used, considering the compliance minimization optimization problem . The proposed method can provide a continuous and smooth sensitivity field and overcome the numerical inaccuracy caused by interpolation methods, such as the radial basis function . The different background mesh sizes , initial layouts, and orders p of nonuniform rational B-splines basis functions are investigated in truss layout optimization. The results indicate that the selection of the appropriate background mesh size can avoid the problem of discontinuous truss connections, C 1 C1 -continuous isogeometric elements can provide better optimization designs with a lower computational cost, and the proposed method can provide a clear layout for different initial layouts. Moreover, the spatial truss layout optimization problem and the min–max displacement optimization problem are also studied to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, the proposed method is extended to solve the concentrated force diffusion problem that widely exists in the interstage adapters of launch vehicles by adding the variance constraint of reaction forces. The results indicate that the proposed method can obtain required concentrated force diffusion results with reasonable stiffness distributions .},

This study introduces two numerical differentiation approaches for eigensystems : one obtains derivatives of both eigenvalues and eigenvectors by inductively solving linear equations derived from an HDN formulation of eigensystem, and the other specializes in solving derivatives of a function represented by eigenvalues, such as the Helmholtz free energy function in the Ogden model , a representative example of the eigenvalue-based hyperelastic material models. Because these approaches differ considerably in applicability and computational cost, this study proposes a numerical differentiation method that uses both complementarily. The proposed method can accurately compute higher-order derivatives even if the second-order tensors have multiple solutions for eigenvalues. Moreover, applying the proposed method to an incremental variational formulation (IVF) leads to robust and accurate computations for the Ogden material model. These results imply that IVF facilitates the implementation of several constitutive models in a unified manner, and the proposed method broadens the scope of these models, including eigensystem expressions.},

Then, by introducing two power-type scalar auxiliary variables in the phase field equations for the potential energy terms and an exponential-type one in the momentum equation with respect to the inertial term , we transform the proposed model to an equivalent form . Furthermore, with the help of the derived three scalar auxiliary variables (3-SAV) equations, via utilizing the pressure correction method and implicit–explicit techniques in a proper sequence to eliminate the influence of the skew-symmetric loss in the surface finite element method , and applying stabilized methods for the convective and diffusion terms in the phase field and momentum equations according to the feature of the velocity field on surfaces respectively, we construct a linearized and decoupled fully discrete scheme, in which only some linear equations need to be solved at each time step. The unconditional energy stability of the fully discrete scheme is also proved. Finally, we show some numerical examples to verify the rationality of the model and the efficiency of the scheme, and discuss the influence of the geometric curvature and fluid flows on the system.},

The material distribution is discretized by bilinear elements such that the nodal values are the design variables to be identified. Independent FE analysis and material discretization , as well as flexible incorporation of experimental data , offer high robustness and control. Three elementary test cases and one application example, which exhibit large deformations and different challenges, are considered: uniaxial tension, pure bending, sheet inflation, and abdominal wall pressurization . Experiment-like results are generated from high-resolution simulations with the subsequent addition of up to 4% noise. Local optimization based on the trust-region approach is used. The results show that with a sufficient number of experimental measurements, design variables and analysis elements, the algorithm is capable to reconstruct material distributions with high precision even in the presence of large noise. The proposed formulation is very general, facilitating its extension to other material models, optimization algorithms and meshing approaches.

  abstract     = {A single-step high-order implicit time integration scheme for the solution of transient as well as wave propagation problems is presented. It is constructed from the Padé expansion of the matrix exponential solution of a system of first-order ordinary differential equations formulated in the state–space. By exploiting the techniques of polynomial factorization and partial fractions of rational functions, and by decoupling the solution for the displacement and velocity vectors a computationally efficient scheme is developed. An important feature of the novel algorithm is that no direct inversion of the mass matrix is required. Based on the diagonal Padé expansion of order M M a time-stepping scheme of order 2 M 2M is constructed. When M M is odd, one system of equation with a real matrix and ( M − 1 ) / 2 (M−1)/2 systems of equations with complex matrices are solved recursively. When M M is even, there are M / 2 M/2 systems of equations with complex matrices . These systems are sparse and comparable in complexity to the standard Newmark method, i.e., the effective system matrix is a linear combination of the static stiffness , damping, and mass matrices. The derived second-order scheme is analytically equivalent to Newmark constant average acceleration method . The proposed time integrator has been implemented in MATLAB and FORTRAN using direct linear equation solvers. In this article, numerical examples featuring nearly one million degrees of freedom are presented to highlight the exceptional accuracy and efficiency of the novel time-stepping scheme in comparison with established second-order methods.

  abstract     = {This article presents a continuous–discontinuous approach that provides a discontinuous character to the quasi-brittle fracture process, modeled in a continuous setting through a micromorphic stress-based localizing gradient damage framework. The discontinuous framework is developed by enhancing the problem fields using discontinuous interpolations in the critically damaged regions exploiting local partition of unity via the eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM). The proposed approach incorporates an improved spatial nonlocal diffusive behavior in the continuous bulk through an additional microforce balance equation to ensure an improved prediction of the initial phase of the loading process. Level sets are computed to track the discontinuity within the finite element mesh, predicted via evolving micromorphic equivalent strain. Here, the proposed continuous–discontinuous approach combines the advantages of the gradient damage method and the XFEM while exhibiting improved convergence using low-order finite elements during numerical simulations. The enhanced numerical kinematics of the proposed approach successfully eliminates damage spreading during the final failure stages and provides an accurate description of a true discontinuity without using cohesive zone modeling. Various representative structural examples of benchmark tests involving varying loading conditions are investigated to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach to provide qualitative and quantitative accurate numerical predictions .},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the dual interpolation boundary face method (DiBFM) based on a binary tree grid for solving the 3-D potential problems. The subdivision method based on binary tree algorithm is capable to generate both continuous and discontinuous grids, and to achieve the grids​ generation for arbitrary complex model much easier and automatically. By adding virtual nodes on the vertices and edges of traditional discontinuous element, the dual interpolation elements are introduced while the order is increased by two. The values of physical variables are approximated by Lagrange interpolation polynomial in the first-layer interpolation, and meshless interpolation is used to condense the degree of freedom of virtual nodes in the second-layer interpolation. Since no requirement is needed for the continuity of grids in the DiBFM, the dilemma of discontinuous grids are avoidable. In this paper, the DiBFM is implemented based on the binary tree grids to solve general problems with thin-wall structures and “geometrical construction noise”.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a systematic design optimization approach for shells with self-supporting infills for Additive Manufacturing (AM). The design workflow includes a concurrent Topology Optimization (TO) of the shells and the infills using a density based TO approach, followed by a model reconstruction that is tailored to guarantee a precise overhang control on the output Boundary-represented (B-rep) geometry. In the TO model, a new overhang constraint is developed to ensure that the TO result satisfying an overhang angle is defined on a basis of the discrete mesh elements. The TO process is stabilized by utilizing an adaptive parameter updating strategy and a two-field based formulation is proposed to control the minimum length scale . The topology optimized result is re-constructed into a B-rep model afterwards, in which the maximum overhang span of the explicit geometry is strictly controlled to satisfy the manufacturability requirement of an actual AM process . By applying the proposed TO and the associated geometry reconstruction together, the optimized infills are not only self-supporting but also can support the optimized shells from the structural inside. Truly manufacturable shell–infill structures with desirable mechanical properties can be obtained regardless of the voxel granularity of TO. Numerical examples and AM prototypes are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and the applicability of the proposed approach.},

In this method, the phase-field fracture formulation relying on the microforce balance law and the second law of thermodynamics is adopted as a nonlocal damage function for the elastoplastic fracture analysis. A smooth two-yield-surface plasticity constitutive model is utilized to evaluate the brittle–ductile failure transition behavior of pressure-sensitive geomaterials. The coupling effect of phase-field fracture model and cap plasticity model is established by introducing an effective phase-field stress and splitting the total stored energy into elastic and plastic parts. The implicit material point method that can avoid severe mesh distortion and improve numerical stability is then developed to solve the quasi-static elastoplastic fracture finite deformation problem. Furthermore, the convected particle domain interpolation technique is adopted to eliminate numerical noises and improve computational accuracy while material points crossing cell boundaries in modeling the large deformation brittle–ductile failure transition process. The staggered incremental iterative scheme is carried out to solve the coupled discrete governing equations. The accuracy and capability of the proposed PF-ICPDI method are demonstrated through several representative numerical examples, as well as the effects of main material parameters on the phase-field brittle–ductile failure transition modeling of geomaterials are discussed.},

A smoothing tangent operator consistent with the unconstrained stress updating strategy is derived from preserving the quadratic convergence speed for the global solution. Specifically, the relationship and difference between the consistent and continuum tangent operators are analysed from the perspectives of algebra and geometry. In addition, the nonlinear constitutive equations obtained by the backward Euler integration scheme are solved by the double dogleg trust region method (improved by non-monotonic technology), where a larger strain increment than that of the newton method is allowed for the stress updating. Then, the modified Cam-clay model for soil is implemented in ABAQUS/Standard by the proposed algorithm. The results of numerical examples show that the algorithm has significant advantages in terms of computation efficiency and robustness in contrast to the ABAQUS/Standard default integration algorithm, especially for the condition of large load increments and cyclic loadings. More than twice the computational efficiency of the ABAQUS/Standard default integration algorithm can be observed in the representative numerical examples.

For different contrasts between phases, the method is tested on synthetically generated data and a parametric study is performed. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to iterate between DDI and CA in order to improve the method’s predictions when it is limited by scarce input data .

This approach, which is an extension of the standard Virtual Element Method (VEM), facilitates mesh-independent modeling of crack discontinuities and elastic crack-tip singularities on general polygonal meshes . For elastic fracture in the X-VEM, the standard virtual element space is augmented by additional basis functions that are constructed by multiplying standard virtual basis functions by suitable enrichment fields, such as asymptotic mixed-mode crack-tip solutions. The design of the X-VEM requires an extended projector that maps functions lying in the extended virtual element space onto a set spanned by linear polynomials and the enrichment fields. An efficient scheme to compute the mixed-mode stress intensity factors using the domain form of the interaction integral is described. The formulation permits integration of weakly singular functions to be performed over the boundary edges of the element. Numerical experiments are conducted on benchmark mixed-mode linear elastic fracture problems that demonstrate the sound accuracy and optimal convergence in energy of the proposed formulation.},

The fully implicit time integration of the coupled system is recast into a barrier-augmented unconstrained nonlinear optimization problem. A modified line-search Newton’s method is adopted to strictly prevent material points from penetrating the FEM domain, ensuring convergence and feasibility regardless of the time step size or the mesh resolutions. The proposed coupling scheme also reduces to a new approach for imposing separable frictional kinematic boundaries for MPM when all nodal displacements in the FEM domain are prescribed with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Compared to standard implicit time integration, the extra algorithmic components associated with the contact treatment only depend on simple point-segment (or point-triangle in 3D) geometric queries which robustly handle arbitrary FEM mesh boundaries represented with codimension-1 simplices. Experiments and analyses are performed to demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {An innovative stiffener layout optimization framework is proposed based on the isogeometric analysis-based stiffness spreading method (IGA-based SSM), where the shape and size of stiffeners can be simultaneously optimized. The IGA-based SSM is employed to obtain the stiffness spreading matrices of the stiffeners that are embedded in the flat plate. The flat plate is modeled by high-order continuous isogeometric degenerated shell elements that can provide a smooth sensitivity field. Since the sensitivity required for the optimization can be obtained analytically, a gradient-based optimization algorithm can be employed. Moreover, the ground structure is used to provide the initial layouts of stiffeners and ensure the connectivity of stiffeners. A local geometry control strategy is also adopted to avoid the intersection of stiffeners in the optimization process. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method, typical illustrative examples are discussed in detail, considering the compliance minimization optimization problem . Compared with the continuum topology optimization method, the proposed method can provide a clear stiffener layout with a lower computational cost due to fewer design variables and fewer degrees of freedom of the optimization problem. Besides, the maximum thicknesses of stiffeners can be explicitly controlled, and it can easily solve the optimization problem of various volume fraction constraints. Finally, the proposed method is extended to solve a layout optimization problem of the engine nozzle adjusting plate under pressure loads, which obtains a good stiffener layout under the maximum displacement constraint.},

  abstract     = {Mild Traumatic Brain Injuries (mTBI) are caused by violent head motions or impacts. Most mTBI prevention strategies explicitly or implicitly rely on a “brain injury criterion”. A brain injury criterion takes some descriptors of the head’s motion as input and yields a prediction for that motion’s potential for causing mTBI as the output. The inputs are descriptors of the head’s motion that are usually synthesized from accelerometer and gyroscope data. In the context of brain injury criterion, the head is modeled as a rigid body. We present an algorithm for determining the complete motion of the head using data from only four head mounted tri-axial accelerometers. In contrast to inertial measurement unit based algorithms for determining rigid body motion, the presented algorithm does not depend on data from gyroscopes, which consume much more power than accelerometers. Several algorithms that also make use of data from only accelerometers already exist. However, those algorithms, except for the recently presented AO (accelerometer-only) algorithm [Rahaman MM, Fang W, Fawzi AL, Wan Y, Kesari H (2020): J Mech Phys Solids 104014], give the rigid body’s acceleration field in terms of the body frame, which in general is unknown. Compared to the AO-algorithm the presented algorithm is much more insensitive to bias type errors, such as those that arise from inaccurate measurement of sensor positions and orientations.},

  abstract     = {The algebraic flux correction (AFC) schemes presented in this work constrain a standard continuous finite element discretization of a nonlinear hyperbolic problem to satisfy relevant maximum principles and entropy stability conditions. The desired properties are enforced by applying a limiter to antidiffusive fluxes that represent the difference between the high-order baseline scheme and a property-preserving approximation of Lax–Friedrichs type. In the first step of the limiting procedure, the given target fluxes are adjusted in a way that guarantees preservation of local and/or global bounds. In the second step, additional limiting is performed, if necessary, to ensure the validity of fully discrete and/or semi-discrete entropy inequalities. The limiter-based entropy fixes considered in this work are applicable to finite element discretizations of scalar hyperbolic equations and systems alike. The underlying inequality constraints are formulated using Tadmor’s entropy stability theory. The proposed limiters impose entropy-conservative or entropy-dissipative bounds on the rate of entropy production by antidiffusive fluxes and Runge–Kutta (RK) time discretizations. Two versions of the fully discrete entropy fix are developed for this purpose. The first one incorporates temporal entropy production into the flux constraints, which makes them more restrictive and dependent on the time step. The second algorithm interprets the final stage of a high-order AFC-RK method as a constrained antidiffusive correction of an implicit low-order scheme (algebraic Lax–Friedrichs in space + backward Euler in time). In this case, iterative flux correction is required, but the inequality constraints are less restrictive and limiting can be performed using algorithms developed for the semi-discrete problem. To motivate the use of limiter-based entropy fixes, we prove a finite element version of the Lax–Wendroff theorem and perform numerical studies for standard test problems. In our numerical experiments, entropy-dissipative schemes converge to correct weak solutions of scalar conservation laws, of the Euler equations, and of the shallow water equations.},

  abstract     = {Obstacles, such as voids and precipitates, are prevalent in crystalline materials. They strengthen crystals by serving as barriers to dislocation glide . In this work, we develop a phase-field dislocation dynamics (PFDD) technique for investigating the interactions between dislocations and second-phase obstacles, which can be either voids or precipitates. The PFDD technique is constructed to account for elastic heterogeneity, elastic anisotropy, dissociation of the dislocation, and dislocation transmission across bicrystalline interfaces. Within the framework, we present a model for “pseudo-voids”, which are voids shearable by dislocations, in contrast to unphysical, unshearable voids in conventional phase-field dislocation formulations. We employ the PFDD technique to investigate the in-plane interactions between an edge dislocation and an array of nano-scale obstacles with different spacings. In this application, the interactions take place in glide planes of either a face-centered cubic (FCC) Cu or a body-centered cubic (BCC) Nb matrix, while the precipitates have a Cu 1 − x 1−x Nb x x composition, with x x varying from 0.1 to 0.9. Our atomistic simulations find that the alloy precipitates can have an FCC, an amorphous, or a BCC phase , depending on the compositional ratio between Cu and Nb, i.e., value of x x . Among all types of obstacles, the critical stresses for dislocation bypass are the highest for unshearable amorphous precipitates, followed by shearable crystalline precipitates, and then the pseudo-voids.},

  abstract     = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are increasingly employed to replace/augment traditional numerical methods in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). While state-of-the-art PINNs have many attractive features, they approximate a specific realization of a PDE system and hence are problem-specific. That is, the model needs to be re-trained each time the boundary conditions (BCs) and domain shape/size change. This limitation prohibits the application of PINNs to realistic or large-scale engineering problems especially since the costs and efforts associated with their training are considerable. We introduce a transferable framework for solving boundary value problems (BVPs) via deep neural networks which can be trained once and used forever for various unseen domains and BCs. We first introduce genomic flow network (GFNet), a neural network that can infer the solution of a BVP across arbitrary BCs on a small square domain called genome . Then, we propose mosaic flow (MF) predictor, a novel iterative algorithm that assembles the GFNet’s inferences for BVPs on large domains with unseen sizes/shapes and BCs while preserving the spatial regularity of the solution. We demonstrate that our framework can estimate the solution of Laplace and Navier–Stokes equations in domains of unseen shapes and BCs that are, respectively, 1200 and 12 times larger than the training domains. Since our framework eliminates the need to re-train models for unseen domains and BCs, it demonstrates up to 3 orders-of-magnitude speedups compared to the state-of-the-art.},

To remove the need for a predefined global parametric domain, Principal Component Analysis is employed in a meshfree setting to develop a local parameterization of the shell midsurface . The KL shell kinematics is utilized to develop a correspondence-based PD formulation. A bond-stabilization technique is employed to naturally achieve stability of the discrete solution. Only the mid-surface velocity degrees of freedom are used in the governing thin-shell equations. 3D rate-form material models are employed to enable simulating a wide range of material behavior . A bond-associative damage correspondence modeling approach is adopted to use classical failure criteria at the bond level, which readily enables the simulation of brittle and ductile fracture . Discretizing the model with asymptotically compatible meshfree approximation provides a scheme which converges to the classical KL shell model while providing an accurate and flexible framework for treating fracture. A wide range of numerical examples , ranging from elastostatics to problems involving plasticity, fracture, and fragmentation, are conducted to validate the accuracy, convergence, and robustness of the developed PD thin-shell formulation. It is also worth noting that the present method naturally enables the discretization of a shell theory requiring higher-order smoothness on a completely unstructured surface mesh.},

The main novelties of this development are the free-surface treatment using surface fitting and the new discretization schemes. By using linear surface fitting, the normal vector and the signed distance to the free surface are accurately and stably obtained. The existing consistent spatial discretization scheme, namely, the LSMPS scheme, is extended by adopting regularized least squares, diffuse derivative constraints, and constrained least squares. Based on this scheme, new formulations are proposed particularly for the pressure Poisson equation and the pressure gradient operator. By using a Taylor–Green vortex problem, 2nd-order accuracy in space is confirmed for the 2nd-order discretization scheme. Furthermore, highly accurate solutions are obtained for various test cases, including free-surface deformations of moderate to high complexity. Thus, the proposed method is indicated to have high accuracy and stability for complex free-surface flow simulations.},

The proposed HiDeNN-TD method keeps advantages of both HiDeNN and TD methods. The automatic mesh adaptivity makes the HiDeNN-TD more accurate than the finite element method (FEM) and conventional proper generalized decomposition (PGD) and TD, using a fraction of the FEM degrees of freedom. This work focuses on the theoretical foundation of the method. Hence, the accuracy and convergence of the method have been studied theoretically and numerically, with a comparison to different methods, including FEM, PGD, TD, HiDeNN and Deep Neural Networks . In addition, we have theoretically shown that the PGD/TD converges to FEM at increasing modes, and the PGD/TD solution error is a summation of the mesh discretization error and the mode reduction error. The proposed HiDeNN-TD shows a high accuracy with orders of magnitude fewer degrees of freedom than FEM, and hence a high potential to achieve fast computations with a high level of accuracy for large-size engineering and scientific problems. As a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we propose a highly efficient solution strategy called HiDeNN-PGD. Although the solution is less accurate than HiDeNN-TD, HiDeNN-PGD still provides a higher accuracy than PGD/TD and FEM with only a small amount of additional cost to PGD.},

The proposed methodology is especially useful for complex physical problems , where the derivation of the adjoint system can be a challenging task. The algorithm considers the finite volume model to solve the state equations , and uses an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) scheme during the optimization to enhance the definition of the solid–fluid interface while trying to maintain a competitive computational cost. The implementation is done by using the OpenFOAM platform, which can be modified to address algorithm needs (DA and AMR).

This new approach uses the notion of equivalent polynomials, introduced previously in the context of the eXtended Finite Element Methods (XFEM), to implement exact integration for terms involving products of polynomials with Heaviside and Dirac distributions. Combining CutFEM and equivalent polynomials results in a method for fluid–structure interaction that (1) has the same number of degrees of freedom as the underlying conforming Galerkin method on the fixed background mesh, which is independent of the configuration of non-conforming interfaces, (2) has the same element assembly structure as classical FEM on the background mesh—with standard quadrature rules, and (3) retains the convergence properties , indeed the precise theoretical structure, of the original CutFEM method. The result is a method that is robust, accurate, and efficient for interacting particles, and which provides a convenient approach for upgrading legacy finite element codes to include embedded boundaries with CutFEM or similar formulations that can retain the same asymptotic accuracy as the underlying boundary conforming finite element method.},

For the four-fold symmetric formulation we show that the standard quadratic degradation function is unsuitable and devise a procedure to derive a suitable one.

  abstract     = {Nonlocal models , including peridynamics , often use integral operators that embed lengthscales in their definition. However, the integrands in these operators are difficult to define from the data that are typically available for a given physical system , such as laboratory mechanical property tests. In contrast, molecular dynamics (MD) does not require these integrands , but it suffers from computational limitations in the length and time scales it can address. To combine the strengths of both methods and to obtain a coarse-grained, homogenized continuum model that efficiently and accurately captures materials’ behavior, we propose a learning framework to extract, from MD data, an optimal Linear Peridynamic Solid (LPS) model as a surrogate for MD displacements. To maximize the accuracy of the learnt model we allow the peridynamic influence function to be partially negative, while preserving the well-posedness of the resulting model. To achieve this, we provide sufficient well-posedness conditions for discretized LPS models with sign-changing influence functions and develop a constrained optimization algorithm that minimizes the equation residual while enforcing such solvability conditions . This framework guarantees that the resulting model is mathematically well-posed, physically consistent, and that it generalizes well to settings that are different from the ones used during training. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach with several numerical tests for single layer graphene . Our two-dimensional tests show the robustness of the proposed algorithm on validation data sets that include thermal noise, different domain shapes and external loadings, and discretizations substantially different from the ones used for training.},

Recent advances in deep learning have shown the great potential of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve PDEs as a basis for data-driven modeling and inverse analysis. However, the majority of existing PINN methods, based on fully-connected NNs, pose intrinsic limitations to low-dimensional spatiotemporal parameterizations. Moreover, since the initial/boundary conditions (I/BCs) are softly imposed via penalty, the solution quality heavily relies on hyperparameter tuning. To this end, we propose the novel physics-informed convolutional-recurrent learning architectures (PhyCRNet and PhyCRNet-s) for solving PDEs without any labeled data. Specifically, an encoder–decoder convolutional long short-term memory network is proposed for low-dimensional spatial feature extraction and temporal evolution learning. The loss function is defined as the aggregated discretized PDE residuals, while the I/BCs are hard-encoded in the network to ensure forcible satisfaction (e.g., periodic boundary padding). The networks are further enhanced by autoregressive and residual connections that explicitly simulate time marching. The performance of our proposed methods has been assessed by solving three nonlinear PDEs (e.g., 2D Burgers’ equations, the λ - ω and FitzHugh Nagumo reaction–diffusion equations), and compared against the start-of-the-art baseline algorithms. The numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methodology in the context of solution accuracy, extrapolability and generalizability.},

The proposed method enables flexible non-body-fitted discretization , approximations , and quadrature rules for solid and fluid subdomains . The interfacial compatibility conditions are imposed by a volumetric constraint, which avoids the tedious contour integral and interface tracking. The reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM) is employed for both solid and fluid sub-systems, which allows arbitrary control of the orders of continuity and approximation, as well as flexibility in discretization , making it particularly advantageous for modeling fluid–structure interaction (FSI). In the proposed approach, the fictitious fluid is combined with the foreground solid, forming an “effective solid problem” solved on a moving foreground domain, while the background fluid problem is solved with prescribed solid velocity in the overlapping domain to reduce the leaking instability and mesh sensitivity. The variational multiscale immersed method (VMIM) is employed to enhance accuracy and stability in FS coupling, which leads to a residual-based stabilization. The MUSCL-SCNI shock algorithm provides a natural way of introducing the Riemann solution in the shock algorithm via the SCNI contour integral for desirable accuracy. The employment of SCNI in the proposed framework also provides computational efficiency, accuracy, and stability. Using a larger RKPM support size in the fluid domain can effectively suppress the leaking instability. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified in solving several FSI problems with shock waves, and the enhanced stability and accuracy of the proposed methods compared to the classical immersed approach have also been demonstrated.},

To achieve the desired motion, these soft active structures can be designed by tailoring the layouts of the ferromagnetic soft polymer. Although many magnetic soft active structures have been designed and fabricated, they are limited by the developer’s intuition and experience. Structural topology optimization has become a promising method to achieve innovative structures by optimizing the material layout, opening a new path for architecting ferromagnetic-driven active structures. Given the widespread adoption of thin-shell structures for soft robots , the extended level set method (X-LSM) and conformal geometry theory are employed to perform topology optimization of the ferromagnetic soft active structures on manifolds. The boundary evolution on a free-form 3D surface can be transferred into a 2D rectangular plane by solving a modified Hamilton–Jacobi equation weighted by conformal factors. The reconciled level set (RLS) method is firstly implemented within the X-LSM framework in this paper to enable the design of multi-material ferromagnetic soft active structures on free-from surfaces. The design objective consists of a subobjective function for kinematic requirement and a subobjective function for minimum compliance. The shape sensitivity was analyzed using the material time derivative and the adjoint variable approach. The proposed method was applied to design several single and multi-material ferromagnetic soft active structures. Two topologically optimized designs have been printed using functional 3D printing technology, or the so-called 4D printing, to physically realize soft active structures with built-in functionalities. The results of the numerical verification and experimental validation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design and fabrication framework.},

  abstract     = {Efficient and precise prediction of plasticity by data-driven models relies on appropriate data preparation and a well-designed model. Here we introduce an unsupervised machine learning-based data preparation method to maximize the trainability of crystal orientation evolution data during deformation. For Taylor model crystal plasticity data, the preconditioning procedure improves the test score of an artificial neural network from 0.831 to 0.999, while decreasing the training iterations by an order of magnitude. The efficacy of the approach was further improved with a recurrent neural network. Electron backscattered (EBSD) lab measurements of crystal rotation during rolling were compared with the results of the surrogate model, and despite error introduced by Taylor model simplifying assumptions, very reasonable agreement between the surrogate model and experiment was observed. Our method is foundational for further data-driven studies, enabling the efficient and precise prediction of texture evolution from experimental and simulated crystal plasticity results.},

  abstract     = {In dynamical systems , fiber-reinforced materials with fiber rovings in a cured matrix material , woven or manufactured by the technology of tailored fiber placement (TFP), for instance, have gained great significance for engineers. Therefore, many finite element simulations are currently in progress during the design of composite parts. But, standard finite element formulations do not take into account dimensions and the direction-dependent flexure and twist stiffness of the rovings. In order to avoid computationally costly mesoscopic finite element models with a discretization of roving-matrix interior boundary interfaces, a macroscopic material model can be derived by introducing micropolar rotation degrees of freedom . Micropolar rotation degrees of freedom allow for a separate constitutive description of the direction-dependent stiffness and inertia of the rovings in the cured matrix material. This continuum model represents an extended continuum formulation with an extended set of balance laws. In its computational setting, the discrete preservation of the complete set of balance laws can be realized by a mixed principle of virtual power in connection with energy–momentum tension stress and couple stress formulas. The guaranteed algorithmic energy–momentum consistency then allows an one-off virtual parameter identification of the macroscopic material constants with the mesoscopic model based on the error of the balance functions. Therefore, a mixed finite element formulation with independent micropolar rotation degrees of freedom is recently published, which are able to simulate dynamical problems by taking into account flexure and twist of the rovings. In this previously published paper, the constitutive laws are at most quadratic such that energy–momentum time integrations are possible without a special couple stress approximation . If a nonlinear strain energy function for flexure and twist of the rovings is considered, a new special couple stress approximation is necessary. Therefore, the present paper completes this mixed finite element formulation with a new couple stress approximation and shows its application by means of that numerical experiments with unidirectional rovings, which are designed for the virtual parameter identification. These fully dynamical examples with large translations, rotations and deformations demonstrate the flexure and twist stiffness of the rovings with roving curvature–twist strain energy functions of Kauderer-type by parameter studies. The complete set of discrete balance laws are satisfied independent of boundary conditions in order to allow the upcoming virtual parameter identification.},

The mesh objectivity is obtained by developing two nonlocal formulations of the well known Johnson-Cook damage criterion: an integral and a gradient enhanced formulation. Unlike previous nonlocal models in which the nonlocal variable is the plastic strain, we adopt the ratio of the plastic strain and the failure strain as the nonlocal variable. Using one simulation we demonstrate that the integral type nonlocal formulation results in incorrect damage initiation (i.e., not at the sample edge but within the sample). We then focus on the gradient enhanced formulation and use it to simulate three common benchmarks for quasi-static large strain ductile fracture of metals and one impact fracture of a metal plate hit by a blunt bullet. All the results exhibit mesh independence and are in good agreement with previous findings and experiments.},

  abstract     = {Time-stable, high order accurate and explicit numerical methods are effective for hyperbolic wave propagation problems. As a result of the complexities of real geometries , internal interfaces and nonlinear boundary and interface conditions , discontinuities and sharp wave fronts may become fundamental features of the solution. Therefore, geometrically flexible and adaptive numerical algorithms are crucial for high fidelity and efficient simulations of wave phenomena in many applications. Adaptive curvilinear meshes hold promise to minimise the effort to represent complicated geometries or heterogeneous material data avoiding the bottleneck of feature-preserving meshing . To enable the design of stable DG methods on three space dimensional (3D) curvilinear elements we construct a structure preserving skew-symmetric coordinate transformation motivated by the underlying physics. Using a physics-based numerical penalty-flux, we develop a 3D provably energy-stable discontinuous Galerkin finite element approximation of the elastic wave equation in geometrically complex and heterogeneous media. By construction, our numerical flux is upwind and yields a discrete energy estimate analogous to the continuous energy estimate. The ability to treat conforming and non-conforming curvilinear elements allows for flexible adaptive mesh refinement strategies. The numerical scheme has been implemented in ExaHyPE, a simulation engine for parallel dynamically adaptive simulations of wave problems on adaptive Cartesian meshes. We present 3D numerical experiments of wave propagation in heterogeneous isotropic and anisotropic elastic solids demonstrating stability and high order accuracy. We demonstrate the potential of our approach for computational seismology in a regional wave propagation scenario in a geologically constrained 3D model including the geometrically complex free-surface topography of Mount Zugspitze, Germany .},

Here, we propose a subdomain-based method that performs topology optimization in an adaptive design domain (ADD). A subdomain-based parallel processing strategy that can vastly improve the computational efficiency is implemented. In the ADD method, the loading and boundary conditions can be easily changed in concert with the evolution of the design space. Through the automatic, flexible, and intelligent adaptation of the design space, this method is capable of generating diverse high-performance designs with distinctly different topologies. Five representative examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. The results show that, compared with conventional approaches, the ADD method can improve the structural performance substantially by simultaneously optimizing the layout of material and the extent of the design space. This work might help broaden the applications of structural topology optimization .},

  abstract     = {Highly accurate numerical or physical experiments are often very time-consuming or expensive to obtain. When time or budget restrictions prohibit the generation of additional data, the amount of available samples may be too limited to provide satisfactory model results. Multi-fidelity methods deal with such problems by incorporating information from other sources, which are ideally well-correlated with the high-fidelity data, but can be obtained at a lower cost. By leveraging correlations between different data sets, multi-fidelity methods often yield superior generalization when compared to models based solely on a small amount of high-fidelity data. In the current work, we present the use of artificial neural networks applied to multi-fidelity regression problems. By elaborating a few existing approaches, we propose new neural network architectures for multi-fidelity regression. The introduced models are compared against a traditional multi-fidelity regression scheme — co-kriging. A collection of artificial benchmarks are presented to measure the performance of the analyzed models. The results show that cross-validation in combination with Bayesian optimization leads to neural network models that outperform the co-kriging scheme. Additionally, we show an application of multi-fidelity regression to an engineering problem. The propagation of a pressure wave into an acoustic horn with parametrized shape and frequency is considered, and the index of reflection intensity is approximated using the proposed multi-fidelity models. A finite element, full-order model and a reduced-order model built through the reduced basis method are adopted as the high- and low-fidelity, respectively. It is shown that the multi-fidelity neural networks return outputs that achieve a comparable accuracy to those from the expensive, full-order model, using only very few full-order evaluations combined with a larger amount of inaccurate but cheap evaluations of the reduced order model.},

  abstract     = {Fluid–structure interaction problems (FSI) are omnipresent in a wide variety of engineering fields and includes highly non-linear physics such as violent free-surface flow, complex interfacial and inter-phase interactions, and deformable structures with the possibility of damage formations. Well-established mesh dependent approaches may suffer from dynamic mesh-refinement, special algorithms to track free surfaces and handle the interface and inter-phase physics. On the other hand, due to their inherent nature, particle based meshless methods , namely Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and Peridynamics (PD), can lend themselves easily to tackling with the above-stated complex physics involved in the fluid and structure phases of the FSI problems, respectively. This study presents a novel hybrid algorithm to couple the SPH and PD in a robust and high-fidelity manner for modeling extreme FSI problems with and without multi-scale defects. The coupled methodology is integrated with a novel mapping strategy based on Lagrange polynomial interpolation , which allows for the solution procedure to utilize different particle resolutions for fluid and deformable structural media. The mapping strategy enables one to construct a higher-accuracy PD solver that can predict the dynamic behavior of solids and provide an ability to model and track the damage nucleation, propagation, and branching in the structure phase of FSI domains. The corrected weakly compressible SPH is used for pressure–velocity coupling in the fluid phase whereas the ordinary state based PD is utilized for modeling the deformable structure. The SPH and PD solvers of the algorithm are validated separately through solving several well-accepted benchmark test cases such as the collapse of a water column, large deformation of a cantilever beam , and damage propagation in a plate under impact loading (Kalthoff–Winkler experiment). After validating each solver, the hybrid coupled SPH–PD algorithm is applied to simulate various extreme FSI problems of literature such as the dam break with an elastic gate, collapse of the water column and its hydrodynamic impact on an elastic obstacle, and the entry of a V-shaped deformable beam on the free surface of water in a tank. A close agreement between the SPH–PD results and the literature data is achieved for each of the aforementioned cases. The algorithm is further applied to model the failure propagation in the elastic wall of a tank under hydrostatic pressure. A realistic failure behavior is recorded for the FSI setups with different initial states of the wall, i.e., the wall is assumed to be with and without initial defects of different geometrical orientations. In particular, this study proposes and implements a new perspective for coupling different particle methods to achieve high-fidelity and low-cost modeling of complex FSI problems, which may involve multi-scale defects (i.e., cracks and voids) and failure propagations.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a time-periodic MGRIT algorithm is proposed as a means to reduce the time-to-solution of numerical algorithms by exploiting the time periodicity inherent to many applications in science and engineering. The time-periodic MGRIT algorithm is applied to a variety of linear and nonlinear single- and multiphysics problems that are periodic-in-time. It is demonstrated that the proposed parallel-in-time algorithm can obtain the same time-periodic steady-state solution as sequential time-stepping. It is shown that the required number of MGRIT iterations can be estimated a priori and that the new MGRIT variant can significantly and consistently reduce the time-to-solution compared to sequential time-stepping, irrespective of the number of dimensions, linear or nonlinear PDE models, single-physics or coupled problems and the employed computing resources. The numerical experiments demonstrate that the time-periodic MGRIT algorithm enables a greater level of parallelism yielding faster turnaround, and thus, facilitating more complex and more realistic problems to be solved.},

  abstract     = {We design an unfitted hybrid high-order (HHO) method for the wave equation. The wave propagates in a domain where a curved interface separates subdomains with different material properties. The key feature of the discretization method is that the interface can cut more or less arbitrarily through the mesh cells. We address both the second-order formulation in time of the wave equation and its reformulation as a first-order system. We prove H 1 H1 -error estimates for a space semi-discretization in space of the second-order formulation, leading to optimal convergence rates for smooth solutions. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical findings and show that the proposed numerical schemes can be used to simulate accurately the propagation of acoustic waves in heterogeneous media, with meshes that are not fitted to the geometry. For the second-order formulation, the implicit, second-order accurate Newmark scheme is used for the time discretization , whereas (diagonally-implicit or explicit) Runge–Kutta schemes up to fourth-order accuracy are used for the first-order formulation. In the explicit case, we study the CFL condition on the time step and observe that the unfitted approach combined with local cell agglomeration leads to a comparable condition as when using fitted meshes.},

  abstract     = {We present a novel finite element analysis of inelastic structures containing Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs). Phenomenological constitutive models for SMAs lead to material nonlinearities, that require substantial computational effort to resolve. Finite element analysis methods, which rely on Gauss quadrature integration schemes, must solve two sets of coupled differential equations: one at the global level and the other at the local, i.e. Gauss point level. In contrast to the conventional return mapping algorithm, which solves these two sets of coupled differential equations separately using a nested Newton procedure, we propose a scheme to solve the local and global differential equations simultaneously. In the process we also derive closed-form expressions used to update the internal/constitutive state variables, and unify the popular closest-point and cutting plane methods with our formulas. Numerical testing indicates that our method allows for larger thermomechanical loading steps and provides increased computational efficiency, over the standard return mapping algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Atomistic methods have successfully modeled different aspects of shock wave propagation in materials over the past several decades, but they suffer from limitations which restrict the total runtime and system size. Multiscale methods have been able to increase the length and time scales that can be modeled but employing such schemes to simulate wave propagation and evolution through engineering-scale domains is an active area of research. In this work, we develop two distinct moving window approaches within a Concurrent Atomistic–Continuum (CAC) framework to model shock wave propagation through a one-dimensional monatomic chain. In the first method, the entire CAC system travels with the shock in a conveyor fashion and maintains the shock front in the middle of the overall domain. In the second method, the atomistic region follows the shock by the simultaneous coarsening and refinement of the continuum regions. The CAC and moving window frameworks are verified through dispersion relation studies and phonon wave packet tests. We achieve good agreement between the simulated shock velocities and the values obtained from theory with the conveyor technique, while the coarsen-refine technique allows us to follow the propagating wave front through a large-scale domain. This work showcases the ability of the CAC method to accurately simulate propagating shocks and also demonstrates how a moving window technique can be used in a multiscale framework to study highly nonlinear, transient phenomena.},

  abstract     = {This paper analyses the viscoelastic up-scaling effects in electro-active polymers endowed with a micro-structure architecture in the form of a rank-one laminate. The principles of rank-n homogenisation and thermodynamical consistency are combined in the context of extremely deformable dielectric elastomers actuated well beyond the onset of geometrical instabilities. To ensure the robustness of the resulting methodology, Convex Multi-Variable (CMV) energy density functionals enriched with a nonlinear continuum viscoelastic description are used to describe the physics of the individual microscopic constituents . The high nonlinearity of the visco-electro-mechanical problem is resolved via a monolithic multi-scale Newton–Raphson scheme with a Backward-Euler (implicit) time integration scheme. A tensor cross product operation between vectors and tensors and an additive decomposition of the micro-scale deformation gradient (in terms of macro-scale and fluctuation components) are used to considerably reduce the complexity of the algebra. The resulting computational framework permits to explore the time-dependent in-silico analysis of rank-one electro-active polymer composites exhibiting extremely complex deformation patterns, paying particular attention to viscoelastic up-scaling effects. A comprehensive series of numerical examples is presented, where specially revealing conclusions about the rate-dependency of the composite electro-active polymer are observed as a function of its microstructure orientation and viscoelastic content. In a rectangular film subjected to extreme bending deformation , two different deformation modes are observed with one prevailing mode depending on the laminate composition. For the case of a square membrane where extreme deformation induces buckling, it is shown that the viscoelastic contribution leads to larger values of (stable) deformation, due to the regularisation that viscoelasticity inherently provides.},

The user can control the numerical dissipation in the discrete spectrum’s high-frequency regions by adjusting the method’s coefficients. We study the method’s spectral behaviour and show that the CFL condition is independent of the accuracy. The stability region remains invariant while increasing the number of stages, that is, the accuracy order. Next, we exploit efficient preconditioners for the isogeometric matrix to minimize the computational cost. These preconditioners use a diagonal-scaled Kronecker product of univariate parametric mass matrices ; they have a robust performance with respect to the spline degree and the mesh size , and their decomposition structure implies that their application is faster than a matrix–vector product involving the fully-assembled mass matrix. Our high-order schemes require simple modifications of the available implementations of the generalized- α α method. Finally, we present numerical examples demonstrating the methodology’s performance regarding single- and multi-patch IGA discretizations .},

In particular, the space–time solutions are sought in a low-dimensional space–time linear trial subspace that can be obtained by computing tensor decompositions of usual state-snapshots data. The mapping between the input parameters and the basis expansion coefficients (or generalized coordinates) is approximated using four different machine learning techniques: multivariate polynomial regression, k k -nearest-neighbors, random forests and neural networks. The relative costs and effectiveness of the four machine learning techniques are explored through three engineering problems: steady heat conduction, unsteady heat conduction and unsteady advective–diffusive–reactive system. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in terms of both accuracy and computational cost, and highlights the important point that the amount of model training data available in an engineering setting is often much less than it is in other machine learning applications, making it essential to incorporate knowledge from physical models.},

(2020) have made an important step forward toward addressing this issue by introducing a moving surface mesh to represent the free-surface boundary in 2D. However, the surface mesh makes it difficult to extend this methodology to 3D and to treat topological changes in free surfaces. This study aims to extend this methodology to 3D and restore the capability of the model to simulate topological changes by carefully detecting the free-surface particles. In this situation, the problems regarding fluctuated free-surface boundaries and the dynamic intersection of a free surface with a wall boundary arise. To resolve these problems, a new particle shifting method in the surface normal direction is proposed for the free-surface particles to reduce fluctuations. A new contact angle model is proposed to compute the intersection point of a free surface and a wall boundary. In this manner, an enhanced particle method suitable for simulating the dynamics of liquid droplets with possible topological changes in 3D is developed. Eight numerical examples verified the developed method and demonstrated the enhancement of the new particle shifting technique.},

The main objective is being able to efficiently identify how a variation of user-defined parameters affects the dynamic response of the structure in terms of fundamental natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes . A parametric version of the inverse power method (IPM) is presented by using the proper generalised decomposition (PGD) rationale. The proposed approach utilises the so-called encapsulated PGD toolbox and includes a new algorithm for computing the square root of a parametric object. With only one offline computation, the proposed PGD-IPM approach provides an analytical parametric expression of the smallest (in magnitude) eigenvalue (or natural frequency) and corresponding eigenvector (mode shape), which contains all the possible solutions for every combination of the parameters within pre-defined ranges. A Lagrange multiplier deflation technique is introduced in order to compute subsequent eigenpairs , which is also valid to overcome the stiffness matrix singularity in the case of a free-free structure. The proposed approach is nonintrusive and it is therefore possible to be integrated with commercial finite element (FE) packages. Two numerical examples are shown to underline the properties of the technique. The first example includes one material and one geometric parameter . The second example shows a more realistic industrial example, where the nonintrusivity of the approach is demonstrated by employing a commercial FE package for assembling the FE matrices. Finally, a multi-objective optimisation study is performed proving that the developed method could significantly assist the decision-making during the preliminary phase of a new design process.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce a new approach based on distance fields to exactly impose boundary conditions in physics-informed deep neural networks. The challenges in satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions in meshfree and particle methods are well-known. This issue is also pertinent in the development of physics informed neural networks (PINN) for the solution of partial differential equations. We introduce geometry-aware trial functions in artificial neural networks to improve the training in deep learning for partial differential equations. To this end, we use concepts from constructive solid geometry (R-functions) and generalized barycentric coordinates (mean value potential fields) to construct ϕ ( x ) ϕ(x) , an approximate distance function to the boundary of a domain in R d Rd . To exactly impose homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, the trial function is taken as ϕ ( x ) ϕ(x) multiplied by the PINN approximation, and its generalization via transfinite interpolation is used to a priori satisfy inhomogeneous Dirichlet (essential), Neumann (natural), and Robin boundary conditions on complex geometries. In doing so, we eliminate modeling error associated with the satisfaction of boundary conditions in a collocation method and ensure that kinematic admissibility is met pointwise in a Ritz method. With this new ansatz, the training for the neural network is simplified: sole contribution to the loss function is from the residual error at interior collocation points where the governing equation is required to be satisfied. Numerical solutions are computed using strong form collocation and Ritz minimization. To convey the main ideas and to assess the accuracy of the approach, we present numerical solutions for linear and nonlinear boundary-value problems over convex and nonconvex polygonal domains as well as over domains with curved boundaries. Benchmark problems in one dimension for linear elasticity, advection-diffusion, and beam bending; and in two dimensions for the steady-state heat equation, Laplace equation, biharmonic equation (Kirchhoff plate bending), and the nonlinear Eikonal equation are considered. The construction of approximate distance functions using R-functions extends to higher dimensions, and we showcase its use by solving a Poisson problem with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions over the four-dimensional hypercube. The proposed approach consistently outperforms a standard PINN-based collocation method, which underscores the importance of exactly (a priori) satisfying the boundary condition when constructing a loss function in PINN. This study provides a pathway for meshfree analysis to be conducted on the exact geometry without domain discretization.},

The effects of length scale parameter, staggered solution methods, and related factors on mechanical fields, as well as the impact of fracture on mass transfer and heat conduction are investigated.

Lastly, a set of model comparisons is presented for revealing and demonstrating some essential model peculiarities: (1) the 1D Timoshenko beam model is essentially closer to the 3D model than the corresponding Euler–Bernoulli beam model; (2) the 3D model and the 1D beam models agree on the strong size effect typical for microstructural and microarchitectural beam structures; (3) stress singularities of reentrant corners disappear in strain gradient elasticity.

For this purpose, a gradient-extended two-surface damage-plasticity model for finite strains is incorporated into a low-order solid-shell finite element formulation for large deformations which is based on reduced integration with hourglass stabilization. Due to a specific combination of the assumed natural strain (ANS) and the enhanced assumed strain (EAS) method, the most relevant locking pathologies which stem from the linear interpolation of the displacement field are eliminated. Furthermore, an additional micromorphic nodal degree of freedom which comes from the gradient extension is considered. A polynomial approximation of the kinematic as well as the constitutively dependent quantities within the weak forms provides a suitable hourglass stabilization which is computationally highly efficient, since the corresponding element residual vectors and stiffness matrices can be determined analytically. Three numerical examples of different elastic as well as elasto-plastic plate and shell configurations, reveal the ability of the present framework to efficiently and accurately predict the damage processes within both geometrically non-linear thin and thick-walled structures.},

  abstract     = {The structural complexity (the number of holes) of the 2D or 3D continuum structures can be measured by their topology invariants (i.e., Euler and Betti numbers). Controlling the 2D and 3D structural complexity is significant in topology optimization design because of the various consideration, including manufacturability and necessary structural redundancy , but remains a challenging subject. In this paper, we propose a programmable Euler–Poincaré formula to efficiently calculate the Euler and Betti numbers for the 0–1 pixel-based structures. This programmable Euler–Poincaré​ formula only relates to the nodal density and nodal characteristic vector that represents the nodal neighbor relation so that it avoids manually counting the information of the vertices, edges, and planes on the surfaces of the structure. As a result, the explicit formulations between the structural complexity (the number of holes) and the discrete density design variables for 2D and 3D continuum structures can be efficiently constructed. Furthermore, the discrete variable sensitivity of the structural complexity is calculated through the programmable Euler–Poincaré formula so that the structural complexity control problem can be efficiently and mathematically solved by Sequential Approximate Integer Programming and Canonical relaxation algorithm Various 2D and complicated 3D numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. We further believe that this study bridges the gap between structural topology optimization and mathematical topology analysis, which is much expected in the structural optimization community.},

Under this interaction viewpoint, the material network can be viewed as a trainable system involving fitting parameters including not only the weights of the material nodes but also the parameters characterizing their interactions. As opposed to the other existing works, this interaction-based material network does not rely on the micromechanics of multiple-phase laminates but on constraining all requirements of a truly microscopic boundary value problem including the stress and strain averaging principles and the Hill–Mandel energetically consistent condition. Consequently, the proposed framework can be applied to microstructures with the presence of voids, which is not achievable with the laminate theory. To make a material network become a surrogate of a full-field microscopic model, this work proposes two different training procedures to calibrate its fitting parameters. On the one hand, a nonlinear training procedure is proposed considering sequential data collected from finite element simulations on the full-field model subjected to proportional loading paths. On the other hand, a linear elastic training procedure considers only the elastic response of the heterogeneous material. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed framework for microstructures with the presence of voids are demonstrated by comparing the predictions of the trained material networks with the ones of the direct numerical simulations in both contexts of virtual testing and multiscale simulations. It is also shown that the linear elastic training procedure requires a lower computational cost but could lead to less accurate predictions in comparison with the nonlinear training procedure.},

The time integration scheme takes advantage of the notion of polyconvexity and of a new tensor cross product algebra. These two ingredients are shown to be crucial for the design of so-called discrete derivatives fundamental for the calculation of the second Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor , the entropy and the electric field . In particular, the exploitation of polyconvexity and the tensor cross product, enable the derivation of comparatively simple formulas for the discrete derivatives. This is in sharp contrast to much more elaborate discrete derivatives which are one of the main downsides of classical EM time integration schemes. The newly proposed scheme inherits the advantages of EM schemes recently published in the context of thermo-elasticity and electro-mechanics, whilst extending to the more generic case of nonlinear thermo-electro-mechanics. Furthermore, the manuscript delves into suitable convexity/concavity restrictions that thermo-electro-mechanical strain energy functions must comply with in order to yield physically and mathematically admissible solutions . Finally, a series of numerical examples will be presented in order to demonstrate robustness and numerical stability properties of the new EM scheme.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a non-intrusive data-driven approach for model reduction of nonlinear systems. The approach considers the particular case of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) that form systems of partial differential–algebraic equations (PDAEs) when lifted to polynomial form. Such systems arise, for example, when the governing equations include Arrhenius reaction terms (e.g., in reacting flow models) and thermodynamic terms (e.g., the Helmholtz free energy terms in a phase-field solidification model). Using the known structured form of the lifted algebraic equations, the approach computes the reduced operators for the algebraic equations explicitly, using straightforward linear algebra operations on the basis matrices. The reduced operators for the differential equations are inferred from lifted snapshot data using operator inference, which solves a linear least squares regression problem. The approach is illustrated for the nonlinear model of solidification of a pure material. The lifting transformations reformulate the solidification PDEs as a system of PDAEs that have cubic structure. The operators of the lifted system for this solidification example have affine dependence on key process parameters, permitting us to learn a parametric reduced model with operator inference. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the resulting reduced models in capturing key aspects of the solidification dynamics.},

  abstract     = {A unified non-local fluid transport model is proposed for heterogeneous saturated porous media. First, a non-local governing equation of fluid transport is presented based on the Non-ordinary State-based Peridynamics (NOSB-PD), and a novel flux vector state and a non-local Darcy’s law is proposed to illustrate non-local fluid transport effects in heterogeneous saturated porous media. The proposed flux state vector ensures the non-local governing equation of fluid transport model in heterogeneous saturated porous media degenerates into the local one when the horizon of each material point approaches to zero. A non-local pressure gradient at each material point can be obtained by averaging all the flux state vectors in its horizon, which unifies the weak and strong discontinuities of pressure in heterogeneous saturated porous media in a consistent way. Second, a variational formulation of the unified non-local fluid transport model is developed. This variational formulation enables the proposed model to deal with complex boundary conditions, which is difficult or even impossible for current fluid transport models based on Bond-based Peridynamics (BB-PD) and Ordinary State-based Peridynamics (OSB-PD). Third, a fully implicit algorithm combined with the Newton–Raphson method is introduced to solve the general non-linear problems in the heterogeneous saturated porous media. The penalty function method is employed to eliminate the zero-energy mode oscillation in NOSB-PD. Further, numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed model is accurate and can well capture the weak and strong discontinuities of pressure at the material interfaces and crack surfaces in the heterogeneous saturated porous media. Numerical examples also indicate that the model can effectively eliminate the zero-energy mode oscillation inherently rooted in the NOSB-PD, and thus reaches a stable numerical solution.},

Multi-fidelity approaches expedite the construction of the PCE surrogate by blending the efficiency of low-fidelity models and accuracy of high-fidelity models. In this work, we propose a novel non-intrusive multi-fidelity sampling approach that exploits the low computational cost of the low-fidelity model to select a set of high-yield sampling locations for the high-fidelity model. Particularly, the proposed approach draws upon the unique features of the Kaczmarz updating scheme to design a greedy search that explores a large pool of low-fidelity samples and iteratively removes the least contributive ones. Facilitated via a subset updating strategy, the search lands on a small subset of the initial pool which is then used to construct the PCE surrogate for the high-fidelity model. The proposed approach offers a remarkable computational performance, practically delivering accurate results with a high-fidelity sample size about the cardinality of the basis, and as such is amenable to efficient uncertainty quantification on fixed and limited budget. We provide several numerical examples that demonstrate the promise of the proposed approach in substantially reducing the number of high-fidelity samples required for accurate construction of the PCE surrogate.},

The equation for phase field evolution is thus discretized by a graph Laplacian on a curved surface. A corresponding solver is herein developed, considering the matrix sparsity of the discretized system, and constraining irreversible phase field variables (to values greater than zero and less than one). An alternating solution strategy between mechanical equilibrium and the phase field equation is proposed. Our method is then applied to the fracture of plates and shells of arbitrary curvature, exhibiting fast convergence and robustness compared with our previous work, as could be concluded from the several numerical benchmarks we performed. This method opens a new way to efficiently model the fracture of plates and shells, while utilizing conventional shell elements.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive particle refinement (APR) can increase the efficiency of mesh-free particle methods by splitting mother particles into smaller daughter particles. However, most APR algorithms are based on solving a minimization problem in which a single mother particle is split into several daughter particles. This may cause insufficient accuracy because APR is typically adopted in problems where many mother particles are involved in splitting, and a superposition effect may occur in the refinement error field between neighboring mother particles. Hence, we develop a novel APR strategy for the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method based on direct splitting multiple mother particles to obtain more accurate optimal APR parameters. In addition, angular momentum conservation conditions are derived and a new algorithm is proposed to implement periodic boundary conditions for open-channel flows. Furthermore, for the first time, we conduct a rigorous parametric study to investigate factors affecting the optimal APR parameters, including the split patterns, kernel types, the density calculation algorithms as well as refinement error definitions. This APR strategy is validated through five benchmark test cases.

  abstract     = {An implicit family of composite s s -sub-step integration algorithms is developed in this paper. The proposed composite s s -sub-step scheme is firstly designed to satisfy two requirements. One is the directly self-starting property, eliminating any starting procedures and avoiding computing the initial acceleration vector. The other is identical effective stiffness matrices within each sub-step, embedding optimal spectral properties . The analysis reveals that the composite s s -sub-step implicit schemes with s ≤ 6 s≤6 can achieve s s th-order of accuracy when embedding the dissipation control and unconditional stability simultaneously, and that in case of s ≥ 7 s≥7 , the increase of accuracy requires more sub-steps. Then, only the first six economical composite multi-sub-step schemes are developed. Remarkably, two approaches are also constructed to output accurate accelerations, which is also regarded as another minor superiority. Unlike some published higher-order algorithms, the proposed methods do not suffer from the order reduction and they provide the designed order of accuracy for solving general structures. Linear and nonlinear examples are finally solved to confirm the numerical performance and superiority of the proposed methods.},

Internal support structures are challenging, potentially impossible to remove in complex fluid networks, yet would degrade fluidic performance if left within the part. This presents a major challenge in coupling topology optimization with additive manufacturing in the design of fluid components. The proposed approach leverages past work in overhang constraints for solid mechanics, including projection formulations and adjoint sensitivity analysis, and considers incompressible Navier–Stokes equations for laminar fluid flow. The approach is demonstrated on 2D and 3D fluid topology optimization problems to minimize pressure drop and constrain mass flow rates in pipes and manifolds. Resulting designs are crisp, logical, satisfy performance constraints, and satisfy overhang constraints, eliminating the need for internal support structures.},

  abstract     = {We show that isogeometric Galerkin discretizations of eigenvalue problems related to the Laplace operator subject to any standard type of homogeneous boundary conditions have no outliers in certain optimal spline subspaces. Roughly speaking, these optimal subspaces are obtained from the full spline space defined on certain uniform knot sequences by imposing specific additional boundary conditions. The spline subspaces of interest have been introduced in the literature some years ago when proving their optimality with respect to Kolmogorov n n -widths in L 2 L2 -norm for some function classes. The eigenfunctions of the Laplacian — with any standard type of homogeneous boundary conditions — belong to such classes. Here we complete the analysis of the approximation properties of these optimal spline subspaces. In particular, we provide explicit L 2 L2 and H 1 H1 error estimates with full approximation order for Ritz projectors in the univariate and in the multivariate tensor-product setting. Besides their intrinsic interest, these estimates imply that, for a fixed number of degrees of freedom, all the eigenfunctions and the corresponding eigenvalues are well approximated, without loss of accuracy in the whole spectrum when compared to the full spline space. Moreover, there are no spurious values in the approximated spectrum. In other words, the considered subspaces provide accurate outlier-free discretizations in the univariate and in the multivariate tensor-product case. This main contribution is complemented by an explicit construction of B-spline-like bases for the considered spline subspaces. The role of such spaces as accurate discretization spaces for addressing general problems with non-homogeneous boundary behavior is discussed as well.},

  abstract     = {In subsurface multiphase flow simulations, poor nonlinear solver performance is a significant runtime sink. The system of fully implicit mass balance equations is highly nonlinear and often difficult to solve for the nonlinear solver, generally Newton(-Raphson). Although the physical problem is inherently nonlinear, discretization schemes introduce several strong nonlinearities that can cause Newton iterations to diverge or converge very slowly. This frequently results in time step cuts, leading to wasted iterations and computationally expensive simulations. Much literature has looked into how to improve the nonlinear solver through enhancements or safeguarding updates. In this work, we take a different approach; we aim to improve convergence with a smoother finite volume discretization scheme which is more suitable for the Newton solver. Building on recent work, we propose a novel total velocity hybrid upwinding scheme with weighted average flow mobilities (WA-HU TV) that is unconditionally monotone and extends to compositional multiphase simulations. Analyzing the solution space of a one-cell problem, we demonstrate the improved properties of the scheme and explain how it leverages the advantages of both phase potential upwinding and arithmetic averaging. This results in a flow subproblem that is smooth with respect to changes in the sign of phase fluxes, and is well-behaved when phase velocities are large or when co-current viscous forces dominate. Additionally, we propose a WA-HU scheme with a total mass (WA-HU TM) formulation that includes phase densities in the weighted averaging. The proposed WA-HU TV consistently outperforms existing schemes, yielding benefits from 5% to over 50% reduction in nonlinear iterations. The WA-HU TM scheme also shows promising results; in some cases leading to even more efficiency. However, WA-HU TM can occasionally also lead to convergence issues. Overall, based on the current results, we recommend the adoption of the WA-HU TV scheme as it is highly efficient and robust.},

  abstract     = {Topology optimization is a powerful methodology for generating novel designs with a high degree of design freedom. In exchange for this attractive feature, topology optimization cannot generally avoid multimodality, which often impedes finding a satisfactory solution when dealing with strongly nonlinear optimization problems. In this study, we focus on constructing a framework that aims to indirectly solve such complex topology optimization problems. The framework is based on multifidelity topology design (MFTD), the basic concept of which is to divide solving an original topology optimization problem into two kinds of procedures, i.e., low-fidelity optimization and high-fidelity evaluation. We build the framework as a data-driven approach, where the design candidates given by solving the low-fidelity optimization problem are iteratively updated based on the idea of the evolutionary algorithm (EA). As a key procedure to realize a crossover-like operation in the high-dimensional design space, a variational autoencoder—one of the representative deep generative models—is utilized for generating a new dataset composed of various material distributions. Besides, we propose a mutation-like operation for generating novel material distributions based on reference ones in the dataset. By integrating these operations with an elitism-based selection procedure, we propose data-driven MFTD that enables gradient-free optimization even if tackling a complex optimization problem with a high degree of design freedom. We apply the proposed framework to forced convection heat transfer problems, where the low-fidelity optimization problem is formulated using a Darcy flow model, whereas the high-fidelity evaluation is conducted using a Navier–Stokes model. We first demonstrate that the obtained results from the proposed framework can achieve almost identical performance compared with that of the directly solved results in a well-known 2D laminar heat transfer problem. We then show that the proposed framework can find solutions in minimax problems of topology optimization pertaining to 3D laminar and turbulent heat transfer.},

  abstract     = {The underlying physical mechanism of the residual-based large eddy simulation (LES) based on the variational multiscale (VMS) method is clarified. Resolved large-scale energy transportation equation is mathematically derived for turbulent kinetic energy budget analysis. Firstly, statistical results of benchmark turbulent channel flow at R e τ = 180 Reτ=180 obtained using a coarse mesh are compared with the results obtained by the classical LES with the Smagorinsky and dynamic subgrid stress (SGS) model. The present LES shows an advantage in predicting the statistical results of the incompressible turbulent flows. Secondly, the contributions of the unresolved small-scale presentation terms (Term I I - IV IV in Eq. (10)) to the turbulent kinetic dissipation are analysed for the VMS method. The results show that the turbulent kinetic dissipation provided by the numerical diffusion in the VMS method is smaller in the inner layer, larger in the outer layer of the channel flow than those by the Smagorinsky and dynamic SGS model. The turbulent kinetic dissipation in the VMS method is mainly given by the numerical diffusion provided by one of the “cross-stress” terms (Term I I , same as the stabilization term in the SUPG method) and LSIC term (Term IV IV ). The other one of the “cross-stress” terms (Term II II ) gives rise to the positive turbulent kinetic energy budget, and does not dissipate the turbulent kinetic energy. The so-called “Reynolds stress” term (Term III III ) dissipates the turbulent energy but provides a very small numerical diffusion. Finally, on the basis of the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation analysis, a new residual-based stabilized finite element formulation is proposed by modifying the large-scale equation in the VMS method. Numerical experiments of 2D lid-driven cavity flow and 3D incompressible turbulent channel flow are tested to validate the proposed formulation. It is shown that all the stabilization terms in the proposed formulation produce additional numerical diffusions and physically increase the total turbulent kinetic dissipation. Consequently, an apparent improvement in both the first-order and second-order statistical quantities are pursued by the new stabilized finite element formulation.},

Both the subscales are chosen to be time dependent and the stabilized formulation has been reached through the complete elimination of the unresolvable scales in terms of the coarse scale solution. Hence the resultant formulation emerges as a set of equations involving only the coarse scale solution instead of multiple scales and makes the formulation simpler to handle. In this study the shear-rate dependent Casson viscosity coefficient is assumed to be a function of the solute mass concentration, resulting in a two way coupling. This paper investigates the stability and the convergence properties of the stabilized finite element solution, without imposing any additional regularity condition other than the admissible space requirement on it. The proposed expressions of the stabilization parameters play a significant role in obtaining optimal order of convergences. During various theoretical derivations the estimations of the non-linear apparent viscosity coefficient have been carefully carried out assuming sufficiently regular exact solution. The performance of the scheme has been numerically validated with lid driven cavity problem. The theoretically established rate of convergence results are appropriately verified through numerical studies .

  abstract     = {Structural system reliability analysis is of important significance for evaluating the safety of structures with many components. Since a structural system can be acted by static or dynamic load, a unified and efficient method is required to assess the system reliability of static or dynamic load induced structures. In this study, the direct probability integral method (DPIM) is proposed to uniformly attack system reliability problems of static and dynamic structures. Firstly, the static and first-passage dynamic reliability formulas of the series, parallel and mixed systems are established by the joint probability density function (PDF) of multiple performance functions. Based on the probability density integral equation (PDIE) of performance functions, the DPIM is proposed along the two approaches, i.e., DPIM-S and DPIM-H. The former computes the system reliability using the PDF of extreme value mapping of performance functions, which is obtained by smoothing Dirac delta function. In the latter, the system reliability formulas with Heaviside function are analytically derived by the PDIE of multiple performance functions. Specially, the role of smoothing of Dirac delta function in DPIM for stochastic response and reliability analyses is revealed. Finally, five typical examples, including two mathematical examples and three static and dynamic structural systems, demonstrate high efficiency and accuracy of the DPIM for system reliability computation. Because of omitting the smoothing of Dirac delta function, the DPIM-H takes less CPU time for solving system reliabilities of static and dynamic structures than DPIM-S, while the DPIM-S has a significant advantage of obtaining the PDF of performance function.},

  abstract     = {As a mathematical model of high-speed flow and shock wave propagation in a complex multimaterial setting, Lagrangian hydrodynamics is characterized by moving meshes, advection-dominated solutions, and moving shock fronts with sharp gradients. These challenges hinder the existing projection-based model reduction schemes from being practical. We develop several variations of projection-based reduced order model techniques for Lagrangian hydrodynamics by introducing three different reduced bases for position, velocity, and energy fields. A time-windowing approach is also developed to address the challenge imposed by the advection-dominated solutions. Lagrangian hydrodynamics is formulated as a nonlinear problem, which requires a proper hyper-reduction technique. Therefore, we apply the over-sampling DEIM and SNS approaches to reduce the complexity due to the nonlinear terms. Finally, we also present both a posteriori and a priori error bounds associated with our reduced order model. We compare the performance of the spatial and time-windowing reduced order modeling approaches in terms of accuracy and speed-up with respect to the corresponding full order model for several numerical examples, namely Sedov blast, Gresho vortices, Taylor–Green vortices, and triple-point problems.},

  abstract     = {A composite neural network (NN) is a way to improve the reliability of a prediction field by implementing a multi-fidelity model when high-fidelity data are extremely limited. The reliability of the composite NN depends highly on the quantity and quality of low-fidelity data. Satisfying both issues simultaneously is difficult in engineering practices even if low-fidelity data are considered. With this motivation, we suggest a strategy for ameliorating low-fidelity data to efficiently improve the prediction fields of a composite NN. In the proposed strategy, a reduced-order modeling (ROM) is used to supply a large number of low-fidelity data with relatively low computational costs. To decrease ROM errors that may decisively hinder the training of a cross-correlation between low-fidelity and high-fidelity data, the low-fidelity data are updated using an efficient adaptive basis technique. The adaptive basis in this work is calculated by optimizing the local error data to avoid huge computational costs. As a result, the low-fidelity data can better reflect the trend while satisfying the condition in which the low-fidelity data should be sufficiently provided through an efficient procedure. Furthermore, the strategy applied in this study is conducted without any modifications of the given high-fidelity data. Hence, even if high-fidelity data may no longer be obtained, it is possible to efficiently obtain the high-quality prediction field of the composite NN. A detailed strategy is proposed herein, and its performance is evaluated through various numerical examples .},

  abstract     = {Tridynamics is a nonlocal approach to describe lower-scale multi-body interactions at the macroscopic level. Although such a description is sometimes crucial to model the response of a body (for instance carbon nanotube), the computational cost might be very high in the analysis of large structures. Therefore the introduction of basic elements such as beam and plate in this framework could significantly reduce the computational cost. Through this study, we present a set of meaningful and physical quantities that explain the deformation of the beam in this framework. However, the introduced quantities have the potential in describing the variation of field variable in other mechanical problems such as thermal problems. Starting from the kinematic of the beam, a tridynamics beam model (with no restriction on the height of the beam) is developed by using the Lagrangian of the system. The nonlocal parameters are calibrated by carrying out the material correspondences with the classical equations. To see the credibility of the model, a dispersion analysis from low to high wave numbers is performed, and the results are compared with the local and nonlocal models available in the literature.},

Microscale and macroscale Initial Boundary Value Problems (IBVPs) are solved simultaneously using the Numerical Manifold Method (NMM) with the information conveyed between different scales. The microscale IBVP is solved under Linear Boundary Conditions (LBCs) and Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBCs) that are defined with macroscale solid displacement, fluid pressure and their first-order gradients. The discontinuous macroscale IBVP is solved iteratively using the Newton method with the macroscale internal forces and Jacobian determined by solving the microscale IBVPs. A stick–slip contact model is implemented using an augmented Lagrange multiplier method to impose frictional contact conditions along the macroscale discontinuities. Through various numerical simulations, the presented two-scale NMM is shown to be able to effectively and accurately capture the fully dynamic and wave propagation responses of the discontinuous heterogeneous porous media under the fluid injection and impact loading condition.},

For this coupling system, a decoupled finite element method is proposed based on Robin type transmission conditions . In order to avoid the iteration for the traditional domain decomposition , the interface information , which is needed for the Robin type transmission conditions at the current time step, is predicted directly from the numerical solution of the previous time steps. The stability and convergence of this Robin-type decoupled finite element method are rigorously analyzed. A series of analysis techniques are utilized to analyze various components of this complicated multi-physics problem term by term, especially for the Beavers–Joseph interface condition, the interaction terms of dual-porosity model, and the nonlinear advection of Navier–Stokes equation. Moreover, a pair of Robin parameters are considered in the scheme and analysis, and their effects on the robustness for the case with low permeability and low storativity are numerically investigated. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the convergence of the proposed algorithm and illustrate the features of the application to flow problems around multistage fractured horizontal wellbore.},

The current bond-based peridynamic constitutive models can accurately describe the dynamic mechanical behavior of partial ceramic materials under impact loading, however, the predicted value of the Poisson’s ratio is 0.25, which is not true for most of the known ceramic materials. Herein, based on the existing bond-based peridynamic constitutive model, the current study utilizes the description of tangential bond force and considers the influence of bond force on rotation to accurately predict the Poisson’s ratio of different types of ceramic materials, e.g., SiC and B 4 B4 C. Moreover, a novel and comprehensive damage assessment criterion during tensile–shear​ and compressive–shear is established, and the rate-dependent bond-based peridynamic constitutive model is improved, which realized the optimization of the original model. Then, the improved rate-dependent bond-based peridynamic constitutive model is employed to conduct several numerical experiments, including frontal impact, edge-on impact and uniaxial compression experiments. The simulation results are compared with the classical finite element model and experimental results, demonstrating the superiority of the optimized model in terms of accuracy and versatility. The optimized model describes the damage behavior of different ceramic materials and provides theoretical bases for future work in penetration behavior of ceramics.},

This way, we end up with a random deformation field. In particular, we show that it suffices to know the deformation field’s expectation and covariance at the scatterer’s boundary to model the surface’s Karhunen–Loève expansion. Leveraging on the isogeometric framework, we employ multilevel quadrature methods to approximate quantities of interest such as the scattered wave’s expectation and variance. By computing the wave’s Cauchy data at an artificial, fixed interface enclosing the random obstacle, we can also directly infer quantities of interest in free space. Adopting the Bayesian paradigm, we finally compute the expected shape and variance of the scatterer from noisy measurements of the scattered wave at the artificial interface.

To demonstrate the intimate relation between membrane locking and spectral accuracy, we focus on the example of a circular ring discretized with isogeometric curved Euler–Bernoulli beam elements. We show that the transverse-displacement-dominating modes are locking-prone, while the circumferential-displacement-dominating modes are naturally locking-free. We use eigenvalue and mode errors to assess five isogeometric finite element formulations in terms of their locking-related efficiency: the displacement-based formulation with full and reduced integration and three locking-free formulations based on the B-bar, discrete strain gap and Hellinger–Reissner methods. Our study shows that spectral analysis uncovers locking-related effects across the spectrum of eigenvalues and eigenmodes , rigorously characterizing membrane locking in the displacement-based formulation and unlocking in the locking-free formulations.},

Adaboost is an ensemble learning technique originating from the machine learning field. The idea of Adaboost-PCE is to construct many times the “weak” PCE model with assigned weights to each sample point. Each time, the weight of a particular sample point in the training set depends on the performance of the surrogate models on that sample. In this way, weighted least-squares approximation is employed to exploit the weights of each sample in order to reduce the effect of outliers. The Adaboost-PCE is appealing since it is possible to estimate the ensemble weights without using any explicit error metrics as in most existent ensemble methods. Moreover, it has an expectation of the prediction error that enables the efficient adaptive sampling. The proposed method is validated with a numerical comparison of their performance on a series of numerical tests including partial differential equations with high-dimensional inputs.},

The orientation of fiber at any arbitrary point is defined by the orientation of the tangent vector of iso-contour. In order to prevent gaps and overlaps between neighboring fiber tows from arising during the manufacturing of composite structures, a constraint is formulated that the norm of gradient vector of the level set function is equal to 1 almost everywhere. Furthermore, these gradient constraints are aggregated into a single one by using the p p -norm method to improve the efficiency of optimization. The compliance minimization problem is considered, and the coefficients of radial basis functions are taken as the design variables.

  abstract     = {Cut finite-element methods (CutFEMs) belong to the class of methods that allow boundaries/interfaces to cut through the elements, which avoids any meshing/remeshing problems. This is highly convenient from a practical point of view, especially when non-stationary interfaces are considered, e.g. phase boundaries in solids, as the interfaces can move independently of the mesh. There are many research directions related to CutFEM, one of which focuses on the equations of solid mechanics. Initially, the developments centred on linear elasticity and, in the previous publication by the authors, the method has been extended to large deformations and arbitrary constitutive relations, while the focus has been on phase boundaries in solids and on localised chemical reaction fronts in coupled mechanics–diffusion–reaction systems. In this paper, the method is further extended to more complex physics of the interfaces — fracture, i.e. separation of the interface into two surfaces in the current configuration, and contact between the separated surfaces. Several cases are considered — fracture with linear and non-linear traction separation, contact without and with adhesion. Each incremental generalisation of the approach contains a prior approach as a particular case, e.g. the phase boundary problem is a particular case of the fracture problem. The contact problem is treated in an unbiased way — the weak form is symmetric with respect to the choice of the contact surfaces for the integration. The weak forms are derived from the total energy functional. The proposed method has been tested computationally for the case of linear elements and passed the so-called patch tests and the convergence rate tests demonstrating the asymptotically optimal rates.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we analyse the links between ghost penalty stabilisation and aggregation-based discrete extension operators for the numerical approximation of elliptic partial differential equations on unfitted meshes. We explore the behaviour of ghost penalty methods in the limit as the penalty parameter goes to infinity, which returns a strong version of these methods. We observe that these methods suffer locking in that limit. On the contrary, aggregated finite element spaces are locking-free because they can be expressed as an extension operator from well-posed to ill-posed degrees of freedom. Next, we propose novel ghost penalty methods that penalise the distance between the solution and its aggregation-based discrete extension. These methods are locking-free and converge to aggregated finite element methods in the infinite penalty parameter limit. We include an exhaustive set of numerical experiments in which we compare weak (ghost penalty) and strong (aggregated finite elements) schemes in terms of error quantities, condition numbers and sensitivity with respect to penalty coefficients on different geometries, intersection locations and mesh topologies .},

  abstract     = {Dynamical systems arise in a wide variety of mathematical models from the physical, engineering, life, and social sciences. A common challenge is to quantify uncertainties on model inputs (i.e., parameters) that correspond to a quantitative characterization of uncertainties on observable Quantities of Interest (QoI). To this end, we consider a stochastic inverse problem (SIP) with a solution described by a pullback probability measure. This is referred to as an observation-consistent solution since its subsequent push-forward through the QoI map matches the observed probability distribution on model outputs. A distinction is made between QoI useful for solving the SIP and arbitrary model output data. In dynamical systems, model output data are often given as a series of state variable responses recorded over a particular time window. Consequently, the dimension of output data can easily exceed O(1E4) or more due to the frequency of observations, and the correct choice or construction of a QoI from this data is not self-evident. We present a new framework, Learning Uncertain Quantities (LUQ), that facilitates the tractable solution of SIPs for dynamical systems. Given ensembles of predicted (simulated) time series and (noisy) observed data, LUQ provides routines for filtering data, learning the underlying dynamics in an unsupervised manner, classifying the observations, and performing feature extraction to learn the QoI map. Subsequently, time series data are transformed into samples coming from the underlying predicted and observed distributions associated with the QoI so that solutions to the SIP are computable. Following the introduction and demonstration of LUQ, numerical results from several SIPs are presented for a variety of dynamical systems arising in the life and physical sciences. In the interest of scientific reproducibility, we provide links to our Python implementation of LUQ, as well as all data and scripts required to reproduce the results in this manuscript.},

  abstract     = {The paper proposes a heat-flux based approach to optimize build orientation and topology simultaneously for self-supported enclosed voids in additive manufacturing . The enclosed overhangs that require supports in additive manufacturing are removed from the optimized design by constraining the maximum temperature of a pseudo heat conduction problem . In the pseudo problem, heat flux is applied on the non-self-supported open and enclosed surfaces. Since the density-based topology optimization involves no explicit boundary representation, we impose such surface slope dependent heat flux through a domain integral of a Heaviside projected density gradient . In addition, the solid materials and the void materials in the pseudo problem are assumed to be thermally insulating and conductive, respectively. As such, heat flux on the open surfaces can be successfully conducted to external heat sink through the void (or conductive) materials. However, heat flux on the non-self-supported enclosed surfaces is isolated by the solid (or insulating) materials and thus leads to locally high temperature. Hence, by limiting the maximum temperature of the pseudo problem, self-supported enclosed voids can be achieved, and the slope of the open surfaces would not be affected. Due to the differentiability of the heat flux loading in the pseudo problem, the calculated temperature and constraint on it are differentiable to both the build orientation and the density field. Numerical examples on 2D and 3D linear elasticity problems are presented to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach in the design of self-supported enclosed voids.},

The gradient plasticity model is enriched by including the gradient of elastic strains into the expression of the internal virtual work and free energy. This augments the modelling capabilities by incorporating elasticity-related length scales along with plasticity-related energetic and dissipative ones. The strong form governing equations are derived via the principle of virtual work addressing a complete set of boundary conditions. The fourth-order boundary value problem of the gradient elasto-plasticity model is then formulated in a variational form within an H 2 H2 Sobolev space setting. Conforming Galerkin discretizations for numerical results are obtained utilizing an isogeometric approach with NURBS basis functions of degree p ≥ 2 p≥2 providing C p − 1 Cp−1 -continuity. The implementation follows a viscoplastic constitutive framework and adopts the backward Euler time integration scheme. A set of benchmark examples is considered to illustrate convergence properties and to accomplish parameter studies. It is shown that the elastic length scale parameter controls the slope of the elastic part and causes an additional hardening in the plastic part of the material response curves. Finally, an illustrative example is considered in order to demonstrate the applicability of both the continuum model and the numerical method in capturing the size-dependent torsion response of cellular structures.},

  abstract     = {An FFT framework which preserves a good numerical performance in the case of domains with large regions of empty space is proposed and analyzed for its application to lattice based materials. Two spectral solvers specially suited to resolve problems containing phases with zero stiffness are considered (1) a Galerkin approach combined with the MINRES linear solver and a discrete differentiation rule and (2) a modification of a displacement FFT solver which penalizes the indetermination of strains in the empty regions, leading to a fully determined equation. The solvers are combined with several approaches to smooth out the lattice surface, based on modifying the actual stiffness of the voxels not fully embedded in the lattice or empty space. The accuracy of the resulting approaches is assessed for an octet-lattice by comparison with FEM solutions for different relative densities and discretization levels. It is shown that the adapted Galerkin approach combined with a Voigt surface smoothening was the best FFT framework considering accuracy, numerical efficiency and h h -convergence. With respect to numerical efficiency it was observed that FFT becomes competitive compared to FEM for cells with relative densities above ≈ ≈ 7%. Finally, to show the real potential of the approaches presented, the FFT frameworks are used to simulate the behavior of a printed lattice by using direct 3D tomographic data as input. The approaches proposed include explicitly in the simulation the actual surface roughness and internal porosity resulting from the fabrication process . The simulations allowed to quantify the reduction of the lattice stiffness as well as to resolve the stress localization of ≈ ≈ 50% near large pores.},

This approach enables complex, evolving XFEM surfaces in 3D that cannot be captured using existing CG-XFEM approaches. We describe an implementation of the method for 3D static elasticity with linearized strain for modeling open cracks as a salient step towards modeling progressive fracture. The implementation includes a description of the finite element model, hybrid implicit/explicit representation of enrichments, numerical integration method, and novel degree-of-freedom (DoF) enumeration algorithm. This algorithm supports an arbitrary number of enrichments within an element, while simultaneously maintaining a continuous solution across elements. Additionally, our approach easily allows an implementation suitable for distributed computing systems . Enabled by the DoF enumeration algorithm, the proposed method lays the groundwork for a computational tool that efficiently models progressive fracture. To facilitate a discussion of the complex enrichment hierarchies, we develop enrichment diagrams to succinctly describe and visualize the relationships between the enrichments (and the fields they create) within an element. This also provides a unified language for discussing extrinsic XFEM methods in the literature. We compare several methods, relying on the enrichment diagrams to highlight their nuanced differences.},

Our starting point is a projector-based multiscale decomposition of a generic variational formulation that uses broken Sobolev spaces and Lagrange multipliers to accommodate the non-conforming nature at the boundaries of discontinuous Galerkin elements. We show that existing discontinuous Galerkin formulations, including their penalty terms, follow immediately from a specific choice of multiscale projector. We proceed by defining the “fine-scale closure function”, which captures the closure relation between the remaining fine-scale term in the discontinuous Galerkin formulation and the coarse-scale solution via a single integral expression for each basis function in the coarse-scale test space. We show that the projectors that correspond to discontinuous Galerkin methods lead to fine-scale closure functions with more compact support and smaller amplitudes compared to the fine-scale closure function of the classical (conforming) finite element method. This observation provides a new perspective on the natural stability of discontinuous Galerkin methods for hyperbolic problems, and may open the door to rigorously designed variational multiscale based fine-scale models that are suitable for DG methods.},

The failure probability is approximated by a probabilistic model using a scalar factor less than one which is multiplied on the capacity term of performance function. An adaptive input for scalar factor is proposed by the coefficient of variation of failure probability for active region in the training process of artificial neural network (ANN) with multilayer back-propagation algorithm. Four analytical optimization training approaches, active region and number of hidden nodes are discussed for accurate approximation of ANN models. The results of the HEMCS are compared with several analytical reliability methods for numerous engineering problems. Laminated composite plate and turbine bladed disk are selected to illustrate the capability of HEMCS for approximation of failure probability. The proposed method provides higher flexibility for the prediction of failure probability when compared to the enhanced MCS which also offers significantly more accurate and computationally efficient results for high-nonlinear problems.},

Data-driven approaches are able to speed the process up significantly by enabling to incorporate the effective micromechanical response in macroscale simulations without the need of performing additional computations at each Gauss point explicitly. Traditionally artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been the surrogate modeling technique of choice in the solid mechanics community. However they suffer from severe drawbacks due to their parametric nature and suboptimal training and inference properties for the investigated datasets in a three dimensional setting. These problems can be avoided using local approximate Gaussian process regression (laGPR). This method can allow the prediction of stress outputs at particular strain space locations by training local regression models based on Gaussian processes, using only a subset of the data for each local model, offering better and more reliable accuracy than ANNs. A modified Newton–Raphson approach specific to laGPR is proposed to accommodate for the local nature of the laGPR approximation when solving the global structural problem in a FE setting. Hence, the presented work offers a complete and general framework enabling multiscale calculations combining a data-driven constitutive prediction using laGPR, and macroscopic calculations using an FE scheme that we test for finite-strain three-dimensional hyperelastic problems.},

  abstract     = {A universal multiscale Smagorinsky model (UMSM) is established for the large eddy simulation (LES) of wall-bounded turbulent flows by reformulating a universal subgrid eddy viscosity model presented by Gu et al. (Europhysics Letter 94(3):34003,2011). The UMSM is adapted to the LES of wall-bounded turbulent flows by integrating the “small-all” form of the multiscale Smagorinsky model with the dynamic subgrid characteristic length , controlled by subgrid-scale (SGS) motions. The dynamic subgrid characteristic length is determined by the characteristic wave number, which is calculated from a new energy-weighted-mean method when the SGS turbulent kinetic energy and the dissipation wave number are known. The dissipation wave number is derived from the SGS turbulent kinetic energy spectrum equation and the total dissipation rate spectrum equation. The UMSM is used to simulate the fully developed channel flow and the turbulent flow past a square cylinder. The dynamic subgrid characteristic length, as a counterpart of Germano’s procedure, evaluates the rapidly fluctuating small-scale behavior and spatial variations of turbulent characteristics. The results for fully developed channel flow show that the errors in the streamwise velocity and the velocity fluctuations change slowly. The flat nature of the UMSM error across different multiscale Smagorinsky coefficients ( Cs’ ) indicates that the model is relatively insensitive to the value of Cs ′ Cs′ . Additionally, the UMSM is less sensitive to grid resolution since more details of turbulence fluctuations are captured on the same grid-points compared to the RVBMM (Journal of Computational Physics, 234:79-107,2013) and DSM (Journal of Fluid Mechanics 319:353-385,1996). Overall, the proposed model and the DSM exhibit similar behavior, and both LES formulations provide good agreement with reference data from direct numerical simulations . However, the UMSM is more computationally efficient, being 17% faster than the dynamic Smagorinsky model.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an efficient proper orthogonal decomposition with interpolation (PODI) method for real-time simulation of indenter contact problems. In the offline stage, POD models are constructed from displacement and von-Mises stress snapshots of full-order finite element solutions of indenter contact problems with training contact locations and indentation depths. Indentation depth and contact location are respectively used to interpolate POD basis vectors and POD coefficients by Lagrange interpolation with a congruence transformation and radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. In the online stage, displacements and von-Mises stress of solids under a new indentation loading are obtained very quickly by using the interpolated POD matrix and POD coefficients . A clustering-based contact domain decomposition (CDD) scheme is proposed to further improve the computational performance of the present PODI–RBF​ method. Numerical results show that the PODI–RBF method using the CDD scheme can be used to obtain finite element solutions of indenter contact problems at 400 ∼ ∼ 900 Hz on a personal computer for finite element models with 8000 ∼ ∼ 16000 nodes, which is promising to real-time simulation of indenter contact problems.},

Starting from a coarse discretization of the domain, an energetic criterion is used to determine the active zones where damage initiates, evolves and mesh refinement is mandatory to accurately approximate crack topology. Moreover, the extension of the refined regions is strictly correlated with the size of the process zone defined by the optimal profile. Global and global/local refinement strategies are investigated. In particular, the global/local technique solves the displacement and phase field problems on a local mesh dynamically updated and adaptively refined during the computation. Once the solutions of the local problems are obtained, the phase field is interpolated back onto the original mesh, adequately refined where a damage threshold is exceeded. The performances of the refinement techniques are analyzed and compared in representative examples with stable and brutal crack propagation .},

When moisture intrusion and various external loads are concurrently applied to polymer matrix materials, the multi-physical diffusion process , and the correlation with the complex cracking phenomenon is far from been discovered. To approach this uncertainty, we explored fully coupled moisture diffusion , stress redistribution, and damage evolution of composites for revealing complex failure patterns and rules. The novelty of this study could be described as follows. (i) A thermodynamically consistent moisture diffusion model is established to couple the moisture diffusion and viscoelastic response of the multiphase material. (ii) A two-constituent phase-field fracture model is developed to describe the hygroscopic swelling in the matrix and interfacial decohesion within a concise and universal continuum mechanics framework. (iii) We also propose a crack filter theory to characterize the fluctuation of moisture flux along with the evolution of regularized discontinuities. (iv) A static strength evaluation index is devised to calibrate the moisture resistance of fiber/polymer composites. Based on the strongly coupled scheme, the distinct damage profiles of dry and immersed composites were captured in line with experimental observations. For the first time, interactions of moisture diffusion with the complex cracking in composites are elucidated through simulations, thus providing new insights into the coupled damage mechanism of polymer composites and facilitating microstructure design to enhance its performance in ocean environments.},

  abstract     = {Constitutive models are widely used for modeling complex systems in science and engineering, where first-principle-based, well-resolved simulations are often prohibitively expensive. For example, in fluid dynamics, constitutive models are required to describe nonlocal, unresolved physics such as turbulence and laminar–turbulent transition. However, traditional constitutive models based on partial differential equations (PDEs) often lack robustness and are too rigid to accommodate diverse calibration datasets. We propose a frame-independent, nonlocal constitutive model based on a vector-cloud neural network that can be learned with data. The model predicts the closure variable at a point based on the flow information in its neighborhood. Such nonlocal information is represented by a group of points, each having a feature vector attached to it, and thus the input is referred to as vector cloud. The cloud is mapped to the closure variable through a frame-independent neural network, invariant both to coordinate translation and rotation and to the ordering of points in the cloud. As such, the network can deal with any number of arbitrarily arranged grid points and thus is suitable for unstructured meshes in fluid simulations. The merits of the proposed network are demonstrated for scalar transport PDEs on a family of parameterized periodic hill geometries. The vector-cloud neural network is a promising tool not only as nonlocal constitutive models and but also as general surrogate models for PDEs on irregular domains.},

However, similar as for tensor-product B-splines, isogeometric simulations with hierarchical B-splines face a big computational burden from the perspective of matrix assembly, particularly if the spline degree p p is high. To address this issue, we extend the recent work (Pan et al., 2020) – which introduced an efficient assembling approach for tensor-product B-splines – to the case of hierarchical B-splines. In the new approach, the integrand factor is transformed into piecewise polynomials via quasi-interpolation. Subsequently, the resulting elementary integrals are pre-computed and stored in a look-up table. Finally, the sum-factorization technique is adopted to accelerate the assembly process. We present a detailed analysis, which reveals that the presented method achieves the expected complexity of O ( p d + 1 ) O(pd+1) per degree of freedom (without taking sparse matrix operations into account) under the assumption of mesh admissibility . We verify the efficiency of the new method by applying it to an elliptic problem on the three-dimensional domain and a parabolic problem on the four-dimensional domain in space–time, respectively. A comparison with standard Gaussian quadrature is also provided.},

In this method, we split the subdomain interfaces into several contact patches. Different patches are allowed to have the same master/slave nodes. To eliminate the over-constrained behavior that often occurs in conventional mortar methods, we divide the constraint matrix into two categories: pure and cross constraint systems. In this way, all over-constrained equations are concentrated in the cross constraint system. Then, an efficient submatrix condensation algorithm is proposed to remove the linearly dependent equations in cross constraint systems. The over-constrained behavior can thus be avoided. Using the dual Lagrange scheme, the proposed method can implement the matrix condensation at a minimal computational cost and ensure the positive definiteness of the system matrix . The robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method are studied by comparing the theoretical and numerical solutions. Several numerical examples show that our method has an optimal convergence rate and high computational efficiency.},

Recently, an efficient univariate 3D conditional random field simulation method was developed based on the separability assumption of the autocorrelation functions in the vertical and horizontal directions. The developed simulation method allows for Kronecker-product derivations of the large correlation matrices and thus does not need to invert and store large matrices. Moreover, it can handle univariate non-lattice data (e.g., all soundings measure the data of one soil property and there exists missing data at some depths at some soundings). It may be more common to see multivariate non-lattice data (e.g., all soundings measure the data of multiple soil properties and there exists missing data of some properties at some depths at some soundings) in practical site investigations. However, the proposed method is not applicable to multivariate non-lattice data because it cannot directly account for the cross-correlation among different variables The purpose of the current paper is to extend the previous method to accommodate the multivariate non-lattice data. The extended method still takes advantage of the Kronecker-product derivations to avoid the mathematical operation of the large correlation matrices. A simulated example is adopted to illustrate the effectiveness of the extended method.},

  abstract     = {The limiting amplitude principle states that the response of a scatterer to a harmonic light excitation is asymptotically harmonic with the same pulsation. Depending on the geometry and nature of the scatterer, there might or might not be an established theoretical proof validating this principle. In this paper, we investigate a case where the theory is missing: we consider a two-dimensional dispersive Drude structure with corners. In the non lossy case, it is well known that looking for harmonic solutions leads to an ill-posed problem for a specific range of critical pulsations, characterized by the metal’s properties and the aperture of the corners. Ill-posedness is then due to highly oscillatory resonances at the corners called black-hole waves. However, a time-domain formulation with a harmonic excitation is always mathematically valid. Based on this observation, we conjecture that the limiting amplitude principle might not hold for all pulsations. Using a time-domain setting, we propose a systematic numerical approach that allows to give numerical evidences of the latter conjecture, and find clear signature of the critical pulsations. Furthermore, we connect our results to the underlying physical plasmonic resonances that occur in the lossy physical metallic case.},

To find the RQ rules, we develop an empirical quadrature procedure (EQP) for time-dependent problems; we analyze the output error due to hyperreduction using a space–time DWR framework and identify appropriate constraints so that the output error due to hyperreduction is controlled. We in addition equip our reduced model with an online-efficient DWR a posteriori error estimate for the output; we again analyze the error in the hyperreduced dual problem and DWR expression to find appropriate constraints for the EQP so that the error in the error estimate is controlled. In the offline stage, the RBs and RQs, as well as the finite element mesh, are simultaneously constructed using a POD-greedy algorithm that leverages the online-efficient output error estimate. We demonstrate the framework for parametrized unsteady flows in a lid-driven cavity and over a NACA0012 airfoil . Reduced models achieve over two orders of magnitude reduction in the number of degrees of freedom, number of quadrature points , and wall-clock computational time , while achieving less than 0.5% output error and providing efficient error estimates in predictive settings.},

These conventional gradient plasticity models are found to manifest spurious spreading of localization zone during the post-peak regime, leading to non-physical structural and fracture response. Therefore, in the present work, a localizing gradient plasticity (LGP) model is proposed to avoid these non-physical responses. The LGP model avoids spurious responses by including the effects of the fracture processes (at micro and macro level) in the model description through the micromorphic framework. The fracture processes are typically found to initiate as a diffused region of plastic deformation (called necking region), which localizes to form cracks upon further loading. An interaction function is adopted in the LGP model to incorporate the localization of the fracture processes. The enhanced capability of the LGP model is demonstrated through one-dimensional and planar problems with tensile, compressive and mixed-mode loading. The numerical results show that the LGP model can arrest the spurious widening of the localization region resulting in a narrow region of high deformation representing failure.},

The upscaling relations, conceived to determine the macro-descriptors (macro displacement and the micropolar rotation fields) as a function of the micro displacement field, are consistently derived in the asymptotic framework. In particular, the micropolar rotation field is expressed in terms of the microscopical infinitesimal rotation tensor and perturbation functions. The micro displacement field is, in turn, obtained by choosing a third order approximation of the asymptotic expansion, in which the macroscopic fields are expressed as a third order polynomial expansion. It follows that the macro descriptors are directly related to both perturbation functions and micropolar two-dimensional deformation modes. Furthermore, a properly conceived energy equivalence between the macroscopic point and a microscopic representative portion of the periodic composite material is introduced to derive the consistent overall micropolar constitutive tensors. It is pointed out that these constitutive tensors are not affected by the choice of the periodic cell. Moreover, in the case of vanishing microstructure the internal-length-scale-dependent constitutive tensors tend to zero, as expected. Finally, the capabilities of the proposed approach are shown through some illustrative examples.},

In continuous Galerkin (CG) discretisations, similar properties are achievable through the addition of artificial diffusion such as spectral vanishing viscosity (SVV). However although SVV is recognised as very useful in CG-based high-fidelity turbulence simulations, this approach has been observed to be sub-optimal when compared to DG at intermediate polynomials orders ( P ≈ 3 P≈3 ). In this paper we explore an alternative stabilisation approach through the introduction of a continuous interior penalty on the gradient discontinuity at elemental boundaries, which we refer to as a gradient jump penalisation (GJP). Analogous to DG methods, this introduces a penalisation at the elemental interfaces as opposed to the interior element stabilisation of SVV. Detailed eigenanalysis of the GJP approach shows its potential as equivalent (sometimes superior) to DG dissipation and hence superior to previous SVV approaches. Through eigenanalysis, a judicious choice of GJP’s P P -dependent scaling parameter is made and found to be consistent with previous a-priori error analysis. The favourable properties of the GJP stabilisation approach are also supported by turbulent flow simulations of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equation, as we achieve higher quality flow solutions at P = 3 P=3 using GJP, whereas SVV performs marginally worse at P = 5 P=5 with twice as many degrees of freedom in total.},

  abstract     = {Many-query problems – arising from, e.g., uncertainty quantification , Bayesian inversion, Bayesian optimal experimental design , and optimization under uncertainty – require numerous evaluations of a parameter-to-output map. These evaluations become prohibitive if this parametric map is high-dimensional and involves expensive solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). To tackle this challenge, we propose to construct surrogates for high-dimensional PDE-governed parametric maps in the form of derivative-informed projected neural networks (DIPNets) that parsimoniously capture the geometry and intrinsic low-dimensionality of these maps. Specifically, we compute Jacobians of these PDE-based maps, and project the high-dimensional parameters onto a low-dimensional derivative-informed active subspace; we also project the possibly high-dimensional outputs onto their principal subspace. This exploits the fact that many high-dimensional PDE-governed parametric maps can be well-approximated in low-dimensional parameter and output subspaces. We use the projection basis vectors in the active subspace as well as the principal output subspace to construct the weights for the first and last layers of the neural network, respectively. This frees us to train the weights in only the low-dimensional layers of the neural network. The architecture of the resulting neural network then captures, to first order, the low-dimensional structure and geometry of the parametric map. We demonstrate that the proposed projected neural network achieves greater generalization accuracy than a full neural network, especially in the limited training data regime afforded by expensive PDE-based parametric maps. Moreover, we show that the number of degrees of freedom of the inner layers of the projected network is independent of the parameter and output dimensions, and high accuracy can be achieved with weight dimension independent of the discretization dimension.},

  abstract     = {Under fatigue-loading, short-fiber reinforced thermoplastic materials typically show a progressive degradation of the stiffness tensor. The stiffness degradation prior to failure is of primary interest from an engineering perspective, as it determines when fatigue cracks nucleate. Efficient modeling of this fatigue stage allows the engineer to monitor the fatigue-process prior to failure and design criteria which ensure a safe application of the component under investigation. We propose a multiscale model for the stiffness degradation in thermoplastic materials based on resolving the fiber microstructure. For a start, we propose a specific fatigue-damage model for the matrix, and the degradation of the thermoplastic composite arises from a rigorous homogenization procedure. The fatigue-damage model for the matrix is rather special, as its convex nature precludes localization, permits a well-defined upscaling, and is thus well-adapted to model the phase of stable stiffness degradation under fatigue loading. We demonstrate the capabilities of the full-field model by comparing the predictions on fully resolved fiber microstructures to experimental data. Furthermore, we introduce an associated model-order reduction strategy to enable component-scale simulations of the local stiffness degradation under fatigue loading. With model-order reduction in mind and upon implicit discretization in time, we transform the minimization of the incremental potential into an equivalent mixed formulation, which combines two rather attractive features. More precisely, upon order reduction, this mixed formulation permits precomputing all necessary quantities in advance, yet, retains its well-posedness in the process. We study the characteristics of the model-order reduction technique, and demonstrate its capabilities on component scale. Compared to similar approaches, the proposed model leads to improvements in runtime by more than an order of magnitude.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a deep learning-based de-homogenization method for structural compliance minimization. By using a convolutional neural network to parameterize the mapping from a set of lamination parameters on a coarse mesh to a one-scale design on a fine mesh, we avoid solving the least square problems associated with traditional de-homogenization approaches and save time correspondingly. To train the neural network , a two-step custom loss function has been developed which ensures a periodic output field that follows the local lamination orientations. A key feature of the proposed method is that the training is carried out without any use of or reference to the underlying structural optimization problem , which renders the proposed method robust and insensitive wrt domain size, boundary conditions, and loading. A post-processing procedure utilizing a distance transform on the output field skeleton is used to project the desired lamination widths onto the output field while ensuring a predefined minimum length-scale and volume fraction . To demonstrate that the deep learning approach has excellent generalization properties, numerical examples are shown for several different load and boundary conditions. For an appropriate choice of parameters, the de-homogenized designs perform within 7–25% of the homogenization-based solution at a fraction of the computational cost. With several options for further improvements, the scheme may provide the basis for future interactive high-resolution topology optimization .},

The AHA algorithm simulates the special flight skills and intelligent foraging strategies of hummingbirds in nature. Three kinds of flight skills utilized in foraging strategies, including axial, diagonal, and omnidirectional flights, are modeled. In addition, guided foraging, territorial foraging, and migrating foraging are implemented, and a visit table is constructed to model the memory function of hummingbirds for food sources. AHA is validated using two sets of numerical test functions, and the results are compared with those obtained from various algorithms. The comparisons demonstrate that AHA is more competitive than other meta-heuristic algorithms and determine high-quality solutions with fewer control parameters. Additionally, the performance of AHA is validated on ten challenging engineering design cases studies. The results show the superior effectiveness of AHA in terms of computational burden and solution precision compared with the existing optimization techniques in literature. The study also explores the application of AHA in hydropower operation design to further demonstrate its potential in practice.

However, the fracture behaviors, an indispensable factor in the engineering structure design, of the VSC are still unclear due to a lack of research. To fill in the gap, the paper presents a multi-phase-field approach to perform the failure analyses of VSC laminae at mesoscale through which the VSC lamina is modeled as an anisotropic while nonhomogenous brittle material. The proposed model is validated against experimental results of fracture behaviors of single edge cracked and open-hole FRC laminae. Then a systematic investigation of the failure analyses of the pre-cracked and open-hole VSC laminae under different designs is performed. The results reveal that the propagations of cracks are always along with the fiber orientations in notched VSC laminae. In addition, a progressive failure mode demonstrated by the load–displacement curve can be amazingly observed in some designs. Moreover, the guidance in the design of VSCs with discontinuities is also provided based on the modeling results. Our presented fundamental insights in designing the novel fracture-resistant FRCs may promote the application of VSCs in automotive and aerospace structures.},

We consider a phase-field model Aland, et al.

Full Navier–Stokes equations are considered and their finite element formulation is presented based on a residual-based variational multiscale method while a standard Galerkin finite element framework is employed for the rest of partial differential equations in the model. We solve the system of PDEs using an implicit, monolithic scheme based on the generalized- α time integration method. Compared to the system of equations considered in Aland, et al. (2014), we reduce the number of equations to be solved by leveraging high continuity of NURBS functions. We also extend the algorithm of the phase-field method to three-dimensional problems. A number of two-dimensional numerical examples which model the dynamics of a vesicle in a quiescent fluid, in a shear flow, and in plane Poiseuille flow with and without obstructions are studied. The resistive immersed surface method is employed for dealing with obstructions. We also consider a 3D example where we study the dynamics of a vesicle in a constricted channel which resembles the situation that a vesicle experiences in a stenosed microchannel.},

The technique assumes that cracks can nucleate at right angles from the boundary, at the location of enriched nodes that are added to enhance the finite element approximation . Instead of performing multiple finite element analyses to evaluate the energy release rates (ERRs) of all potential cracks—a procedure that would be computationally intractable—we approximate them by means of topological derivatives after a single enriched finite element analysis of the uncracked domain. ERRs are then aggregated to construct the objective function, and the corresponding sensitivity formulation is derived analytically by means of an adjoint formulation.

Going beyond previous works (de Borst and Duretz, 2020; Needleman , 1988; Sluys and de Borst, 1992; Wang et al., 1997), we assume that both the frequency ω ω and the wave number k k belong to the complex plane.

Considering the multi-physics nature of the problem, which involves solid and fluid species, interacting on the basis of mass balance and momentum conservation, we decide to adopt a solution strategy of the discrete problem based on iterative splitting schemes. As the model is similar (but not equivalent to) the Biot poromechanics problem, we follow the abundant literature for solvers of the latter equations, developing two approaches that resemble the well known undrained and fixed-stress splits for the Biot model. A thorough convergence analysis of the proposed schemes is performed. In particular, the undrained-like split is developed and analyzed in the framework of generalized gradient flows, whereas the fixed-stress-like split is understood as block-diagonal L 2 L2 -type stabilization and analyzed by means of a relative stability analysis. In addition, the application of Anderson acceleration is suggested, improving the robustness of the split schemes. Finally, we test these methods on different benchmark tests, and we also compare their performance with respect to a monolithic approach. Together with the theoretical analysis, the numerical examples provide guidelines to appropriately choose what split scheme shall be used to address realistic applications of the soft material poromechanics model.},

These might be related to (i) the need to deal with projections onto high dimensional linear approximating trial manifolds, (ii) expensive hyper-reduction strategies, or (iii) the intrinsic difficulty to handle physical complexity with a linear superimposition of modes. All these aspects are avoided when employing DL-ROMs, which learn in a non-intrusive way both the nonlinear trial manifold and the reduced dynamics, by relying on deep (e.g., feedforward , convolutional, autoencoder) neural networks . Although extremely efficient at testing time, when evaluating the PDE solution for any new testing-parameter instance, DL-ROMs require an expensive training stage, because of the extremely large number of network parameters to be estimated. In this paper we propose a possible way to avoid an expensive training stage of DL-ROMs, by (i) performing a prior dimensionality reduction through POD, and (ii) relying on a multi-fidelity pretraining stage, where different physical models can be efficiently combined. The proposed POD-DL-ROM is tested on several (both scalar and vector, linear and nonlinear) time-dependent parametrized PDEs (such as, e.g., linear advection–diffusion–reaction, nonlinear diffusion–reaction, nonlinear elastodynamics, and Navier–Stokes equations) to show the generality of this approach and its remarkable computational savings.},

We propose a non-nested refinement process for the splines with multiple advantages — a simple computer implementation, reduction in the footprint of C 0 C0 smoothness, boundary preservation, and excellent approximation behaviour in simulations. Furthermore, the refinement process leaves the splines invariant on the mesh boundary. Numerical tests indicate that the spline spaces demonstrate optimal approximation behaviour in the L 2 L2 and H 1 H1 norms under mesh refinement, and provide a viable approach to simulations on watertight reconstructions of trimmed surfaces.},

  abstract     = {We develop a framework for Gaussian processes regression constrained by boundary value problems. The framework may be applied to infer the solution of a well-posed boundary value problem with a known second-order differential operator and boundary conditions, but for which only scattered observations of the source term are available. Scattered observations of the solution may also be used in the regression. The framework combines co-kriging with the linear transformation of a Gaussian process together with the use of kernels given by spectral expansions in eigenfunctions of the boundary value problem. Thus, it benefits from a reduced-rank property of covariance matrices. We demonstrate that the resulting framework yields more accurate and stable solution inference as compared to physics-informed Gaussian process regression without boundary condition constraints.},
