  abstract     = {We analyse the role of new weak and strong commensurability conditions on efficiency measures and especially on productivity measurement. If strong commensurability fails, then a productivity index (indicator) may exhibit a homogeneity bias yielding inconsistent and contradictory results. In particular, we show that the Luenberger productivity indicator is sensitive to proportional changes in the input-output quantities, while the Malmquist productivity index is not affected by such changes. This is due to the homogeneity degree of the directional distance function under constant returns to scale. In particular, the directional distance function only satisfies the weak commensurability axiom in general. However, if the directional distance function is a diagonally homogeneous function of the technology, then the directional distance function satisfies strong commensurability. This explains why the direction of an arithmetic mean of the observed data works well. Numerical examples and an empirical illustration are proposed. Under a translation homothetic technology, the Luenberger productivity indicator is not affected by any additive directional transformation of the observations.},

  abstract     = {Asymptotic statistical inference on productivity and production efficiency, using nonparametric envelopment estimators, is now available thanks to the basic central limit theorems (CLTs) developed in Kneip, Simar, and Wilson (2015) . They provide asymptotic distributions of averages of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Free Disposal Hull (FDH) estimators of production efficiency. As shown in their Monte-Carlo experiments, due to the curse of dimensionality, the accuracy of the normal approximation is disappointing when the sample size is not large enough. Simar and Zelenyuk (2020) have suggested a simple way to improve the approximation by using a more appropriate estimator of the variances. In this paper we suggest a novel way to improve the approximation, by smoothing out the spurious values of efficiency estimates when they are in a neighborhood of 1. This results in sharpening the data for observations near the estimated efficient frontier. The method is very easy to implement and does not require more computations than the original method. We compare our approach using Monte-Carlo experiments, both with the basic method and with the improved method suggested in Simar &amp; Zelenyuk (2020) and in both cases we observe significant improvements. We show also that the Simar &amp; Zelenyuk (2020) idea of the variance correction can also be adapted to our sharpening method, bringing additional improvements. We illustrate the method with some real data sets.},

This framework extends the seminal work of Eeckhoudt and Schlesinger [Eeckhoudt, L. and H. Schlesinger, 2006, Putting risk in its proper place, American Economic Review , 96(1): 280–289]. We further demonstrate the close relationships between the characterized nonmonotonic risk preferences and the non-integer stochastic dominance (and the related almost stochastic dominance), and propose non-integer stochastic dominance between the second- and third-order stochastic dominances and a new type of almost stochastic dominance. Moreover, we show that the framework provides a method to experimentally elicit decision makers’ nonmonotonic risk preferences.},

However, this approach may lead to contradictory recommendations for firms to become technically and allocatively efficient. By definition, the conventional model forces firms to reduce their inputs and increase their investments in order to become technically efficient; for some firms this is followed by the reverse recommendation to become allocatively efficient. This paper proposes a model that endogenizes the directional vector to solve for the cost minimizing combination of inputs and investments. In contrast to the conventional model with an exogenous directional vector, our model provides managers with monotonic prescriptions. We illustrate the superiority of the endogenous directional vector model over its conventional counterpart using a dataset of EU firms in the dietetic food industry. The differences in the managerial prescriptions are striking, with the conventional model wrongly recommending reductions in inputs that are underused with respect to their optimal amounts minimizing cost.},

  abstract     = {Increased environmental awareness has resulted in consumers’ willingness to pay more for products with a smaller environmental footprint. Additionally, emissions trading schemes reward manufacturing firms who produce products with lower-than-average emissions rates. We examine how a manufacturer makes effective sourcing decisions, even if a supplier holds a responsibility certificate that only discloses partial information about a specific product. We also examine how a strategic production strategy (green versus traditional production) can be chosen so that the entire supply chain is motivated to become more sustainable. A game-theoretic model is developed to study the impact of an emissions trading scheme on the screening mechanism with asymmetric information and the production strategies of competing manufacturers. We first show that the performance-based contract plays an active role in driving sustainable improvements, which is consistent with practical activities occurring in the industry. We then show that a general supplier cannot receive patronage, even if the sourcing and production costs are less expensive for the manufacturer. Sourcing materials with a lower emissions rate are not a strictly dominant strategy. These findings further indicate that the equilibrium production strategy in chain-to-chain competition depends on the threshold of trading prices, the supplier’s effort, and the additional production cost per allowance saved. Moreover, even if the manufacturer has sufficient emission allowances, it still prefers to adopt the green production strategy rather than choose a cost-effective strategy to cut production and sourcing costs. The outcomes provide useful guidance for manufacturing industry practices in sustainable development.},

We focus on “long term impacts” in which a natural disaster increases costs of defensive efforts for G G . When costs for G G are higher in this way, the optimal choice by A A to provide assistance or not and the ultimate optimal choice by T T to attack or not could be altered. For all possible parameter values, a unique Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium for the specified sequential move game is identified. A comparative statics analysis is conducted to determine how the natural disaster could alter the equilibrium outcome with respect to: (i) whether A A chooses to provide assistance or not and (ii) whether T T chooses to stage an attack or not. We show that for a natural disaster of sufficiently small magnitude, we could possibly realize one of two distinct counter-intuitive outcomes in which a natural disaster leads to: (i) A A not providing assistance which otherwise would have been provided or (ii) T T not staging an attack which otherwise would have been staged. That is, after a natural disaster occurs, it could be that (i) the ally of the target of a potential terrorist attack is less likely to provide defensive support or (ii) a terrorist attack is less likely to be launched.},

  abstract     = {We introduce and solve a new multi-commodity Vehicle Routing Problem, motivated by a case study of milk collection in Chile. Different grades of raw milk are collected from a number of farms scattered over a large area and transported to a single plant, allowing milk blending at the trucks. Previous works allow blending different grades of milk in the trucks, but the resulting blend is classified as its worst grade component, even if there was a single drop of it in the blend. The novelty of our work is the use of a less conservative gradual blending rule that associates milk grades to ranges of somatic cell count per milliliter, resulting in a more accurate classification of milk. The volume and somatic cell count per milliliter of the milk produced at each farm are known before the collection, and the farms are paid accordingly. The problem is to route a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles to maximize total profit at the plant, i.e., the revenue from milk minus route cost. All the milk is collected and gradual blending is applied. We propose a mixed integer linear programming formulation and solve the problem using a branch-and-cut method for small instances, and an Iterated Local Search metaheuristic for real-size instances. Both are applied to a large set of standard instances and a real case in Chile. Our results show an increase in profit over previous milk collection strategies, of 20\% and 28\% for test instances and up to 30\% for a real instance.},

This resulted in a semiparametric smooth-coefficient (SPSC) production function. The novelty of the SPSC approach is that it can explain the direct and indirect channels through which risk can affect productivity. The study uses several measures of risk, including attitudes toward risk, perceptions of risk, and risk management skills of farmers. It then shows how these risk-related variables affect productivity both directly and indirectly via the inputs. Using 2015 farm-level data from organic basmati rice (OBR) smallholders in India, the study finds that OBR farmers with high degrees of risk aversion had lower productivity than less risk-averse or risk-neutral OBR farmers. Additionally, OBR farmers who were most concerned about production risks (i.e., weather and pest risks) had higher productivity than their counterparts. Finally, the study reveals that OBR farmers can reduce production costs by increasing farm size.},

Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) like lockdowns and curfews have been deployed by affected countries for controlling the spread of infections. In this paper, we develop a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) epidemic model for computing the optimal sequence of NPIs over a planning horizon, considering shortages in doctors and hospital beds, under three different lockdown scenarios. We analyse two strategies - centralised (homogeneous decisions at the national level) and decentralised (decisions differentiated across regions), for two objectives separately - minimization of infections and deaths, using actual pandemic data of France. We linearize the quadratic constraints and objective functions in the MINLP model and convert it to a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model. A major result that we show analytically is that under the epidemic model used, the optimal sequence of NPIs always follows a decreasing severity pattern. Using this property, we further simplify the MILP model into an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model, reducing computational time up to 99\%. Our numerical results show that a decentralised strategy is more effective in controlling infections for a given severity budget, yielding up to 20\% lesser infections, 15\% lesser deaths and 60\% lesser shortages in healthcare resources. These results hold without considering logistics aspects and for a given level of compliance of the population.},

We show that in our multi-sector model, multiplicity of equilibria may occur, even if all assumptions hold that would be sufficient for uniqueness in a single-sector model. We then contribute to the literature by deriving sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of short- and long-run market equilibrium in coupled markets of multiple energy sectors. We illustrate via simple examples that these conditions are indeed required to guarantee uniqueness in general. The uniqueness result is an important step to be able to incorporate the proposed market equilibrium problem in more complex computational multilevel equilibrium models, in which uniqueness of lower levels is a prerequisite for obtaining meaningful solutions. Our analysis also paves the way to understand and analyze more complex sector coupling models in the future.},

  abstract     = {Capturing business process specifics using a model is essential to effectively manage, control, and instruct the process participants with their roles and tasks. A normative process model is an invaluable source of information, not only for human inspection but also for software supporting and controlling the process. The actual process execution likely deviates from the normative model and the magnitude of deviation usually increases over time due to process evolution. A descriptive process model is far more informative when comes to the analysis of the actual execution of the process and spotting the deviations from the norm. However, handcrafting the descriptive model using process-related documents is prohibitively laborious. To automate the discovery of the descriptive process models, we propose Online Miner (OM), an algorithm that continuously builds process models using a stream of events raised by the process. OM first builds a sound process model using a historical event log and then incrementally adapts this model to new data chunks. OM represents the model using a Causal-net – a dependency graph of activities in which arcs are bound with each other to reflect parallel dependencies and exclusive alternatives. OM finds the maximal bindings being consistent with the event log. OM produces sound and perfect fit and generalizing well models. OM quickly reacts to the concept drift spot in the event log by seamlessly adapting the model. OM helps business analytics experts with their everyday tasks of monitoring, auditing, and enhancing business processes.},

  abstract     = {This study considers a single-period make-to-order system in which a manufacturer produces two products: product 1 (2) with tighter (looser) specifications. Production of these two products involves a specific type of materials in a common process. Due to quality discrepancies, new materials purchased from the supplier are used in the production of both product types from which spent materials can be converted into recycled materials and used in the production of product 2. Based on expected total cost minimization, we investigate the manufacturer’s decisions related to regular and expedited orders for new materials as well as the decisions related to reusing the manufacturing waste that jointly mitigate the risk of demand-and-supply mismatch through both analytical and numerical analyses. We find that at an exogenous recycling rate, waste reuse can complement the regular order for new materials in risk mitigation while lowering the manufacturer’s expected total cost when the unit expedited ordering cost is significant and becomes larger. By contrast, waste reuse with endogenous recycling makes it possible to achieve both objectives even for small expedited ordering costs, through balancing the regular order quantity and the recycling effort. Furthermore, the regular order quantity typically is inversely related to the recycled materials used in production. However, the recycling effort is inversely related to the recycled materials as the unit expedited ordering cost varies and is in sync with the recycled materials when other model parameters vary. Finally, some additional insights obtained from numerical analyses are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Efficient solid waste management is one of the most relevant issues for urban communities. With regard to the service type of household waste collection, there are two approaches in practice: when collecting household waste via a door-to-door system, the collection vehicles drive down all the streets to empty the garbage cans on the curb. Using a bring system, waste is accumulated at central collection sites with a larger capacity. While residents do have to travel an additional distance to dispose of their waste at these central collection sites, a bring system can reduce the distance to be covered by collection vehicles because they no longer have to drive down all the streets. To combine the advantages of both systems, in this article the service type decision is introduced. The corresponding waste collection problem with service type option (WCPSTO) is modeled as a new variant of a periodic location routing problem and an adaptive large neighborhood search-based solution approach is proposed. This solution approach not only solves the newly presented problem, but also outperforms a solution algorithm for a related waste collection problem seen in the literature, which can be seen as a special case of the WCPSTO.},

  abstract     = {Supplier reliability is a critical issue for manufacturing companies. Delivery delays from suppliers create backlog and firefighting on the shop floors. To avoid disruption and hedge against supplier lead time uncertainty, companies rely on diversification, multi-sourcing, and safety lead times. In multi-sourcing, the buyer might order the same product (raw material) from different suppliers. The design of a robust and cost-efficient purchasing/ordering plan in multi-sourcing is a complex task which has a strong impact on the performance of the company. In this study, we investigate the use of robust optimization for the integrated lot-sizing and supplier selection problem under lead time uncertainty. More specifically, we use polyhedral budgeted uncertainty sets. The resulting model determines the ideal lot sizes to minimize the total costs taking into consideration suppliers’ reliability and prices. To solve this problem, a row and column generation approach is proposed. To alleviate scalability issues, we enhance the row and column generation through a robust counterpart formulation, and we propose an efficient fix-and-optimize approach. Our extensive computational experiments show that the fix-and-optimize approach yields good quality solutions within a reasonable amount of computational time. We provide insights into supplier diversification based on the risk profile of the decision-maker. One of the conclusions is that an extremely risk-averse decision-maker selects a single supplier, namely the most reliable one even if it does not offer the lowest price.},

In this paper, we address the capacitated disassembly lot-sizing problems under uncertain refurbishing durations. More precisely, we consider a two-level disassembly system with a single type of end-of-life product, a dynamic demand, and stochastic refurbishing lead times for all components. To deal with the static decision frameworks, this problem is modeled as a two-stage stochastic Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP), where the objective is to minimize the expected total cost. To alleviate the scalability issues, we propose a reformulation of the inventory constraint that significantly reduces the number of scenarios. In addition, to solve large scale problems, we couple this reformulation with Monte–Carlo sampling. We provide a rolling horizon approach to deal with the static decision framework, where disassembly decisions are updated when new information unfolds. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed models and the convergence of the resulting Sample Average Approximation (SAA) estimator.},

Risk mitigation strategies in this study were measured at the supplier, manufacturing, and customer segments of a firm&#39;s supply chain.

In this context, we study planners’ adjustments to AI-generated demand forecasts. We collect a large amount of data from a leading AI provider and a large European retailer. Our dataset contains 30 million forecasts at the SKU-store-day level for 2019, plus variables related to products, weather, and holidays. In our two-phase analysis, we aim to understand the adjustments made by planners and the quality of these adjustments. Within each phase, we first identify the drivers of adjustments and their quality using random forest, a well-known ML algorithm. Next, we investigate the collective effects of the different drivers on the occurrence and the quality of the adjustments using a decision tree approach. We find that product characteristics such as price, freshness, and discounts are important factors when making adjustments. Large positive adjustments occur more frequently but are often inaccurate, while large negative adjustments are generally more accurate but fewer in number. Thus, planners do not contribute to accuracy on average. Our findings provide insights for the better use of human knowledge in judgmental forecasting.},

We give analytical approximations of the most important performance measures, such as the size of orders, the size of stocks, the percentage of outdating, the age distribution of stocks and the freshness of units issued, among others. The production of platelet concentrates is a prototypical example of inventory models for short life items with random demand and a weekly pattern, where a high service level is required. The methodology and the approximations presented here can be easily adapted to other inventory systems with similar characteristics. Most of the formulae in this article are new for nonstationary models under the EWA policy; indeed, formulae for the age distribution of units in stock and of units issued have not appeared in the literature even for the simpler base-stock replenishment policy. We apply our results to a real blood bank and find very close agreement between the formulae and the results of Monte Carlo simulations. The accuracy of our approximations is also tested in several scenarios, depending on the lifetime of units, safety stock levels and the probabilistic distribution of demand.},

  abstract     = {Current intermittent demand inventory control models assume that the demand interval is memoryless: the probability of observing a positive demand does not depend on the time since the last demand occurred. Contrarily, several forecasting contributions suggest that demand intervals contain more distributional information. We find that the data of the M5 forecasting competition confirms this. Therefore, we propose an inventory control model that explicitly uses the full distributions of the demand sizes and intervals and thereby acknowledges that the probability of a demand occurrence may vary throughout the interval. To exploit this information, we also allow for time-varying order-up-to levels that flexibly adjust inventories according to the dynamic requirements. We derive the long-run average holding costs, non-stockout probability, order fill rate, and volume fill rate. Inspired by an analogy with multi-item inventory control models, we propose a greedy marginal-analysis heuristic to optimize the order-up-to levels, which we benchmark against the optimal solution on theoretical instances. In a simulation study on the M5 competition data we demonstrate this method’s improved on-target service performance compared to that of traditional solutions. We furthermore show that target service levels can be achieved at significantly lower costs with time-varying than with fixed order-up-to levels.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a generalized model for the integrated problem of routing and scheduling of the home healthcare delivery staff (caregivers) to maximize the revenue generated. The model considers most of the commonly used constraints from the extant literature and specific concerns such as patient&#39;s preferences for the gender and language of the caregiver, inconveniences time window, and multiple visits for certain procedures that are motivated from the case of an Indian home healthcare service provider. The model is capable of handling multiple visits as well as multiple staff requirements for procedures in order to generate proper assignments, schedules, breaks and routes. A unique prospect of the model is the consideration of limited person-to-person contact to minimize the risk of exposure. The model tries to serve maximum number of patients fully without violating a predetermined maximum allowed contact limit for every patient as well as healthcare staff. Additional policy decision of allowing partial accommodation of patient&#39;s request to maximize resource utilization along with the financial viability of hiring additional capacity to fulfill all the demand is also tested. To solve the model efficiently, two different heuristic procedures based on mixed-integer programming decomposition are proposed. Further, a modified Genetic Algorithm, called p-GA, that utilizes inherent parallelism in the evolutionary process is also developed. Application of the proposed model and solution approaches to the practice is tested through extensive numerical experiments on the hybrid problem instances and some benchmark instances from the literature.},

  abstract     = {A recursive time aggregation-disaggregation (RAD) heuristic is proposed to solve large-scale multidimensional and multiperiod precedence-constrained knapsack problems (MMPKP) in which a profit is maximized by filling the knapsack in multiple periods while satisfying minimum and maximum resource consumption constraints per period as well as precedence constraints between items. An important strategic planning application of the MMPKP in the mining industry is the well-known open-pit mine block sequencing problem (BSP). In the BSP, a mine is modeled as a three-dimensional grid of blocks to determine a block extraction sequence that maximizes the net present value while satisfying constraints on the shape of the mine and resource consumption over time. Large real-life instances of this problem are difficult to solve, particularly with lower bounds on resource consumption. The advantage of the time aggregation-disaggregation heuristic over a rolling-horizon-based time decomposition is twofold: first, the entire horizon is considered for the resource consumption from the first aggregation; and second, only two-period subproblems have to be solved. This method is applied to a well-known integer programming model and a variant thereof in which blocks can be extracted in parts over multiple periods. Tests on benchmark instances show that near-optimal solutions for both of the models can be obtained for extremely large instances with up to 2,340,142 blocks and 10 periods.},

  abstract     = {This study deals with an extension of the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) by constraints on material flows released during the execution of project activities. These constraints arise from limited processing capacities for materials and maximum inventories of intermediate storage facilities. Production scheduling problems with converging material flows have been studied extensively. However, this is the first project scheduling problem integrating diverging material flows typically observed in dismantling projects, e.g., building deconstruction, power plant decommissioning, or battery/car decommissioning. Diverging material flows do not directly impact the project planning but only impose delays in the case of congestion. We model material flows by using operations that represent the processing of materials, and cumulative resources that represent storage facilities. As a method for efficiently generating starting solutions, we propose a schedule generation scheme tailored to the particular precedence structure of such problems. Furthermore, we extensively study the schedule generation scheme’s performance on generated test instances and compare it to the constraint programming solver IBM ILOG CP Optimizer. It turns out that the solution quality strongly depends on the employed model and that neither of the two solution methods is generally superior.},

  abstract     = {The recently-defined class of integer programming games (IPG) models situations where multiple self-interested decision makers interact, with their strategy sets represented by a finite set of linear constraints together with integer requirements. Many real-world problems can suitably be cast in this way, hence anticipating IPG outcomes is of crucial value for policy makers. Nash equilibria have been widely accepted as the solution concept of a game. Thus, their computation provides a reasonable prediction of games outcome. In this paper, we start by showing the computational complexity of deciding the existence of a Nash equilibrium for an IPG. Then, using sufficient conditions for their existence, we develop a general algorithmic approach that is guaranteed to return a Nash equilibrium when the game is finite and to approximate an equilibrium when payoff functions are Lipschitz continuous. We also showcase how our methodology can be changed to determine other types of equilibria. The performance of our methods is analyzed through computational experiments on knapsack, kidney exchange and a competitive lot-sizing games. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that equilibria computation methods for general IPGs have been designed and computationally tested.},

  abstract     = {In the service industry, a service provider may sell a collection of service activities as a package, also known as a service bundle. Empirical studies indicate that the customer’s ex-post perception of a service bundle depends on not only the utility of each activity, but also the sequence of the activities being delivered. The latter can be measured by certain sequence effects, such as the utility of the peak activity, the utility of the end activity, and the trend of utility change over the activities. This phenomenon gives a service provider an opportunity to optimize a service bundle by manipulating the activities and their sequence. Such a service bundle design problem can be formulated as a 0–1 sum-of-ratios problem. To solve the problem, we design a novel geometric branch-and-bound algorithm. The algorithm divides the objective function into several dimensions, and repeatedly strengthens the bounds of each dimension. This enables us to convert the 0–1 sum-of-ratios problem into a series of 0–1 quadratic optimization problems. Computational experiments show that the algorithm can solve the service bundle design problem efficiently.},

In this paper, we study a robust assortment optimization problem for substitutable products under a sequential ranking-based choice model and a cardinality constraint. Our choice model captures the increasing customer frustration of finding multiple products unavailable as a factor affecting purchasing decisions. To model the highly uncertain order in which a customer explores the products to buy, we present a bi-level optimization approach to maximize the expected revenue assuming that the customer visits a sequence of unavailable products that minimizes the likelihood of staying in the store. We show that the resulting problem is NP-hard and develop exact and greedy solution approaches that can solve different instances efficiently in terms of both solution time and optimality gap. We develop a model extension that includes multiple customer categories and also show a special case of the problem that can be solved in polynomial time. We perform a computational study to demonstrate the performance of our methods and illustrate the sensitivity of the optimal assortment to variations in the input parameters.},

The rasterized shapes provide simple procedures of the intersection test without any exceptional handling due to geometric issues, while they often require much memory and computational effort in high-resolution. To reduce the complexity of rasterized shapes, we propose a pair of scanlines representation called the double scanline representation that merges consecutive pixels in each row and column into strips with unit width, respectively. Based on this, we develop coordinate descent heuristics for the raster model that repeat a line search in the horizontal and vertical directions alternately, where we also introduce a corner detection technique used in computer vision to reduce the search space. Computational results for test instances show that the proposed algorithm obtains sufficiently dense layouts of rasterized shapes in high-resolution within a reasonable computation time.},

We show that they are equivalent in terms of value of the linear relaxation. In addition, we study the link between aggregated and disaggregated formulations, i.e., formulations where variables have an index related to vehicles. Also in this case, we show that aggregated and disaggregated formulations are equivalent in terms of the value of the corresponding linear relaxation. To the best of our knowledge, this analysis has never been done for the IRP, which instead is gaining a lot of popularity in the literature. Finally, we propose different exact solution approaches based on the aggregated formulations and we compare them with state-of-the-art exact methods for the IRP.

  abstract     = {An increasing number of online retailers (e.g., Amazon.com and JD.com) who are established as pure resellers are providing marketplace services allowing suppliers to directly sell products to consumers. These platforms’ hybrid roles of resellers and marketplaces make it possible for suppliers to distribute vertically differentiated products through the reselling or the marketplace channel. However, the suppliers’ product distribution choices are affected by the platforms’ marketplace introduction decisions, which is largely neglected in previous research. To investigate such interactions, this paper develops a game model where a supplier sells low- and high-end products through a platform retailer. The supplier makes the product distribution decision in response to the retailer&#39;s marketplace introduction choice. Our analysis shows that the game equilibrium is affected by the product differentiation level and the order-fulfillment fee charged by the retailer. First, the retailer prefers to offer the marketplace service when the order-fulfillment fee is relatively high. Second, we derive conditions under which each of the four distribution modes (pure reselling, pure marketplace, and two hybrid selling modes with different products selling in different channels) emerges in equilibrium. We disclose that the pricing right and the strategic use of the double marginalization from reselling play critical roles in the equilibrium results. Our main results highlight the importance for platform-based retailers to consider suppliers’ strategic product distribution responses when opening their platforms.},

We also provide closed-form solution for variance swap rates and analytically solve the optimal portfolio choice problem in variance swaps for an investor with a power utility function. Unlike the optimal investment with two variance swaps in two-factor models, the investor follows a “long-short-long” trading strategy involving three swap contracts. Hence, a third swap is not redundant in our three-factor model.

  abstract     = {Evaluating moving average options is a tough computational challenge for the energy and commodity market as the payoff of the option depends on the prices of a certain underlying observed on a moving window so, when a long window is considered, the pricing problem becomes high dimensional. We present an efficient method for pricing Bermudan style moving average options, based on Gaussian Process Regression and Gauss-Hermite quadrature, thus named GPR-GHQ. Specifically, the proposed algorithm proceeds backward in time and, at each time-step, the continuation value is computed only in a few points by using Gauss-Hermite quadrature, and then it is learned through Gaussian Process Regression. We test the proposed approach in the Black-Scholes model, where the GPR-GHQ method is made even more efficient by exploiting the positive homogeneity of the continuation value, which allows one to reduce the problem size. Positive homogeneity is also exploited to develop a binomial Markov chain, which is able to deal efficiently with medium-long windows. Secondly, we test GPR-GHQ in the Clewlow-Strickland model, the reference framework for modeling prices of energy commodities. Then, we investigate the performance of the proposed method in the Heston model, which is a very popular model among the non-Gaussian ones. Finally, we consider a challenging problem which involves double non-Markovian feature, that is the rough-Bergomi model. In this case, the pricing problem is even harder since the whole history of the volatility process impacts the future distribution of the process. The manuscript includes a numerical investigation, which displays that GPR-GHQ is very accurate in pricing and computing the Greeks with respect to the Longstaff-Schwartz method and it is able to handle options with a very long window, thus overcoming the problem of high dimensionality.},

  abstract     = {To manage the risk of insurance companies, a reinsurance transaction is among the myriad risk management mechanisms the top ranked choice. In this paper, we study the design of optimal reinsurance contracts within a risk measure minimization framework and subject to the Vajda condition. The Vajda condition requires the reinsurer to take an increasing proportion of the loss when it increases and therefore imposes constraints on the indemnity function. The distortion-risk-measure-based objective function is very generic, and allows for, for example, an objective to minimize the risk-adjusted value of the insurer’s liability, and for heterogeneous beliefs regarding the loss distribution by the insurer and reinsurer. Under a mild condition, we propose a backward-forward optimization method that is based on a marginal indemnity function formulation. To show the applicability and simplicity of our strategy, we provide three concrete examples with the Value-at-Risk: one with the risk-adjusted value of the insurer’s liability, one with an objective function that follows from imposing Pareto optimality, and one with heterogeneous beliefs. We conclude this paper with an empirical application with Danish fire insurance losses and the Value-at-Risk and the Tail Value-at-Risk.},

  abstract     = {With the rise of the e-economy, online retailers, which are often financial-constrained, can choose to borrow from e-commerce platforms in addition to traditional financial institutions. Many e-commerce platforms adopt two types of market channel cooperation contracts: Reselling or Marketplace. We model their interaction as a Stackelberg game, studying the interaction between the financing strategies of the online retailers and the channel sales cooperation contracts of the e-commerce platforms. We observe the characteristics and applicable conditions in four modes. Results show that the working capital level of the online retailer will affect the preferences of both parties. Specifically, when working capital is low, platform direct financing has no advantage over bank financing. By contrast, a higher level will affect the operational decisions of the e-commerce platform, mainly due to the trade-off between sales revenue and interest income. Combined with the characteristics of online trading information collected by e-commerce platforms, we find that platform can provide a means of risk control to guarantee the benefits of both parties and solve the financing dilemma caused by low working capital. We further determine that the fixed commission rate of the platform should not be too large, otherwise the profits of the online retailer will be greatly weakened. This paper proves the necessity of the existence of transfer payment platform usage fee. Our findings not only complement the emerging online marketplace literature for e-commerce platforms but also provide enlightenment on working capital management for small and medium-sized enterprises and self-employed individuals such as online retailers.},

  abstract     = {We study an operational planning problem arising in the offshore oil and gas industry, in which we determine routes, as well as sailing speeds along these routes, for a set of platform supply vessels (PSVs) servicing a given set of delivery and pickup orders such that costs are minimized. The sailing costs, mainly induced by fuel consumption for the PSVs, heavily depend on the chosen sailing speeds. Furthermore, the fuel consumption and the feasible speed ranges for the PSVs are largely affected by weather conditions that may vary over time, resulting in a weather- or Time-Dependent Vessel Routing Problem with Speed Optimization (TDVRP-SO). Optional decisions include the postponement of certain orders and the chartering of spot vessels, both associated with additional costs. We present a time-discrete mixed integer programming (MIP) model for the TDVRP-SO. To overcome the challenges of solving large-scale instances of the TDVRP-SO with a commercial MIP solver, we propose an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) heuristic extended with a local search and a set partitioning model. The ALNS heuristic also includes solving the sub-problem of determining the optimal sailing speeds along each PSV route. Computational tests on instances based on a real planning case from the Norwegian continental shelf show that the ALNS heuristic efficiently provides high-quality solutions. It is also demonstrated that, in contrast to current planning practice, accounting for speed optimization and weather conditions significantly improves the solutions.},

In our model, we assume that the distributions, the first- and second-order moments of returns of assets and exchange rates are ambiguous. To control the conservatism of our robust model, we incorporate a new support set constructed by intervals of deviations from the no-arbitrage condition in currency markets into the ambiguity set of distribution. Our model can be reformulated as an equivalent semi-definite programming problem, which is computationally tractable. We conduct empirical experiments by the weekly rolling window strategy during the total period, the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis period, and the recent stable period. Using various performance measures, we investigate the out-of-sample performance of our model with comparison to those of other four benchmark models. The experimental results demonstrate that our model has the best performance in terms of return and various risk adjusted return measures during all of the three periods. They suggest that investors can obtain significant benefits when employing the robust portfolio strategy and the new support set, and considering the ambiguity of the first- and second-order moments during both volatile and stable periods.},

  abstract     = {When earthquakes and other natural disasters occur, a surge in demand for life-supporting commodities can occur alongside transportation network disruption. Slow and ineffective delivery of water, food, medical supplies, and survival equipment can lead to high levels of anxiety in the population, mistrust for the government, and potentially social conflict and increased casualties. Thus, the issue of how to effectively and efficiently distribute essential commodities in the highly stochastic post-disaster response phase is extremely critical. In this research, we create a network flow model which allows the transportation of goods not only from distribution center to relief centers, but also among the relief centers. This structure allows local relief centers to support each other, which we show leads to much greater efficiency of commodity distribution to meet the demands of each relief center in the face of uncertain transportation network flow. We collaborate with the National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction (NCDR) in Taiwan to model and simulate the relationship between earthquake attributes (e.g., magnitude, time of strike) and the resulting status of the transportation network and speed of vehicle traffic. By applying simulation optimization techniques to solve the split delivery multiple destination inventory routing problem, we are able to obtain the best vehicle and inventory routing decision under varying disaster scenarios. The resulting actionable insights can alleviate civil unrest and anxiety as well as save lives after a major earthquake.},

The uncertainty of the green regulation arises from the probability of its occurrence. It is assumed that ocean carriers can adopt one of the two green strategies, i.e., the equipment upgrade strategy or the slow steaming strategy, to comply with the potential green regulation. This paper aims to examine the stable green strategies as well as the pricing decisions of competitive carriers in the shipping market considering the service differentiation and the upgrade risk. A two-period game model is formulated to seek the sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium under potential regulation. We obtain the final sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium, i.e., when the probability of enacting regulation is sufficiently high, there is always one carrier that will adopt the equipment upgrade strategy. However, because of the joint impact of market competition and uncertain regulation, the two carriers will never adopt the equipment upgrade strategy simultaneously. In addition, our results show that the potential regulation sometimes may help the two carriers achieve the optimal outcome. Nevertheless, the carriers may fall into a “sub-optimal outcome” in some situations.},

  abstract     = {Planning and scheduling the multiple bottling lines of large wineries can significantly increase or reduce their inventory cost and bottling lines operating costs. It also determines how well they meet their clients’ demand, which is critical for wineries. A good plan must consider demand, labour availability, bottling and labelling lines capacities, and the required materials. It also must ensure that the product is available on time, simultaneously keeping finished product inventory as low as possible, and efficiently using the lines and labour. For this, the planner must consider a large number of parameters, like customer orders, the lines’ production and labour capacities, bottling supplies availability, storage capacity, and labour costs. Furthermore, bottling wine has sequence-dependent set-up times. Changing from bottling red wine to white requires twice the set-up time needed to change from white to red, due to line cleaning. This makes planning and scheduling multiple bottling lines a complex process. We developed two models to support this process for a large winery: a basic one and one that generates more robust plans. Since solving this problem is difficult, we devised a decomposition algorithm that takes advantage of the different set-up types to reduce the time required to solve large problem instances. The results showed cost reductions of approximately 15\% to 30\% on test problems. We could also generate more robust plans without a significant cost increase. The model and solution approach were used to implement a decision support system for a large winery.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the optimal financial hedging strategy and sustainable development in four supply chain structures. To help manufacturers reasonably hedge the risks caused by the fluctuation of input commodity prices, we use an index-based price contract by which manufacturers can transfer part of their risk to downstream retailers and realize risk-sharing in the supply chain. We discuss the optimal hedging strategy and the product&#39;s green degree in four structures: monopoly (manufacturer sets contract), monopoly with Nash bargaining, retailer competition, and manufacturer competition. Our model follows two-stage Stackelberg game, which delivers us the results that the hedge ratio is positively related to the consumer&#39;s preference for green products but is inversely related to the green product research and development costs. Interestingly, in the manufacturer competition supply chain, the profits of both manufacturers increase significantly when the input commodity price fluctuates slightly, but as that fluctuation continually increases, the profit of one manufacturer declines, while the profit of the other rises slowly. Considering another perspective, green degree competition harms the profits of the manufacturers and the retailer, as well as decreasing the green degree.},

Therefore, how to use the difference of opinions and the relationships between experts to promote the consensus is an important issue. This paper proposed a CRP approach for large-scale group decision-making based on bounded confidence and social network to manage experts’ opinions. Firstly, a fast unfolding algorithm was used to reduce the dimension of the large-scale and the experts’ weights were obtained by social network analysis. Secondly, the CRP was built based on the Manhattan distance, and the feedback mechanism was developed to adjust experts’ opinions based on bounded confidence and social network when the experts did not reach a consensus. A numerical example was used to show the feasibility of the proposed approach and the results illustrated that the consensus speed was faster and the information managed more efficiently. The comparisons with other approaches showed the advantage of our proposed approach. Finally, simulation experiments were given to verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

We utilize research on intuitive decision making from psychology to build a model of mixing intuition and analysis over a set of interrelated tasks, where the choice of intuition or analysis in one task affects the choice in other tasks. In this model, people may use any analytical method, such as multi-attribute utility, or a single-cue heuristic, such as availability or recognition. The article makes two contributions. First, we study the model and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the optimality of using a positive proportion of intuition (i.e., for some tasks): Intuition is more frequently accurate than analysis to a larger extent than analysis is more frequently accurate than guessing. Second, we apply the model to synthetic data and also natural data from a forecasting competition for a Wimbledon tennis tournament and a King’s Fund study on how patients choose a London hospital: The optimal proportion of intuition is estimated to range from 25\% to 53\%. The accuracy benefit of using the optimal mix over analysis alone is estimated between 3\% and 27\%. Such improvements would be impactful over large numbers of choices as in public health.},

  abstract     = {The dramatic growth of consumer credit market induces online platforms to adapt their operations in response to credit offering strategy when facing consumer strategic behavior. This study proposes a two-period pricing model for investigating platforms’ offering strategy of consumer credit and responding pricing policy, considering consumer strategic behavior and hassle cost from the credit. Consumers are heterogeneous in their disposable personal income (DPI) and valuations for the product, and are strategic in choosing the purchase timing to optimize their valuations. We find that the platform is willing to offer the credit when both the credit risk and the credit hassle cost are not sufficiently high, and the interest-free credit is sometimes more attractive over non-interest-free credit. In response to credit offering, the first and second period prices decrease as compared to the conventional case with no consumer credit, resulting in the increased first period demand and decreased second period demand. In addition, the platform&#39;s credit offering may mitigate consumer waiting behavior because of the direct effect of diminished passive waiting for consumers with low DPIs. Interestingly, credit offering may aggravate consumer strategic waiting. This may lead to an increased profit loss due to strategic consumer. Moreover, the proportion of consumers with high DPIs is critical for the platform in determining the credit offering strategy and pricing decision. Extended analyses uncover that positive spillover and network effects increase the platform&#39;s incentive to offer the credit. Surprisingly, credit offering may alleviate consumer strategic waiting when the strength of network effects is strong and hassle cost is low, and the platform&#39;s role, acting as a reseller or a marketplace has no qualitative effect on the consumer&#39;s strategic behavior.},

  abstract     = {There has been extensive academic research on the optimisation of reverse logistics (RL) and closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network design. However, the existing literature is lacking in several features of practical relevance, and the simultaneous consideration of dynamic characteristics, including the multi-period setting, inventory factors, environmental footprints, and scalability of the application. This shortcoming is primarily due to the challenges associated with computation complexity, mathematical formulation, and the need for a faster solution method to solve such large-scale problems in real-time. In this research, we address these challenges and investigate the multi-facility green RL network design problem, integrating carbon footprint and vehicle selection, entailing allocation between the facilities in the multi-period setting to incorporate the dynamic characteristics. We formulate a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to minimise the total cost, comprising the carbon emission cost due to transport and production at the facilities. We also investigate the effects of carbon emissions and the choice of the vehicle fleet on the network&#39;s structure. The novelty of our research lies in the development and application of an exact solution method, namely “Improved Benders Decomposition (IBD)” with several algorithmic enhancements, including a strengthened master problem, valid inequalities, a heuristic, and a multi-stage strategy to accelerate the convergence of the Benders decomposition method. By combining these elements, the proposed IBD solves the MILP model, provides a faster solution methodology with improved convergence of the bounds, and addresses the inherent intractability of the existing problem. We apply our proposed heuristic on a set of 12 problem configurations under distinct scenarios. We show that the proposed IBD heuristic outperforms existing traditional methods in terms of solution quality, computational time, and robustness.},

They are supposed to select the best route for service requests in case of time-varying demand and different service patterns. In addition, it is necessary to choose appropriate routing metrics so as to satisfy user requirements for a variety of services. Multiple quality of service (QoS) requirements must be considered in the dynamic environment as a result of high demand for service networks. To that end, we propose an agent-based algorithm to address the routing problem in service networks. We construct a multi-layer network model to figure out component behaviors and complicated relationship between components under uncertainty. In order to reflect various service requirements, QoS metrics are defined from the perspectives of component and link. We also put forward an improved deep Q-learning method to achieve global convergence and enhance the efficiency of the routing algorithm. The numerical results on a case study illustrate the proposed algorithm finds high-quality solutions at acceptable costs, which routes service requests properly in the dynamic network environment. The proposed algorithm achieves outstanding performance compared with state-of-the-art routing algorithms in terms of delay and service factor.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses recovery strategies for supply chain enterprises under uncertain demand. Specifically, a bank or supplier is considered to provide financing for a capital-constrained retailer to reduce or even eliminate the negative impact of disruption. The problem is formulated with a bank-supplier-retailer game model. A robust optimization approach is used to obtain the retailer’s minimax regret order quantity where only the upper and lower bound of demand are known. Four financing strategy combinations for two-stage financing before and after demand disruption are proposed, including bank-bank, supplier-supplier, bank-supplier, and supplier-bank. With respect to supply chain recovery, three strategies of mixed recovery, pure penalty, and pure investment are proposed, and their performances are examined. Furthermore, the impact of each financing combination and recovery strategy on the retailer’s regret, bankruptcy risk, and profit are analyzed, which provides a basis for financing decisions. The relevant results show that the pure investment strategy can not only protect the bank and supplier from losing profit due to disruption, but also bring less bankruptcy risk to the retailer. On the other hand, penalty strategy can also mitigate the negative impact of disruption on the supplier, but it will lead the retailer to facing higher risk of bankruptcy. For the retailer, the bank-bank and bank-supplier financing combination is superior to the others because they are less likely to result in bankruptcy. Finally, as an extension, the proposed models are applied to some other financing schemes which are commonly employed in practice, and some managerial implications are drawn.},

  abstract     = {Searching for achieving an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, the EU has set as a goal a modal shift in freight transport of 30\% by rail for the near future. In this context, it is vital to use modal choice models road versus rail to assess the shippers’ acceptance of the actions promoting the use of rail. This paper develops a combined model for jointly evaluating modal split and railway freight flows, addressed to the case when a modal split based on a random utility model is available, and some of its coefficients may present a non-negligible variability. To this end, after the initial deterministic formulation a robust counterpart of the model is developed. The model, formulated as a non-linear integer programming problem, is oriented to a multi-carrier environment and includes constraints to consider the interactions between the different types of flows on the railway network, allowing a good evaluation of the cost types of the carriers and the network capacity. An algorithmic solution based on the outer approximation method is shown to provide accurate solutions in a reasonable computational time for the robust and non-robust versions of the model. Examples centered on a section of the Trans-European Transport Network, the TEN-T Core network corridors, are reported to test the model’s applicability. Results show that this model can be a helpful tool for analyzing the possible shippers’ response to the different railway carriers’ services competing with the road.},

  abstract     = {Many infrastructure systems are governed by non-monetary capacity allocation: users submit scheduling requests and an infrastructure manager determines a schedule of utilization given capacity restrictions. Two broad approaches exist to cope with information asymmetry. Under a primary mechanism , the infrastructure manager determines the eventual schedule. Under a secondary mechanism , users can swap their service units following the scheduling adjustments from the infrastructure manager. The secondary mechanism provides flexibility to align the schedule with users’ (private) preferences. However, this paper shows that the secondary mechanism may not result in more efficient outcomes when users are strategic. We develop a multi-stage capacity allocation game in infrastructure systems characterized by multi-period operations, discrete service units and non-atomistic users. We show that the primary mechanism either is incentive compatible, or incentivizes users to voluntarily displace low-value service units from peak to off-peak periods. Such “good gaming” behaviors mitigate system-wide costs. In contrast, the secondary mechanism incentivizes users to request more service units than preferred in peak periods. Such “bad gaming” behaviors increase system-wide costs. The costs from “bad gaming” may outweigh the benefits from secondary swaps: system-wide costs can be lower under the (restricted) primary mechanism than under the (flexible) secondary mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Last-mile logistics is regarded as an essential yet highly expensive component of parcel logistics. In dense urban environments, this is partially caused by inherent inefficiencies due to traffic congestion and the disparity and accessibility of customer locations. In parcel logistics, access hubs are facilities supporting relay-based last-mile activities by offering temporary storage locations enabling the decoupling of last-mile activities from the rest of the urban distribution chain. This paper focuses on a novel tactical problem: the dynamic deployment of pooled storage capacity modules in an urban parcel network. It formulates the problem as a two-stage stochastic optimization model with recourse, and incorporates the synchronization of underlying operations through continuum approximation-based travel time estimations. It also develops a solution approach based on a rolling horizon algorithm with lookahead, sample average approximation and Benders decomposition enhanced by acceleration methods, able to solve large scale instances of a real-sized megacity. Numerical results, inspired by the case of a large parcel express carrier, are provided to evaluate the computational performance of the proposed approach and suggest up to 28\% 28\% last-mile cost savings and 26\% 26\% capacity savings compared to a static capacity deployment strategy.},

  abstract     = {A continuous supply of used products ensures large-scale remanufacturing. Manufacturers can delegate used product collection to third-party collectors (3PCs) that provide a trade-old-for-cash (TOC) program, in addition to collecting used products through a trade-old-for-new (TON) program. However, few studies have investigated the interactions between collection delegation and channel structure in a supply chain. To fill this gap, we develop game-theoretic models in a supply chain under traditional retail channel and dual-channel structures to explore whether and when the manufacturer adopts the collection delegation policy and examine the optimal channel choice for trade-ins. Our finding shows that the manufacturer always benefits from collection delegation, but the retailer would be worse off from such delegation in certain cases. To be specific, under the retail channel structure, collection delegation has no impact on the retailer when the salvage value of used products is relatively low, whereas it hurts the retailer when the salvage value is relatively high. However, under the dual-channel structure, collection delegation never affects the retailer. Moreover, we find that the manufacturer&#39;s channel choice depends on the consumer acceptance of the direct channel and the salvage value of used products. We further consider the case that the manufacturer does not introduce the TON programs to explore the effects of TON and the case that the new and remanufactured products are sold at different retail prices to examine the equilibrium strategies. Our results can provide useful managerial insights for decisions-makers who face the choice of collection delegation under different channel structures.},

To speed up deliveries and lower costs, some companies have been using private individuals as non-dedicated drivers to perform pickup and delivery tasks for online customers. Such delivery systems are known as crowd-shipping. Customers have come to expect an accurate estimate for the delivery times of their online orders. The coordination of online deliveries with private individuals is done by a crowd-shipping platform. In this paper, we focus on the estimation of pickup and delivery times. This is a challenging job because not only are the requests unknown and submitted dynamically, but so is the pool of drivers, i.e. delivery capacity. We model the problem as a Markov decision process and integrate it into a simulation study. To improve the estimates that can be done by a naive policy, we propose two policies that use lookahead: one with a fixed lookahead horizon and one with a dynamic. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that a lookahead policy with dynamically adjusted horizon outperforms the other two policies in terms of estimation accuracy, which is up to 19\% 19\% higher in some instances.},

Jobs from the same family have the same processing time and can be loaded into a batch, as long as the batch size respects the machine capacity. The objective is to minimize the total weighted completion time; this common scheduling objective is equivalent with the minimization of in-process inventory when all jobs have the same release date. Our problem combines two classic combinatorial problems, namely bin packing and single machine scheduling. We develop three new mixed-integer linear-programming formulations, namely an assignment-based formulation, a time-indexed formulation (TIF), and a set-partitioning formulation (SPF). We also propose a column generation (CG) algorithm for the SPF, a branch-and-price (B&amp;P) algorithm and a CG-based heuristic. A heuristic framework based on proximity search is also developed using the TIF. We examine how to reduce the size (number of variables) of the formulations in a preprocessing step. The SPF and B&amp;P can solve instances with non-unit and unit job durations to optimality with up to 80 and 150 jobs within reasonable runtime limits, respectively. The proposed heuristics perform better than the methods available in the literature for the same problem.},

It is investigated if optimal permutation schedules exist, i.e., schedules which minimize the makespan within the set of all schedules and where the job sequence on both machines is the same. Two standard buffer models (an intermediate buffer that a job occupies between its processing on the two machines and a spanning buffer which is occupied by a job over all of its processing steps) are considered for two types of buffer usage: i) all jobs occupy the same buffer amount and ii) for each job the occupied buffer amount equals its processing time on the machine with non-constant times. For (i) and both buffer models, it is shown that the set of optimal schedules always contains at least one permutation schedule. For (ii) the existence of optimal permutation schedules is only guaranteed for instances with n n jobs for all n ≤ 6 n≤6 (spanning buffer) and for all n ≤ 3 n≤3 (intermediate buffer). For each n &gt; 6 n&amp;gt;6 (spanning buffer) and each n &gt; 3 n&amp;gt;3 (intermediate buffer) exists an instance which does not have an optimal permutation schedule.

We extract a novel integer programming model that integrates bin packing with the multi-level lot-sizing problem, which is characterized by re-configurable bins and configuration-dependent processing time. To obtain tighter lower bounds, we decompose the original model into a master problem and several sub-problems based on the Dantzig–Wolfe framework. To accelerate the column generation process, we develop a bi-level dynamic programming algorithm to solve the sub-problems exactly. A hybrid algorithm that combines the column generation and the fix-and-optimize heuristic is proposed to generate high-quality upper bounds. We first evaluate the quality of the lower bounds obtained from the linearly relaxed restricted master problem and then demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed heuristic algorithm in terms of the solution quality and computational efficiency by comparing it with CPLEX, a commercial solver. In addition, we conduct sensitivity analysis of the bi-level dynamic programming to investigate the impact of the processing time required by the configuration-based bins. Moreover, a case study was conducted, which demonstrated the effect on cost reduction by shortening the length of unit time period in the planning horizon.},

The purpose of MPOP is to maximize the total profits collected from the vertices while satisfying the travel time limit constraint. To date, no exact algorithm has been developed for MPOP. This paper proposes a dynamic programming (DP)-based exact algorithm for MPOP for the first time.

  abstract     = {Railway timetable planning is one of the key factors in the successful operation of a railway network. The timetable must satisfy all operational restrictions at a microscopic representation of the railway network, while maximizing transportation capacity for passengers and freight. The microscopic planning of a railway timetable is an NP-Hard problem, difficult to solve for large-scale railway networks, such as those of entire countries. In this work, we propose a logic Benders decomposition approach to solve the problem of microscopic railway timetable planning. Our decomposition exploits the typical structure of a railway with dense networks around major hubs and sparse connections in-between hubs. A logic Benders cut is designed, which we are able to compute effectively for all decomposed problems within our considered structure, using a SAT based algorithm we developed. Moreover, an aggregation scheme for Benders cuts is proposed to speed up the iterative process. Experiments on real-world cases of the Swiss Federal Railways show a clear improvement in scalability compared to a variety of benchmarks including centralized approaches.},

  abstract     = {Port terminals play a critical role in the context of world trade since they are the main nodes responsible for connecting sea and land transportation. There are several optimization problems arising in port terminals, and those involving berth allocation are among the most important ones. They constitute the first level of terminal planning operations. As a consequence, the corresponding decisions impact all the subsequent operations in the port terminals. Berth allocation decisions are often integrated with quay crane assignment and/or scheduling decisions. However, the quality of these decisions is greatly affected by unpredictable events that may occur frequently. Since 2006, different approaches have been proposed for solving general berth allocation problems under uncertainty. This paper provides an exhaustive survey of the works published in the literature addressing berth allocation and berth allocation and quay cranes assignment/scheduling problems under uncertainty. The publications are classified into three main classes of approaches: proactive, reactive, and proactive/reactive. An overview of the main methodologies proposed, including stochastic programming, robust optimization, fuzzy programming, and deterministic approaches, is provided. The common sources of uncertainty are identified, and the representation of the uncertain parameters is highlighted. The papers are also classified according to the main objectives to be optimized and the solution methods proposed. We identify several research trends, limitations in the current literature and future research directions.},

To solve these problems, a novel method considering heterogeneous influence and strength attenuation (HISA) effects is developed in this paper. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by applying it to design of smart home system. Comparisons between the proposed method and previous approaches are conducted.

  abstract     = {Generation expansion planning is a classical problem that determines an optimal investment plan for the expansion of electricity network. With the advent of demand response as a reserved capacity in smart power systems, recent versions of this class of problems model demand response as an alternative for the expansion of the network. This adds uncertainties, since the availability of this resource is not known at the planning phase. In this paper, we model demand response uncertainty in a multi-commodity energy model, called ETEM, to address the generation expansion planning problem. The resulting model takes the form of an intractable multi-period adjustable robust problem which can be conservatively approximated using affine decision rules. To tackle instances of realistic size, we propose a Benders decomposition that exploits valid inequalities and favors Pareto robustly optimal solutions at each iteration. The performance of our new robust ETEM is evaluated in a realistic case study that surveys the energy system of the Swiss “Arc Lémanique” region. Results show that an adjustable robust strategy can potentially reduce the expected cost of the system by as much as 33\% compared to a deterministic approach when accounting for electricity shortage penalties. Moreover, an adjustable procurement strategy can be responsible for a 9 billion Swiss francs cost reduction compared to a naive static robust strategy. The proposed decomposition scheme improves the run time of the solution algorithm by 40\% compared to the traditional Benders decomposition. To conclude, we provide a discussion on other possible problem formulations and implementations.},

To accommodate heterogeneity across firms in terms of production technology and sources of growth, we consider a nonparametric production function and decompose firm output growth at both the mean and different quantiles of the output distribution. Nonparametric estimation techniques and recentered influence functions are used to facilitate our decomposition. In addition, we decompose the aggregate industry productivity growth into three sources, viz., survivors’ productivity growth, market dynamics, and reallocation of market shares. Given the market-oriented economic reforms undergoing in China during our sample period, contributions to aggregate productivity coming from dynamic ownership changes are also examined.},

A promising concept in this context are truck-and-robot systems with robot depots, as they enable significant cost and traffic reduction compared to classic truck deliveries. The system relies on small autonomous delivery robots to cover the last meters to a customer. Existing concepts consider home deliveries by robots, while trucks are only used to transport robots and not for deliveries. This assumption disregards the fact that regular truck deliveries are still needed for some delivery requests, such as for the delivery of bulky items, or for customers who do not accept robots. Our research addresses this issue and proposes the first mixed truck and robot delivery concept with robot depots in which both robots and the delivery truck can visit customers. Our tailored solution approach is based on a General Variable Neighborhood Search that efficiently solves the routing problem and outperforms existing truck-and-robot routing algorithms (reducing the runtime by 37 to 94\% in experiments). The numerical experiments show that this approach enables cost reductions of up to 43\% compared to classical truck deliveries and up to 22\% compared to a truck-and-robot system that does not allow deliveries by both truck and robots on the same tour. Further analyses reveal additional benefits of such mixed tours and the robustness of our approach for different problem settings.},

The subsidy-promoting policies are oftentimes justified on the ground that subsidies increase the recipient firms’ innovation and productivity. We develop a novel (semiparametric) method to structurally identify the firm-level productivity in the presence of subsidies. Unlike previous studies, we assume that subsidies are endogenous. To correct for the endogeneity problem, we use a switching regression in our semiparametric production function. Our method provides an improved framework for estimating the production function with endogenous and/or censored variables. We apply our method to study the effect of subsidies on firm-level productivity in the Chinese machinery industry, using panel data from 1998 to 2007. We find strong empirical evidence that subsidies have a positive effect on firms’ persistent productivity. Subsidies may allow firms to invest more on research and development (R&amp;D) and thus improve productivity. Using the available R&amp;D data, we find evidence to support this explanation that more subsidies are associated with higher R&amp;D investment. We also carry out a decomposition analysis to separately examine the subsidy effect on output via the input channel and the persistent productivity channel. Opposite effects are found from the two channels and overall subsidies have a positive effect on a firm’s output.},

Inefficiency and productivity dynamics are explored in some detail along with marginal effects of contextual variables on productivity growth, inputs, and output. Additionally, we examine the causal structure between inefficiency and productivity as well as model validity based on a causal deconfounding approach.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces the Vessel Swap-Body Routing problem (VSBR), a generalization of the pickup and delivery problem with time windows, which considers freight distribution between ports located throughout an inland waterway network. Subject to time windows and precedence constraints, each customer request is associated with a number of containers and must be served via a single body. Bodies are capacitated components that cannot move independently and must therefore be towed by a vessel. Bodies can be transferred between vessels at customer locations or transfer points in order to reduce overall costs. Vessels and bodies can end their routes at any location, meaning they do not need to return to a depot. Moreover, every vessel-body combination is permitted, which greatly expands the size of the solution search space. Although body transfers constitute a fundamental component of this real-world problem, the flexibility such transfers engender poses a huge logistical challenge to the human planners tasked with efficiently scheduling vessel routes. In this paper we model the VSBR as an optimization problem and introduce complementary approaches for solving it. We propose a mixed integer programming formulation and a heuristic approach with tailored neighborhoods for body transfers. To help stimulate further research, a set of instances is introduced based on real-world data and benchmarks are made publicly available.},

  abstract     = {Failure detectors (FDs) are fundamental building blocks for distributed systems. An FD detects whether a process has crashed or not based on the reception of heartbeats’ messages sent by this process over a communication channel. A key challenge of FDs is to tune their parameters to achieve optimal performance which satisfies the desired system requirements. This is challenging due to the complexities of large-scale networks. Existing FDs ignore such optimisation and adopt ad-hoc parameters. In this paper, we propose a new Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimisation-based FD algorithm. We obtain the MILP formulation via piecewise linearisation relaxations. The MILP involves obtaining optimal FD parameters that meet the optimal trade-off between its performance metrics requirements, network conditions and system parameters. The MILP maximises our FD’s accuracy under bounded failure detection time while considering network and system conditions as constraints. The MILP’s solution represents optimised FD parameters that maximise FD’s expected performance. To adapt to real-time network changes, our proposed MILP-based FD fits the probability distribution of heartbeats’ inter-arrivals. To address our FD scalability challenge in large-scale systems where the MILP model needs to compute approximate optimal solutions quickly, we also propose a heuristic algorithm. To test our proposed approach, we adopt Amazon Cloud as a realistic testing environment and develop a simulator for robustness tests. Our results show consistent improvement of overall FD performance and scalability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine the MILP-based optimisation modelling with FD to achieve performance guarantees.},

In dynamic focus programming, there are two distinct evaluation systems: Positive and negative ones. Each possible path consisting of a decision sequence from the initial stage to the final stage and the associated states is examined. In the positive evaluation system, for each decision in the initial stage, if a path starting from it can bring about a relatively low total cost with a relatively high probability, then this path is selected as the positive focus path of this decision; based on the positive focus paths of all initial decisions, a decision maker chooses a most-preferred decision rule.

For a specific sequential decision problem, only one system is activated; as for which one works, it is strongly dependent on decision maker&#39;s personality and the framing. We apply dynamic focus programming to a real bidding decision-making problem: We obtain the optimal decision rule and gain the behavioral insights of the decision maker.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we consider linear bilevel programming problems with multiple objective functions at the lower level. We propose a general-purpose exact method to compute the optimistic optimal solution, which is based on the search of efficient extreme solutions of an associated multiobjective linear problem with many objective functions. We also explore a heuristic procedure relying on the same principles. Although this procedure cannot ensure the global optimal solution but just a local optimum, it has shown to be quite effective in problems where the global optimum is difficult to obtain within a reasonable timeframe. A computational study is presented to evaluate the performance of the exact method and the heuristic procedure, comparing them with an exact and an approximate method proposed by other authors, using randomly generated instances. Our approach reveals interesting results in problems with few upper-level variables.},

Our framework relies on the axiomatization of a value transformation set on which quantity, price and value distance functions can be defined. The methodology developed allows for various degrees of dependency between quantity and price as well as for different degrees of freedom in price setting. The value-based performance decomposition can encompass all traditional measures such as cost, revenue, profit and profitability efficiencies.

We show how entry timing and product position interact under uncertainty. The expected result under real options holds: the leader’s entry threshold monotonically increases with volatility, which means that the leader abandons earlier period monopoly profits, which are not so time discounted. The significant findings are as follows: First, from the expected result, the larger the abandoned monopoly profits in earlier periods through volatility, the closer to the edge the leader’s product position. Second, this property of the leader’s decision regarding its product position makes the follower’s entry threshold non-monotonic with a positive correlation to volatility, in contrast to previous studies in the real options literature. The above two results have an important implication: the leader values the abandoned monopoly profits in earlier periods through volatility more than the highly increased monopoly profits in later periods through delayed entry by the follower.},

Three possible power structures between manufacturer and retailer in the dual-channel supply chain, i.e., Manufacturer Stackelberg, Retailer Stackelberg and Vertical Nash, are considered. Under each of the three power structures, decision models are developed with stochastic dynamic programming to determine how to adjust the pricing and inventory decisions in every period so that each member’s total expected discounted profit over the planning horizon is maximized. The effects of the power structure are analyzed by comparing the optimal dynamic pricing and inventory policies under different power structures. Our main findings include: (i) the optimal dynamic pricing and inventory policy of a dual-channel supply chain is an inventory-dependent base-stock-list-price policy; (ii) base stock levels and reduced prices are affected by starting inventory levels; (iii) the influence rules on reduced prices under different power structures are the same, while the influence rules on base stock levels vary according to the power structure; (iv) optimal pricing and inventory decisions are affected by the power structure, although the structural properties of the optimal policies under different power structures are the same. Results from numerical examples show that, for the two-period dual-channel supply chain, manufacturer and retailer prefer Vertical Nash when the wholesale price is low, while they prefer Manufacturer Stackelberg when the wholesale price is high.},

  abstract     = {Spare parts inventory management is complex due to the combined impact of intermittent and variable demand patterns. It becomes even more challenging if the spare parts demand distribution is highly complex due to strong interdependent demand intermittency and extremely irregular demand. The research literature proposes many analytical methods for forecasting spare parts demand. But, due to their limited flexibility in modeling complex demand patterns, existing forecasting methods may not produce satisfactory results for a spare parts portfolio displaying extremely complex demand patterns. This study proposes a novel nonparametric Bayesian forecasting approach with its roots in the empirical Bayes paradigm. The method is subject to few performance constraints and is highly flexible in dealing with a rich diversity of demand patterns, including extreme demand complexity. We assess the relative performance of this new approach with several prominent methods in the literature using an automotive parts distributor&#39;s empirical demand data for 46,272 stock-keeping units. This dataset is representative of typical spare parts portfolios that are characterized by a wide variety and extremely complex demand patterns. The experimental findings show the new Bayesian approach achieves the best overall performance in terms of inventory efficiency and minimal backorders for meeting specified target service levels. This favorable performance reflects the approach&#39;s flexibility to accommodate disparate and complex demand patterns, including interdependence of demand intermittency, irregular demand distribution, and even nonstationary demand distribution to some extent, and provide robust solutions.},

With the comparison of monopolistic and competitive scenarios, we find that channel discrimination and collection convenience drive the competitive collection. Specifically, extreme channel discrimination reduces competitive collection, whereas, with reasonable channel discrimination, a more competitive market has a higher collection convenience level. In the market, customers who are less sensitive to the selling price prefer a more competitive collection market, since a competitive market can better reduce selling prices thanks to a remanufacturing benefit.

Almost all previous relevant optimization studies assume that the objective of the pricing or discounting scheme is to balance the fleet from the standpoint of the carsharing companies. However, the users’ preferences for various levels of service have not been explored sufficiently. This paper introduces a carsharing personalized price discounting scheme (CSPPDS) problem for one-way reservation-based 1 services, considering user acceptance of the discounted price and various levels of service that the system provides to the users. To maximize the system’s profit, the presented CSPPDS problem decides the discounting scheme and whether to accept the requests. Meanwhile, the actual requests travel plans that can be different from the users’ original travel requests in pick-up locations and start times are optimized. A real-world case study based on a one-way carsharing system in Beijing is conducted to demonstrate the applicability of the presented model.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the rural population is still dependent on motorized individual transportation due to the little offers of public transport there. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to close this mobility gap as shifting the task of driving from humans to machines facilitates new possibilities for vehicle sharing and lifts economical and service time limitations (e.g., labor costs and working hour regulations). However, mobility service operators are then probably responsible for serving the holistic travel demands of users. This might involve interrelated trips, where users ask for simultaneous arrival at meeting locations, where round trips involve a stay time at some destination locations, or the like. Accordingly, in this work, we present a problem variant of the dial-a-ride problem that allows for interrelated trips. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer program and propose an adaptive  variable neighborhood search heuristic (AVNS) based on a sophisticated solution representation. Our computational results for instances considering characteristics of rural areas reveal that the heuristic performs very well and that it is clearly superior to standard MIP solvers. We further investigate the impact of different types of trip interrelations on the solvability of the problem, service quality, and total transportation costs of the solutions.},

  abstract     = {Manufacturers have increasingly started offering rental options for the products they sell. Renting products offers an opportunity: segmenting consumers. However, this also raises a challenge: what to do with the returned products? One solution is to remanufacture these products and then rent or resell them. Subsequently, should remanufacturing be outsourced to a third-party firm that can remanufacture at a lower cost? Here, we use a multi-period setting and examine the optimal decisions for different selling and renting constellations. Importantly, we allow the manufacturing costs of the sales and rental products to differ, as they seem to be critical in determining the manufacturer&#39;s renting and selling decisions and remanufacturing strategies. For example, under integrated (i.e. in-house) remanufacturing, when the new rental product&#39;s manufacturing cost is sufficiently high, no remanufacturing happens. Under both remanufacturing strategies—integrated and outsourced—the manufacturer does not rent new products in the second period if the manufacturing costs of the sales and rental products are identical. If the rental product&#39;s manufacturing cost is either sufficiently low or high, then integrated remanufacturing is more profitable; when this manufacturing cost is within a moderate range, the manufacturer outsources remanufacturing to an independent remanufacturer. Surprisingly, in some situations, the production quantity of the new sales product may even increase with its manufacturing cost. This is because the manufacturer may extract an even higher margin compared with the new rental product. Finally, we also consider several extensions such as uncertainty regarding the quality of the returned goods, simultaneous selling and renting of remanufactured goods, and longer horizons and the product&#39;s life cycle.},

  abstract     = {Satellite scheduling is concerned with the assignment of start and finish times for tasks while considering the mission objective, available resources, and constraints. This scheduling problem is especially critical in nanosatellites, given that resources are more scarce than in traditionally-sized spacecrafts. Despite having its own set of constraints and being increasingly deployed, nanosatellite task scheduling has received little attention in the literature. In this paper, we advance the state-of-the-art by devising an effective solution approach for a nanosatellite task scheduling problem. We resort to the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition to explore the special structure of an existing mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation, decomposing it by tasks, which results in a novel profile-based formulation for the problem. To solve the resulting formulation, we propose a branch-and-price (B&amp;P) algorithm that is suitable for the scheduling of a large number of tasks over an expanded time horizon. Furthermore, we design a dynamic programming algorithm for generating feasible schedules instead of solving the pricing subproblem with an MILP solver, among other algorithmic strategies. Computational experiments using instances that represent realistic scenarios showed that the B&amp;P algorithm is considerably more efficient in solving large instances when compared to commercial solvers. Overall, the proposed solution strategy empowers the decision maker to plan more complex missions, in an optimal or nearly-optimal manner and within a reasonable computation time.},

Any valid total coloring induces a partition of the elements of G G into total matchings, which are defined as subsets of vertices and edges that can take the same color. In this paper, we propose Integer Linear Programming models for both the Total Coloring and the Total Matching problems, and we study the strength of the corresponding Linear Programming relaxations. The total coloring is formulated as the problem of finding the minimum number of total matchings that cover all the graph elements. This covering formulation can be solved by a Column Generation algorithm, where the pricing subproblem corresponds to the Weighted Total Matching Problem. Hence, we study the Total Matching Polytope. We introduce three families of nontrivial valid inequalities: vertex-clique inequalities based on standard clique inequalities of the Stable Set Polytope, congruent- 2 k 3 2k3 cycle inequalities based on the parity of the vertex set induced by the cycle, and even-clique inequalities induced by complete subgraphs of even order.

We adapt a mixed-integer linear programming model from the case with a rectangular container and design a cutting plane method to solve this problem by adding linear cuts to forbid items from being placed outside the circle. We show that this linear model allows us to prove optimality for instances larger than those solved using the state-of-the-art non-linear model for the same problem. We also propose a simple parallel algorithm that efficiently enumerates all non-dominated subsets of items and verifies whether pertinent subsets fit into the container using an adapted version of our linear model. Computational experiments using large benchmark instances attest that this enumerative algorithm generally provides better solutions than the best heuristics from the literature when maximizing the number of items packed. Instances with up to 30 items are now solved to optimality, against the eight-item instance previously solved.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid Flowshop Scheduling Problems (HFS) are among the most realistic machine sequencing models there are. These problems deal with the scheduling of a set of jobs through a set of stages where at each stage, multiple parallel machines exist. We consider a number of extensions to this problem. First of all, we take into account the existence of sequence dependent setup times which are prevalent in practice. Second, we optimize the total weighted earliness and tardiness, but not from a due date, rather a due date window. As of late, simple local search methods have been successfully employed in scheduling problems. Their simplicity and ease of extension is remarkable. Despite being simple, state-of-the-art results are often achieved. Among these methods, Iterated Greedy (IG) has shown great promise. We elaborate on these ideas and develop new local search procedures that are much faster than existing ones, allowing many more iterations per unit of time. A parameter-less IG, which does not require calibration, is presented. In order to test it, we carry out a comprehensive computational campaign. We test both the HFS without setup times and due date windows (HFSDDW), as well as the same problem with the additional consideration of setup times (HFSDDW-SDST). A total of 14 competing methods have been carefully reimplemented, adapted for these problems, calibrated and tested against the proposed IG. The complete experiments, with more than 12,000 instances, together with the statistical analyses, indicate that the proposed IG method produces state-of-the-art results for the problems considered.},

State-of-the-art solution approaches of pCP use its connection to the set cover problem to solve pCP in an iterative fashion by repeatedly solving set cover problems. The classical textbook integer programming (IP) formulation of pCP is usually dismissed due to its size and bad linear programming (LP)-relaxation bounds. We present a novel solution approach that works on a new IP formulation that can be obtained by a projection from the classical formulation. The formulation is solved by means of branch-and-cut, where cuts for demand points are iteratively generated. Moreover, the formulation can be strengthened with combinatorial information to obtain a much tighter LP-relaxation. In particular, we present a novel way to use lower bound information to obtain stronger cuts. We show that the LP-relaxation bound of our strengthened formulation has the same strength as the best known bound in literature, which is based on a semi-relaxation. Finally, we also present a computational study on instances from the literature with up to more than 700,000 customers and locations. Our solution algorithm is competitive with highly sophisticated set-cover-based solution algorithms, which depend on various components and parameters.},

  abstract     = {Traditional scheduling models assume that due dates are predefined and the aim is to find a schedule that minimizes a given scheduling criterion with respect to the given set of due dates. A more recent trend consists of models that focus on coordinating two sets of decisions: due date assignment to customers and determining a job schedule. We follow this trend by analyzing a single machine scheduling problem, where the scheduler is tasked with assigning a common due date to all jobs in order to minimize an objective function that includes job-dependent penalties due to early and late work. We show that the problem is solvable in linear time if the common due date value is unbounded, and in O ( n log n ) time if it is bounded from above. We then extend the analysis to the case where a common due window has to be assigned to all jobs. We show that when the location of the due window is unbounded, the problem is solvable in O ( n log n ) time (and further in linear time if the length of the due window is unbounded as well). However, it becomes NP -hard when it is bounded. We complement our analysis by ( i ) providing a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm to solve this hard variant of the problem, and ( i i ) study two special cases of this hard variant that are solvable in polynomial time.},

The convex recoloring problem (or CR , for short) was firstly motivated by applications on perfect phylogenies, and it is a hard computational problem even restricted to paths. In this work, we introduce a polytope based on connected subgraphs for CR and propose a class of strong inequalities with righthand side ranging from 1 to the number of colors. Those with righthand side one generalize and strengthen the inequalities of the corresponding formulation and comprise all facet-defining inequalities on binary coefficients when G G is a tree. We report on computational experiments for an application on mobile networks to evaluate the potential of the proposed inequalities to reduce the integrality gap. Finally, we propose a branch-and-price algorithm to solve CR on trees and present the results of experiments on several classes of instances, including phylogenetic trees. The experiments indicate that our approach outperforms the fastest solving method in the literature.},

To solve the problem, we propose a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model and two heuristics. The MILP model represents BPPC-IF as a generalized transportation problem in which sources correspond to items, and sinks are defined for all maximal independent sets in the graph representing conflicts between items. The proposed heuristics, called Sequential Packing Heuristics 1 and 2 (SPH1 and SPH2, respectively) are modifications of the previously proposed Sequential Maximum Degree Packing Heuristic (SMDPH) for BPPC-IF, which fills bins by solving a series of MILP subproblems. Both new heuristics use improved criteria for selecting items to pack. Additionally, in SPH1, bins are filled heuristically without solving any MILP subproblems. Computational experiments carried out on a large set of benchmark problem instances from the literature show that (i) SPH1 obtains good quality solutions and is orders of magnitude faster than the MILP-based heuristics, (ii) compound heuristic SPH1+SPH2 finds on average better solutions than any other heuristic and is on average faster than any other MILP-based heuristic, and (iii) the proposed MILP model greatly outperforms the best previously proposed MILP model.},

Examples of such cases are the selection of trains and blocks in freight rail transportation and the selection of physical and logical paths in telecommunications. Each set of those design variables are then defined on a particular network making up a layer with its own nodes, which can represent or not the same physical or conceptual locations, potential arcs, with fixed selection cost and with or without limited capacities, and, possibly, multicommodity demands, which need to be routed within the layer by selecting/opening the appropriate arcs. The particular characteristic and challenge of multilayer network design consists in the various design and flow-connectivity requirements linking the decisions on different layers. Thus, for example, to select a light path, all the links making up the supporting physical path must be installed. Similarly, to select a transportation service, all the supporting resources must be selected together with their feasible working paths in the corresponding layers. We propose the first classification and a state-of-the-art survey of multilayer network design problems. The survey focuses on applications in transportation and telecommunications, as well as on solution methods.

High-quality measurements of term structures enable us to extract the systematic risk factors and make precise estimates of the perceived transaction costs. The hedging cost is weighed against the reduction in portfolio variance by using an adjustable hedging parameter. The hedging procedure is simulated on a daily basis in a realistic setting over an out-of-sample period from 2002 to 2018, and the results are compared to traditional hedging methods through detailed performance attribution.

  abstract     = {In many games and other processes, participants can choose to intervene in some way that does not follow the usual progress of the game (for example, cheating at cards, or spying on rivals) which may provide benefits, but also possibly incur substantial costs. Here, repeated interventions may be more likely to incur negative outcomes – for example, as the chance of getting caught increases. How to optimally employ these risky interventions, trading off potential advantages and disadvantages, can then be challenging to identify. Here, we study such a game, taken from the popular ‘Fighting Fantasy’ gamebook series. This stochastic game involves a series of rounds, each of which may be won or lost. Each round, a unit of limited resource (‘ luck ’) may be spent on a gamble to amplify benefits from a win or to mitigate deficits from a loss. However, the success of this gamble depends on the number of units of remaining resource, and if the gamble is unsuccessful, benefits are reduced and deficits increased. By choosing to expending resource, a player thus has diminishing probability of positive return, as in the cheating and espionage examples above. We characterise the dynamics of this system using stochastic analysis and dynamic programming, solve the Bellman equation for the complete system with diminishing returns, and identify the optimal strategy for any given state during the game. We use classification tools to distil general principles for this and related problems, informing resource allocation problems with diminishing returns in stochastic decision theory.},

Given that closed-form solutions are rarely available especially in finite-time problems, the upper and lower bounds have great potential to be useful information that can complement approximate solutions obtained from existing numerical methods. We present numerical results throughout to justify the theoretical developments and convergence results so as to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with low computational complexity.

The travelers choose amongst the mobility services according to a multinomial logit model, and the operators aim at maximizing their joint profit under a constant market share constraint. After showing that various well-known allocation rules (i.e., proportional rules and the Shapley value) do not always generate core allocations, we present a core-guaranteeing allocation rule, the market share exchange rule. This rule first allocates to each transport operator the profit he or she generates under collaboration, and then subsequently compensates those transport operators that lose part of their market share, which is paid by the ones that receive some extra market share. This exchange of market share is facilitated by a unique price, which can be expressed as the additional return by cooperating per unit of market share. Finally, we show that, under some natural conditions, the market share exchange rule still sustains the collaboration when the transport operators need to pay back part of the joint profit to society.},

  abstract     = {This work studies equilibrium problems under uncertainty where firms maximize their profits in a robust way when selling their output. Robust optimization plays an increasingly important role when best guaranteed objective values are to be determined, independently of the specific distributional assumptions regarding uncertainty. In particular, solutions are to be determined that are feasible regardless of how the uncertainty manifests itself within some predefined uncertainty set. Our mathematical analysis adopts the robust optimization perspective in the context of equilibrium problems. First, we present structural insights for a single-stage, nonadjustable robust setting. We then go one step further and study the more complex two-stage or adjustable case where a part of the variables can adjust to the realization of the uncertainty. We compare equilibrium outcomes with the corresponding centralized robust optimization problem where the sum of all profits are maximized. As we find, the market equilibrium for the perfectly competitive firms differs from the solution of the robust central planner, which is in stark contrast to classical results regarding the efficiency of market equilibria with perfectly competitive firms. For the different scenarios considered, we furthermore are able to determine the resulting price of anarchy. In the case of non-adjustable robustness, for fixed demand in every time step the price of anarchy is bounded whereas it is unbounded if the buyers are modeled by elastic demand functions. For the two-stage adjustable setting, we show how to compute subsidies for the firms that lead to robust welfare optimal equilibria.},

We develop a model that captures the interaction between supply-side entities – a coordinating organisation, whose objective is to maximise the social welfare, and a hospital that performs the organ retrieval. Under different setups, we evaluate the two levers available to the coordinating organisation, its own effort and reimbursement fees, which can be used to induce higher effort by hospitals. We contrast these decisions and payoffs to determine if any benefits are forthcoming from the coordinating organisation’s effort commitment. We also examine the hospital’s optimal channel decision in the presence of an unauthorised channel and a low paying authorised channel, and derive the conditions under which the hospital would prefer the authorised channel over the unauthorised channel. Our results provide insights that lead to better outcomes for the players, and result in the improved organ donation rate.},

  abstract     = {The Inventory Routing Problem (IRP) is a broad class of complex routing problems where the quantities of delivered products must also be determined. In this paper, we consider the classic IRP where a single supplier must determine when to visit its customers, how much to deliver and how to combine the customer visits in each period into routes. We propose a branch-and-cut algorithm based on a new mathematical formulation for the IRP, improving the average lower bound obtained from algorithms based on the branch-and-cut methodology. The new formulation substitutes parts of the original formulation with a convex combination of extreme points. We call these extreme points customer schedules and for each customer they contain information about delivery periods and corresponding delivered quantities. We show that this algorithm outperforms a state-of-the-art branch-and-cut algorithm on instances with time-varying demands. The customer schedule-based algorithm obtains better lower bounds, which improves the average optimality gap by 29\% 29\% and 15\% 15\% on two new sets of instances with time-varying demands.},

In addition, the size of the state space is not affected if we include nonzero lead times, backlog, and lost sales. We characterize the optimal joint replenishment policy, and use these characteristics to develop a greedy-optimal algorithm that generalizes the can-order policy, a well-known family in the class of joint replenishment policies. We numerically show that this generalized can-order policy only marginally improves the best conventional can-order policy. For sizeable systems with multiple items, the latter can now be found using our exact embedded Markov-chain method.

  abstract     = {Dropshipping, where e-retailers manage marketing and dropshippers manage inventory and fulfillment, has become a common practice in e-commerce. However, due to information asymmetry, some e-retailers require dropshippers to share available inventory quantity committed to them on a periodic basis (x-hour, day,...), via an availability commitment. Such commitment leaves the potential for dropshippers to overpromise and exploit availability pooling benefit as it does not involve physical transaction. To further prevent fulfillment failure, some e-retailers stop accepting more orders once remaining promised quantity falls below a promised availability threshold, which is unknown to the dropshipper. In this paper, leveraging the collaboration with a dropshipping furniture manufacturer in the US market, we tackle the inventory availability commitment (IAC) problem for dropshippers at the operational decision level. Three commitment policies are proposed based on varying overpromising allowance: guaranteed fulfillment, controlled fillrate, and penalty-driven fillrate policies. The IAC optimization problem, under uncertain customer demand and retailers threshold, is modeled as a two stage stochastic program. Experimental results on a case study demonstrated that penalty-driven fillrate policy is a dominating policy for a dropshipper under any availability level while the impact of overpromising is maximized under lean availability. E-retailers imposing thresholds tend to receive more availability than those not imposing any threshold in general. However, non-overpromising dropshippers with lean or lower availability level will promise less availability to e-retailers imposing threshold.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider two supply chains each consisting of a manufacturer sells products to customers through an exclusive retailer to investigate the issue of whether the manufacturers with differentiated absorptive capacity will invest in uncertain process innovation under knowledge spillovers. To this end, we develop game-theoretic models with bilateral investment, unilateral investment, and no-investment. Analysis of the equilibrium outcomes shows that the manufacturers when confronted with weak (strong) spillovers will (not) invest. If a manufacturer’s knowledge seldom spills over while the opposite is true for the competitor, they behave as the unique investor and free-rider, respectively. If both of them are exposed to medium spillovers, there exist thresholds below which the investment strategies are asynchronous, and they are synchronous otherwise. Moreover, we reveal that: (i) bilateral investment may yield lose-lose, lose-win, win-lose, or win-win outcomes for the manufacturers; (ii) the manufacturer with weak absorptive capacity may invest even though it almost learns nothing from external knowledge; and (iii) if the success probability of innovation is high, the investment strategies hinge on the intensity of knowledge spillovers. Otherwise, the manufacturers generally have fewer incentives to invest. Finally, we extend the model to verify the robustness of the key findings in situations with cross-selling and channel integration, respectively, as well as shed some light on the effects of different supply chain structures on the manufacturers’ incentives to invest in uncertain process innovation.},

  abstract     = {Information on lower bounds plays an important role in the development of exact and heuristic methods for stochastic service network design (SSND). In this paper, we consider the Lagrange dual problem of SSND for computing lower bounds. The Lagrange dual problem is obtained by introducing scenario bundling into scenario-wise decomposition of the SSND model and dualizing the non-anticipativity constraints in a Lagrangian fashion. Our theoretical analysis establishes the superiority of the resulting optimal Lagrange dual bound over that in the case of scenario-wise decomposition. The Lagrange dual problem is solved from the primal perspective by employing the recently proposed FW-PH algorithm, which combines Progressive Hedging with a Frank-Wolfe-like method. To improve the computing efficiency, scenario-wise decomposition in the FW-PH algorithm is replaced with bundle-wise decomposition, which divides the problem by scenario bundles into multiple-scenario subproblems, rather than by individual scenarios into single-scenario subproblems. Scenario bundles are constructed using Gaussian mixture models. Our convergence analysis shows that this improvement retains the desirable theoretical property of FW-PH about convergence to the optimal Lagrange dual value. Computational experiments on SSND instances demonstrate that the improved FW-PH algorithm is far superior to the basic version, providing either a dramatic saving in the run-time required to achieve convergence or a much tighter lower bound when terminated due to the time limit.},

The model therefore captures the dependency of a machine’s failures on both recent failures as well as preventive maintenance actions, via our prediction model. We validate our model using an original equipment manufacturer data set and obtain policies that prescribe when to deviate from the planned periodic maintenance schedule. To improve our predictions for machine failure behavior with limited to no past data, we pool our data set over different machine classes by means of a Poisson generalized linear model.

  abstract     = {A reference price is the price expectation of consumers for a product. When considering whether to buy a product, consumers usually compare its price with the reference price, which leads to psychological gain-loss utility affecting the consumers’ willingness to pay for the product. In this paper, we incorporate a reference price into the product line design problem and investigate the strategic implications of reference price effects for both the firm and consumers. We first study the optimal quality-price bundle design problem of a monopolistic firm and investigate the impact of reference price effects on the optimal quality and price decision when the number of products in the line is given. We show that as the importance of price comparison increases, the optimal range of qualities in the product line narrows. Specifically, the lowest quality in the product line is distorted upward, while the quality gap between adjacent products narrows. In particular, when consumers attach great importance to price comparison, the reference price effects may cause the firm to abandon discrimination among consumers and instead offer just a single product. We also investigate the optimal product variety setting problem considering a fixed setup cost incurred for each product in the choice set. Our numerical studies using synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that the demand model with reference price has better goodness of fit and prediction accuracy. The impact of neglecting reference price in the product line design problem is significant, potentially leading to substantial profit loss. Finally, we extend our work through general discussions of the model and through the dynamic pricing problem incorporating temporal reference price effects.},

The experiment results prove that the proposed algorithm can deal with the target problem properly, and considering stochastic factors and alternative paths in the underlying road network can reduce the operation cost and improve user satisfaction efficiently.},

  abstract     = {Outsourcing is a common operations strategy nowadays, but it may lead to an unintended consequence of supplier copycatting. When outsourcing, there is some subtle information that the manufacturer knows but is optional for the supplier to carry out the production task, such as how fit this product is to the market trend (product fit). This paper considers a game setting that the manufacturer has private information on product fit during the production stage, and it decides whether or not to disclose this piece of information to the supplier. The supplier decides whether or not to exert production process enhancement effort and whether or not to enter the market with a copycat. We discover two novel disclosure structures: (1) only disclosing the intermediate range of product fit information, and (2) always withholding information even though disclosure is costless. We find that the manufacturer can be better off, while the supplier can be worse off, from the supplier copycatting option. Our work lends support to the practitioners’ recommendation that the manufacturer should withhold some crucial information from the supplier and keep the communication as basic as possible and uncovers the bright side of supplier’s copycat on the manufacturer’s profitability.},

Our objective is to minimize the total cost relevant costs, consisting of intervention costs and the backorder costs. In this paper, we focus on proactive interventions, aiming to avoid stockouts. We assume that all reactive interventions are fixed. Proactive interventions that we study include lateral transshipments, emergency shipments, stock reservations, expediting part repairs, and early new buys of parts. These interventions are invoked by using alert generation, when the supply chain status deviates from the plan. We propose heuristic rules to generate alerts. We also develop heuristic rules for the choice of operational interventions. We model and test our heuristics in a simulation test bed, based on data of a global IT company by using the case data in Germany. Numerical experiments reveal the following key insights: (i) downstream interventions – proactive lateral and emergency shipments – have most impact in reducing costs, (ii) communicating losses in the supply chain (no returns, failed repairs) for early new buys has positive impact on fill rates at negligible costs, and (iii) expedite repair and stock reservations using the proposed rules is not profitable.},

  abstract     = {We study the strategic value of cooperation between competitors in sourcing. Two firms procure from a supplier and sell to markets with uncertain demand. The firms can unilaterally procure from the supplier but obtain products from each other on a needed basis, which we call horizontal sourcing, or procure from the supplier together, which we call joint sourcing. Either horizontal or joint sourcing enables the firms to mitigate quantity pressure and improve selling (save cost) when the supplier offers a sufficiently weak (strong) discount incentive, making them strategic substitutes. The two sourcing strategies are complements as well because the firms can redeploy resources in between to profit from the synergies between markets only by horizontal sourcing. The firms profit more by joint sourcing than horizontal sourcing for the higher efficiency gain received from cost reduction (market selling improvement) when the supplier&#39;s discount incentive is strong (weak). Once the firms adopt joint sourcing, strategic substitutability causes them to forgo horizontal sourcing when markets are deterministic, but strategic complementarity can entice them to further adopt horizontal sourcing when markets are volatile. Once the firms adopt horizontal souring, they always have an incentive to further engage in joint sourcing. Empowered to manage wholesale pricing, the supplier can deter the firms from adopting joint sourcing but develop horizontal sourcing into an instrument that benefits every party in the supply chain, unless the competition pressure on the firms is strong and the supplier&#39;s production cost is sufficiently high.},

The problem concerns preparing a single-origin single-destination transportation plan of loading required orders to vehicles at the origin and dispatching the vehicles to deliver the orders to the destination within their due dates. The decision maker uses their own fleet of vehicles, with each vehicle having a fixed transportation cost per trip, and may outsource additional vehicles at a higher cost. VLDP involves constraints regarding the due dates of the orders, pairwise incompatibility of orders packed in the same vehicle, incompatibility of orders and vehicles, as well as area and weight capacity of the vehicles. An order can be delivered earlier than its due date, incurring an earliness penalty due to storage requirements at the destination. The objective is to minimize the total vehicle usage and earliness penalty costs. A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model (MILP) is provided, as well as an Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search (ALNS) algorithm. Results of computational experiments on instances derived from real-world data show the effectiveness of the ALNS algorithm.},

MDGP is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, possessing widespread application and practical importance. This paper introduces a novel hybrid algorithm, called a three-phase search approach with dynamic population size (TPSDP), for solving the problem. The proposed algorithm devises the search process into three phases with distinct functions which are iterated: (1) an undirected perturbation phase to improve the population diversity, (2) a restructure phase using a distinctive crossover operator to increase the information interaction among solutions, and (3) a directed perturbation phase to discover the adjacent local optima around current solutions. TPSDP also combines a dynamic population size strategy to reserve limited computing resources for potential solutions. The results of experiments and the Friedman test show that the overall performance of the proposed TPSDP is highly competitive with or better than previous state-of-the-art MDGP algorithms on 500 instances taken from five popular benchmark sets. Furthermore, an additional experiment of parameter analysis and a discussion of critical ingredients are presented.

In the recent literature, competitive frameworks has been proposed for bi-objective 0–1 problems, and many of these frameworks rely on the use of the linear relaxation to obtain lower bound sets. When increasing the number of objective functions, however, the polyhedral structure of the linear relaxation becomes more complex, and consequently requires more computational effort to obtain. In this paper we overcome this obstacle by speeding up the computations. To do so, in each branching node we use information available from its father node to warm-start a Bensons-like algorithm. We show that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the CPU time of the framework on several different problem classes with three, four and five objective functions. Moreover, we point out difficulties that arise when non-binary integer variables are introduced in the models, and test our algorithm on problem that contains non-binary integer variables too.},

In a shared-storage system, items to be stored are not pre-assigned to dedicated shelf spaces. Therefore, given a set of storage and retrieval requests, the crane scheduling problem consists of deciding which requests are processed together in the same tour, determining the sequence in which the requests are processed, and assigning each storage request to an available slot on the shelf. We reformulate the problem as a special type of capacitated vehicle routing problem, which we use to close some open questions regarding the time complexity of related geometric routing problems. The reformulation allows us to tap into the rich and mature vehicle routing toolbox from the literature to propose a new exact solution approach. We show that this method is capable of solving large instances to optimality, outperforming previous methods from the literature. We use our new approach to derive multiple insights. Specifically, we show that system throughput can be predicted from the capacity of the crane via a simple rule. We also determine the optimal shape of a shelf and investigate the value of having knowledge of multiple requests when planning the crane schedule. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach can easily be extended to solve a whole family of multi-shuttle crane scheduling problems.},

  abstract     = {Constraint programming solvers are known to perform remarkably well for most scheduling problems. However, when comparing the performance of different available solvers, there is usually no clear winner over all relevant problem instances. This gives rise to the question of how to select a promising solver when knowing the concrete instance to be solved. In this article, we aim to provide first insights into this question for the flexible job shop scheduling problem. We investigate relative performance differences among five constraint programming solvers on problem instances taken from the literature as well as randomly generated problem instances. These solvers include commercial and non-commercial software and represent the state-of-the-art as identified in the relevant literature. We find that two solvers, the IBM ILOG CPLEX CP Optimizer and Google’s OR-Tools, outperform alternative solvers. These two solvers show complementary strengths regarding their ability to determine provably optimal solutions within practically reasonable time limits and their ability to quickly determine high quality feasible solutions across different test instances. Hence, we leverage the resulting performance complementarity by proposing algorithm selection approaches that predict the best solver for a given problem instance based on instance features or parameters. The approaches are based on two machine learning techniques, decision trees and deep neural networks, in various variants. In a computational study, we analyze the performance of the resulting algorithm selection models and show that our approaches outperform the use of a single solver and should thus be considered as a relevant tool by decision makers in practice.},

The problem has two main distinctive features. On the one hand, when assigning pallets to trucks, strict packing constraints, concerning axle weight, stability, and sequential loading, must be considered. On the other hand, split delivery is allowed. We have developed an integer linear model for the integrated problem, considering all routing and packing constraints. We have also designed a more efficient decomposition procedure in which some packing constraints are initially relaxed. Each time an integer solution is found in the search tree of the relaxed problem, it is checked to see whether it satisfies the remaining constraints and is therefore a feasible solution to the original problem. If it is not, a heuristic algorithm is first applied to rearrange the solution and, if it fails, an integer model is used, considering the packing problem for a single truck. If this also fails, a constraint is added to the relaxed problem to cut off the infeasible integer solution. An extensive computational study shows how the integer linear model and the decomposition procedure work on a set of instances varying the number of customers, the number of pallets, and their weight distribution.},

  abstract     = {Sport mega-events, such as the Soccer World Cup or Olympic Games, attract many visitors from all over the world. Most of these visitors are also interested in, besides attending the sports events, visiting the host nation and the neighboring countries. In this paper, we focus on the upcoming FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022. As per the schedule of the tournament, a national team can play 7 matches at most. Therefore, a supporter will have six short breaks (of three to five days) between consecutive matches in addition to two longer ones, immediately before and after the tournament, during which they can plan some touristic trips. We study the problem faced by a touristic trip provider who wants to offer a set of touristic packages, chosen among a very large set of options, devoted to World-Cup related tourists. The number of packages offered must be limited due to organizational reasons and the necessity to guarantee a high participation in each trip. In this study, a set of user profiles is considered. It represents different categories of tourists, characterized by different preferences and budgets. Each user is supposed to pick the packages that maximize their satisfaction, considering their budget and time restraints. The goal of the company is to choose the set of packages to be offered that would maximize the average users satisfaction. To address this NP-Hard combinatorial optimization problem we provide a mathematical formulation and a matheuristic, named Consensus-Based Kernel Search (CKS), wherein an alternative rule is used to create the initial Kernel and partition variables in buckets. Computational results evidence the excellent performance of CKS and prove that the newly introduced algorithm systematically outperforms the classical Kernel Search.},

  abstract     = {The increasing importance of integrated fulfillment concepts revitalizes bricks-and-mortar stores and puts them at the center of retail operations. So-called omnichannel (OC) concepts leverage stores to offer seamless and enhanced operations for offline and online shoppers. Stores are used to fulfill online orders, offer shorter lead times to customers, and extend the assortment across channels. The role of the store and the underlying store operations are thus impacted by profound changes. This transformation has not yet been assessed comprehensively from a practical or an Operations Research (OR) lens. This paper identifies cross-cutting store-related planning issues and develops a planning framework for OC operations. We apply industry interviews and a systematic literature analysis to derive five planning issues. Research gaps are revealed by matching the pertinent OR literature with managerial needs. The planning issues network design of fulfillment locations, assignment of customer orders, and assortment and inventory planning have been discussed in several store-related OC publications. Demand forecasting and inventory replenishment and returns have received less coverage, and offer significant research opportunities.},

In this model the flows through certain arcs are bounded by linear (or more generally, piecewise linear concave) functions of the flows through other arcs. This formulation can be used to model interrelated systems in which the components of one system require the delivery of material from another system in order to function (for example, components of a subway system may require delivery of electrical power from a separate system). We propose and study randomized rounding schemes for how this model can be used to approximate solutions to a related mixed integer linear program for modeling binary input dependencies. The introduction of side constraints prevents this problem from being solved using the well-known network simplex algorithm, however by characterizing its basis structure we develop a generalization of network simplex algorithm that can be used for its computationally efficient solution.},

The characterization of the optimal contracts in the generic finite-population case commonly involves a complicated system of coupled nonlinear equations for which the existence of a solution may not be established. Alternatively, an approximation of the large population case is still viable. Indeed, we derive an analytically tractable mean field equilibrium as the population size goes to infinity and conclude that: (1) it is the risk sharing between shareholders and managers and the presence of correlated investment opportunities across firms that lead to the inclusion of RPE in contracts; (2) these contracts incorporating RPE, in return, trigger the managers to invest more in the correlated assets with the desire to reduce the volatility of compensation payments. To this end, we echo the finding that the incorporation of RPE increases the systemic risk, which was first observed in Albuquerque et al. (Rev. Financ. Stud. 32(11): 4304–4342, 2019). In addition, we show that the systemic risk increases with the aggregate Sharpe Ratios of securities and the risk seeking appetites of managers.},

  abstract     = {Structured investment products (SPs) are derivative securities whose return is contingent on the return of their underlying assets, such as a certain stock market index. SPs have been criticized for being complex and costly on the inside, while attracting retail investors with emotionally appealing promises, on the surface, to provide tempting yields and protection for the capital invested. To circumvent such criticism, we consider transparent SPs (TSPs), which simply offer a lower and upper limit on annual return (after costs and fees) as well a transparent rule defining the return based on the return of the underlying asset. We study TSPs using both empirical and theoretical approaches. An empirical survey of real investors with best-worst scaling as well as theoretical analyses based on utility theory and multi-stage stochastic programming (MSSP) show that moderately priced TSPs are competitive in comparison with other investment products, such as index funds. Furthermore, retail investors actually exhibit substantial preference for TSPs with partial capital guarantees, over and above SPs with the superficially tempting, full capital guarantees. A theoretical, MSSP-based analysis similarly confirms that including TSPs in an investment portfolio can yield substantial gains in certainty equivalent annual return. The results further indicate that perceived gains from TSPs are sensitive to costs, market imperfections, and interest rates, as well as private preferences and stock market expectations of retail investors. This demonstrates how MSSP can be applied to financial engineering for successful implementation of TSPs in future financial markets.},

Visits are performed sequentially with no repetitions. The inspectees report and share the sequence of inspections as they occur, but otherwise, they do not cooperate. We formulate two Stackelberg models, a static game where the inspector commits to play a sequence of visits announced at the start of the game, and a dynamic game where visits will depend on who was visited previously. In the static game, we characterize the (randomized) inspection paths in an equilibrium using linear programs. In the dynamic game, we determine the inspection paths in an equilibrium using backward induction. Our paper focuses on the mathematical structure of the equilibria of this sequential inspection game, where the inspector can perform exactly two visits. In the static game, the inspection paths are solutions to a transportation problem. We use this equivalence to determine an explicit solution to the game and to show that set of inspection path probabilities in an equilibrium, projected onto its first and second visit marginals, is convex. We discuss how the static and dynamic games relate to each other and how to use these models in practical settings.},

Our paper aims to present a method for quantifying the violation of this theoretical property through the example of the European Qualifiers for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Even though that competition is known to be incentive incompatible since lower-ranked Nations League group winners are interested in the success of their higher-ranked peers, the extent of the problem has remained unexplored until now. Computer simulations reveal that the threat of tanking can be substantially mitigated by adding a carefully chosen set of draw restrictions, which offers a justifiable and transparent solution to improve fairness.

  abstract     = {Today’s project organisations are conducting their daily activities for multi-projects where a group of scarce resources are shared amongst several parallel projects. In addition, due to the implementation of lean and agile production, they have consumed more and more resources from external environment (i.e., non-regular resources) when performing projects. Therefore, how to effectively schedule the shared resources across projects and meanwhile optimally plan the required capacities of non-regular resources for an entire multi-project becomes a critical problem for project organisations. This paper proposes a multi-agent approach to address the resource planning and scheduling decisions of the problem in an integrated manner. In this work, a multi-project is represented as a hierarchical multi-agent system consisting of a multi-project portfolio agent (MPA), a resource agent (RA) and a set of project agents (PAs). Decisions are made by these agents through a hierarchical coordination mechanism. Basically, the decision of resource planning for a multi-project is obtained from the resource requirements proposed by projects in their scheduling decisions which are coordinated by MPA through controlling the allocation of shared resources to projects. The scheduling decision of each project is made by its PA using the model of multi-mode resource constrained project scheduling problem. A genetic algorithm and an ant colony optimisation algorithm are proposed for decision optimisations of resource planning and project scheduling, respectively. A numerical study demonstrated that the proposed approach can effectively solve the multi-project problem by producing near-optimal solutions.},

Classical segmentation models stand out for their ability to provide a segmentation of the original image very quickly and with low computational burden. However, they do not usually achieve high quality segmentations with a small number of clusters in order to classify the different elements which compose the structure represented in the image. The quality of the segmentation provided by our approach is analysed using different choices of the weight vector in some real instances. Moreover, improvements are proposed for the formulations to reduce the computational time needed to solve these problems by taking advantage of the weight vector structure.},

A novel time sensitive graph model is developed to analyze international negotiations in which the duration of time is different for negotiators, or called decision makers, to implement each action. In this novel model, the process of negotiation is divided into multiple phases. Decision makers may fail to achieve desired outcomes due to time constraints when approaching the deadline of each stage. Time sensitive stabilities are defined to describe this particular behavior patterns of decision makers. The interrelationships between classical stabilities and time sensitive stabilities are investigated. Propositions are provided to indicate how equilibrium can be affected by the change of action time. This novel methodology is applied to an air carbon negotiation participated by three representative decision makers, the European Union (EU), major developing countries, and the United States (US), under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). The time sensitive equilibrium at the end of Baseline Phase explains modification of the requirements for monitoring the CORSIA baseline emissions under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The time sensitive equilibrium achieved after June 2020 suggests that the EU Carbon Trading System for Monitoring Air Carbon Baseline (EU ETS MRV) could be adjusted by the end of the Pilot Phase provided that both developing and non-EU developed countries put the EU under pressure by filing appeals at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) meetings not later than March 2022.},

  abstract     = {The measurement of technical efficiency is a topic of great interest in microeconomics and engineering. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is one of the existing techniques for measuring technical efficiency. One of the challenges related to DEA is to introduce a “well-defined” efficiency measure. Overall, it means that the technical efficiency measure should satisfy a list of mathematical and economical properties. Regarding this point, an unresolved question in the DEA literature to date, is whether any measure can satisfy both Indication, also called Pareto-efficiency identification, and uniqueness of the projection point generated by the corresponding efficiency optimization model. With this issue in mind, this paper introduces a new family of measures, inspired on the Range-Adjusted Measure (RAM), which satisfy a list of six properties. This family of measures will be called Generalized Range-Adjusted Measure (GRAM). Additionally, we show in this paper how GRAM can be implemented from a computational point of view and we also provide an economical interpretation of its dual program in terms of (shadow) profit maximization. Finally, an empirical example extracted from the literature serves to illustrate the new methodology.},

  abstract     = {We propose a novel approach for service systems, according to which the service can be split into two phases: an opening service (OS), which can be provided only when the customer is present, and a complementary service (CS), which can be conducted without the customer. To improve the system&#39;s overall performance, after providing the OS, the server can postpone executing the CS to time intervals in which they are empty of customers. The prepared OSs are stored in a designated storage facility. Once the system becomes empty, the server executes the CS for the stored OSs, one at a time. We consider two unbounded dimensions system involving a multivariate probability generating function and derive closed-form expressions for the system&#39;s steady-state probabilities and various performance measures. An economic analysis compares the described model with a corresponding limited OS capacity model.},

  abstract     = {We analyze the assembly line balancing problem with stochastic task times. Tasks have to be assigned to a minimum number of stations with a constraint on the line reliability, which is the probability of finishing a work piece completely. A sampling approach is developed that ensures the line reliability. We prove that any lower bound on the number of stations for the related deterministic problem can be transformed into a lower bound for this sampling formulation. This general transformation can be applied to any bound that has already been developed or to any potential new bound. Those bounds can be applied to any MIP model, optimization algorithm or heuristic procedure based on a sampling formulation. We exemplify the usefulness of these bounds in a reliability-based branch-and-bound (RB&amp;B) algorithm that explicitly considers the dependence among all stations due to the constrained line reliability. A partial assignment of tasks to stations has to consider already constructed stations and potential further assignments to other stations. Hence, a feasible assignment of tasks to this station may allow for exceeding the cycle time with a certain probability but has to consider the overall line reliability with respect to the remaining stations. Effective fathoming strategies based on the new transformed lower bounds or based on a direct consideration of the line reliability are proposed. A numerical study shows that the transformed lower bounds are tight and that they substantially reduce the required computation times of the RB&amp;B algorithm and of the solver CPLEX.},

Max-stable fields, such as the Brown–Resnick and Smith fields, are very popular in spatial extremes. We focus on the two most popular unbiased stochastic derivative estimation approaches: the likelihood ratio method (LRM) and the infinitesimal perturbation analysis (IPA). LRM requires the multivariate density of the max-stable field to be explicit, and IPA necessitates the computation of the derivative with respect to the parameters for each simulated value. We propose convenient and tractable conditions ensuring the validity of LRM and IPA in the cases of the Brown–Resnick and Smith field, respectively. Obtaining such conditions is intricate owing to the very structure of max-stable fields. Then we focus on risk and dependence measures, which constitute one of the several frameworks where our theoretical results can be useful. We perform a simulation study which shows that both LRM and IPA perform well in various configurations, and provide a real case study that is valuable for the insurance industry.},

Heterogeneities are also integrated in the model assuming that the inverse of the scale parameter follows a uniform distribution. A maintenance strategy is implemented in this system and the state of the system is checked in inspection times. If the system is working at inspection time, a preventive replacement is performed if the deterioration level of a degradation process exceeds a certain threshold. A corrective replacement is performed if the system is down at inspection time. Under this maintenance strategy, the expected cost rate is obtained.

Failed components are immediately replaced with new, functioning components, and a one-for-one replenishment policy is applied for the restocking of those spare parts. We present a novel decomposition approach to approximate the average throughput and inventory for a system with an arbitrary number of machines, buffers, and spare parts. With a detailed numerical study, we analyze the impact of different parameter constellations on the approximation quality. We demonstrate the remarkable accuracy of our method by comparing our results with both exact and simulated values.

In addition, the only source of consultancy is most often carried out by the order picking system manufacturers themselves. Our framework, using recent advancements in deep neural networks, provides an efficient methodology for selecting not only the best order picking system for a given order structure but also the most suited design parameters. This enables warehouse companies to compare objectively an extensive number of systems and allows them to identify the most promising order picking systems.

However, there is little literature quantifying the benefits of warehouse collaboration. In this paper, we study the impact of collaboration on two main internal resources of the warehouse; order pickers and dock doors. The setting we consider is relevant to multi-user warehouses, where the owner provides facilities and services to multiple clients depending on their needs. We investigate the impact of sharing the resources among the clients of such a warehouse. We present an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation, which aims at planning the order picking and shipping process while minimizing the total tardiness of shipping trucks. We use this ILP to solve the non-collaborative and collaborative case and evaluate the performance improvement resulting from the collaboration, based on operational data from a retailer. We perform computational experiments under varying warehouse configurations to investigate under what circumstances collaboration leads to the highest benefit. We find that collaboration has a significant impact on decreasing the tardiness of trucks, and the benefits mostly come from sharing the pickers rather than sharing the dock doors. We further find that the maximum benefit of collaboration is obtained at the medium-level of resource utilization. Even at low levels of utilization of a particular resource, benefits can be obtained by collaborating on complementary resources.},

We formulate a simultaneous game between multiple firms that sell substitutable products to the same market, and customer demand is determined by both prices and lead-time quotations of all firms. We fully characterize the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium, and use analytical results supplemented by comprehensive numerical examples to understand the impact of competition. Our research yields two key counterintuitive findings. First, although on the surface price and lead-time shape the demand function in a similar fashion, competition in these two dimensions drives equilibrium price and lead-time quotation in opposite directions. In particular, price competition decreases price but increases lead-time quotation, whereas lead-time competition increases price but decreases lead-time quotation. Second, under joint price and lead-time competition, if the relative price and lead-time competition intensities are disparate, firms can benefit from increased competition in the weaker dimension. The intuition is that increased competition in the weaker dimension diffuses the tensions between the firms in the stronger competition dimension, mitigating its negative impact on profit. To the best of our knowledge, we are among the first to identify conditions under which firms can gain from intensified competition.},

With the recent advances in data collection and analysis technologies, data-driven approaches to classical inventory management problems have gained traction. Specially, machine learning methods are increasingly being integrated into optimization problems. Although data-driven approaches have been developed for the newsvendor problem, they often consider learning from the available data and optimizing the system separate tasks to be performed in sequence. One of the setbacks of this approach is that in the learning phase, costly and cheap mistakes receive equal attention and, in the optimization phase, the optimizer is blind to the confidence of the learner in its estimates for different regions of the problem. To remedy this, we consider an integrated learning and optimization problem for optimizing a newsvendor’s strategy facing a complex correlated demand with additional information about the unobservable state of the system. We give an algorithm based on integrating optimization, neural networks and hidden Markov models and use numerical experiments to show the efficiency of our method. In an empirical experiment, the method outperforms the best competitor benchmark by more than 27\%, on average, in terms of the system cost. We give further analyses of the performance of the method using a set of numerical experiments.},

The distribution of uncertain processing times is subject to ambiguity belonging to a set of distributions with constrained mean and covariance. We show that the problem can be cast as a deterministic optimization problem, with the objective function composed of an expectation and a regularization term given as an ℓ p ℓp norm. The main question we ask and answer is whether the particular choice of the used ℓ p ℓp norm affects the computational complexity of the problem and the robustness of its solution. We prove that if durations of the jobs are independent, the solution in terms of any ℓ p ℓp norm can be solved in a pseudopolynomial time, by the reduction to a non-linear bipartite matching problem. We also show an efficient, polynomial-time algorithm for ℓ 1 ℓ1 case. Furthermore, for instances with dependent durations of the jobs, we propose computationally efficient formulation and an algorithm that uses ℓ 1 ℓ1 norm. Moreover, we identify a class of covariance matrices admitting a faster, polynomial-time algorithm. The computational experiments show that the proposed algorithms provide solutions with a similar quality to the existing algorithms while having significantly better computational complexities.},

The objective is to determine the subsets of jobs to be outsourced and a joint production and delivery schedule for the rest of the jobs that are processed in-house, so that the makespan of the jobs processed in-house plus the total cost of outsourcing and delivery is minimized.

  abstract     = {To reach more customers, many manufacturers utilize multiple distribution channels consisting of a direct and an indirect sales channel. In particular, the strong growth of internet sales (or e-commerce) has driven companies to redesign their distribution channels to take advantage of the opportunities e-commerce offers. Opening a direct sales channel, however, also leads to managerial challenges. The most significant one is channel conflicts that manufacturers encounter when adding a direct channel to an existing traditional channel. Manufacturers that engage in direct selling may compete with their extant independent retailers. Competition between manufacturers and retailers starts when the former intrude into the market (segment) that was traditionally served by the retailers via manufacturer-owned stores and online sales, which is commonly referred to as manufacturer or supplier encroachment. This paper aims to provide a systematic and exhaustive review of multi-channel distribution systems in a combined forward and reverse supply chain where the manufacturer competes with its independently-owned intermediaries (retailers or wholesalers). First, to organize our discussion, all works obtained during the literature search were classified and evaluated in accordance with a proposed conceptual framework. The paper then discusses the sampled works and evaluates possible research gaps. Finally, based on the analysis of the literature, managerial implications and promising future research directions are proposed.},

While most work has investigated the problem using all assets, minimal work has investigated the cardinality constrained variant, which reduces the associated portfolio overhead. In this work, we present the first formulations that can be solved to global optimality by off-the-shelf solvers. Specifically, we propose two new quadratically constrained quadratic integer programs, a non-convex and a convex one, that can be solved to global optimality without the need of specialized algorithms, heuristics or approximations. We strengthen our formulations by adding tighter variable bounds and valid constraints. Computational experiments on real-world financial data indicate the effectiveness of our formulations at producing portfolios with equal risk contributions of chosen cardinality size. Specifically, the convex formulation is shown to be very efficient in terms of both speed and accuracy, while producing portfolios with great out-of-sample performance.},

  abstract     = {Driven by ambitious renewable portfolio standards, large-scale inclusion of variable energy resources (such as wind and solar) are expected to introduce unprecedented levels of uncertainty into power systems operations. The current practice of operations planning with deterministic optimization models may be ill-suited for a future with abundant uncertainty. To overcome the potential reliability and economic challenges, we present a stochastic hierarchical planning (SHP) framework for power systems coordinated by a centralized planner. This framework captures operations at day-ahead, short-term and hour-ahead timescales, along with the interactions between the stochastic processes and decisions. In contrast to earlier studies where stochastic optimization of individual problems (e.g., unit commitment, economic dispatch) have been studied, this paper studies an integrated framework of planning under uncertainty , where stochastic optimization models are stitched together in a hierarchical setting, which parallels the deterministic hierarchical planning approach that is widely adopted in the power industry. Our experiments, based on the NREL-118 dataset, reveal that under high renewable integration, significant operational improvements can be expected by transitioning to the SHP paradigm. In particular, the computational results show that significant improvements can be achieved in several metrics, including system reliability, environmental sustainability, and system economics, solely by making a strategic choice to adopt the new SHP paradigm.},

Therefore, we consider the online version of the problem. Our objective is to minimize a combination of makespan and the total energy costs. The energy costs include cost of energy consumption of machines for switching on, processing, and idleness. We propose a binary program to solve the optimization problem at each stage of the approximate dynamic program. We compare the results of the approximate programming approach against an integer linear programming formulation of the offline version of the scheduling problem and an existing heuristic method suitable for scheduling problem with ready times. The results show that the approximate dynamic programming algorithm outperforms the two off-line methods in terms of solution quality and computational time.},

  abstract     = {Modern transport systems are not only large-scale but also highly dynamic, which makes it difficult to optimize by just employing classical methods. This paper analyzes a realistic and novel problem within the Physical Internet initiative which consists of container transportation throughout a spoke-hub network. Containers need to be transported from their origin locations to their final destinations on or before a given deadline, and they can be temporarily stored in network hubs. Each truck can move one container at a time from one hub to another, containers can be transported by different trucks during their path from their origin to their destination, and drivers need to be back at their starting points in due time. A deterministic heuristic, based on discrete-event simulation, is proposed as a first step to address the intrinsic dynamism of this time-evolving system. Then, in a second step, a biased-randomized version of this heuristic is incorporated into a multi-start framework (BR-MS) to generate better solutions. Next, our methodology is extended to a iterated local search (ILS) framework. Finally, a two-stage algorithm, combining both the BR-MS and the ILS frameworks is proposed. Several computational experiments have been carried out on a set of new benchmark instances, adapted from real road networks, to illustrate the problem and compare the performance of the different solving approaches.},

Despite this, it is clear from published studies that many DES models are not subsequently implemented in hospitals or reused for other sites. This research addresses a gap in the literature by presenting a new data-driven modelling framework ‘GE-DES’, which outlines an approach to the design and development of generalisable ED models. The nature of the framework means that it is sufficiently flexible (i) for use across multiple EDs, and (ii) for investigating hospital-specific problems through data-driven customisation. The primary aim of GE-DES is to support model reuse and implementation. The framework is demonstrated through application to a case study ED in Australia.},

Specifically, under the niche strategy (i.e., the provider sells the new technology to only one manufacturer), the provider sells the new technology to the low-quality manufacturer in the case of moderate-level technology improvement; otherwise, the provider sells to the high-quality manufacturer. Interestingly, the provider&#39;s profit may decrease with increased technology improvement. Second, the manufacturers will remove the old version of the product from the market when adopting the new technology, as long as the quality of the new version of the product exceeds a critical threshold. Finally, if the provider has a limited production capacity and can only satisfy the demand of one manufacturer, the provider sells the new technology to the low-quality manufacturer when the technology improvement is moderate; otherwise, the provider sells to the high-quality manufacturer.},

A comparison of six deep neural network architectures, including state-of-the-art transformer models, finds that the architectures mostly provide similar performance.

We identify two shortcomings of their approach and propose two frontier-based incentive mechanisms for allocating common revenues or fixed costs. First, the incentive common revenue allocation (ICRA) and incentive fixed cost allocation (IFCA) are conceptualized. On the basis of ICRA and IFCA, the generalized incentive efficiency measures that satisfy strong monotonicity and self-excluded in technology are identified to evaluate subunit performances. To seek for incentive efficiency measures, several ex-post technologies with frontier change rate (FCR) are considered. Different technologies are formulated for the information asymmetry situation , in which FCR is not available to subunits when they select production mixes, and the information symmetry situation , in which FCR is available to subunits when they select production mixes. We elucidate that the formulated technologies are applicable to derive corresponding incentive efficiency measures. ICRA and IFCA are then obtained via the concept of efficiency proportion. Subsequently, the mechanisms for information asymmetry situation and information symmetry situation are summarized, and several theorems and interesting observations of the proposed mechanisms are reported. Finally, we illustrate our proposed mechanisms for allocating common revenues or fixed costs using data from a home appliance enterprise in China.},

Unstructured problems, such as the grand challenges, are characterised by the existence of multiple actors with different perspectives and conflicting interests, and they require a coordinated effort from multiple organisations. Within this context, this paper aims to understand stakeholders’ perceptions of system boundaries and problem framings, and their potential effects on decision-making by systematically comparing different stakeholder groups’ causal maps around the same shared concern. Bridging notions from Operational Research, System Dynamics and Organisational Studies, the comparison is based on a novel type of thematic analysis of Causal Loop Diagrams (CLDs) built with each stakeholder group on their perceptions of a given system. The proposed integrated approach combines qualitative with quantitative analysis, such as the centrality of the variables and the structure of the CLDs. Such CLDs comparison provides an intuitive way to visualise differences and similarities of the thematic clusters of variables, underlining factors influencing the shared concern. This could be considered a starting point for more shared understanding as well as more integrated holistic perceptions of the system and, consequently, a more systemic decision-making. Furthermore, for the sake of replicability, this paper also presents a qualitative participatory System Dynamics modelling process aimed to define the key aspects of a problem for each group of stakeholders to support a collaborative multi-organisational decision-making process.

The decision maker&#39;s preferences are elicited considering the choices made given a set of comparisons among pairs of solutions (the stimuli). It is assumed that the decision maker has a reference value (target) for the stimulus. Solutions that do not comply with this reference value for some of the criteria dimensions considered will be penalized, and an inferred weight is associated with each dimension to calculate a penalty score for each solution. One of the differentiating features of the proposed model when compared with other existing models is the fact that only solutions that do not meet the target are penalized. The target is not interpreted as an ideal solution, but as a set of threshold values that should be taken into account when choosing a solution. The proposed approach was applied to the problem of choosing radiotherapy treatment plans, using a set of retrospective cancer cases treated at the Portuguese Oncology Institute of Coimbra. Using paired comparison choices made by one radiation oncologist, the preference model was built and was tested with in-sample and out-of-sample data. It is possible to conclude that the preference model is capable of representing the radiation oncologist&#39;s preferences, presenting small mean errors and leading, most of the time, to the same treatment plan chosen by the radiation oncologist.},

How should a buyer manage the consequent risk of reduced sales? This paper answers the question by analyzing a dynamic Stackelberg game in which the buyer offers financial incentives to the supplier to treat its work force fairly. This tactical approach to risk management corresponds to a strategic approach in which the buyer first determines its risk posture, and then identifies the most profitable financial incentives that are consistent with that risk posture. The buyer’s problem corresponds to optimizing a Markov decision process with a discounted criterion over an infinite horizon. Analytical and numerical analysis of the model shows that the buyer should rely on a contingent bonus as the primary incentive, and set the wholesale price at the supplier’s reservation price; the organization of the supply chain affects the mean severity of a flagrant violation of fair labor practices; and the buyer’s value function is approximated well by an affine function of reputation.},

To incorporate setup crossover and carryover, we first propose a standard model that straightforwardly adapts a formulation technique from the literature. Then, as the main contribution, we propose a novel optimization model that incorporates the notion of time flow. We derive a family of valid inequalities with which to compare the tightness of the models’ linear programming relaxations. In addition, we provide an approximate dynamic programming algorithm that estimates the value of a state using its lower and upper bounds. Then, we conduct computational experiments to demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed models and the solution algorithm. The test results show that the newly proposed time-flow model has considerable advantages compared with the standard model in terms of tightness and solvability. The proposed algorithm also shows computational benefits over the standard mixed integer programming solver.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel way of modeling uncertainty on demand in the single-item dynamic lot sizing problem is proposed and studied. The uncertainty is not related to the demand quantity, but rather to the demand timing, i.e., the demand fully occurs in a single period of a given time interval with a given probability and no partial delivery is allowed. The problem is first motivated and modeled. Our modeling naturally correlates uncertain demands in different periods contrary to most of the literature in lot sizing. Dynamic programs are then proposed for the general case of multiple demands with stochastic demand timing and for several special cases. We also show that the most general case where the backlog cost depends both on the time period and the stochastic demand is NP-hard.},

  abstract     = {Households produce large amounts of waste cooking oil (WCO), which should be disposed properly to avoid its negative impacts on the environment. Using WCO as raw material in biodiesel production is an effective disposal method. In this study, we focus on designing an efficient WCO collection network, in which households deposit their WCO into the bins to be placed at several collection centers (CCs), which are then regularly collected by capacitated vehicles. We study the problem of determining (i) the number and location of the CCs, (ii) the assignment of households to the CCs, respecting a certain coverage distance threshold, (iii) the number of bins to place at each CC, and (iv) the vehicle routes navigating between the biodiesel facility and CCs to minimize the sum of fixed cost of opening CCs and placing bins at each CC and routing cost. To solve the proposed location-routing problem, we develop a novel matheuristic based on Variable Neighborhood Search , which incorporates an integer programming model to determine the bin allocation and assignment decisions. We evaluate the solution performance of different variants of the proposed algorithm by performing an extensive computational study on a set of hypothetical and case instances. The results show that the proposed matheuristic provides superior solutions with respect to benchmark algorithms.},

After this actual available quantity is realized but before assembly for meeting final demand, the assembler can procure additional components from some backup suppliers. We derive the optimal ordering policy under this backup sourcing strategy and analyze the benefits of using backup suppliers in mitigating the adverse effect of supply uncertainty in component procurement from the primary suppliers. Our result shows that the availability of backup supplier for the component with supply uncertainty can provide very substantial benefits to the assembler, especially when the unit cost of this component from the primary supplier is high relative to the extra unit component cost from the backup supplier for high-margin products under an operating environment of high supply uncertainty and low demand uncertainty. We further show that the availability of backup suppliers for the other components with no supply uncertainty can provide additional significant benefits to the assembler when extra unit component cost of backup supplier for the unreliable component supplier is high for low-margin products with high demand uncertainty.},

This paper studies the effect of retailer’s strategic pricing on the supplier’s encroachment incentive. We build up an analytical model where the physical retailer rolls out retail service to attract consumers, while the matching degree between retail service and customers’ taste is uncertain before the selling season and could be privately observed by the retailer in the selling season. The retailer could strategically choose the pricing strategy between: (i) pricing before learning accurate consumer information (preannounced pricing) and (ii) pricing after grasping accurate information (responsive pricing). We find that responsive pricing can lead to costly signaling behavior for the retailer, in which the retailer downward distorts the profit margin when the realized service matching degree is low. Specifically, we demonstrate that strategically adopting responsive pricing could dampen the supplier’s encroachment incentive when signaling is costly and the matching degree is ex ante less likely to be high; otherwise, the retailer could strategically adopt preannounced pricing to dampen the supplier’s encroachment incentive. Our results suggest that the retailer’s strategic pricing could serve as a novel and costless anti-encroachment device.},

  abstract     = {Modern high-end computing systems, such as storage servers used in Youtube and Tiktok, serve large numbers of concurrent streams, each of which requires aggressive prefetching. This multi-stream prefetching problem, which strives to serve as many requests as possible from the memory cache and minimize response time, remains as an open challenge in computer science research. To address the efficient resource management for data prefetching, this paper introduces a novel method adopted from inventory management of multiple products in operations research. It proposes a unique constrained multi-stream ( Q , r ) (Q,r) model which simultaneously determines the prefetching degree (order quantity) Q Q and trigger distance (reorder point) r r for each application stream, taking into account the distinct data request rates of the streams. The model has the objective of minimizing the cache miss level (backorder level), which determines the access latency, as well as constraints on the cache space (inventory space) and the total prefetching frequency (total order frequency). Specifically, the disk access time (lead time) is a function of both the prefetching degree and the total prefetching frequency, the latter of which represents the system load. We present the analytical properties of the model, provide numerical optimization examples, and conduct sensitivity analysis to further demonstrate the insights of this prefetching problem. Significantly, an empirical evaluation proves the effectiveness of the prefetching policy provided by our model.},

  abstract     = {Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology has proved to be an effective way to eliminate inventory inaccuracy, which is very prevalent in many industries. Inspired by the case of Wal-Mart facing difficulties when it required its suppliers to adopt RFID, this paper investigates RFID adoption strategies in a decentralized supply chain with two competing suppliers and a dominant retailer facing inventory inaccuracies. The two suppliers first sequentially determine whether to adopt RFID. Then, the supply chain members sequentially set their pricing policies under the wholesale price contract. We characterize the optimal wholesale prices, retail prices, and profits under different RFID adoption strategies and further examine the equilibrium results of RFID adoption. Our findings reveal that when only the powerful supplier uses RFID, the follower&#39;s profit first increases and then decreases as the inventory availability rate increases; however, when only the follower supplier adopts RFID, the profit of the powerful supplier that forgoes RFID increases as the inventory availability rate increases. Importantly, inventory inaccuracies and tag costs have substantial effects on the equilibrium RFID adoption strategy under upstream competition. The powerful supplier has the incentive and is more inclined to adopt RFID than the follower. Under intense upstream competition, suppliers are more likely to forgo the use of RFID. The equilibrium RFID adoption strategy can bring all supply chain members to a Pareto optimal outcome when both inventory availability rates are low or one is close to 1 while the other is low.},

Addressing this issue, we consider a retailer that sells two substitutable products whose demands are uncertain. Based on the newsboy model, we analyze the optimal pricing and inventory decisions under the two strategies in three total market size situations, namely deterministic, discrete random, and general random. We derive closed-form optimal solutions for the former two situations and numerically find the optimal solution for the latter situation. We then compare the optimal profits under the two strategies in the three situations. We show that probabilistic selling always performs better than inventory substitution and brings more benefits to the retailer. These findings can explain that more and more firms adopt probabilistic selling in reality.},

After the decision maker fixes part of the solution, the adversary chooses a scenario from a specified uncertainty set. Afterwards, the decision maker can react to this scenario by completing the partial first-stage solution to a full solution. We extend this classic setting by adding another adversary stage after the second decision-maker stage, which results in min-max-min-max problems, thus pushing two-stage settings further towards more general multi-stage problems. We focus on budgeted uncertainty sets and consider both the continuous and discrete case. For the former, we show that a wide range of robust combinatorial optimization problems can be decomposed into polynomially many subproblems, which can be solved in polynomial time for example in the case of ( representative ) selection . For the latter, we prove NP-hardness for a wide range of problems, but note that the special case where first- and second-stage adversarial costs are equal can remain solvable in polynomial time.},

A group-application means that its applicants ask to be assigned to the same dormitory, and otherwise they prefer living off-campus. The underlying assumption in our model is that the dormitories share a common preference over the student-groups, which is given by a strictly increasing ranking of their credit scores. The definition of a quasi-stable outcome is adjusted in order to incorporate student-group applications, and we prove that such an outcome always exists. Furthermore, a polynomial-time algorithm that finds all the quasi-stable outcomes is proposed. Apparently, not all properties of the single students’ model continue to hold under group-applications. Finally, we consider the incentive compatibility property of the proposed algorithm, and describe a specific quasi-stable outcome for which no subset of student-groups can gain by misrepresenting their preferences over the dormitories.},

  abstract     = {This paper provides a comprehensive review in the domain of hazardous material transportation from an Operational Research point of view. The paper&#39;s focus lies on hazmat routing, routing-scheduling, and network design problems. The objective of this review paper is twofold: (1) reviewing the models’ assumptions, objectives and constraints, decisions, input parameters, basic modeling/solution techniques, and case studies, and (2) highlighting the underlying features and challenges in designing the models with different transportation modes. Besides, the most significant research gaps in the literature are identified through a systematic in-depth review at a micro-level. Finally, a set of promising future research directions is proposed upon from the authorities could draw better decisions. As a key finding after performing this review, we believe that a considerable number of promising future research directions consist in hybridizing different problems, i.e., amount to borrowing some key properties from a problem and integrating them into another problem. This has led to valuable research studies in the literature of hazmat transportation problems.},

  abstract     = {Persistence in the literature is the perception of an inherent tradeoff between ecological conservation and economic harvesting goals. Overexploitation may lead to resource destruction, including extinction. Conservation measures should be decided and implemented. A standard ecological response is to impose no-take areas or marine reserves. In this paper, our objective is to study a harvesting management problem under the constraints of a no-take area, which we formulate mathematically as a bi-dimensional singular stochastic control problem. Using dynamic programming theory, we characterise our value function as the unique solution to a HJB equation. We also describe the optimal harvesting strategy by identifying the harvesting and non-harvesting regions. We show that setting up reserve area not only leads to a better ecological conservation but may also increase the economic benefit for fishing industry in the long run. We further enrich our studies with some numerical analysis, enabling us to get some insightful understanding on the size of the reserve area where no-take policy should be implemented.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies an optimal investment and benefit adjustment problem for a target benefit pension plan. The pension sponsor can adjust the benefit level to guarantee the stable operation of the plan. The pension is allowed to invest in a risk-free bond and a stock. The weighted product of the benefit outgo and pension wealth is considered in the objective function, which is taken in the form of Cobb-Douglas utility. Thus the plan takes both the benefit level and terminal wealth of the pension into account and then the benefit payment are dependent on the financial situation of the plan. By applying dynamic programming approach, we establish the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and derive the optimal investment-benefit strategy and the value function explicitly. The verification theorem is presented and proved. Furthermore, the recursive utility is considered as an extension and we find that the elasticity of intertemporal substitution has a positive effect on the optimal benefit level. Finally, numerical examples are given and demonstrate that this pension scheme is sustainable and can provide stable and consecutive incremental benefit payment for future generations.},

To this end, we introduce a sequence of nonatomic games with a finite number of player types, which approximates the initial game. We show the existence of a symmetric Wardrop equilibrium in each of these games. We prove that those symmetric equilibria converge to an equilibrium of the infinite game, and that they can be computed as solutions of finite-dimensional variational inequalities. The model is illustrated through an example from smart grids: the description of a large population of electricity consumers by a parametric distribution gives a nonatomic game with an infinity of different player types, with actions subject to coupling constraints.},

For instance, the Airbus A380 can only be serviced at gates equipped with a passenger boarding bridge that is able to access its upper level. Given the dynamic development of both the number of aircraft movements and the fleet mix at airports, the recurring decision problem is to determine for each gate whether and when the passenger boarding bridge configuration should be changed. The objective is to minimize investment and operating costs associated with the bridges as well as penalty costs for aircraft which cannot be processed because gates that are equipped with adequate gate configurations are not available. We propose a mixed-integer model formulation and present its underlying network structure. To solve the problem, we employ a column generation based heuristic approach. We demonstrate the good performance of the heuristic in a computational study and present a detailed discussion of the decisions taken as part of a case study.},

  abstract     = {In warehouses, storage replenishment operations involve the transportation of items to capacitated item slots in the forward storage area from reserve storage. These items are later picked from these slots as demand arises. While order picking constitutes the majority of warehouse operating costs, efficient management of replenishment operations is important to ensure the availability of the items for picking and to decrease the operating costs due to replenishment, which might be particularly higher in warehouses with fast-moving items (e.g., e-commerce warehouses or retail distribution centers). In this paper, we define the storage replenishment routing problem in a parallel-aisle warehouse, where replenishment and order picking operations are carried out in successive cycles with time limits. The aim is to determine the item slots that will be replenished and the route of the replenishment worker in each replenishment cycle, so as to minimize the total travel time and ensure the availability of items at the start of the cycle they will be picked. We present complexity results on different variants of the problem and show that the problem is NP -hard in general. Consequently, we adapt a heuristic approach based on a priori routing and inspired by the literature on the inventory routing problem. We use randomly generated warehouse instances to analyze the effects of different a priori routing methods and demand skewness patterns on replenishment performance, and to compare the proposed approach to benchmarks that mimic practice.},

To ensure robustness, previous works on these synchronized systems propose sending a robot to the neighboring area in case it detects a failure. In order to deal with unpredictability and to improve on the efficiency in the deterministic patrolling scheme, this paper proposes random strategies to cover the areas distributed among the agents. First, a theoretical study of the stochastic process is addressed in this paper for two metrics: the idle time , the expected time between two consecutive observations of any point of the terrain and the isolation time , the expected time that a robot is without communication with any other robot. After that, the random strategies are experimentally compared with the deterministic strategy adding another metric: the broadcast time , the expected time elapsed from the moment a robot emits a message until it is received by all the other robots of the team. The simulations show that theoretical results are in good agreement with the simulations and the random strategies outperform the behavior obtained with the deterministic protocol proposed in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Achieving fairness in algorithmic decision-making tools is an issue constantly gaining in need and popularity. Today, unfair decisions made by such tools can even be subject to legal consequences. We propose a new constraint that integrates fairness into data envelopment analysis (DEA). This allows the calculation of relative efficiency scores of decision-making units (DMUs) with fairness included. The proposed fairness constraint restricts disparate impact to occur in efficiency scores, and enables the creation of a single data envelopment analysis for both privileged and unprivileged groups of DMUs simultaneously. We show that the proposed method - FairDEA - produces an interpretable model that was tested on a synthetic dataset and two real-world examples, namely the ranking between hybrid and conventional car designs, and the Latin American and Caribbean economies. We provide the interpretation of the FairDEA method by comparing it to the basic DEA and the balanced fairness and efficiency method (BFE DEA). Along with calculating the disparate impact of the model, we performed a Wilcoxon rank-sum test to inspect for fairness in rankings. The results show that the FairDEA method achieves similar efficiency scores as other methods, but without disparate impact. Statistical analysis indicates that the differences in ranking between the groups are not statistically different, which means that the ranking is fair. This method contributes both to the development of data envelopment analysis, and the inclusion of fairness in efficiency analysis.},

We reflect upon the contribution of SDD as lying in its appreciation of “third phase science” and discuss links to other deliberative processes. We indicate why SDD can be classed as “problem structuring” despite the near absence of publicisation in the Operational Research (OR) literature to date. We discuss distinct contributions that the SDD offers to the OR world and indicate how it strengthens and extends Community OR, contributes to Critical Systems Thinking in OR, and offers new mathematical approaches that the Community OR practitioners may wish to consider using. By way of illustration, we showcase the “European Initiative” as an aspect of a large-scale project across five geographical regions funded by the United Nations Democracy Fund, in conjunction with the Future Worlds centre (2016–2018). It engaged as stakeholders five cohorts of youth pioneers concerned with formulating options for Re-inventing democracy in the digital age.},

After defining appropriate choice functions, we extend the five basic graph model stability definitions to this new context.

Thereby, all requests have associated time windows for pick-up and delivery, and may be denied if they can not be serviced in reasonable time or at reasonable cost. Rather than using a spatial representation of the transportation network we suggest an event-based formulation of the problem, resulting in significantly improved computational times. While the corresponding MILP formulations require more variables than standard models, they have the advantage that capacity, pairing and precedence constraints are handled implicitly. The approach is tested and validated using a standard IP-solver on benchmark data from the literature. Moreover, the impact of, and the trade-off between, different optimization goals is evaluated on a case study in the city of Wuppertal (Germany).},

The freight volume that enters a service network on the day of operations deviates from the forecast freight volume used to create the loadplan. These deviations cause inefficiencies when the capacity on planned freight paths is no longer sufficient and delays result in missed service promises. Near real-time loadplan adjustments, i.e., rerouting freight on alternate paths, can improve on-time performance without incurring additional cost (e.g., without purchasing additional capacity). The problem of identifying effective alternate freight paths is modeled on a time-expanded network and computationally efficient heuristics are developed for its solution in order to ensure that there is sufficient time to put the adjusted loadplan in place. We demonstrate the practical viability and value of these heuristics in a computational study using real-life data from a large LTL carrier. The results show that on-time performance can be improved without increasing cost, i.e., by rerouting freight and using existing capacity in the service network.},

  abstract     = {We consider a system with a finite lifespan and a single critical component that is subject to random failures. An age-based replacement policy is applied to preventively replace the component before its failure. The components used for replacement come from either a weak population or a strong population, referred to as population heterogeneity. However, the true population type is unknown to the decision maker. By considering that the decision maker has a belief on the probability of having a weak population, we build a partially observable Markov decision process model with the objective of minimizing the total cost over the lifespan of the system. The resulting optimal policy updates the belief variable in a Bayesian fashion by using the data obtained over the course of the system lifespan, and it denotes when to execute preventive replacement. It optimally balances the trade-off between the cost of learning the true population type (via deliberately delaying the preventive replacement time to better learn the population type) and the cost of maintenance activities. By addressing this so-called exploration-exploitation trade-off, we generate insights on the optimal policy and compare its performance with existing heuristic approaches from the literature. We also characterize a lower bound to the optimal cost, allowing us to determine the value of resolving the uncertainty on the population type.},

  abstract     = {Consumers are increasingly concerned about pollution and are, at least in part, making their purchases accordingly. In this paper, we consider a supply chain where demand depends on the manufacturer’s environmental reputation, an asset that can only be built over time. We assume that this reputation depends on information emanating from the manufacturer itself about its environmental actions and on its objective environmental record when compared to an industry standard. In this paper, we look at the impact of consumers’ environmental concern on the strategies and outcomes of a supply chain. As the retailer has a direct influence on sales through its pricing policy, it seem more realistic to take a supply chain perspective instead of a single-firm one. Therefore, the contractual arrangement in the supply chain becomes a relevant issue. We model the supply chain as a two-player dynamic game and characterize and compare the equilibrium strategies and outcomes under wholesale-price and revenue-sharing contracts. We analyze the impact of the sharing parameter, the industry pollution standard and consumers’ degree of environmental sensitivity on the results, and in particular, on the region in the parameter space where a revenue-sharing contract is Pareto improving with respect to a wholesale-price contract. Also, we examine whether it is in the best interest of the retailer to behave myopically when setting its price.},

  abstract     = {This study attempts to examine whether it is beneficial to introduce the “buy online and return to store” (BORS) strategy in a competitive market. We consider two competing dual-channel retailers, and investigate conditions under which it is optimal for one or both of the retailers to offer the BORS strategy. We first assume that a partial refund is offered for online returns and then consider the important case of a full refund. We show that whether both retailers adopt this strategy significantly depends on the return rate and cross-selling profit. Specifically, if the return rate is sufficiently low (high), at least one retailer (both retailers) will adopt this strategy when the unit cross-selling profit is relatively high. Nonetheless, both retailers will fall into the prisoner&#39;s dilemma under certain conditions. Interestingly, the return rate and proportion of consumers with a high hassle cost associated with BORS returns significantly influence the equilibrium channel strategy and the existence of the prisoner&#39;s dilemma. We further find that, when both retailers implement the BORS strategy, they both benefit from offering a full refund return policy when the number of online-type consumers is large enough and the unit cross-selling profit is relatively small, but should provide a partial refund otherwise. When only one retailer adopts the BORS strategy, a partial refund return policy is preferable.},

  abstract     = {Emerging on-demand sharing alternatives, in which one resource is utilised simultaneously by a circumstantial group of users, entail several challenges regarding how to coordinate such users. A very relevant case refers to how to form groups in a mobility system that offers shared rides, and how to split the costs within the travellers of a group. These are non-trivial tasks, as two objectives conflict: 1) minimising the total costs of the system, and 2) finding an equilibrium where each user is content with her assignment. Aligning both objectives is challenging, as users are not aware of the externalities induced to the rest. In this paper, we propose protocols to share the costs within a ride so that optimal solutions can also constitute equilibria. To do this, we model the situation as a non-cooperative game, which can be seen as a game-version of the well-known set cover problem . We show that the traditional notions of equilibrium in game theory (Nash and Strong) are not useful here, and prove that determining whether a Strong Equilibrium exists is an NP-Complete problem, by reducing it to the k-Exact-Cover problem. Hence, we propose three alternative equilibrium notions (stronger than Nash and weaker than Strong), depending on how users can coordinate. For each of these equilibrium notions, we propose a (possibly overcharging) cost-sharing protocol that yields the optimal solutions equilibria. Simulations for Amsterdam reveal that our protocols can achieve stable solutions that are close to the optimum, and that having a central coordinator can have a large impact.},

However, these goods are often in short supply, due to consumer hoarding, insufficient manufacturing capacity and price gouging. Herein, we develop a game-theoretic supply chain model to evaluate the impact of government regulations on the shortage of life-saving goods and profit within the supply chain. Our model considers three types of regulation: (i) price regulation in the form of a price cap, (ii) purchase regulation or demand rationing and (iii) a combination thereof. The most distinguishing feature of our model is that it captures consumer panic buying, insufficient capacity, price surges and controls on the supply and demand side of the supply chain that are widely observed during a pandemic. The results establish reasonably simple prescriptions for policymakers to design effective and easy-to-implement regulations to mitigate shortages of critical supplies in the face of a pandemic.},

Although this approach strives to sell a product more appealing to customers, it also renders the product more complex and difficult to use, generating the feature fatigue effect. This is characterized by feelings frustration experienced by consumers when purchasing high-tech products with many appealing features, most of which turn out to be undesired, useless, and difficult to use. We study the impact of the feature fatigue effect on a manufacturing firm’s policies in designing its product–service portfolio. We consider two periods in order to capture the effect of customers’ word-of-mouth originating from feature fatigue, which is shared with other potential customers. Therefore, we assess not only the impact of feature fatigue but also the extent to which this effect can be alleviated by after-sales service. We capture feature fatigue by first considering a base model without this effect and then comparing the manufacturer’s decisions regarding quality, pricing, and service when it has either clear or noisy effect. Our findings reveal that feature fatigue drives manufacturers to under invest in quality and to replace penetration pricing policies with skimming policies. In addition, we demonstrate that after-sales service cannot fully mitigate the detrimental effect of feature fatigue on a manufacturer’s profits.},

We show that the optimal policy on product-level has the switching-curve structure under the assumption that the lost sales costs for new and remanufactured products are identical. Based on this structural result, we develop an efficient, close-to-optimal heuristic for the general product-level model and for the component-level model. Our numerical experiments indicate that two-way substitution on component level significantly reduces total cost. We also extend our model to strategic cost that includes environmental aspects in the objective function.

We propose a robust optimization reformulation of the related machine scheduling problem and discuss several important properties of the mathematical model and the reformulation approach. The proposed model generalizes robust parallel machine scheduling problems by including sequence-dependent setup times and ellipsoidal uncertainty sets. Another key contribution of the paper is to show that scheduling problems usually have alternative optimal solutions for the worst-case tardiness objective, whose performance under nominal processing times may vary or vice a versa. This issue has been addressed by studying the Pareto efficient extensions of the proposed robust optimization models to provide solutions that are immune to changes in processing times. A branch-and-price algorithm has been developed to solve realistically sized instances in less than one hour, which a commercial solver cannot achieve. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach since realistically sized instances such as (4 machines, 32 jobs) and (150 machines, 300 jobs) can be solved to optimality within the time limit, and the (average) objective function value improvement made by the robust approach can get as high as 56\% compared with the (nominal) optimal solutions that ignore uncertainty in problem data.},

Decades of research have resulted in very powerful algorithms that can solve large knapsack problem instances involving thousands of decision variables in a short amount of time. Current problem instances in the literature no longer challenge these algorithms. However, hard problem instances are important to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of algorithms and this knowledge can in turn be used to create better performing algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new class of hard problem instances for the 0–1 knapsack problem and provide theoretical support that helps explain why these problem instances are hard to solve to optimality. A large dataset of 3240 hard problem instances was generated and subsequently solved on a supercomputer, using approximately 810 CPU-hours. The analysis of the obtained results shows to which extent different parameters influence the hardness of the problem instances. This analysis also demonstrates that the proposed problem instances are a lot harder than the previously known hardest instances, despite being much smaller.},

Generalized strong branching extends the strong branching concepts developed for choosing a single variable to choosing a set of variables. As the computational requirements of a full implementation of strong branching are prohibitive, we use extreme gradient boosting to train a model to predict the ranking of (sets of) candidate variables. An extensive computational study using instances from three well-known classes of optimization problems demonstrates that branching on sets of variables outperforms branching on a single variable, that a learned model can be used effectively to select among (sets of) candidate variables, and that the learned strong branching strategies outperform the default branching strategy of state-of-the-art commercial solver CPLEX in terms of both the number of nodes explored in the search tree and the time it takes to explore the search tree.},

Jobs are self-interested utility-maximizers that can choose the machines they are processed on and are exclusively interested in reducing their own private objective function. Each machine processes the jobs according to a local policy. We discuss Nash equilibria in the resulting schedules and perform a thorough analysis of the resulting (absolute) prices of anarchy for various parallel machine environments, utilities of the agents, and local policies of the machines. We show that local policies that are based on simple sorting-based procedures like shortest processing time first (SPT) and earliest due date first (EDD) lead to big losses in welfare compared to the global optimum. However, when employing Moore-Hodgson’s algorithm as a local policy, we can prove a price of anarchy of ( 2 m − 1 ) / m (2m−1)/m for identical machines and a price of anarchy of 2 for related and unrelated parallel machines. Moreover, we show how these results can be used to prove approximation ratios for greedy scheduling algorithms. This paper is the first to prove approximation ratios for two greedy scheduling procedures, turning them from simple heuristics into actual approximation ratios with a provable approximation ratio.},

This paper surveys the scientific literature on assembly line balancing that has been published since the last major review papers have appeared in 2006 and 2007, respectively. We cover all essential stages of the decision making process: we address novel methods to efficiently gather the relevant (precedence graph) data, review especially new problem variants and models treated in the literature, and survey the most important algorithmic developments. Furthermore, we outline a possible research agenda for the next fifteen years.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we propose a supervised learning-driven (SLD) heuristic to solve the capacitated facility location and production planning (CFLPP) problem. Using the solution values derived from linear programming relaxation, Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition, and column generation as features, the SLD heuristic uses a supervised learning approach (i.e., naïve Bayes) to derive an offline-learned oracle on the optimal solution patterns. The oracle and the incumbent feasible solution obtained by a time-oriented decomposition method (i.e., relax-and-fix) are then used to guide a sampling procedure to iteratively create numerous smaller-sized subproblems, which are solved by the relax-and-fix method to gradually improve the solution for the CFLPP problem. Computational results show that the SLD heuristic achieves better solution qualities than the commercial CPLEX solver and several state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, model averaging, by which estimates are obtained based on not one single model but a weighted ensemble of models, has received growing attention as an alternative to model selection. To-date, methods for model averaging have been developed almost exclusively for point-valued data, despite the fact that interval-valued data are commonplace in many applications and the substantial body of literature on estimation and inference methods for interval-valued data. This paper focuses on the special case of interval time series data, and assumes that the mid-point and log-range of the interval values are modelled by a two-equation vector autoregressive with exogenous covariates (VARX) model. We develop a methodology for combining models of varying lag orders based on a weight choice criterion that minimises an unbiased estimator of the squared error risk of the model average estimator. We prove that this method yields predictors of mid-points and ranges with an optimal asymptotic property. In addition, we develop a method for correcting the range forecasts, taking into account the forecast error variance. An extensive simulation experiment examines the performance of the proposed model averaging method in finite samples. We apply the method to an interval-valued data series on crude oil future prices.},

A static structural model is constructed, composed of a network of firms who cross-hold each other, a financial market consisting of multiple primitive assets that are vulnerable to a shock, and an insurer who resides external to the network and assesses the opportunity to sell protection to the financial firms. Assume that each firm in the network is rational and able to decide how much protection to purchase to optimize its portfolio according to the mean-variance principle. As a result, the shock may impact on the insurer but indirectly through the network. In view of the robust-yet-fragile nature of financial networks that has been discovered, both empirically and theoretically, by various recent works, one expects that the network integration and the shock play an intertwined role in the insurance risk. Our study forms a theoretical confirmation of this surmise: Depending on the shock size, there are three mutually exclusive scenarios in which an increase in the network integration can either reduce or amplify the impact of the shock on the insurance risk.},

For the exponential CSALT with type II censoring, we derive the exact and approximate prediction intervals for the RUL of the product. Using the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimation and the bootstrap method, we provide the two prediction intervals for the RUL of the product based on the exponential CSALT type I censored data. Under the Weibull CSALT with type II censoring, we use the generalized inferential procedure to obtain the generalized prediction interval of the RUL of the product. We also get the bootstrap prediction interval of the RUL of the product based on the Weibull CSALT type I censored data. The performance of the proposed prediction intervals is assessed by Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation results show that the coverage probabilities of the proposed prediction intervals are very close to the nominal confidence level.

  abstract     = {Most modern energy markets trade electricity in advance for technical reasons. Thus, market participants must commit to delivering or consuming a certain amount of energy before the actual delivery. In Germany, two markets with daily auctions coexist. In the day-ahead auction market, the energy is traded in 60-minute time slots, which are further partitioned into 15-minute time slots for the intraday auction market. Because of the slow ramp-ups of nuclear and fossil power plants, these price-makers trade mostly in the day-ahead market. Only the residual energy is traded in the intraday market, where the market prices fluctuate substantially more. These fluctuations as well as the expected price difference between these markets can be exploited by fast ramping energy storage systems. We address the decision problem of an owner of an energy storage who trades on both markets, taking ramping times into account. Because the state variable of our dynamic programming formulation includes all features of our high-dimensional electricity price forecast, this problem cannot be solved to optimality. Instead, we use approximate dynamic programming. In a numerical study based on real-world data, we benchmark the algorithm against an adapted state-of-the-art approach from literature and an expectation model with a receding horizon. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of the price forecast on expected profit and demonstrate that it is essential for the dynamic program to capture the high dimensionality of the price forecast to compete with the expectation model, which does not suffer from the curses of dimensionality.},

  abstract     = {Many humanitarian organizations aid en route refugee groups who are on their journey to cross borders using mobile facilities and need to decide the number and routes of the facilities. We define a multi-period facility location problem in which both the facilities and demand are mobile on a network. Refugee groups may enter and exit the network in different periods and follow various paths. In each period, a refugee group moves from one node to an adjacent one in their predetermined path. Each facility should be located at a node in each period and provides service to the refugees at that node. Each refugee should be served at least once in a predetermined number of consecutive periods. The problem is to locate the facilities in each period to minimize the total setup and travel costs of the mobile facilities, while ensuring the service requirement. We call this problem the multi-period mobile facility location problem with mobile demand (MM-FLP-MD) and prove its NP-hardness. We formulate a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model and develop an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm (ALNS) to solve large-size instances. We tested the computational performance of the MILP and the metaheuristic algorithm by extracting data from the 2018 Honduras Migration Crisis. For instances solved to optimality by the MILP model, the proposed ALNS determines the optimal solutions faster and provides better solutions for the remaining instances. By analyzing the sensitivity to different parameters, we provide insights to decision-makers.},

We show both theoretically and empirically that Markowitz optimisation is likely to fail badly, even with normally-distributed data, with no time series or correlation effects, and even with shrinkage estimators to reduce estimation risk. A core problem is that very often we cannot confidently distinguish between the mean returns of most assets. We develop a method, based on a sequentially rejective test procedure, to help remedy this problem by identifying subsets of assets indistinguishable in mean or variance. We test our method against naive Markowitz and compare it to other methods, including bootstrap aggregation, proposed to remedy the poor practical performance of Markowitz optimisation. We use out-of-sample and bootstrap tests on data from several market indices and hedge funds. We find our method is more robust than naive Markowitz and outperforms equally weighted portfolios but bootstrap aggregation works, as expected, better when we cannot distinguish among means. We also find evidence that covariance shrinkage improves performance.},

We find that for cash-only RPs, the retailer uses price to attract consumers while using the refund fraction to discourage wardrobers. SC/GC can be a good alternative to cash when consumers have high valuation for SC/GC and some SC/GC are not redeemed. With high redemption rate, SC/GC can be a good alternative when consumers make hedonic purchases and the retailer has a reasonable profit margin. We also find that single-option RPs dominate two-option RPs when genuine consumers and wardrobers have the same valuation for SC/GC, and two-option RPs can dominate when the two consumer segments have heterogeneous valuation for SC/GC. When two-option RPs dominate, the retailer gives lenient SC/GC option to genuine consumers who have a high valuation for SC/GC, and uses the cash option to decrease the cost or increase the profit from wardrobers who have a low valuation for SC/GC for some ranges of problem parameters. Moreover, when consumers have continuous valuation for SC/GC, two-option RPs dominate single-option RPs in genuine-only consumer markets.

On the basis of this weak order, each alternative profile is represented by an ordinal mean which balances the multisets of ordinal proximity degrees associated with the upper and lower ordinal evaluations.

In the PDPTWMS-H, a fleet of vehicles based at a depot is used to complete a set of requests which consist of transporting items from a pickup location to a delivery location. The vehicles have multiple stacks operated using last-in-first-out (LIFO) loading which requires the vehicle to be rear-loaded and items can only be unloaded if they are closest to the back door. In the PDPTWMS-H, additional handling operations, referred to as rehandling, are allowed and an additional handling time might be incurred when rehandling items (by unloading and reloading items). The problem consists of determining the number of vehicles and the vehicle routes needed to complete the set of requests at minimal cost while respecting the possible handling operations. We model the PDPTWMS-H with a set-partitioning formulation and resort to branch-price-and-cut (BPC) for its solution. To solve the pricing problem, we derive a unified labeling algorithm that is able to cope with the different rehandling possibilities. The labeling algorithm keeps track about the information of on-board items such that symmetries with respect to both stacks and item positions are reduced. Extensive tests are performed on benchmark instances to assess the performance of the proposed BPC methodology and to provide insights on the impact of the rehandling flexibility on solution quality and time.},

Further, we introduce a mean preserving newsvendor model by extending the overconfident newsvendor model to non-negative confidence parameters. For these models we provide simple and intuitive conditions on the operational and behavioral parameters that allow heterogeneity and asymmetry of ordering. We relate the psychological cost parameters of the reference dependent newsvendor model to the confidence parameters of the mean preserving model. Because of heterogeneity in ordering, the descriptive order quantities of an individual are not necessarily compatible with admissible behavioral parameter values of the model under consideration. Therefore, we use an endogenous approach to derive the behavioral parameter values from the descriptive order quantities, if possible. For the reference dependent newsvendor model, this approach enables us to derive constraints of the descriptive order quantities that guarantee admissible and realistic values of the psychological cost parameters. We give managerial interpretations of the analytical findings by a graphical illustration; the two behavioral models cover the whole area of plausible order quantity combinations for the low-profit and high-profit product. We discuss how an executive inventory manager could advice the newsvendor to adapt the behavioral parameters in order to achieve an expected profit target.},

An important pair of questions thus arise: should a retailer that has its own online and offline channels sell through a third-party platform? If so, which selling format should it adopt? This study considers the interaction between offline channel and internet channels (including online channel and third-party platform channel) and establishes a model with a spillover effect that can act in two directions: from offline channel to internet channels (O2I) or from internet channels to offline channel (I2O). We explore three different supply chain structures/scenarios: a dual-channel structure (D); a triple-channel structure: reselling format (MR); and a triple-channel structure: agency selling format (MA). Using a game-theoretic model, we investigate whether the retailer should use a third-party platform and its selling format preference, and further explore the impact of the direction of the spillover effect. Our theoretical analysis shows that when the channel competition is moderate, the region in which the retailer uses the third-party platform first increases and then decreases as the spillover effect increases. Given a reasonable agency fee, when the channel competition is medium, the retailer is more likely to prefer MR as the O2I spillover effect increases, but to prefer MA as the I2O spillover effect increases. We also find that two Pareto zones exist, that is, the retailer and third-party platform prefer the same selling format in some cases, either MR or MA.},

  abstract     = {We consider the design of a robust procurement mechanism for an assembler who must procure multiple complementary components under limited information regarding the unit production costs of the potential suppliers. We abandon the standard assumption that there exists a common prior distribution for the suppliers’ costs and we employ the max-min criterion in which we design a mechanism to maximize the assembler’s worst-case expected profit when only the means of the suppliers’ costs are known. We formulate this problem using a linear semi-infinite programming model and we apply a primal-dual approach to reduce the problem to a single joint optimization model. We characterize the optimal procurement mechanism (payments and ordering quantities) under the assumption of balanced ordering and uncertain end-customer demand. We use these results to compare the performance of component production, under which the components are sourced from separate suppliers, and integrated production, under which the components are sourced from the same supplier. We find that component production is preferred when the production costs of the components are heterogeneous. We also propose two heuristic mechanisms which are easier to compute and implement in practice, particularly when the number of components is large. Finally, we extend our analysis to the case in which the average and variance of the suppliers’ costs are known.},

  abstract     = {Progress in digitalization opens opportunities to capture accurate transportation logistics data and provide advanced decision support, which leads into the question of how to efficiently exploit this progress in order to improve solution quality in transportation services. Here we address this issue in the context of a dynamic and stochastic patient transportation problem, where besides considering new events, we also incorporate stochastic information about future events. We propose different anticipatory algorithms and investigate which algorithm performs best according to the given settings in a real-world application. We therefore address different types of dynamic events, appropriate response times, and the synchronization of real-world data with the plan. In order to test and analyze how the algorithms behave and perform, we apply the concept of a digital twin. The implemented anticipatory algorithms compared here are a sample scenario planning approach and two waiting strategies. The question of the value of more sophisticated algorithms compared to algorithms with less computational effort is investigated. The experimental results show that solution quality benefits from incorporating information about future requests, and that simple waiting strategies prove most suitable for such a highly dynamic environment. We find that in highly stochastic environments, a rescheduling should be done whenever a new event occurs, whereas in less stochastic environments it is better to let the optimization engine run a bit longer and not start reoptimization after every new event.},

This research studies the performance of four channel designs: (i) ship-from-store, (ii) ship-from-warehouse, (iii) ship-from-store-and-warehouse, and (iv) ship-from-warehouse with backhauling from the store inventory to the warehouse. Our focus is on omnichannel retailers who carry a single product category. A profit maximizing mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) is presented to determine the optimal locations and capacities of omnichannel warehouses, and the product flows from suppliers to warehouses, warehouses to the stores, and warehouses and stores to online markets. The online demand earned by the firm in each market is determined endogenously in the model as a function of the shipping time (distance) and the level of competition in the online market. Different warehouse capacities capture economies-of-scale in operating costs. To cover a wide range of different products, computational results are presented for five product categories, each considered separately, with widely differing cost characteristics. Results show that the ship-from-warehouse design generates greater profit than ship-from store for four product categories. However, the ship-from-store-and-warehouse design is better than both of the more restrictive ship-from-store or ship-from-warehouse designs, with the advantage growing as the percentage of online demand increases. Results also document increasing benefits from optimizing the number, locations and capacities of omnichannel warehouses as the demand increases. The magnitude of the profit advantage of different omnichannel designs is shown to depend strongly on the product category and percentage of demand that is online.},

  abstract     = {In supply chain (SC) systems, channel coordination can be achieved by incentive alignment contracts. The contracting mechanisms reported in the literature are usually “short-term-based” and the respective decisions are assumed to be static. However, real world supply chains (SCs) operate in the long term and decisions may evolve when time passes. As a result, this paper analytically explores the instability of the short-term coordination strategies and examines the evolutionary behaviors of SC members towards SC coordination. Moreover, it incorporates the effects of SC members’ evolutionary strategy adoption into profit surplus distribution among them. To be specific, an evolutionary game theory-based model, namely the “ profit surplus distribution (PSD) mechanism for supply chain coordination ”, is proposed to investigate how long-term behaviors of SC members will affect the coordination decisions (i.e., choosing to collaborate) and their share of coordination profit surplus. Based on a real case in consumer electronics, we analytically investigate a two-level SC consisting of a retailer investing in sales-effort and a population of manufacturers investing in innovation effort. Using the evolutionary game theory, we examine the relationship between the evolutionary strategies of SC members towards channel coordination and the profit surplus distribution among them. The results reveal that the coordination strategy is preferred by a great percentage of manufacturers in the long term and their share of coordination profit surplus plays a critical role in affecting their evolutionary preference (and vice versa).},

It is a business model that might be environmentally superior to conventional selling. Servitization promises accessibility to the product’s functionality, pooling of consumer use, and potentially products of better design. However, it can also inflate consumption and result in a bigger environmental impact overall. In this paper, we compare servitization with traditional selling for a monopolist durable goods manufacturer from both an economic and environmental perspective. In this comparison, we define the durability of a product as the use capacity; that is, how many usages it can endure before reaching end of life. We study the firm’s durability decision, followed by the price/fee decision, and the consequent usage in the market under each model. We find that servitization produces durability levels that are robust to customer heterogeneity, and higher than selling. Overall, environmental superiority of servitization hinges on product related costs, customer heterogeneity, and market composition. It is, however, robust to varying environmental factors in the use and manufacturing phases. When we compare environmental preferability with the economic incentives of the firm, we observe that they are not always aligned.},

The analysis here first considers the characteristics of a good crowd-sourced value then turns to an empirical analysis which applies those characteristics and their implications to assess the quality of the commonly used crowd-sourced values from Transfermarkt. Our empirical results show systematic influences from some obvious factors indicating that the crowd-sourced transfer fees are biased as predictors of the true market determined fees. The findings are useful because they address the question of whether these values can reasonably be used as proxies for unknown salary in academic research. Additionally, because Transfermarkt values are often used in negotiations between clubs and players, it is useful to both parties to know the accuracy and the bias of the crowd-sourced values.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the practical import free-flow program that aims to expedite the container retrieval process, we conceptualize a new container stacking strategy, termed Smart Stacking (SS) strategy. The SS strategy aims to create relocation-free stacks (smart stacks) by utilizing customer information. The Storage Location Assignment Problem (SLAP) under the SS strategy is addressed. The problem is to determine the smart customers/containers, and the number and locations of smart stacks, when assigning a batch of import containers to a yard block at an automated container terminal to minimize the total retrieval time. Two variants of SLAP are investigated under the non-split policy and the split policy, depending on whether the containers from the same customer are allowed to be split between smart stacks and non-smart stacks. For the non-split variant, a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is formulated first. By analyzing the properties of the optimal solution, an improved formulation with enhanced computational performance is then proposed. Based on the structure of the model, a divide-and-conquer heuristic is designed to solve the non-split variant more efficiently. For the split variant, a MIP model under the optimal partitions of the non-split model is developed. We theoretically prove that the split variant yields better results than the non-split variant. Extensive experiments are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of smart stacking. It is found that customer information and yard utilization rate have a significant influence on the effectiveness of smart stacking.},

Motivated by modern crowdsourced truck logistics platforms, we introduce the online crowdsourced truck delivery (OCTD) problem and reformulate it as the online bipartite hyper-matching problem. We then explore the possibility of accommodating historical information to design efficient online algorithms to serve online orders. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work on incorporating historical information to solve the online bipartite hyper-matching problem. Depending on whether orders can be partially served, we investigate two practical situations, i.e. separable and inseparable cases. For the inseparable case, we propose a randomized online algorithm, named Hyper-Matching , whose competitive ratio is a non-decreasing function of the amount of historical information. For the separable case, we modify Hyper-Matching to present another randomized online algorithm, named Separable-Hyper-Matching . It is worth noting that the competitive ratios of Hyper-Matching and Separable-Hyper-Matching either beat or match the current best online algorithms when no historical information is considered. We then present four computationally efficient heuristic algorithms, including a greedy variant and a batch-processing variant for each of the inseparable and separable cases. We perform a sequence of experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets, with an emphasis on the influence that historical information has on algorithm performance. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms and particularly the positive influence of historical information on our algorithms.},

This research investigates how a manufacturer facing free riders should decide on channel differentiation strategy, i.e., selling homogeneous or differentiated products through his own online channel and via an independent retailer. We consider horizontal differentiation across channels and identify the optimal strategy. In addition, we develop an agent-based model with vertical and horizontal differentiation to derive managerial insights for more complex situations. We have analytically found: (1) consumers are more likely to engage in free riding when faced with differentiated products than homogeneous products, as the price gap across channels is larger under the former scenario; (2) the manufacturer should offer differentiated products if the free rider&#39;s online factor is high. Similarly, if the retailer&#39;s service cost is low (high), and online (offline) shopping cost is low, differentiated products should be offered. (3) Under different conditions, offering homogeneous or differentiated products could respectively be a win-win strategy for the manufacturer and the retailer. (4) The proposed channel differentiation strategies remain robust to the horizontal differentiation decision and integration of the retail channel. Through agent-based computational experiments, we derive several insights. Namely, (1) if consumers are highly heterogeneous, the manufacturer should horizontally differentiate products across channels; (2) the manufacturer should narrow the vertical differentiation between the two products in dual channels; and (3) the manufacturer should differentiate products if consumers are familiar with the products.},

Both manufactured and remanufactured products are used to meet the stochastic demand of the retailer. We incorporate the price of the product in the demand through an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) pricing process, realizing a market demand that evolves according to a non-standard ARMA(1,1) process. For this demand model, we employ the order-up-to inventory policy with a minimum mean square error forecasting scheme and measure the bullwhip effect at each echelon of the supply chain. We investigate the behaviour of the bullwhip effect analytically, and a numerical evaluation shows that the bullwhip effect or the anti-bullwhip effect may occur at each echelon depending on the values of the autoregressive and moving average parameters of the underlying demand process. We also investigate the effects of the remanufacturing yield, the variance of the market shock on price, and the lead times on the bullwhip effect.},

Because of the interaction of time-dependent activity durations and resource consumptions, scheduling policies based on starting each activity in the sequence as early as possible may fail due to unnecessarily high resource consumptions exceeding the limited availability of the resource. We propose a dynamic discretization discovery algorithm that generates a partially time-expanded network during the search. We propose an acceleration technique allowing to significantly reduce the computational effort if the approach is embedded in an iterative solution procedure that frequently evaluates activity sequences which start with the same activities. Furthermore, we extend our approach to the case where resources can be replenished between subsequent activities. We evaluate our approach as a route evaluation method for the case of routing a fleet of electric vehicles in which travel durations and the energy consumed when travelling from one location to another depend on the time of the day.},

  abstract     = {We consider the Pareto-scheduling of two competing agents on a single machine, in which the jobs of each agent have their “own equal processing times” (shortly, OEPT). In the literature, two special versions of the OEPT model, in which the jobs have either unit or equal processing times, have been well studied, where the criteria are given by various regular objective functions without including the late work criteria. However, for equal processing times, the exact complexity of three problems is still unaddressed. Two-agent scheduling related to late work criteria is also a hot topic in recent years. This inspires our research by also including the total (weighted) late work as criteria. We show that, for equal processing times, all the problems are binary NP-hard if the criterion of one agent is the total tardiness or the total late work and the criterion of the other agent is either the total tardiness or the total late work or the weighted number of tardy jobs or the total weighted completion time. As a result, complexity classification for equal processing times is completely addressed. We further show that all the problems under the OEPT model are either polynomially solvable or ordinary NP-hard, which results in a complete complexity classification for the OEPT model.},

  abstract     = {Electrification of bus fleets in most cities is expected to rise due to its significant environmental benefits. However, electric buses have limited driving range and long recharging times. Additionally, electric buses require special charging infrastructure, which overall makes them less flexible than conventional diesel buses. Due to the limitations of the electric bus technologies, further adjustments have to be made to the current bus transport planning problems. The scheduling of electric vehicles is recognized as a fast-growing area of research. In this paper, we review 43 articles related to the electric bus technologies and give an overview of the different problems in the electric bus planning process ( strategic, tactical and operational ). The different problems are: 1) investment of electric bus fleet and charging infrastructure, 2) placement of charging infrastructure, 3) the electric vehicle scheduling problem (E-VSP) and 4) the charging scheduling problem. Given a set of timetabled trips and recharging stations, the E-VSP is concerned with finding a vehicle schedule that covers the trips and satisfies the driving range and recharging requirements of electric buses while minimizing operational cost. A detailed literature review of the constraints associated with the E-VSP and the solution approaches proposed to solve it is given. Rescheduling aspects or considerations of robustness for scheduling of electric vehicles is identified as a future area of research. Furthermore, integrated electric bus planning is considered as a crucial area of research and integrated approaches could further improve the efficiency of electric bus transport systems.},

Furthermore, the opaqueness of these models may hide unknown biases that may lead to unfair lending decisions. In this study, we show that banks do not have to sacrifice prediction accuracy at the cost of model transparency to be compliant with regulatory requirements. We illustrate this by showing that the predictions of credit losses given by a black-box model can be easily explained in terms of their inputs. Because black-box models are better at uncovering complex patterns in the data, banks should consider the determinants of credit losses suggested by these models in lending decisions and pricing of credit exposures.},

  abstract     = {Optimal power flows play a key role in power system operation planning. While most papers in the literature focus on attaining optima, sequencing paths of optimal control adjustments that lead the system from an initial operating point towards the optimum remain scarcely accounted for. Thus, this work proposes a practical framework based upon power system steady-state analysis for sequencing strictly feasible paths of optimal control adjustments determined by the Optimal Reactive Dispatch (ORD) via Lagrange multiplier sensitivity analysis. The proposed framework is methodologically founded on the reformulation of the ORD in terms of optimal control adjustments rather than optimal control values, successive Newton’s power flow calculations to assure a strictly feasible path from the initial operating point towards the optimum, and successive resolutions of the reformulated ORD’s associated dual problem to determine Lagrange multipliers along such sequence path. Thus, pondering optimal control adjustments by their respective Lagrange multipliers indicates which control action must be realised. Numerical results for IEEE test-systems with up to 300 buses with an increased number of controllable variables are obtained to validate and illustrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed framework.},

In this paper, we argue that regulators should focus more on simple equity requirements instead of elaborating complex rules. Such a constraint in equity is however opposed by the banking industry because of its presumed adverse impact on banks’ performance. Using various techniques (Lasso, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, Artificial Neural Network) on a large dataset of banks’ balance sheet variables, we show that the equity ratio (equity over total assets) has a clear positive effect on banks’ performance when measured by the return on assets, while the impact of this ratio on the return on equity is most of the time negative. Strong equity requirements do not therefore impede banks’ performance, but do reduce the shareholder value. This may be the reason why the banking industry so fiercely opposes strong equity requirements. In addition, from a methodological perspective, we provide evidence that Random Forest performs better than other techniques at dealing with banks’ balance sheet data. Doing so, we provide avenues for future research dealing with these kind of data.},

  abstract     = {Airline schedules are frequently disrupted by unexpected events such as poor weather conditions, aircraft mechanical failures, airport congestions and crew absences, resulting in tremendous costs to airlines and passengers in addition to those originally planned. The Aircraft Recovery Problem (ARP) is usually solved to help airlines repair disrupted schedules by properly rescheduling their flights and rerouting the aircraft such that the total recovery cost is minimized while a set of operational and maintenance constraints are satisfied. When the flight retiming is allowed in a recovery solution, we can copy a flight by shifting its scheduled time and include the copies in the ARP model to determine either the original flight or one of its copies is to be flown by an aircraft. Many previous studies generate flight copies in some arbitrary manner and the quality of each copy is not assessed. In this paper, we propose a copy evaluation method and develop a solution approach to the ARP by incorporating the method within an iterative process of copy generation and filtration. The approach relies on repeatedly solving the ARP linear programming relaxation defined on time-space networks with respect to each aircraft and evaluating the copies to be added into the networks based on the solution obtained. The goal is to produce a limited number of copies but enough to help reduce recovery cost. Through computational experiments using real airline data, we demonstrate that our approach is able to provide promising recovery solutions in reasonable computational time.},

  abstract     = {We propose a mathematical optimization model and its solution for joint chance constrained DC Optimal Power Flow. In this application, it is particularly important that there is a high probability of transmission limits being satisfied, even in the case of uncertain or fluctuating feed-in from renewable energy sources. In critical network situations where the network risks overload, renewable energy feed-in has to be curtailed by the transmission system operator (TSO). The TSO can reduce the feed-in in discrete steps at each network node. The proposed optimization model minimizes curtailment while ensuring that there is a high probability of transmission limits being maintained. The latter is modeled via (joint) chance constraints that are computationally challenging. Thus, we propose a solution approach based on the robust safe approximation of these constraints. Hereby, probabilistic constraints are replaced by robust constraints with suitably defined uncertainty sets constructed from historical data. The ability to discretely control the power feed-in then leads to a robust optimization problem with decision-dependent uncertainties, i.e. the uncertainty sets depend on decision variables. We propose an equivalent mixed-integer linear reformulation for box uncertainties with the exact linearization of bilinear terms. Finally, we present numerical results for different test cases from the Nesta archive, as well as for a real network. We consider the discrete curtailment of solar feed-in, for which we use real-world weather and network data. The experimental tests demonstrate the effectiveness of this method and run times are very fast. Moreover, on average the calculated robust solutions only lead to a small increase in curtailment, when compared to nominal solutions.},

  abstract     = {Immunization is widely recognized as one of the most successful and cost-effective health interventions, preventing two to three million deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases each year. Although progress has been made in recent years, substantial operational challenges persist in resource-limited settings with frequent stock-outs contributing to sub-optimal immunization coverage and inequality in vaccine access. In this paper, we investigate the role of rainy season induced supply chain disruptions on vaccination coverage and inequalities. We develop a modeling framework combining spatial modeling—to predict flood disruptions in road networks—and a discrete-event simulation of a multi-tiered vaccine supply chain (VSC). Our models are fitted using data from the Malagasy VSC network and validated to the best extent possible with scarce data. Our baseline simulation predicts the national vaccination coverage with good accuracy and suggests that 67\% of regions with low reported immunization coverage are affected by rainy season disruptions or operational inefficiencies, causing significant geographical inequalities in vaccine access. We investigate various mitigation strategies to increase the resiliency of VSCs and find that, by strategically placing buffer inventory at targeted facilities prior to the rainy season, the proportion of children receiving all basic vaccines in these areas is increased by 8\% and the geographical inequality in vaccination coverage between areas affected and not affected by the rainy season is reduced by 11\%. By also increasing the replenishment frequency from every third month to every month, the national vaccination coverage improves by 41\%. Our results contribute to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by providing actionable insights for improving vaccination coverage (SDG 3) and investigating the resiliency of the VSC to increased flooding due to climate change (SDG 13).},

More specifically, to store and consolidate knowledge, a concept falling space is first employed as a basic knowledge memory mechanism in C3S. Then, we design a new concept-cognitive process by means of simulating human learning processes, which can incorporate new information into the old knowledge. Finally, a strategy of constructing two different concept spaces is considered in our system when faced with the scenario of a partially labeled dynamic data. Although there exist significant differences between C3S and the conventional incremental learning methods in the learning paradigm, our proposed C3S still performs strong performance for dynamic classification in comparison with several state-of-the-art incremental learning approaches. In addition, the experiments on various datasets have demonstrated that our system can obtain a good performance on the partially labeled data and labeled data simultaneously in dynamic environments.},

In conventional metafrontier analyzes, either radial or nonradial DEA models are used in two separate DEA efficiency analyzes. The results of a metafrontier analysis may be biased if this approach is adopted in a nonradial DEA model. One possible problem is that the value of the technology gap ratio is greater than one because the technology gaps to be estimated for decision-making units (DMUs) under different technology groups relative to the metatechnology have no connection between group frontiers and metafrontiers. Furthermore, the direction of projection of each DMU onto the metafrontier is totally independent of the direction to the efficiency frontier of the respective group frontier. Our proposed integration of group technology and metatechnology constraints into a union model offers a possible solution to the existing metafrontier problem and provides more robust metafrontier results regardless of whether radial or nonradial DEA models are used. Four numerical examples and one empirical application are demonstrated, and the results appear to support the use of our proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing (AM) suggests promising manufacturing technologies, which complement traditional manufacturing in multiple areas, such as biomedical, aerospace, defense, and automotive industries. This paper addresses the production planning problem in multi-machine AM systems. We consider all relevant physical and technological parameters of the machines and the produced parts, for using direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) technology. In DMLS technology, each machine produces jobs, where each job consists of several parts arranged horizontally on the build tray. Starting a new job requires a setup operation. We address the simultaneous assignment of parts to jobs and jobs to the machines, while considering the cost and makespan objectives. A unified mixed-integer linear-programming (MILP) formulation that can minimize the above objectives separately and simultaneously is suggested, along with analytical bounds and valid inequalities. Experimentation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed formulation with single objectives versus similar formulations from the literature. An efficient frontier approach is applied to the multi-objective problem while generating a diverse set of exact non-dominated solutions. The trade-off between the objectives is analyzed via experimentation. Results show that when identical machines are used, the trade-off is relatively small, and hence the decision-maker can use any of the single objectives. However, when non-identical machines are used, it is important to consider both objectives simultaneously. Moreover, the trade-off increases with the number of machines and heterogeneity of the system, with respect to the size and settings of the machines.},

  abstract     = {Unlike consumer goods industry, a high-tech manufacturer (OEM) often amortizes new product development costs over multiple generations, where demand for each generation is based on advance orders (i.e., known demand) and additional uncertain demand. Also, due to economic regulatory reasons, high-tech OEMs usually source from a single supplier. Relative to the high retail price, the costs for a supplier of producing high-tech components are low. Consequently, incentives are misaligned: the OEM faces relatively high under-stock costs and the supplier faces high over-stock costs. In this paper, we examine supply contracts that are intended to align the incentives between a high-tech OEM and a supplier so that the supplier will invest adequate and yet non-verifiable capacity to meet the OEM’s demand. When focusing on a single generation, the manufacturer can coordinate a decentralized supply chain and extract all surplus by augmenting a traditional wholesale price contract with a “contingent penalty” should the supplier fail to fulfill the OEM’s demand. When the resulting penalty is too high to be enforceable, we consider a new class of “contingent renewal” wholesale price contracts with a stipulation: the OEM will renew the contract with the incumbent supplier for the next generation only when the supplier can fulfill the demand for the current generation. By using non-renewal as an implicit penalty, we show that the contingent renewal contract can coordinate the supply chain. While the OEM can capture the bulk of the supply chain profit, this innovative contract cannot enable the OEM to extract the entire surplus.},

  abstract     = {Guarantee credit financing (GCF), allows banks to offer loans to capital-constrained retailer (he) based on the guarantee contracts offered by the manufacturer (she). Therefore, this study investigates the signaling role of guarantee contracts when the retailer is less informed about its product&#39;s market potential. In particular, we explore a joint contract of guarantee credit and production quantity to deliver the manufacturer&#39;s demand information. We add a framework to the capital-constrained supply chain with asymmetric demand information under GCF. Using a signaling game to capture the demand information asymmetry, we identify the strategic interaction between the retailer and the manufacturer under GCF. Also, we investigate the value of GCF when both GCF and trade credit financing (TCF) are viable. We find that the single guarantee contracts cannot signal the manufacturer&#39;s demand information when the production cost is less than a threshold, otherwise, only the separating equilibria survive the intuitive criterion. Besides, the findings reveal that the demand information asymmetry can either benefit or harm the retailer or the manufacturer, but cannot benefit both of them. In addition, GCF remains an attractive financing option when both GCF and TCF are viable. A joint contract of guarantee credit and production quantity can be used to deliver the demand information if the guarantee contracts are invalid. Our paper helps to explain the impact of asymmetric demand information on supply chain partners’ decisions under GCF and sheds light on the design and use of guarantee contracts.},

  abstract     = {Forecast combinations have been widely applied in the last few decades to improve forecasting. Estimating optimal weights that can outperform simple averages is not always an easy task. In recent years, the idea of using time series features for forecast combinations has flourished. Although this idea has been proved to be beneficial in several forecasting competitions, it may not be practical in many situations. For example, the task of selecting appropriate features to build forecasting models is often challenging. Even if there was an acceptable way to define the features, existing features are estimated based on the historical patterns, which are likely to change in the future. Other times, the estimation of the features is infeasible due to limited historical data. In this work, we suggest a change of focus from the historical data to the produced forecasts to extract features. We use out-of-sample forecasts to obtain weights for forecast combinations by amplifying the diversity of the pool of methods being combined. A rich set of time series is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results show that our diversity-based forecast combination framework not only simplifies the modeling process but also achieves superior forecasting performance in terms of both point forecasts and prediction intervals. The value of our proposition lies on its simplicity, transparency, and computational efficiency, elements that are important from both an optimization and a decision analysis perspective.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a solution approach to the joint assortment and inventory planning problem for vertically differentiated products considering dynamic consumer-driven substitution. The demand for each product and the stockout-based substitution rates are derived from a consumer’s utility function and a random market size. We propose a two-step integral solution approach, which uses the substitution characteristic of vertically differentiated products. In a first step, the approach determines the initial purchasing probabilities of all potential products and the substitution rate matrices for all possible product-availability combinations. In a second step, the inventory levels are determined by iteratively solving a sequence of two-product problems. We prove that an optimal assortment only contains products whose critical ratios are decreasing with increasing quality levels. We further compare the proposed approach with the exact results obtained by complete enumeration and find that in almost all instances, the optimality gap is below 0.5\%. Numerical experiments reveal that an increasing demand uncertainty leads to first deeper assortments and second a shift of inventory towards lower-quality products. We also compare the proposed integral approach with a sequential assortment and inventory planning approach that first optimizes the assortment only considering assortment-based substitution and subsequently, determines the optimal inventory levels constrained on this assortment. We show that a joint assortment and inventory planning considering stockout-based substitution is particularly essential when both the profit margin and demand uncertainty is high. Moreover, we provide an extension considering shelf-space constraints.},

Unlike most of the literature on the newsvendor problem, we assume that price-dependent demand arrives randomly according to a stochastic arrival process whose rate depends on the fluctuating market input price process. The retailer’s problem is to choose the order quantity and a proportional price markup over the input price to maximize the expected profit. This setting is mostly encountered by retailers that trade in different currencies or have to purchase and convert commodities for seasonal sales. For this setting, we characterize both the optimal inventory and markup levels. We present monotonicity properties of the expected profit function with respect to each decision variable. We also show that more volatile input price processes lead to lower expected profits.},

Job scheduling of furnaces needs to meet the daily production targets while adhering to job due dates and process constraints. The furnace scheduling problem belongs to a special class of flexible job-shop scheduling with complicated constraints including but not limited to batch processing, reentrance, and time-windows. This problem is NP-hard. The extremely large solution space prevents any straightforward application of optimization techniques. In this paper, several properties are identified to reduce the solution space based on a dynamic programming formulation. With the help of these properties, an efficient algorithm has been developed to find a good solution to this problem. The developed method has been implemented in practical production lines. Compared with existing methods, the developed algorithm gives a higher throughput rate and improves the scheduling efficiency.},

We investigate the assortment, space and inventory problem for an omni-channel retailer operating with interconnected bricks-and-mortar stores and an online shop. For this problem it becomes essential to consider customers’ demand interactions across channels. Current literature mainly focuses on single-channel assortments and ignores cross-channel substitution. We contribute the first integrated omni-channel model that determines assortments for the online and bricks-and-mortar channel with stochastic, space-elastic and out-of-assortment and out-of-stock demand both for in-channel substitution and cross-channel substitution. A specialized heuristic is developed that is based on an iterative solution of a binary problem and demand updates. Our approach achieves near-optimal results for small instances and higher objective values as an alternative heuristic for larger instances. With the full integration of channels, omni-channel retailers can realize a profit increase that mainly depends on the magnitude of substitution rates. We further show numerically that in-channel substitution has a stronger impact on profits than cross-channel substitution when costs are equal across channels.},

Inspired by real-world problems that large cargo companies face for their delivery decisions, we introduce a new facet to the classical vehicle routing problem by considering the welfare of all three stakeholders of the problem: an environmentally conscious company, the drivers, and the indistinguishable customers, as our setting assumes that all customers belong to the same delivery class. Thus, the proposed problem consists of three objective functions. The first one is to minimize the total fuel consumption and emission to represent the companies’ main economic and environmental concerns. The second one is to maximize total welfare of the drivers through a function that encourages equitable payment across drivers while encouraging low total driver cost and the third one is to maximize total welfare of the customers through a function that encourages fairness in terms of delivery times. The last two objectives are measured using slots for tour lengths and delivery times. We implement an efficient solution approach based on the ϵ ϵ -constraint scalarization to find the nondominated solutions of our triobjective optimization problem and present computational analysis that provide insights on the trade-off between the objectives. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of the suggested framework under the customer anonymity assumption to help decision makers make effective plans that all parties involved would give consent to.},

  abstract     = {A primary challenge in goods distribution using Electric Commercial Vehicles (ECVs) pertains to tackling their limited driving range. This paper proposes a multi-faceted approach towards increasing the driving range of ECVs by coordinating the options of: (i) intra-route recharging at an intermediate Recharging Station (RS), with (ii) synchronised en-route battery swapping services performed by Battery Swapping Vans (BSVs) at a pre-planned rendezvous time and space. We introduce and solve a variant corresponding to an Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows, RSs and Synchronised Mobile Battery Swapping (EVRPTW-RS-SMBS). In the proposed model, route planning is carried out synchronously for two interdependent fleets, i.e., ECVs and BSVs, which work in tandem to complete the delivery tasks. To address methodological complications arising from the simultaneous consideration of intra-route recharging at RSs and the synchronised battery swapping on-the-fly, the paper develops a pre-optimisation procedure based on a Non-Dominated Path Identification (NDPI) algorithm that is used in deriving a significantly strengthened path-based formulation of the problem, and an efficient dynamic programming based heuristic algorithm. To gain practical insights on the economic and environmental added value and viability of the proposed logistics model, we compare different scenarios for goods distribution using ECVs in urban and regional levels in London and Southeast England, respectively. A set of numerical experiments are further performed to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms. Our results indicate significant cost and emissions savings and an opportunity for going beyond last mile local deliveries using ECVs with the proposed logistics model.},

For the PBS system, among many intricate scheduling problems studied, the minimization of total number of item-moves when retrieving a single item with multiple escorts is an essential building block for its operation. To tackle this problem, we propose a hybrid approach that combines state appraisal, neighborhood search, and beam search. Our numerical experiments on a large number of benchmark instances show that, compared with the results of these instances provided by the best existing heuristic with computational complexity of O ( n 4 ) O(n4) , our algorithm with different computational complexity settings can improve the overall average solution accuracy from 1.096\% to 0.055\% by its setting of O ( n 3 ) O(n3) , or to 0.570\% by its setting of O ( n ) O(n) , where n n is the size of the PBS system. For PBS systems that are more in line with the actual storage density, our algorithm shows stronger robustness by improving the accuracy from 1.086\% to 0.026\% by its setting of O ( n 3 ) O(n3) , or to 0.249\% by its setting of O ( n ) O(n) . The significant improvement in efficiency and accuracy of our algorithm for this basic problem makes its industrial applications in PBS systems promising.},

That is, the launch of the supplier’s online channel can result in costly signaling behavior for the retailer, where the retailer must increase the retail margin to signal the true demand forecast, which may hurt both chain members. Consequently, the supplier chooses to encroach when the retailer shares information, while may choose not to encroach when the retailer does not share information in order to avoid costly signaling behavior by the retailer. Complementing the conventional understanding, the retailer may share information to encourage the supplier to encroach if the information accuracy of the demand forecast or the direct selling cost of the supplier is small or if both the information accuracy of the demand forecast and the direct selling cost of the supplier are large, while prefers to keep the information private to prevent the supplier’s intention to establish a direct channel otherwise.

In addition, we consider two types of supply: (i) a regular supply that follows an ( S , s ) (S,s) policy with stochastic lead times under a lost-sales assumption and (ii) an additional emergency supply that brings the inventory up to level 0 0&amp;lt;Se≤S when stockout. We assume that such an emergency supply has a negligible lead time but incurs an extra cost. Hence, we analyze four models that are each adequate for a different demand-supply pattern. Our cost structure includes variable and fixed costs for each type of order, together with holding and lost-sales costs. By integrating a multidimensional martingale technique and hitting-time transforms for fluid models and MAPs, we derive explicit formulas for the cost components that aim to minimize the expected discounted total cost. A numerical study provides insights into the best parameters and how they depend on different factors. For example, we show that the MAP-type arrivals yield higher control values; increasing the lead time (average and variance) and the lost cost increases these values, and eventually leads to the ( S , s = S − 1 ) (S,s=S−1) policy. We further show that increasing the discount factor decreases s s and the fluid models are less sensitive to the timing. By comparing the models, we provide managers with a framework for assessing when dual sourcing is more beneficial than single sourcing.},

  abstract     = {Many disasters that have happened in the last decades, including the latest COVID-19 pandemic, have caused a shortage of healthcare resources and change in healthcare operations. Given these impacts, the Operational Research (OR) community has applied various approaches to improve the emergency medical responses. Coordination of healthcare facilities is one of the emergency medical response strategies to ensure the continued provision of medical services during disasters. Although the existing literature reviews of OR approaches have included the perspective of healthcare management, they focused mostly on the application of OR in disaster operations and logistics management. The importance of coordination in healthcare systems during disasters is well recognised in the literature, but to the best of our knowledge there has been no review of the published research in this area. This study provides a focused literature review of the OR contributions in the coordination in healthcare systems during disasters. Definitions of the terms in use in this field are provided. An overall descriptive statistics of the reviewed articles is given, followed by the review of the presented research problems, disaster types, and developed methodologies. The main characteristics of models for the coordination in the healthcare system are described. Measures of coordination effectiveness that denote healthcare resilience are discussed. Based on our findings, we suggest future research directions in the context of existing models extension, and application and development of other methodologies with the aim to provide a solid basis for OR research in the healthcare disaster management.},

  abstract     = {Many engineering products have more than one failure mode and the evolution of each mode can be monitored by measuring a performance characteristic (PC). It is found that the underlying multi-dimensional degradation often occurs with inherent process stochasticity and heterogeneity across units, as well as dependency among PCs. To accommodate these features, in this paper, we propose a novel multivariate degradation model based on the inverse Gaussian process. The model incorporates random effects that are subject to a multivariate normal distribution to capture both the unit-wise variability and the PC-wise dependence. Built upon this structure, we obtain some mathematically tractable properties such as the joint and conditional distribution functions, which subsequently facilitate the future degradation prediction and lifetime estimation. An expectation-maximization algorithm is developed to infer the model parameters along with the validation tools for model checking. In addition, two simulation studies are performed to assess the performance of the inference method and to evaluate the effect of model misspecification. Finally, the application of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by two illustrative examples.},

First, we use time series-based optimization approaches (i.e., a single-unit commitment model) to determine, validate and parametrize exponential Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) revenues as a state variable for the real options model in a biogas plant flexibilization case study. Second, from a theoretical perspective, our findings suggest that for specific revenue processes (i.e., exponential OU processes) the well-known option-driven incentive to wait acts alongside a new uncertainty-driven intrinsic investment incentive. Hence, higher uncertainty may lead to earlier investment. Third, we show how the results influence managerial decision making in practice and can be used to shape the design of an optimal renewable support scheme.},

As shown in Brigo et al. (Brigo, Liu, Pallavicini, and Sloth (2016b), Brigo, Francischello, and Pallavicini (2016a)), this leads to a more articulate variety of Value Adjustments (XVA) that introduce some nonlinear features. When exploiting a reduced-form approach for the default times, the adjusted price can be characterized as the solution to a possibly nonlinear Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (BSDE). The expectation representing the solution of the BSDE is usually quite hard to compute even in a Markovian setting, and one might resort either to the discretization of the Partial Differential Equation characterizing it or to Monte Carlo Simulations. Both choices are computationally quite expensive, In this paper, we suggest an alternative method based on an appropriate change of numéraire and a Taylor polynomial expansion when intensities are represented by affine processes correlated with the asset price. The numerical discussion at the end of this work shows that, at least in the case of the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) intensity model, even the simple first-order approximation has a remarkable computational efficiency.},

Our analysis of the optimal intervention problem extends well-established targeting results to the economic network setting, which requires additional theoretical steps. We prove several results about optimal intervention: it is NP-hard and cannot be approximated to a constant factor in polynomial time. In turn, we show that randomizing failure thresholds leads to a version of the problem which is monotone submodular, for which existing powerful approximations in polynomial time can be applied. In addition to optimal intervention, we also show practical consequences of our analysis to other economic network problems: (1) it is computationally hard to calculate expected values in the economic network, and (2) influence maximization algorithms can enable efficient importance sampling and stress testing of large failure scenarios. We illustrate our results on a network of firms connected through input-output linkages inferred from the World Input Output Database.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces the multiphase course timetabling problem and presents mathematical formulations and effective solution algorithms to solve it in a real case study. Consider a pool of lessons and a number of students who are required to take a subset of these lessons to graduate. Each lesson consists of a predetermined and consecutive sequence of phases with possibly different resource requirements and duration. Students who take a lesson must be present in certain phases of the lesson. Similarly, resources that are allocated to the lesson must be present in certain phases of the lesson depending on their roles. The objective is to maximize the weighted sum of student-lesson allocations subject to some capacity, availability and prerequisite constraints. The problem is formulated as an integer linear program called the session-index formulation. The formulation is then extended by introducing various side constraints that capture business requirements of a pilot training program. An enhanced branch-and-check algorithm is proposed to solve the problem more efficiently. Large instances of the problem are solved by utilizing an effective fix-and-optimize matheuristic. Results of a computational study on a set of real-world instances of the problem demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed exact and matheuristic algorithms. Due to the novelty and complexity of the problem, the efficacy of the proposed methodology to solve its real-world instances, and the implementation and realization of these contributions within a decision support system, this work was recognized as a semi-finalist of INFORMS Franz Edelman Award (2021).},

The TD-IRP extends the routing component of the IRP by making the travelling time between two locations no longer constant but depending on the departure time. In order to investigate the relevance of considering time-dependent travelling time functions, a set of new benchmark instances based on real-data is assumed. Numerical experiments show that optimising with time-dependent travelling times is cost-efficient, but computationally challenging. Thus, we propose a matheuristic that decomposes the problem, based on the observation of the structure of optimal TD-IRP solutions. The proposed matheuristic defines the set of clients to visit and the quantity to deliver for each period first and solves the routing problem second. Numerical experiments prove it to be very efficient and yield solutions with small gaps to the best lower bounds found. Because it separates the routing problem, the proposed matheuristic opens the possibility to solve the TD-IRP very efficiently by taking advantage of the rich literature on time-dependent routing problems.},

Our results reveal that: (1) both policies are effective in scaling up production volume and economic performance, but loan guarantee policy is ineffective in boosting green investment; (2) the downside risk the bank bears under the loan guarantee policy is not less than that under an interest subsidy policy, due to limited intervention from government; (3) it is optimal for the government to intervene in the manufacturer&#39;s financing activity when the environmental value is above a certain level. Further, we demonstrate that whether loan guarantee policy outperforms interest subsidy depends on consumers’ green awareness, green investment efficiency, environmental value, as well as bank&#39;s attitude toward risk. Finally, we test the robustness of our findings by extending the base models to other scenarios and find that the main results still hold in these extensions.},

To investigate the problem, we develop a game-theoretic model describing a supply chain organized by one manufacturer and one retailer. Intuitively, if there is a bargaining opportunity, a retailer is better off bargaining over the wholesale price rather than simply accepting the price determined by the manufacturer. Consistent with this intuition, we first show the benchmark outcome that the retailer achieves a higher profit through bargaining over the price when the manufacturer uses only a single-channel supply chain, in which the manufacturer sells only through the retailer. Conversely, however, we demonstrate that this intuitive result can be completely reversed in a dual-channel supply chain environment, in which the manufacturer is able to sell products not only through the retailer but also directly to end-consumers. Specifically, we find that if a retailer&#39;s bargaining power is sufficiently strong and if consumers&#39; substitutability between channels is substantially high, full acceptance of the wholesale price dictated by the manufacturer earns the retailer a higher profit than bargaining. This counterintuitive result is a warning to retailers in dual-channel environments because if a retailer does not accept the wholesale price dictated by a manufacturer, but heedlessly exploits its strong power and bargains with the manufacturer, it may ultimately harm itself and reduce its own profits.},

We propose using cost-function-based prediction markets as means of sharing demand forecasts. We consider a decentralized two-stage supply chain with a supplier who sells to a retailer, in which both partners receive demand forecast updates. In the first stage, the supplier and the retailer agree on a collaborative forecasting scheme to form a consensus forecast. We consider two schemes: collaborative forecasting using cost-function-based prediction markets in which partners pay a set-up cost to operate a prediction market, and direct collaborative forecasting in which partners directly share their forecasts with each other and resolve their forecast differences through costly actions. In the second stage, we analyze the game between the supplier and the retailer to determine the retailer’s optimal order quantity as well as the supplier’s optimal wholesale price. We show that demand forecast sharing using cost-function-based prediction markets results in a Pareto improvement of the partners’ profit over the alternative of directly sharing forecasts. Furthermore, we show that this Pareto improvement is monotone with respect to supply chain partners’ forecast accuracy. We conduct an extensive numerical study to provide further insights into the effect of the return on forecast sharing investment, forecast accuracy, and level of demand uncertainty on the benefits gained by implementing cost-function-based prediction markets.},

This process can be viewed as the cumulative effect of various possible causes, including (apparent) product flaws and breakage. This category of waste, in contrast to products that are removed based on reaching their best before or use-by date, are also having little potential for redistribtion, and may thus be most targeted in future waste reduction legislative initiatives. We develop some relatively easy to calculate measures to help a retailer with identifying the financial implications of waste production in relation to some supply source characteristics, the financial motivation of its supplier to tackle item deterioration at the retailer level, and how this is affected by the level of logistics collaboration. We also discuss how the model can help in deriving the relative benefit of technological, logistical, supplier selection, and marketing strategies available to the retailer to meet future legislative waste reduction targets, and derive conclusions with respect to the design of legislative instruments.},

  abstract     = {Cities, retailers, and delivery services are trying to find more environmental friendly solutions for last mile delivery. One very promising and partly used option are cargo bicycles. A critical factor of cargo bicycles is their travel speed, which depends on the mass of the load and the gradient of the chosen streets. Therefore, we define load-dependent travel speed and introduce the vehicle routing problem with load-dependent travel times (VRPLTT). We introduce a mixed-integer programming formulation and show the benefits of considering load-dependent travel times in last mile delivery with cargo bicycles. To efficiently solve larger instances, we develop an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS). For the numerical study, we introduce a new set of instances and show that the travel time can be reduced by 4.5\% on average and up to 22\% compared to the vehicle routing problem with time windows. Moreover, ignoring the load-dependent travel times can lead to the underestimation of travel time in such a way that time windows are violated.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a Cumulative Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Routing Problem (CUAVRP) approach to optimize Humanitarian Coverage Path Planning (HCPP). Coverage path planning consists of finding the route which covers every point of a certain area of interest. This paper considers a Search &amp; Rescue mission, using a homogeneous fleet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In this scenario, the objective is to minimize the sum of arrival times at all points of the area of interest, thus, completing the search with minimum latency. The HCPP problem is transformed into a Vehicle Routing Problem by using an approximate cellular decomposition technique to discretize the area into a grid, where the rectangles represent the UAV sensor’s field of view. The center points of the formed rectangles, become the nodes used for a UAV routing problem. This approach uses the objective of minimizing the sum of arrival times at customers, found in the Cumulative Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CCVRP), adjusted for the Search &amp; Rescue Coverage Path Planning using UAVs. The Min-max objective is also implemented and tested. Three versions of a Parallel Weighted Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure - Variable Neighborhood Decent (GRASP-VND) algorithm is implemented to solve the Cumulative UAV Routing Problem for Humanitarian Coverage Path Planning.},

  abstract     = {Package express companies routinely operate multiple equipment types in their service networks. Nevertheless, the weekly schedule of movements used to transport packages through the network leads to changes in equipment inventory at the facility level, which will hinder their normal operations if it is not carefully taken care of. Traditional rebalancing seeks to move the equipment empty in the most cost efficient way. In contrast, we investigate a substitution-based equipment balancing which has been rarely considered. More specifically, we try to reduce this change, i.e., the equipment imbalance associated with the schedule of movements, by substituting the equipment types initially assigned to movements. Consequently, substantial unnecessary empty repositioning needed to restore balance can be avoided at the end. We conduct complexity analysis of the underlying optimization problems, i.e., finding the minimum imbalance of the network and minimizing the number of substitutions required to achieve the minimum network imbalance. In addition, we develop integer programming (IP) models and propose an efficient two-phase decomposition heuristic for solution. Furthermore, we perform a computational study using real-world instances to analyze the performance of the IP solution approach and assess the benefits of substitution-based equipment balancing.},

  abstract     = {A Robotic Mobile Fulfillment System (RMFS) is an automated parts-to-picker material handling system, in which robots carry pods with products to the order pickers. It is particularly suitable for e-commerce order fulfillment and can quickly and frequently reallocate workers and robots across the picking and replenishment processes to respond to strong demand fluctuations. More resources for the picking process means lower customer wait times, whereas more resources for the replenishment process means a higher inventory level and product availability. This paper models the RMFS as a queuing network and integrates it within a Markov decision process (MDP), that aims to allocate robots across the pick and replenishment processes during both high and low demand periods, based on the workloads in these processes. We extend existing MDP models with one resource type and one process to an MDP model for two resources types and two processes. The policies derived from the model are compared with benchmark policies from practice. The results show that the length of the peak demand phase and the height of the peak affects the optimal policy choice. In addition, policies that continually reallocate resources based on the workload outperform benchmark policies from practice. Moreover, if the number of robots is limited, continual resource reallocation can reduce costs sharply. The results show that optimal dynamic policies can reduce the cost by up to 52.18\% on average compared to optimal fixed policies.},

  abstract     = {A buyer exposed to a stockout may lose goodwill and be less inclined to select the same supplier in his next procurement. Reversely, an in-stock experience may restore the supplier’s prospect of being selected in the future. What should the supplier’s inventory control policy be in this situation? To address this question, we develop a multiperiod model of a buyer who selects a supplier with a probability that depends on the supplier’s rating. This rating reflects the buyer’s goodwill towards the supplier based on past service, measured in terms of in-stock/out-of-stock incidents, and is updated by the buyer after each service. The supplier’s optimal inventory policy partitions the inventory space in order-up-to and do-not-order intervals for each rating. The optimal decision depends on whether ordering reduces the supplier’s risk of being downgraded enough to offset the increase in her ordering and inventory costs. We derive and evaluate bounds on the optimal policy and expose some of its properties. We obtain conditions for the optimality of basestock policies and show that such policies are optimal if there are only two ratings or if the buyer’s demand is constant. Using our model, we impute the stockout cost in a newsvendor setting. Numerical experiments suggest that (i) the supplier may benefit from holding more inventory in intermediate than in extreme ratings, and from dealing with a buyer who responds less erratically to service, (ii) basestock policies are efficient, and (iii) using an arbitrary stockout cost in the newsvendor setting can significantly hurt profits.},

In this paper, we study the problem of designing the feeder vessel network, transporting containers between a regional hub and the surrounding feeder ports. The problem, as modelled, has many similarities with the split delivery vehicle routing problem, but with additional characteristics such as simultaneous pickups and deliveries and weekly departures. The problem also includes fleet sizing with a heterogeneous fleet and allows demand rejection at a penalty cost. We present a branch-and-price framework to solve the problem, where the subproblem is solved by enumerating vessel routes and subsequently assigning commodities by solving a min-cost flow problem for each commodity. The algorithm is tested on instances with up to 12 ports, which are all solved to optimality. Since the problem is similar to the liner shipping network design problem but without transshipments, we further study selected instances from the LINER-LIB instance suite. The Baltic instance is solved to proven optimality and we find the best known solution to the West Africa instance, significantly improving on what can be found in the literature.},

  abstract     = {A delivery mix that includes delivery from stock and drop-shipping is of interest to many internet retailers. We consider a retailer serving a time- and price-sensitive market with two substitutable products that differ in the guaranteed delivery time and price, an express product (delivered from the stock) and a regular product (drop-shipped). In case of stockout, customers may switch from the express product to the regular product. We study how to differentiate the products in terms of delivery times and prices and how to determine the stock level to maximize the retailer&#39;s expected profit while satisfying service constraints. We solve different variants of the problem and derive insights into the optimal retailer&#39;s strategy. In addition, we study the impact of stockout-based substitution. This paper is the first to investigate time- and price-based differentiation along with inventory decisions for a retailer who relies on a hybrid distribution to satisfy a time- and price-sensitive demand subject to stockout-based substitution. When prices and stock are fixed, in addition to minimum and maximum time differentiations, a medium differentiation strategy may be optimal but depends on the stock level. When only prices are fixed, there exists a price differentiation limit below which a minimum time differentiation is optimal, and above which only the express product should be offered. For the general model, numerical experiments show that a higher stockout-based substitution leads to greater time differentiation (which is consistent with the results of previous models) and more stock. However, this would not impact the price differentiation.},

  abstract     = {In many supply chains, suppliers that provide a key component to retailers in the wholesale market also have their own retail divisions in the retail market and form vertically integrated producers (VIPs) with these divisions. A VIP’s profit comes from two sources: (i) the wholesale profit from supplying the key component to retailers and (ii) the retail profit from its own retail division. In this situation, the VIP’s intra-company discount is often restricted by the arm’s length regulation (ALR) to induce fair competition in the retail market and improve the consumer benefit. However, the ALR may not always result in the desired outcome, especially when the retailers are asymmetric. Thus motivated, we investigate the impact of the ALR on the supply chain profit and the consumer benefit. Our analysis incorporates two types of asymmetry commonly observed among retailers: (i) retailer-specific selling costs and (ii) private information regarding the intra-company discount. Our results have several important implications. First, the ALR improves the supply chain profit only when the rival retailer is more competitive than the VIP’s retailer. Also, the ALR benefits consumers when the rival retailer is more competitive and the competition intensity is low. Second, under information asymmetry, while the rival retailer would not benefit from the VIP’s private information, the VIP’s gain does not always outweigh the rival retailer’s loss. Hence, the total supply chain profit may increase with the ALR. In addition, the consumer surplus can increase under information asymmetry unless the VIP’s intra-company discount is extremely limited.},

  abstract     = {Itinerary planning serves an important purpose for travelers navigating through a public transit network. The uncertainty of travel times within the network must be considered since this uncertainty can lead to delays or missed transfers. If an initial transit service or a transfer between services is missed, then the traveler must have a contingency plan for reaching their destination. However, finding reliable itineraries with contingency plans is computationally challenging. This paper outlines an a priori policy that maximizes the reliability, i.e. the probability of reaching the destination within a travel time budget, while considering the most reliable primary itinerary and backup itineraries in case a transfer is missed. We develop a network search algorithm that finds the most reliable itinerary with backups, which accurately accounts for the uncertainty of travel times and frequency of alternative options in the recommendation. We compare our approach to state-of-the-art contingency research, Dynamic Journeying Under Uncertainty by Häme and Hakula (2013), and show that it more accurately calculates the reliability, is more intuitive to the traveler, and has a faster runtime. Additionally, we highlight the differences in reliability across times of day, travel time budgets, and city regions for a real-world transit network in Göttingen, Germany. This approach offers travelers an easy-to-understand tool for planning reliable public transit travel itineraries.},

  abstract     = {In an observational study, one is given disjoint samples of treatment units and control (untreated) units, and the goal is to compare outcomes between the two samples in order to estimate a treatment effect. A complication is that the treatment and control units often differ on important pre-treatment attributes, and these differences, referred to as covariate imbalance, can bias the estimate. One method to correct for covariate imbalance is to select a subset of the control sample that has minimum imbalance with respect to the treatment sample, and then use this control subset for estimating the treatment effect. While this optimization problem is NP-hard in general, certain special cases can be solved efficiently. Specifically, the variant of this optimization problem with one covariate is easy to solve, the variant with three or more covariates is NP-hard, and the variant with two covariates is solvable in polynomial time. We present several network flow formulations for the problem of minimizing imbalance on two nominal covariates. First, we present a minimum cost network flow formulation for solving the problem with the constraint that the control subset must have the same size as the treatment sample. We then derive an improved maximum flow formulation. For alternate size restrictions on the control subset, we use a proportional imbalance objective which leads to non-integral supplies and demands in the preceding network flow formulations. We then derive an alternate minimum cost network flow formulation that ensures integrality and solves the proportional imbalance problem in polynomial time.},

  abstract     = {We present a fast algorithm to solve nesting problems based on a semi-discrete representation of both the 2D non-convex pieces and the strip. The pieces and the strip are represented by a set of equidistant vertical line segments. The discretization algorithm uses a sweep-line method and applies minimal extensions to the line segments of a piece to ensure that non-overlapping placement of the segments, representing two pieces, cannot cause overlap of the original pieces. We implemented a bottom-left-fill greedy placement procedure, using an optimised ordering of the segments overlap tests. The C++ implementation of our algorithm uses appropriate data structures that allow fast execution. It executes the bottom-left-fill algorithm for typical ESICUP data sets in a few milliseconds, even when rotation of the pieces is considered, and thus provides a suitable ‘building block’ for integration in metaheuristics. Moreover, we show that the algorithm scales well when the number of pieces increases.},

  abstract     = {Innovation-driven entrepreneurship has become a focus for economic development and received increasing attention from policy makers and academics over the last decades. While consensus has been reached that context matters for innovation and entrepreneurship, little evidence and decision support exists for policy makers to effectively shape the environment for growth-oriented companies. We present the entrepreneurial ecosystem concept as a complex systems-based approach to the study of innovation-driven entrepreneurial economies. The concept, in combination with novel data sources, offers new opportunities for research and policy, but also comes with new challenges. The aim of this paper is to take stock of the literature and build bridges for more transdisciplinary research. First, we review emergent trends in ecosystem research and provide a typology of four overarching problems based on current limitations. These problems connect operational research scholars to the context and represent focal points for their contributions. Second, we review the operational research literature and provide an overview of how these problems have been addressed and outline opportunities for future research, both for the specific problems as well as cross-cutting themes. Operational research has been invaluable in supporting decision-makers facing complex problems in several fields. This paper provides a conceptual and methodological agenda to increase its contribution to the study and governance of entrepreneurial ecosystems.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the variance risk premium of project returns and its impacts on the real options to expand and to abandon a project. Variance risk premium measures the hedging costs associated with the time-varying variance of the returns. We find that the variance risk premium increases the real option value to expand and to abandon a project. Hence, the variance premium delays both abandoning and expanding the project. Our setting also enables us to study the multi-stage decisions with real options under the variance risk premium. For example, we consider an abandonment or a re-expansion add-on attached to an expansion project, which is a reminiscence of how our framework facilitates modeling compound real option structures in the presence of the variance risk premium. We present two applications of our models that involve Ford Motor company and battery storage investments for electricity distribution networks. These cases demonstrate how the proposed framework in this paper can be applied to real world decisions, and, moreover, they establish a baseline for how much decisions can be improved when variance risk premium is included in the modeling.},

  abstract     = {Policymakers seeking to promote the diffusion of infrastructure-dependent technologies are often confronted with the “chicken-and-egg” problem: consumers are reluctant to adopt the technology without adequate infrastructure available, and firms are reluctant to invest in infrastructure without a sufficient number of adopters. This chicken-and-egg problem can hinder the diffusion of new technologies and prolong the timeframe over which existing technological systems remain locked-in. In this paper, we formulate a stylized model of technology policy decision-making from the perspective of a policymaker who seeks to stimulate the market penetration of an infrastructure-dependent technology. Our model is a multi-level optimization problem in which a policymaker (first level) maximizes net social benefits by setting the levels of two incentives: a subsidy for a profit-maximizing firm (in equilibrium with two other firms, the second level) to invest in infrastructure that raises the benefit of adoption to consumers, and a direct subsidy for consumers to adopt the technology (third level). Under certain assumptions about functional forms, we solve the full multi-level problem analytically through backward induction and derive closed-form expressions for the policymaker’s optimal subsidy levels. Then, we present a case study on policies to promote battery electric vehicle (BEV) diffusion. Our results reveal three main insights: (1) the optimal policy portfolio often subsidizes charging infrastructure more than BEV purchases, (2) infrastructure and adoption subsidies tend to be substitutes rather than complements, and (3) an increase in the marginal social benefit of BEV adoption shifts the optimal policy away from infrastructure subsidies and toward BEV subsidies.},

In this paper, we study a logical inference problem in a Boolean network to find all such critical genetic alterations in a minimal (parsimonious) way. We propose a bilevel integer programming model to find a single minimal genetic alteration. Using the bilevel integer programming model, we develop a branch and bound algorithm that effectively finds all of the minimal alterations. Through a computational study with eleven Boolean networks from the literature, we show that the proposed algorithm finds solutions much faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms in large data sets.},

The no-good-deal condition provides useful guidance for individuals to choose the insurance-income ratio inside good-deal bounds. The magnitude of the influence of market incompleteness on life insurance demand (measured as the width of good-deal bounds) displays life-cycle patterns that converge over time and are highly sensitive to health status characteristics.},

A broad range of interrelated scheduling and routing operations and various synchronization aspects of heterogeneous vehicles are considered in this regard. A novel bi-objective mixed-integer programming model is presented, where the first objective function aims to minimize the total costs of the relief logistics network, and the second one minimizes the total operation times of vehicles. Moreover, due to extensive empirical and analytical errors, preliminary travel and service times are inexact and unreliable. Hence, a novel two-stage data-driven approach is rendered to predict reliable travel and service times. In the first stage, a new hybrid machine learning model is rendered to predict these times, and in the second stage, the distributionally robust optimization with φ-divergence is employed to surmount the unreliability of predicted times. A real case study is examined to illustrate the validity of the proposed model and solution approach. In addition, several simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solution method in terms of robustness. Finally, the proposed framework can improve the planning by rendering meaningful insights concerning significant parameters&#39; influence over the schedule and routing consequences.},

While this problem has been extensively studied for over-the-road and air travel modes of transportation and researchers have accomplished substantial advancements in improving the accuracy of the related models, we still observe a significant lack of accurate methods for estimating the travel time of freight trains. The planned train schedule is often dramatically affected by the delays that occur in complex networks due to various reasons such as train movement conflicts, resource unavailability, and unforeseen conditions. We develop a novel mixed integer programming model to address this problem. Considering the current train schedule, characteristics of the railroads, availability of resources, operational restrictions, different types of delay, and congestion-related factors, the proposed model obtains the estimated travel time of trains by minimizing the total amount of deviation from the planned timetable. This optimization scheme enables us to impose all business constraints and network restrictions on the model. Our proposed formulation is generic and can be utilized for other railway networks with minor modifications. To evaluate our model, we use the network characteristics and planned trains movement data of Prorail in Netherlands. The model is implemented in Julia and solved with Gurobi solver efficiently which demonstrates the superiority of our approach.},

Using a Stackelberg game model, we analyze the market entry strategy of the retailer and the incentive strategy of the manufacturer, and investigate how the consumer fairness concern affects the firms’ strategies and performances. Our results show that consumer fairness behavior in transactions has a negative effect on the retailer’s profit, and leads the retailer to lower retail prices of both brands. The incentive provided by the manufacturer can alleviate consumers’ fairness concern for the national brand, and under certain conditions, it can effectively discourage the retailer from building her own brand. We further show that our main results still hold when we take into consideration the incentive frequency in the selling period and when consumers are fairness-concerned about the national brand manufacturer.},

In order to study the impact of blockchain technology on competitive retailers’ strategic pricing, we establish a retailer competition model including an initial retailer and an entrant retailer both of whom can decide whether to apply the blockchain technology. We obtain the optimal prices and corresponding profits of the two retailers when applying and not applying blockchain, respectively, and find that consumer privacy concerns decline both retailers’ prices and profits when adopting blockchain technology because consumer privacy concerns lower consumers’ valuations of products, thereby reducing demand. Furthermore, we analyze the two retailers’ equilibrium strategies of the application of blockchain technology, which suggests that it is not always beneficial for retailers to adopt blockchain technology in all situations. Both retailers will apply blockchain only when consumer privacy concerns are lower and information transparency promotion is higher because higher information transparency promotion increases consumers’ willingness to pay, which exceeds the cost of consumers privacy concerns. On the contrary, when consumer privacy concerns are higher and information transparency promotion is lower, neither retailer will apply blockchain technology. Interestingly, when both consumer privacy concerns and information transparency promotion are medium, the initial retailer will apply blockchain technology and the entrant retailer will not because consumers’ higher trust in initial retailer allows the initial retailer can bear higher cost of consumers privacy concerns which is hard to undertake for the new entrant retailer when information transparency promotion is medium.},

Given the catastrophic nature of rail hazmat incidents, every effort should be made to mitigate risk. This study investigates a novel risk mitigation tool, i.e., subsidy, to induce railroad operators to take alternate routes that are away from high-risk portions of the network such as population centers. To this end, a bi-level optimization program is developed that captures both the risk perspective of the leader (i.e., government) and the cost concerns of the follower (i.e., railroad operator). Model complexity necessitated the development of a customized solution technique, and the resulting methodology was used to study problem instances generated on the realistic infrastructure of a railroad operator in Midwest United States. Analyses underscore the significance of using subsidy as a risk mitigation tool and in ensuring a fairer distribution of risk, in demonstrating how significant improvement in risk can be achieved by offering modest subsidy, and in defining the threshold level of the subsidy budget beyond which no improvement should be expected.},

This paper seeks to solve this problem by developing a game-theoretic model describing a dual-channel reverse supply chain consisting of a recycling company and a third-party collector in which the recycling company purchases products not only through a third-party collector, but also directly from consumers online. We derive two major results by solving the model. The first is that first-mover advantage arises, which indicates that each firm constituting a dual-channel reverse supply chain should announce its own recycling price before the other. This first result is notable because it is exactly opposite to conventional wisdom that the second-mover advantage of pricing usually emerges when price competition occurs among firms in a horizontal relationship, which is well known in noncooperative game theory. The second result is that the recycling company can maximize its own profit and consumers&#39; surplus by announcing its recycling price in the online channel before or upon, but not after, determining the transfer price paid to the collector for products collected in the offline channel. Both results can be used as practical decision-making guidelines in dual-recycling channel reverse supply chain management.},

  abstract     = {In complex systems that can be found in semiconductor manufacturing, linear programming production planning models must consider many products with hundreds of production steps to be performed on hundreds of machines. To deal with this complexity and solve problems with flexible lead times in a reasonable CPU time, the new concept of timed route is introduced. In a timed route, each production step of a product is associated with a specific time period. A new formulation relying on timed routes is then proposed. Because the number of feasible timed routes can grow exponentially, a column generation approach is presented. Algorithms to generate relevant timed routes are given, and their complexity analyzed. Computational experiments on industrial data with different lead time profiles, fixed lead times and flexible lead times, show that computational times are very significantly reduced when using our approaches, by 92\% on average and even divided by more than 1,000 in some cases. The advantages of timed routes are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {Delivery of goods into urban areas constitutes an important issue for logistics service providers. One of the most talked-about developments in recent years has been the potential use of unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, for transporting packages, food, medicine, and other goods. Delivery by drones offers new possibilities, but also induces new challenging routing problems. In this paper, we address and extend the so-called Parallel Drone Scheduling Traveling Salesman Problem. Basically, in this problem, deliveries are split between a vehicle and one or several drones. The vehicle performs a classical delivery tour from the depot, while the drones are constrained to perform back and forth trips. The objective is to minimize the completion time. We extend the problem by considering several vehicles. We call it Parallel Drone Scheduling Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem . We propose a hybrid metaheuristic for its solution. The procedure starts by building a giant tour visiting all customers. Then, the giant tour is split in order to determine a set of vehicles tours (each vehicle tour following the order defined by the giant tour) and a set of customers assigned to drones. Thirdly, an improvement step move customers between vehicles or between vehicles and drones. We also propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation and a simple branch-and-cut approach. The proposed approach is validated via an experimental campaign on instances taken from the CVRPLIB 1 library. Computational experiments comparing several variants of the hybrid metaheuristic give some insights on this drone delivery system.},

While this can be done when there are simplistic assortment choices to be made, the optimization process becomes difficult when imposing constraints on the collection of relevant assortments based on insights by store-managers and historically well-performing assortments. We design fast and flexible algorithms based on variations of binary search that find the (approximately) optimal assortment in this difficult regime. In particular, we revisit the problem of large-scale assortment optimization under the multinomial logit choice model without any assumptions on the structure of the feasible assortments. We speed up the comparison steps using advances in similarity search in the field of information retrieval/machine learning. For an arbitrary collection of assortments, our algorithms can find a solution in time that is sub-linear in the number of assortments, and for the simpler case of cardinality constraints - linear in the number of items (existing methods are quadratic or worse). Empirical validations using a real world dataset (in addition to experiments using semi-synthetic data based on the Billion Prices dataset and several retail transaction datasets) show that our algorithms are competitive ( 3 × − 100 × 3×−100× faster) even when the number of items is ∼ 10 5 ∼105 ( 10 × 10× larger instances than previously studied).},

Non-anticipatory family setup times are held at the beginning of each batch, defined by the combination of one setup-time and a sequence of operations from a unique family. Other aspects are also considered in the problem, such as release dates for operations and machines, operation’s sizes, and machine’s eligibility and capacity. We consider item availability to define the completion times of the operations within the batches, to minimize the total weighted completion time of jobs. We developed Iterated Greedy (IG) algorithms combining destroy and repair operators with a Random Variable Neighborhood Descent (RVND) local search procedure, using four neighborhood structures to solve the problem. The best algorithm variant outperforms the current literature methods for the problem, in terms of average deviation for the best solutions and computational times, in a known benchmark set of 72 instances. New upper bounds are also provided for some instances within this set. Besides, computational experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed methods’ performance in a more challenging set of instances introduced in this work. Two IG variants using a greedy repair operator showed superior performance with more than 70\% of the best solutions found uniquely by these variants. Despite the simplicity, the method using the most common destruction and repair operators presented the best results in different evaluated criteria, highlighting its potential and applicability in solving a complex machine scheduling problem.},

However, these factors have not been addressed in the current literature. To fill this gap, we formulate a comprehensive multi-workstation order and rack sequencing problem as a mixed integer programming model that accounts for workload balancing and rack conflicts. To solve the model, we propose an adaptive large neighborhood search method, which builds on a newly developed data-driven heuristic that exploits the structure of the problem and simulated annealing. We show that our proposed approach performs well on both small-scale problem instances with synthetic data and a large-scale real-world dataset supplied by a large e-commerce company.

An iterative heuristic algorithm is introduced, based on the concepts of inverse optimization and neighbourhood search. The procedure alternates between two versions of restricted formulations of the model while inducing promising changes into the service assignments. The approach has proven a high performance for all of the considered real-world instances. Its efficiency rests on its ability to deliver results within a close proximity to those obtained by the exact solver in terms of quality, yet within a significantly smaller amount of time, and to land feasible solutions for the large-sized instances that could not be previously solved.

Then we analyse the problem from an approximation point of view, in which we first show that Johnson’s algorithm, one of the most classical ones in flow shop scheduling, can only achieve the worst performance ratio for the considered problem (although it is an optimal one for makespan minimization). With the motivation of proposing better approximation algorithms, we further design a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS). Finally, we point out that the approximation results also work for the weighted model - if a specific constraint is satisfied.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, an increasing number of competing firms have started to integrate their product attribute development and advertising strategies by targeted advertising of the best-developed attribute of their product. With a focus on such integration and its potential effects, we establish an analytical model in which two competing firms sell multi-attribute products. Each firm can choose which attribute to focus on in its development strategy and which attribute to emphasize in its advertising strategy. By optimizing the development and advertising strategies of these firms, we first verify the integration of these two strategies as each firm advertises only its developed attribute. Second, we find that advertising, according to the firms’ development choices, plays distinctive roles on profit generation: the difference-alleviating or difference-strengthening effect. Therefore, when determined endogenously, the advertising intensities show qualitatively different changing trends: a monotonous curve in the same-attribute-development case but an inverted-U shaped curve in the different-attribute-development case. Third, we find advertising establishes a connection between firms’ attribute development choices, making them depending not only on their own development cost. A smaller difference between the development costs of these firms or a higher advertising efficiency increases the firms’ willingness to develop a same attribute. We also extend our analysis to the flexible quality level of the non-developed attribute, asymmetric substitution degrees between attributes and prices, or the endogenous attribute development levels, and study how the interactions between the product development and advertising are affected. This paper highlights the importance of making development and advertising strategies jointly.},

Such operations can be optimized by solving the Logistics Service Network Design Problem (LSNDP), wherein a logistics service provider seeks to cost-effectively source and fulfill customer demands of products within a multi-echelon distribution network. However, many industrial settings yield instances of the LSNDP that are too large to be solved in reasonable run-times by off-the-shelf optimization solvers. We introduce an exact Benders decomposition algorithm based on partial decompositions that strengthens the master problem with information derived from aggregated subproblem data. More specifically, the proposed Meta Partial Benders Decomposition intelligently switches from one master problem to another by changing both the amount of subproblem information to include in the master as well as how it is aggregated. Through an extensive computational study, we show that the approach outperforms existing benchmark methods and demonstrate the benefits of dynamically refining the master problem in the course of a partial Benders decomposition-based scheme.},

Yet, research on forecasting with sales promotions has focussed specifically on promotional effects and their elevation versus a normal sales period, while generally disregarding adjustments for post-promotional periods. To investigate further into the effects of promotions after their occurrence, we employed an incentivized laboratory experiment focussing specifically on the role of human judgment in sales forecasting after a promotion has occurred. Our study shows that, without guidance, the post-promotional period is considered equal to a normal period in sales numbers. However, a post-promotion dip is commonly observed in reality. We therefore introduced information on the existence of post-promotional dips, in itself (treatment one) or with added average magnitude of such a dip (treatment two). Information provision resulted in increased forecasting accuracy in both treatments, but more so in treatment two. Thus, this study promotes the provision of guiding information. We find that structured support, allows an improvement in judgmental forecasting accuracy after a sales promotion.},

  abstract     = {In the Make-To-Order (MTO) supply chain, for enticing the retailer to choose a shorter delivery lead-time, which improves the manufacturer&#39;s wholesale prices, the manufacturer adopts the Production Time Hedging (PTH) strategy as an incentive. Since the profit of the retailer depends not only on the Quoted Delivery Lead-Time (QDLT) but also on the Realized Delivery Lead-Time (RDLT), effectively hedging production time uncertainty reduces tardy delivery. We build an analytical model to investigate how PTH affects the retailer&#39;s QDLT decision and the supply chain performance. We consider models for four scenarios, namely (I) the centralized model, (II) the Nash model, (III) the manufacturer-led Stackelberg model, and (IV) the retailer-led Stackelberg model. We derive close-form results on the optimal hedging and QDLT decisions. In models II and III, PTH reduces the QDLT under all the conditions. However, in model IV, PTH can only coordinate the retailer when the hedging cost is low, or the holding cost/tardiness penalty is high. Besides, we find that model III is the dominant scenario for both players. Extending model IV to consider the case where the retailer sources from multiple manufacturers, we show that multiple sourcing is the dominant strategy when a manufacturer&#39;s hedging cost is high, or its holding cost/lead-time sensitivity factor is small. From the numerical study, we are interesting to find that the retailer&#39;s profit increases with the manufacturer&#39;s holding cost/lead-time sensitivity factor.},

  abstract     = {Effective traffic sensor systems can collect precise and reliable real-time traffic information to improve the performance of traffic guidance and traffic flow control. In particular, link flow data are among the most intuitive sources of information for reflecting road congestion and can be further used to estimate origin-destination (OD) and path demands. To efficiently obtain link flow information, much effort has been devoted to the network sensor location problem for link flow observability and estimation. The objective of the observability problem is to minimize the number of installed sensors while ensuring full link observability, whereas the objective of the link flow estimation problem is to maximize the information gain or minimize the estimation deviations given a limited number of sensors. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to integrate link flow observability, flow estimation and the impact of prior link flow uncertainty into the sensor location problem. Accordingly, we propose two new models. In detail, we first present a new mixed-integer optimization model to achieve full link flow observability. Since only topological information is used, this is a generalized version of the existing models as well as a basic representation of other models for the flow estimation problem in our study. The second model integrates linear regression into the traffic sensor location problem. The results of this model provide both location selection and estimation methods for the decision maker. Furthermore, to address the problems of data loss and low computational efficiency in large-scale networks, we exploit the concepts of ambiguity sets and linear decision rules in robust optimization to generate a tractable approximate counterpart to the above sample-based link estimation model. Sample information is further integrated into this tractable approximate model to enhance the simulation performance without incurring a loss in computational efficiency. Numerical experiments are conducted for networks of different sizes. The results show significant improvement in surveillance performance, with a significant reduction in the number of required sensors and good estimation performance. Our work also verifies that when the number of samples is small, compared with the sample-based model, our enhanced tractable approximate model has several advantages, including (i) better out-of-sample performance, (ii) a similar noninferred link distribution, (iii) less dependence on sample size, and (iv) lower computation time requirements for large-scale problems.},

  abstract     = {In the past decade, considerable advances have been made in the field of computational intelligence and operations research. However, the majority of these optimisation approaches have been developed for deterministically formulated problems, the parameters of which are often assumed perfectly predictable prior to problem-solving. In practice, this strong assumption unfortunately contradicts the reality of many real-world problems which are subject to different levels of uncertainties. The solutions derived from these deterministic approaches can rapidly deteriorate during execution due to the over-optimisation without explicit consideration of the uncertainties. To address this research gap, a deep reinforcement learning based hyper-heuristic framework is proposed in this paper. The proposed approach enhances the existing hyper-heuristics with a powerful data-driven heuristic selection module in the form of deep reinforcement learning on parameter-controlled low-level heuristics, to substantially improve their handling of uncertainties while optimising across various problems. The performance and practicality of the proposed hyper-heuristic approach have been assessed on two combinatorial optimisation problems: a real-world container terminal truck routing problem with uncertain service times and the well-known online 2D strip packing problem. The experimental results demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing solution methods for these problems. Finally, the increased interpretability of the proposed deep reinforcement learning hyper-heuristic has been exhibited in comparison with the conventional deep reinforcement learning methods.},

  abstract     = {Despite the growing interest on many-objective evolutionary algorithms, studies on combinatorial problems are still rare. In this study, we choose many-objective knapsack problem (MaOKP) as the benchmark and target the challenges imposed by many-objectives in discrete search spaces by investigating several reference set handling approaches and combining several prominent evolutionary strategies in an innovative fashion. Our proposed algorithm uses elitist nondominated sorting and reference set based sorting, however reference points are mapped onto a fixed hyperplane obtained at the beginning of the algorithm. All evolutionary mechanisms are designed in a way to complement the reference set based sorting. Reference point guided path relinking is proposed as the recombination scheme for this purpose. Repair and local improvement procedures are also guided by reference points. Moreover, the reference set co-evolves simultaneously with the solution set, using both cooperative and competitive interactions to balance diversity and convergence, and adapts to the topology of the Pareto front in a self-adaptive parametric way. Numerical experiments display the success of the proposed algorithm compared to state-of-art approaches and yield the best results for MaOKP. The findings are inspiring and encouraging for the use of co-evolutionary reference set based techniques for combinatorial optimization.},

We model the negotiations using cooperative game theory and analyze the Shapley value to resolve such liability problems. We establish three main monotonicity properties of the Shapley value. First, creditors can only benefit from the increase in their claims or of the asset value. Second, the firm can only benefit from the increase of a claim but can end up with more or with less if the asset value increases, depending on the configuration of small and large liabilities. Third, creditors with larger claims benefit more from the increase of the asset value. Even though liability games are constant-sum games and we show that the Shapley value can be calculated directly from a liability problem, we prove that calculating the Shapley payoff to the firm is NP-hard.},

In an empirical calibration, the stable coalition of the complete contract is quite small. An incomplete contract over emission leads to larger stable coalitions which can be further enlarged by a technology transfer within the coalition. An incomplete contract over emissions and R&amp;D investments is the best performer and yields the largest stable coalition up to the grand coalition.

  abstract     = {The delegated portfolio management has been at the core of financial debates, leading to a growing research effort to provide modeling and solution approaches. This class of problems focuses on investors relying upon decentralized affiliates for the specialized selection of investment options. In this paper we propose a novel optimization framework for multi-market portfolio management, where a central headquarter delegates the market-wise portfolio selection to specialized affiliates. Being averse to risk, the headquarter endogenously sets the maximum expected loss (in the form of conditional value at risk) for the affiliates, who respond designing portfolios and retaining portions of the expected investment returns as management fees. In its essence, this problem constitutes a single-leader-multi-follower game, resulting from the decentralized investment design. Starting from a bilevel formulation, our results build on the equivalence with the high point relaxation to provide theoretical insights and numerical solution approaches. We show that the problem is NP-Hard and propose a decomposition procedure and strong valid inequalities, capable of boosting the efficiency of the computational solution, when instances become large. In the same line, optimality bounds exploiting overlooked properties of the conditional value at risk are deduced, to provide almost exact solutions with few seconds of computation. Building on this theoretical development, we conduct computational tests using comprehensive firm-level data from 1999 to 2014 on 7256 U.S. listed enterprises. These tests support the effectiveness of the decomposition procedure, as well as the one of the strong valid inequalities, improving the LP relaxation by up to 99.18\% 99.18\% .},

  abstract     = {This paper examines the implications of credit-based MSPs in a setting that is more general than those examined in the research literature. Our setting entails a market comprising of two types of farmers (with heterogeneous production costs): “myopic” farmers (who make their crop selection and production decisions based on recently observed market prices) and “strategic farmers” (who make their decisions by taking all other farmers’ decisions into consideration). In addition, our setting involves two types of crops: “complementary crops” (e.g., cereals and legumes) or “substitutable crops” (e.g., different varieties of cereals). In our model, each type of farmer can select one type of crop to grow in response to a given MSP. By comparing the equilibrium outcomes, we obtain three new results. First, the strategic farmers “counteract” the decisions of the myopic farmers by producing less of the crop when its MSP is low. Second, when the market is dominated by myopic farmers, credit based MSP is more effective than the traditional procurement-based MSP. Third, a higher surplus can be attained by offering MSPs to complementary crops than substituable crops. Moreover, it is beneficial to offer a higher MSP to a crop that is cheaper to cultivate when the budget availability is high. However, when budget availability is low, it is advantageous to offer MSP to the crop that is costlier to cultivate. Also, we illustrate our analysis based on the Bhavantar-Bhugtan-Yojana policy, which is a variant of the credit-based MSP being implemented in India.},

Matches of these tournaments are usually determined in a myopic round-based way dependent on the results of previous rounds. Together with the hard constraint that no two players meet more than once during the tournament, at some point it might become infeasible to schedule a next round. For tournaments with n n players and match sizes of k ≥ 2 k≥2 players, we prove that we can always guarantee ⌊ n k ( k − 1 ) ⌋ ⌊nk(k−1)⌋ rounds. We show that this bound is tight. This provides a simple polynomial time constant factor approximation algorithm for the social golfer problem. We extend the results to the Oberwolfach problem. We show that a simple greedy approach guarantees at least ⌊ n + 4 6 ⌋ ⌊n+46⌋ rounds for the Oberwolfach problem. This yields a polynomial time 1 3 + ε 13+ε -approximation algorithm for any fixed ε &gt; 0 ε&amp;gt;0 for the Oberwolfach problem.

  abstract     = {We study the dynamic behaviour of a hybrid system where manufacturing and remanufacturing operations occur simultaneously to produce the same serviceable inventory for order fulfilment. Such a hybrid system, commonly found in the photocopier and personal computer industries, has received considerable attention in the literature. However, its dynamic performance and resulting bullwhip effect, under push and pull remanufacturing policies, remain unexplored. Relevant analysis would allow considering the adoption of appropriate control strategies, as some of the governing rules in a push-based environment may break down in pull-driven systems, and vice versa. Using nonlinear control theory and discrete-time simulation, we develop and linearise a nonlinear stylised model, and analytically assess bullwhip performance of push- and pull-controlled hybrid systems. We find the product return rate to be the key influencing factor of the order variance performance of pull-controlled hybrid systems, and thus, to play an important role towards push or pull policy selection. Product demand frequency is another important factor, since order variance has a U-shaped relation to it. Moreover, the product return delay shows a supplementary impact on the system&#39;s dynamics. In particular, the traditional push-controlled hybrid system may be significantly influenced by this factor if the return rate is high. The results highlight the importance of jointly considering ordering structure and product demand characteristics for bullwhip avoidance.},

Furthermore, since the convexity axiom has both an impact on technical and cost efficiency, we pay a particular attention to the effect of nonconvexity on both super-efficiency notions. Apart from a numerical example, we use a secondary data set guaranteeing replication to illustrate these efficiency and super-efficiency concepts. Two empirical conclusions emerge. First, the cost super-efficiency notion ranks differently from the technical super-efficiency concept.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we focus on a two-level production and distribution planning problem in the field of supply chain management, and examine the situations where the leader does not fully know the manufacturing technologies of the follower. In such a situation, the parameters representing the manufacturing technologies cannot be explicitly used to formulate the follower’s production planning problem. To overcome this difficulty, we propose formulations that implicitly express manufacturing technologies by using the input-output data observed from the production activities of the follower, incorporating the idea of data envelopment analysis (DEA). Assuming that the follower has multiple production facilities, we consider two possibilities of the observable input-output data and formulate two corresponding production planning problems; firstly, that only the input-output data aggregated for all the production facilities can be observed collectively, and secondly, that the input-output data for each of the production facilities can be observed separately. To clarify the validity of these DEA approaches, we compare them with the conventional formulation with technological coefficients using a numerical example.},

  abstract     = {After a disaster, often roads are damaged and blocked, hindering accessibility for relief efforts. It is essential to dispatch work teams to restore the blocked roads by clearance or repair operations. With the goal of enabling access between critical locations in the disaster area in shortest time, we propose algorithms that determine the schedule and routes of multiple work teams. We minimize the total latency of reaching the critical locations, where the latency of a location is defined as the time it takes from the start of the operation until its first visit by one of the work teams. Coordination among the teams is needed since some blocked edges might be opened by a certain team and utilized by other teams later on. First, we develop an exact mathematical model that handles the coordination requirement. After observing the intractability of this formulation, we introduce two heuristic methods and a lower bounding procedure. In the first method, we develop a mathematical model based on a novel multi-level network representation that yields solutions with disjoint paths. Given that it does not coordinate the teams, we present a matheuristic based on a cluster-first-route-second approach embedded into a local search algorithm together with an additional coordination step to obtain alternative solutions with higher quality and in a shorter time. We test our heuristics on data sets coming from a real network from the literature (180 instances) and randomly generated ones (640 instances) and observe the superiority of the solutions obtained by incorporation of coordination.},

These problems arise in the field of public transportation systems where autonomous (i.e. driverless) vehicles travel on circular networks. We consider a set of stations arranged in a circle and a set of transportation requests. Each request asks for the transportation of a certain quantity from a pickup station to a delivery station. A fleet of capacitated vehicles is available at the depot. In the first part of the paper we propose a classification scheme for these problems. In the second part, we address the variants in which the vehicles are allowed to move in a single direction of the circle (either clockwise or counterclockwise) and the objective is to minimize the number of tours on the ring while serving all the requests. We provide a complexity analysis for this class of problems. We develop polynomial time algorithms for the variants that are polynomially solvable and proofs of NP-hardness for the variants that are NP-hard. In addition, for the latter, we provide mathematical formulations and perform computational tests that show the effectiveness of these formulations. Finally, we compare optimal solutions with those obtained using a straightforward greedy algorithm.},

In the problem, a single vehicle must fulfill a set of client requests. Each request states that the vehicle must pick up an item at a given location, and later deliver it to another particular location. Inside the vehicle, items are stored in horizontal stacks of limited capacity. The loading and unloading operations of items follow the last-in-first-out policy. Every item is picked up on top of a stack and can only be delivered if it is also on top of its stack. The goal of this problem is to find a vehicle route of minimum cost. We propose a new formulation along with new valid inequalities for the problem. Several of these valid inequalities are lifted versions of inequalities previously proposed in the literature. The branch-and-cut algorithm based on the formulation and the valid inequalities is compared with the state-of-the-art solution methods for the problem. Computational experiments performed on benchmark instances show that the implemented algorithm outperforms all other competing exact algorithms for this problem.},

  abstract     = {Mathematical optimization problems including a time dimension abound. For example, logistics, process optimization and production planning tasks must often be optimized for a range of time periods. Usually, these problems incorporating time structure are very large and cannot be solved to global optimality by modern solvers within a reasonable period of time. Therefore, the so-called rolling-horizon approach is often adopted. This approach aims to solve the problem periodically, including additional information from proximately following periods. In this paper, we first investigate several drawbacks of this approach and develop an algorithm that compensates for these drawbacks both theoretically and practically. As a result, the rolling-horizon decomposition methodology is adjusted to enable large scale optimization problems to be solved efficiently. In addition, we introduce conditions that guarantee the quality of the solutions. We further demonstrate the applicability of the method to a variety of challenging optimization problems. We substantiate the findings with computational studies on the lot-sizing problem in production planning, as well as for large-scale real-world instances of the tail-assignment problem in aircraft management. It proves possible to solve large-scale realistic tail-assignment instances efficiently, leading to solutions that are at most a few percent away from a globally optimal solution.},

The duration of a path is inherently stochastic because of delays and the possibility of overbooking. We study a problem faced by a company that supports shippers with advice for the route selection. The challenge is to find Pareto-optimal solutions regarding the route’s costs and the probability of arriving before a specific deadline. We show how this probability can be calculated in a network with scheduled departure times and the possibility of overbookings. To solve this problem, we give an optimal algorithm, but as its running time becomes too long for larger networks, we also develop a heuristic. The idea of this heuristic is to replace the stochastic variables by deterministic risk measures and solve the resulting deterministic optimization problem. The heuristic produces, in a fraction of the optimal algorithm’s running time, solutions of which the costs are only a few percent higher than the optimal costs.},

  abstract     = {The objective of the paper is to study the integration of revenue management considerations into service network design models targeting the tactical planning of intermodal consolidation-based freight transportation carriers. Revenue management strategies and mechanisms are broadly used within passenger transportation. Although identified as a desirable feature for freight transportation, interest growing within the industry, few contributions have addressed the topic. Moreover, almost none of those target the challenging issue of the interactions between the planning of the carrier’s services and operations, on the one hand, and the revenue-management strategy it could implement, on the other hand. We propose a new scheduled service network design model with resource and revenue management model, which selects the services and schedule to be repeatedly operated over the next season, allocates and routes the main resources supporting the selected services, and routes the demand flows between their respective origins and destinations. The objective of the model is the maximization of the expected net revenue of the carrier when several customer categories, with specific service requirements, as well as several tariff and operation classes are considered. Our interest goes beyond the modeling challenges raised by the problem setting, to exploring the impacts of this new approach on the decision types and on the structure of the service network solutions obtained. The results of extensive experiments, in terms of demand distribution, network topology, fare class and quality-of-service, provide a proof of concept of the proposed modeling framework and its capability for insightful analyses. Experimentation was conducted using an off-the-shelf software to solve the corresponding mixed-integer linear programming formulation for realistically dimensioned barge intermodal transportation instances.},

  abstract     = {Food Loss and Waste (FLW) is a major problem for humanity, with a third of all food grown for human consumption being wasted. While FLW happens at every stage of the food supply chain, in developed economies, 40\% of the wastage happens in households (FAO 2011). The extant literature identifies several factors that drive wastage in households, but scalable interventions to reduce this wastage remain elusive. We contend that the idiosyncratic nature of households’ behavior in regards purchase, consumption, and wastage makes such interventions difficult, and that an analytical model characterizing these behaviors will be helpful for furthering work in this direction. With this goal, we develop an analytical model incorporating factors (parameters) that influence consumption and wastage in households. While our model applies generally to perishable items including dairy products, we focus on Fresh Fruit and Vegetables (FFV) as it constitutes a large fraction of food wasted in households, even as many people consume far less FFV than the amount recommended for a healthy diet. Using numerical experiments for a range of parameter values obtained from the extant literature and from a survey, we identify the parameter combinations that result in larger volumes of wastage. Our findings will be useful for future research focusing on recommendations for reducing wastage and improving intake of FFV in households.},

Additional economies of scale may arise as various items share high joint costs (e.g. the cost of an overseas container shipment) and require coordination of their replenishment policies. The buyer needs to find the joint ordering interval and replenishment policies for each of the individual items to minimize the system-wide ordering and inventory costs while satisfying the quantity restrictions. We focus on the case of constant demand without backlogging. Given a fixed joint reorder interval, we characterize the optimal inventory ordering strategy for each item, which we refer to as Multi-Replenishment (MR) inventory ordering policy, and derive a closed-form expression for the optimal average inventory costs per unit of time. In contrast to the previous literature, the MR inventory ordering policy does not follow the zero-inventory-ordering (ZIO) rule and allows for orders of different sizes over time to optimally accommodate the MOQ restriction. A numerical approach is used to determine the optimal joint reorder interval, and is later extended to account for the presence of empty replenishments. An extensive computational study shows 1) the total inventory and setup cost reduction associated with the MR inventory policies and empty replenishments; 2) the impact of various parameters on cost and policy performance; and 3) the loss associated with discretizing time at different levels of granularity (weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds) to accommodate restrictions in the timing of item deliveries.},

The focus in the literature has been on how to stimulate customers towards advance demand. Predicting how demand will shift can be problematic, however, and backorders may still occur. We focus on how a firm can address backorders under a given advance demand pattern by a mechanism of compensation from which both the firm and the customers will benefit: the firm may offer a discount to customers for accepting later deliveries at a promised delivery date. Delivery postponement offers are made selectively, i.e. in some periods and to some customers only when there is a benefit for the firm to do so. Customers may decline the offer, but then face the probability of a backorder. In each period, the firm has to decide whether to make delivery postponement offers and for how long, and whether to order from its supplier and how much. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process and solve it by backward induction. Numerical examples illustrate the properties of the state-dependent policies obtained for both uncapacitated and capacitated inventory systems. The postponement mechanism in capacitated systems leads to policies that differ from the threshold policy identified as optimal in the literature. Overall, the approach shows promise to improve system performance more efficiently compared to strategies aiming to increase advance demand in the system.},

Such policies include ecological taxes for different types of pollution, subsidies for pollution control, command-and-control policies, as well as hybrid approaches with different possible combinations of policy instruments. Furthermore, our model captures dynamic changes in not only the consumer purchasing behavior, but also the operational costs and environmental pollution, as well as government environmental policies. A series of numerical examples evaluate the impacts of consumer preferences for sustainability and environmental policies on firms’ profitability and their environmental footprint. The results indicate that firms will improve sustainable operations as long as it is financially valuable for them to do so, which mandates governments and firms to educate consumers about sustainability.

In this study, we aim to decide how many of each type of material to procure before and after the disaster considering the budget limitations. For this purpose, we first develop single product models with and without budget constraints using a newsvendor approach. Then, we build a two-stage stochastic model with budget constraint for the two-product case and determine its optimal solution by first solving the second stage problem to allocate the remaining budget among the products after the disaster. Then, we solve the first stage problem using KKT conditions for the resulting constrained nonlinear optimization problem. Finally, we extend our analysis for multiple product cases and propose approximation algorithms utilizing the optimal solutions derived for the single and two-product cases. We provide managerial insights using our results through detailed numerical experiments, and also present a case study with real life data. It is observed that, contrary to expectations, higher quantities need to be purchased before the disaster when there is a limited budget, as compared to the unlimited budget case. When multiple products are considered, it is important to consider the interactions between the products, especially when the budget is moderate.},

  abstract     = {Given the increased purchasing powers in overseas markets and the existence of purchasing agents, international brands may reconsider their entering strategies. In this paper, we use a game-theoretical approach to investigate the strategy of an international brand to carve out a niche in overseas markets with considering of purchasing agents and multinational tax rules. At the beginning, the brand serves the domestic market only, and the purchasing agent acts as a domestic consumer but resells the product to the overseas market. To enter the overseas market, the brand can choose to operate an overseas store itself or sell through a cross-border e-commerce platform, with the existence of the purchasing agents. We derive the optimal strategies for the brand and the impacts of purchasing agents. Our results show that the brand prefers to enter the overseas market once the two overseas strategies are profitable but sticks to domestic market under certain circumstances, which depends on the tax policy and consumers’ valuation discount of buying from an agent. For the optimal overseas strategies of the brand, selling through a platform is more likely to be a profitable option than managing an overseas store. When both overseas strategies are profitable, the brand’s optimal choice depends on tax rules only. Interestingly, the brand does not always have the motivation to drive the purchasing agents out of the overseas market by adjusting retail prices.

We propose a marginal-based distributionally robust optimization framework for integer stochastic optimization with decision-dependent discrete distributions that can be applied for the retrofitting planning application. We show that the resulting model can be formulated as a mixed-integer linear optimization problem. In order to solve the problem, we develop a constraint generation algorithm given the exponentially large number of constraints. Numerical results for the retrofitting planning application show that the proposed algorithm once tailored can solve the problem efficiently.},

Online items are delivered from a warehouse, which also replenishes the stores. When the inventory in a store drops below a certain level, the retailer offers customers a discount for purchasing online. In this way, the retailer can save items for customers who need the item immediately and thus avoid lost sales. For this model, we propose an approximation method for calculating the average inventory costs for one store and one warehouse and an optimization procedure for the case of more stores. Using extensive numerical experiments, we show that the approximations are very close to the performance measured via simulation. Finally, we show that by adopting the discounts policy proposed in this paper, the retailer can reduce its total cost, on average, by 8.5\% compared to the no-discounts policy.},

Based on the concept of budgeted uncertainty, the objective is to obtain a robust scheduling that minimizes the makespan of the restricted worst-case scenario, where only a subset of job processing times will oscillate to their worst-case values. To our knowledge, this is the first work to obtain optimal solutions to this problem, by extending two classical MILP formulations for the deterministic case and combining them with a Column-and-Constraint Generation framework. For this purpose, a dynamic programming algorithm was also developed, allowing the identification of worst-case scenarios in polynomial time. Experiments on a set of literature instances confirm the efficacy of our approach, including a case study that shows little overhead in the expected solution value of obtained robust solutions.},

Then, we present pseudo-polynomial time exact algorithms for the problem along with nontrivial special cases that can be solved in polynomial time.

In this work, we extend the two-dimensional vector packing problem by considering a more realistic cost structure, which is a general function of volumetric weight. The problem is to pack a set of different items into some identical bins without violating weight limits and volume capacities so that the total delivery cost is minimized. We develop an exact approach based on a branch-and-price algorithm and subset-row inequalities for the problem. To efficiently solve the pricing problem in column generation, a label-setting algorithm with an effective label dominance rule and a bounding procedure is presented. A stronger label dominance rule is derived for the case where the cost function is convex. The computational results show that the exact method is effective in solving the various test instances of the problem. If the volumetric weight is not considered, the exact method can be adapted to solve the two-dimensional vector packing problem with piecewise linear cost function and outperformed the existing exact algorithm by computing 27 optimal solutions for previously open instances.},

  abstract     = {Ordering and pricing are two crucial decisions for retailers and are widely studied. We focus on a situation where a retailer uses successive discounts, and we study the joint decision of the order quantity and selling prices. Earlier works often simplify this problem by assuming that demands in the discount periods are deterministic and independent, which is unrealistic. This work proves that there exists a unique optimal order quantity when the demands are stochastic and correlated. In determining the optimal order quantity and regular selling price for the multi-discount problem, earlier studies often assume special price structures, for example, equally spaced discount prices. This study optimises the selling prices and proves that the discount schemes used in earlier multi-discount works are suboptimal. In this study, both hierarchical and joint optimisation methods are derived for when the demand distribution information is known. In the static pricing situation, using small discounts in the beginning and marking down with an accelerating increase rate can benefit the retailer instead of discounting with a constantly increasing rate. Numerical examples show that the performance of the hierarchical method, often used in earlier one-discount models, depends on the profit margin and the demand correlation ratio in a multi-discount situation. Compared with the hierarchical method, the joint optimisation method yields more benefits in profit in both static and dynamic pricing situations when the profit margin is low and demand correlation is high. We also provide a robust optimisation method for the partial-demand-information case in this study. Other insights for managers are also provided.},

A strand of literature in financial markets has attempted to explore this, but the results have been inconclusive: some studies suggest that temperature does not affect financial decisions, whilst others reach contrasting conclusions-some suggesting that higher, and others that lower temperatures, reduce the quality and economic value of financial decisions. We design an empirical experiment to overcome the limitations of previous studies in order to shed new light on the role of temperature in financial decisions. The study employs data from a time-limited market for state-contingent assets, namely an event-driven prediction market. We assess the extent to which prediction market participants’ subjective judgments of event probabilities deviate from the actual probability of the event occurring, as a result of temperature-induced cognitive errors and risk-taking. The results demonstrate that higher temperatures are associated with lower decision quality. We also found that temperature differentially influences the decisions of those with different decision profiles, with the largest influence observed on individuals whose decisions are based on logic, objectivity and skilful cognitive evaluations of alternatives.},

  abstract     = {Tackling uncertainty is becoming increasingly relevant for decision-support across fields due to its critical impact on real-world problems. Uncertainty is often modelled using scenarios, which are combinations of possible outcomes of the uncertain parameters in a problem. Alongside expected value methods, decisions under uncertainty may also be tackled using methods that do not rely on probability distributions and model different decision-maker risk profiles. Scenarios are at the core of these approaches. Therefore, we propose a scenario generation methodology that seizes the structure and concepts of genetic algorithms. This methodology aims to obtain a diverse set of scenarios, evolving a scenario population with a diversity goal. Diversity is here expressed as the difference in the impact that scenarios have on the value of potential solutions to the problem. Moreover, this method does not require a priori knowledge of probability distributions or statistical moments of uncertain parameters, as it is based on their range. We adapt the available code for Biased-Random Key Genetic Algorithms to apply the methodology to a packing problem under demand uncertainty as a proof of concept, also extending its use to a multi-objective setting. We make available these code adaptations to allow the straightforward application of this scenario generation method to other problems. With this, the decision-maker obtains scenarios with a distinct impact on potential solutions, enabling the use of different criteria based on their profile and preferences.},

An old, yet recently revitalized charging infrastructure, currently evaluated on multiple test tracks all around the globe, allows to charge electric trucks while driving. However, installing the charging infrastructure along highways, namely, overhead wiring or road-embedded power lines both accessed by trucks equipped with a movable contact arm, is costly. This paper provides a detailed modeling approach based on continuous variables to minimize the installation costs for electrified highway kilometers while still providing sufficient energy for a given set of representative tours of electric vehicles. We apply our solution approach to show that investment costs can considerably be reduced along a European highway mainline while still allowing electrified transport among most adjacent major cities. Furthermore, we quantify the loss in precision, if instead of our detailed approach a more aggregate model based on discrete decision variables is applied.},

We apply the risk-averse formulation to the surveillance and control of a non-native forest insect, the emerald ash borer (EAB), a wood-boring beetle native to Asia and recently discovered in North America. Spreading across the eastern United States and Canada, EAB has killed millions of ash trees and cost homeowners and local governments billions of dollars. We present a mean-Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), multi-stage, stochastic mixed-integer programming model to optimize a manager’s decisions about surveillance and control of EAB. The objective is to maximize the benefits of healthy ash trees in forests and urban environments under a fixed budget. Combining the risk-neutral objective with a risk measure allows for a trade-off between the weighted expected benefits from ash trees and the expected risks associated with experiencing extremely damaging scenarios. We define scenario dominance cuts (sdc) for the maximization problem and under the decision-dependent uncertainty. We then solve the model using the sdc cutting plane algorithm for varying risk parameters. Computational results demonstrate that scenario dominance cuts significantly improve the solution performance relative to that of CPLEX. Our CVaR risk-averse approach also raises the objective value of the least-benefit scenarios compared to the risk-neutral model. Results show a shift in the optimal strategy from applying less expensive insecticide treatment to more costly tree removal as the manager becomes more risk-averse. We also find that risk-averse managers survey more often to reduce the risk of experiencing adverse outcomes.},

The consumers have heterogeneous intrinsic rating behaviors and preferences. For example, the population may include avid fans who tend to purchase at early stages and over-rate the product. What are the firm’s optimal pricing and marketing strategies in the face of such heterogeneous market? To answer this question, we model the problem as a Stackelberg mean-field game, with the firm acting as leader and the consumers as followers. We determine the conditions under which a Stackelberg equilibrium exists and provide a numerical scheme to compute the optimal prices, marketing activities, aggregate rating, and market share. We provide some numerical examples to illustrate the type of insights that can be obtained with our model. For instance, we show that it is useful to compare the fairness of different rating aggregators, and can anticipate herding behavior triggered by biased raters.},

  abstract     = {In graph-based clustering, a relevant affinity matrix is crucial for good results. Double stochasticity of the affinity matrix has been shown to be an important condition, both in theory and in practice. In this paper, we emphasize idempotency as another key condition. In fact, a theorem from Sinkhorn, R. (1968) allows us to exhibit the bijective relationship between the set of doubly stochastic and idempotent matrices of order n n (modulo permutation of rows and columns) on the one hand, and the set of possible partitions of a set of n n objects on the other hand. Thereby, both properties are necessary and sufficient conditions for properly modeling the clustering or graph partitioning tasks using matrices. Yet, this leads to a NP-hard discrete optimization problem. In this context, our main contribution is the introduction of a new relaxed model that efficiently learns a double stochastic and nearly idempotent affinity matrix for graph-based clustering. Our approach leverages existing properties between doubly stochastic and idempotent matrices on the one hand, and their associated Laplacian matrices on the other hand. The resulting optimization problem is bi-convex and can be addressed by an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers scheme. Furthermore, our model requires less parameters to set in contrast to most of recent works. The experimental results we obtained using several real-world benchmarks, exhibit the interest of our method and the importance of taking into account idempotency in graph-based clustering.},

  abstract     = {Recently, cost-based feature selection has received significant attention due to its great ability to achieve promising prediction accuracy at a minimum feature acquisition cost. To further improve its predictive and economic performances, this research proposes a cost-effective 1-norm support vector machine with group feature selection as GFS-CESVM 1 GFS-CESVM1 . Its robust counterpart model, GFS-RCESVM 1 GFS-RCESVM1 , is also introduced to address the cost uncertainty of features and feature groups because cost variation commonly exists in real-world problems. The proposed models are formulated as Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). To efficiently solve the proposed SVM MILP models, we develop a Branch-Cut-and-Price (BCP) algorithm that considers only a limited number of variables and/or constraints, which thereby leads to rapid convergence to an optimal solution. Various experimental results on benchmark and synthetic datasets demonstrate that GFS-CESVM 1 GFS-CESVM1 can achieve competitive outcomes by considering not only individual feature evaluation but also group structural information among features. The GFS-RCESVM 1 GFS-RCESVM1 can identify the subset of features that is immune to cost uncertainty and therefore provide feasible and optimal solutions. Furthermore, our BCP algorithm can dominantly outperform the ordinary BB algorithm for finding better objective value and integrality gap within a short period of time.},

We assume an agent to have a preference relation over positions in different weighted (directed and undirected) graphs, stating pairwise comparisons between these positions. Ideally, such a preference relation can be expressed by a utility function, where positions are evaluated by their assigned ‘utility’. Extending preference relations over the mixture set containing all lotteries over graph positions, we specify axioms on preferences that allow them to be represented by von Neumann–Morgenstern expected utility functions. For directed graphs, we show that the only vNM expected utility function that satisfies a certain risk neutrality, is the function that assigns to every position in a weighted directed graph the same linear combination of its outdegree and indegree . For undirected graphs, we show that the only vNM expected utility function that satisfies this risk neutrality, is the degree measure that assigns to every position in a weighted graph its degree. In this way, our results provide a utility foundation for degree centrality as a vNM expected utility function. We obtain the results following the utility approach to the Shapley value for cooperative transferable utility games of Roth (1977b), noticing that undirected graphs form a subclass of cooperative games as expressed by Deng and Papadimitriou (1994). For directed graphs, we extend this result to a class of generalized games. Using the relation between cooperative games and networks, we apply our results to some applications in Economics and Operations Research.},

We examine the effectiveness of the prenegotiation preference elicitation on the basis of holistic judgments, supported by a software decision support tool. This approach is based on rank-ordering of examples of complete offers, which is then disaggregated using the Utilités Additives (UTA) method. In a series of studies, we analyse the accuracy of the scoring systems obtained from these approaches, as well as the negotiators’ subjective evaluation of their use and usefulness. The technical capability of the various setups of the UTA-based disaggregation models to produce accurate scoring systems is verified by simulation in Study 1. The empirical applicability of the most promising UTA-based models is studied in two experiments, in which the negotiators used examples of both predefined and self-declared sets of offers (Study 2), or applied an enhanced UTA algorithm (Study 3). The enhanced algorithm used a predefined set of offers, implemented certain elements of DR, and allowed for iterative improvements of the scoring system. The results show that the UTA-based approach works in a technical sense, but empirically its performance is worse than DR unless the set of example offers is predefined. The enhanced algorithm produced a better scoring system, but users&#39; subjective evaluations were mixed.},

To address this question, we train the neural network to choosing Condorcet, Borda, and plurality winners, respectively. Remarkably, our statistical results show that, when trained on a limited (but still reasonably large) sample, the neural network mimics most closely the Borda rule, no matter on which rule it was previously trained. The main overall conclusion is that the necessary training sample size for a neural network varies significantly with the voting rule, and we rank a number of popular voting rules in terms of the sample size required.},

This paper addresses the TBYB retailer’s problem in its operations: the decision regarding how many items to send to a consumer to maximize its expected profit when the products are chosen by a retailer recommendation system. To this end, we develop a stylized model of the retailer’s quantity decision by taking into account the consumer’s purchase decision, which is influenced by the consumer’s budget constraint and the retailer’s recommendation accuracy. We derive the retailer’s optimal quantity decision and discuss how it is determined. We also examine how the retailer’s optimal quantity decision and corresponding profit are influenced by two factors reflecting the TBYB industry: recommendation accuracy and new consumer influx. Regarding recommendation accuracy, our results show that a minimum level of accuracy exists, which acts as an entry barrier to TBYB retail. Once the retailer’s accuracy exceeds the threshold, we show that the relationship between the accuracy and the optimal quantity is characterized as an inverted-U relationship. Regarding the latter, interestingly, we find that an influx of new consumers may hurt the retailer’s profit even when the accuracy applied to them is above the entry barrier.},

The policies are developed to observe certain principles of fairness: if a customer is quoted a longer lead-time, she/he must be charged a lower price and a significant proportion of the deliveries has to be made during the quoted lead times. Although handling non-exponential service times in this setting presents difficulties, our analysis of the proposed policies is exact. Two of the policies operate with static prices, while one of the two dynamic pricing policies also quotes dynamic lead times. By construction of the policies, we show that the dynamic pricing policies are more profitable. Numerical examples bring additional light by showing that in small markets with oversensitive customers, dynamic policies can be profitable while static pricing policies can fail. In a larger market, a simple dynamic policy charging two prices depending on the stock availability can be a reasonable compromise. Dynamic policies tend to suffer less against high production time variability as well.},

To focus on the reneging feature, we study the customer strategic behavior in the simplest such system, that is in the M/M/1 queue with a server alternating between on and off periods. We show that the possibility of reneging has substantial effect on the equilibrium social welfare and throughput. In particular, as the reward from service varies in a given system, it becomes beneficial to activate or deactivate the option of reneging to ensure a higher welfare. Moreover, we show that the effect of the reneging option is particularly significant in the case where the original system with non-strategic customers is unstable.},

While the TCP assumes that the tests&#39; results can be deterministically mapped into classes, in the STCP, the results are mapped to probability distributions over the classes. Moreover, each test and each type of classification error is associated with some cost. A solution of the STCP is a subset of tests and a mapping of their results to classes. The objective is to minimize the weighted sum of the tests&#39; costs and the expected cost of the classification errors. We present an integer linear programming formulation of the problem and solve it using a commercial solver. To solve larger instances, we apply three metaheuristics for the STCP, namely, Tabu Search (TS), Cross-Entropy (CE), and Binary Gravitational Search Algorithm (BGSA). These methods are tested on publicly available datasets and shown to deliver nearly optimal solutions in a fraction of the time required for the exact solution.},

  abstract     = {Adopting unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), also known as drones, into the last-mile-delivery sector and having them work alongside trucks with the aim of improving service quality and reducing the transportation cost gives rise to a new class of Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). In this paper, we introduce a new optimization problem called the min-cost Parallel Drone Scheduling Vehicle Routing Problem (PDSVRP). This problem is a variant of the well-known Parallel Drone Scheduling Traveling Salesman Problem (PDSTSP) recently introduced in the literature in which we allow multiple trucks and consider the objective of minimizing the total transportation costs. We formulate the problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program and then develop a Ruin and Recreate ( R &amp; R R&amp;#x26;R ) algorithm. Exploiting PDSVRP solution characteristics in an effective manner, our heuristic manages to introduce “sufficient” rooms to a solution via new removal operators during the ruin phase. It is expected to enhance the possibilities for improving solutions later in the recreate phase. Multiple experiments on a new set of randomly generated instances confirm the performance of our approach. To explore the benefits of drone delivery as well as the insight into the impact of related factors on the contribution of drones’ use to operational cost, a sensitivity analysis is conducted. We also adapt the proposed algorithm to solve the PDSTSP and validate it via benchmarks available in the literature. It is shown that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of solution quality. Out of 90 considered instances, it finds 26 new best known solutions.},

  abstract     = {We present a unified modeling framework for Time-Based Maintenance (TBM) and Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) for optimization of replacements in multi-component systems. The considered system has a K K -out-of- N N reliability structure, and components deteriorate according to a multivariate gamma process with Lévy copula dependence. The TBM and CBM models are formulated as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), and optimal policies are found using dynamic programming. Solving the CBM model requires that the continuous deterioration process is discretized. We therefore investigate the discretization level required for obtaining a near-optimal policy. Our results indicate that a coarser discretization level than previously suggested in the literature is adequate, indicating that dynamic programming is a feasible approach for optimization in multi-component systems. We further demonstrate this through empirical results for the size limit of the MDP models when solved with an optimized implementation of modified policy iteration. The TBM model can generally be solved with more components than the CBM model, since the former has a sparser state transition structure. In the special case of independent component deterioration, transition probabilities can be calculated efficiently at runtime. This reduces the memory requirements substantially. For this case, we also achieved a tenfold speedup when using ten processors in a parallel implementation of algorithm. Altogether, our results show that the computational requirements for systems with independent component deterioration increase at a slower rate than for systems with stochastic dependence.},

  abstract     = {Today, in the market with ever-changing consumer preferences, three-dimensional (3D) printing is becoming an overwhelming trend. In this paper, we explore the use of 3D printing in mass customization (MC) programs. We consider the case when 3D printing brings extra self-design fun to consumers, which is highlighted in MC practices of the auto company BMW and the furniture company Poltrona Frau, and also changes the cost formula (i.e., the marginal product variety cost) of the MC product. In addition, the roles played by the risk attitudes of the MC manufacturer and consumers, consumer returns, as well as consumers’ time sensitive behaviors, are also uncovered. We find that under the case with a low consumer&#39;s willingness to pay for the traditional “ready-made product variety enjoyment” (RPVE), even the maximized product variety level and the additional self-design fun cannot make the 3D printing based MC more profitable. In addition, compared to the markets with risk-averse and risk-neutral consumers, the 3D printing based MC can increase more MRBs and a higher consumer surplus by simultaneously highlighting the high self-design fun and the high RPVE in a market with risk-seeking consumers. The high flexibility and responsiveness of 3D printing also shows its advantages in remanufacturing the consumer returned MC items and enhancing MC programs’ overall lead-time. Finally, applying 3D printing in creating molds can also help the MC manufacturer tackle demand uncertainties. These findings all provide a good reference to the application of 3D printing in MC operations.},

For this problem, we prove several theoretical results which are used to propose a speed-up procedure. This acceleration mechanism can be applied in any insertion-based method for the problem under study and, consequently, also for their special cases. In addition, we propose four efficient constructive heuristics for the problem, based on both Johnson’s algorithm and the NEH heuristic. These proposals are compared against 47 algorithms existing in the literature for related problems. The results show the excellent performance of the proposals.},

A key factor in the comparison of these procedures is the availability of benchmark datasets that cover a large part of the feature space. Otherwise, one risks that the conclusions from experiments on these sets do not hold when they are repeated on a different set. In this paper we propose new multi-project datasets that contain instances with a wide variety of characteristics. We first develop several new summary measures that describe three types of portfolio characteristics, two of the three types are not present in any of the existing datasets. Second, an algorithm is developed that can generate instances with the desired parameter values in a controlled manner. With this procedure, we create three datasets that each focus on one of the characteristics and a fourth dataset that contains all combinations. The computational results show (a) that these sets cover a significantly larger part of the feature space than existing benchmark libraries and (b) that they are more challenging for advanced algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Surgical activity has a substantial impact in all areas of hospitals. Additionally, social concerns arise related to equity and speed of access. Therefore, operating room management is paramount in modern society. This work studies the master surgery scheduling problem which is the problem of assigning surgical specialties to operating room blocks, which represent a shift of an operating room. For a master surgery schedule to be applicable in practice, multiple considerations must be taken into account. The particular focus of this work is in the integration of downstream units (i.e., wards or the ICU). Although, in a tactical planning scenario, operational bed requirements are unknown, these may be estimated based on historical data. We propose a novel stochastic programming model that captures the uncertainty in the bed requirements, with a recourse function that penalizes the overutilization of beds. A solution approach based on Benders decomposition is developed and results for generated instances mimicking real-life data are presented.},

It adopts a dynamic programming framework, using a hybrid lookahead scheduling policy. The hybrid lookahead scheduling policy makes the one-step optimal decision for heavy aircraft maintenance based on deterministic forecasts and then determines the light maintenance according to stochastic forecasts. The objective is to minimize the total wasted utilization interval between maintenance checks while reducing the need for additional maintenance slots. By achieving this goal, one is also reducing the number of maintenance checks and increasing aircraft availability while respecting airworthiness regulations. We validate the proposed methodology using the fleet maintenance data from a major European airline. The descriptive statistics of several test runs show that, when compared with the current practice, the proposed methodology potentially reduces the number of A-checks by 1.9\%, the number of C-checks by 9.8\%, and the number of additional slots by 78.3\% over four years.},

The definition of distance between elements is customized to specific applications, and the way that the overall diversity of the selected elements is computed results in different mathematical models. Maximizing diversity by means of combinatorial optimization models has gained prominence in Operations Research (OR) over the last two decades, and constitutes nowadays an important area. In this paper, we review the milestones in the development of this area, starting in the late eighties when the first models were proposed, and identify three periods of time. The critical analysis from an OR perspective of the previous developments, permits us to establish the most appropriate models, their connection with practical problems in terms of dispersion and representativeness, and the open problems that are still a challenge. We also revise and extend the library of benchmark instances that has been widely used in heuristic comparisons. Finally, we perform an empirical review and comparison of the best and more recently proposed procedures, to clearly identify the state-of-the art methods for the main diversity models.},

This information is typically aggregated using simple averages, which leads to the well-known shared information problem. A weighted average of the individual judgments based on empirically estimated sophisticated weights is commonly discarded in practice, because the sophisticated weights have large estimation errors. In this paper, I explore mixture weights, which are convex combinations of sophisticated and naïve weights. I show analytically that if the data generation process is stable, there always exists a mixture weight which aggregates judgments better than the naïve weights. I thus offer a path to alleviate the shared information problem. In contrast to other proposed solutions, it does not require any control over the judgment process. I demonstrate the utility of mixture weights in numerical analyses and in two empirical applications. I also offer heuristic selection algorithms for the correct mixture weight and analyze them in my numerical and empirical settings.},

  abstract     = {Peer-to-peer (P2P) insurance is a decentralized network in which participants pool their resources together to compensate those who suffer losses. The rise of P2P insurance in Western countries, such as Friendsurance and Lemonade, has been viewed as a disruption to the traditional insurance industry in the same way Uber is to the taxi industry. A similar business model of mutual aid, such as the model developed by Xianghubao, has become popular in the East. It is a model designed to provide financial support to those in need and to distribute the cost among all participants. Despite the fast-changing landscape in this field, there has been scarce literature on the theoretical underpinning of P2P insurance and mutual aid. This paper presents the first effort to build a unified framework to quantify and assess the exchange of risks in a network of participants from different risk classes. Under this framework, the paper aims to address several essential research questions, including the fair exchange of heterogeneous risks and the optimality of algorithmic designs under various criteria. The modeling of multi-risk exchange is done with a P2P network structure. We show that these network structures not only can be used to explain the current practice in the industry, but also provide new tools to develop better designs. The paper concludes with a comparison of traditional insurance and P2P risk sharing from the standpoint of stability and cost reduction.},

A tie occur when some students have the same score at a programme. If not enough seats are available for the last tied group of applicants at a programme then there are three reasonable policies used in practice: 1) all must be rejected, as in Hungary 2) all can be accepted, as in Chile 3) a lottery decides which students are accepted from this group, as in Ireland. Even though student-optimal stable matchings can be computed efficiently for each of the above three cases, we developed (mixed) integer programming (IP) formulations for solving these problems, and compared the solutions obtained by the three policies for a real instance of the Hungarian application from 2008. In the case of Hungary common quotas arise from the faculty quotas imposed on their programmes and from the national quotas set for state-financed students in each subject. The overlapping structure of common quotas makes the computational problem of finding a stable solution NP-hard, even for strict rankings. In the case of ties and common quotas we propose two reasonable stable solution concepts for the Hungarian and Chilean policies. We developed (mixed) IP formulations for solving these stable matching problems and tested their performance on the large scale real instance from 2008 and also for one from 2009 under two different assumptions. We demonstrate that the most general case is also solvable in practice by IP technique.},

The problem aims to find a set of routes with minimum transportation cost by satisfying the demand of all customers and loading constraints. We propose a column generation-based heuristic algorithm that employs three heuristic algorithms to solve the subproblem and a hybrid algorithm for loading. Computational experiments on the literature instances indicate that the proposed algorithm can produce very near solutions to the literature algorithm&#39;s solutions in significantly shorter running times. This paper introduces real-world instances with 230 to 850 customers, several times larger than the existing benchmarks. The results of the proposed algorithm for real-world instances are effective, and compared to the current situation, it leads to a reduction of 20\% in the average total cost of transportation. Also, the average number of vehicles is reduced by 36\%.},

Based on empirical requirements identified in interviews with the manager of a professional fire department, we suggest a multi-objective mixed-integer linear optimization problem with lexicographically ordered objective functions, which we refer to as spontaneous volunteer coordination problem (SVCP). Acknowledging that disaster situations are unavoidably linked to uncertainty, we consider uncertainty with a sequence of (deterministic) SVCP instances, where each instance depends on the solutions of previous SVCP instances. We conduct comprehensive computational experiments based on real-world data of a flood disaster that the fire department faced. From our computational results, we derive detailed implications for the fire department on how to use our decision support model. We also derive recommendations for all relief organizations which aim at adopting or adapting our model for the coordination of spontaneous volunteers in a broad set of disasters. Our implications include several recommendations for relief organizations in terms of performing extensive computational tests in order to parameterize and instantiate the generic model before its use during the disaster response phase; thereby we also address tasks to be executed during the preparedness phase of a disaster.},

We propose an integrated optimization model to simultaneously plan snow removal for multiple runways and to assign runways and take-off and landing times to aircraft. For this winter runway scheduling problem, we present a time-discrete binary model formulation using clique inequalities and an equivalent constraint programming model. To solve the winter runway scheduling problem optimally, we propose an exact solution methodology. Our start heuristic based on constraint programming generates a feasible initial start solution. We use a column generation scheme, which we initialize with a heuristic solution, to identify all variables of the binary program which are required to solve it optimally. Finally, we apply a branch-and-bound procedure to our resulting binary program. Additionally, we present an enhanced time discretization method to balance model size and solution quality. We apply our algorithm to realistic instances from a large international airport. An analysis of resulting model sizes proves the ability of our approach to significantly reduce the number of required variables and constraints of the time-discrete binary program. We also show that our method computes optimal schedules in a short amount of time and often outperforms a time-continuous formulation as well as a pure constraint programming approach.},

  abstract     = {Topic modeling is a significant branch of natural language processing and machine learning focused on inferring the generative process of text. Traditionally, algorithms for estimating topic models have relied on Bayesian inference and Gibbs sampling. This paper proposes a novel “acceptable set” framework for formulating topic modeling problems inspired by ideas from discrete component analysis and data-driven robust optimization. Our approach not only simplifies the design and inference of topic models, but also allows for extensions and generalizations that are challenging to integrate into traditional approaches. Different restrictions (e.g., sparsity) and assumptions (e.g., alternative generative processes) can be easily incorporated into our formulations through additional or modified constraints. Our formulations also naturally control a widely used metric of solution quality, perplexity. We adapt state-of-the-art stochastic gradient methods to find good local optima for the optimization formulations. The algorithms are efficient, scaling to realistic problem sizes with runtimes comparable to existing methods. Through extensive computational experiments, we show that our methods have improved solution quality compared to baseline methods and reconstruct more reliably the underlying generative models. Our framework overcomes known vulnerabilities of traditional topic modeling algorithms: our methods are effective in low-data settings, register good out-of-sample performance, and perform well for a variety of initial assumptions on input parameter values.},

As an essential element of loyalty programs (LPs), the reward amount invested by the retailer is often linked to retailer&#39;s profit and customer behavior. We consider a retailer who sells a type of product in two periods to strategic customers. The retailer makes inventory ordering and loyalty program investment decisions. Customers decide whether to purchase immediately (in period 1) to receive the product and reward, or to wait for a markdown discount but face the risk of stockout. We have focused on three main questions: (1) How does the loyalty reward investment decision impact strategic customers’ behavior? (2) What are the optimal decisions and profits for the retailer when investing in a loyalty program? (3) What are the factors influencing the reward investment decision? We find that investing in the loyalty program induces more customers to make an early purchase, leading to a higher inventory ordering decision and more profit for the retailer. The benefits from reward investments are significantly affected by the product&#39;s cost and customers’ valuation of the product. Our results shed light on the reward investment decision of LPs. For products with high profit margins and market-determined prices (valuation approximates price), the retailer should invest in a loyalty program to achieve better profits.},

By defining a likelihood for the provided preference information and specifying a prior of the preference model, we apply the Bayesian rule to derive a posterior distribution over a set of all potential value functions, not necessarily compatible ones. This distribution emphasizes the potential differences in the abilities of these models to reconstruct the DM’s pairwise comparisons. Hence a distinctive character of our approach consists of characterizing the uncertainty in consequence of applying indirect preference information. We also employ a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, called the Metropolis-Hastings method, to summarize the posterior distribution of the value function model and quantify the outcomes of robustness analysis in the form of stochastic acceptability indices.

In this study we adopted a pre-test post-test design to analyse whether the intended outcomes of eight facilitated modelling workshops were achieved. We compared the outcomes as experienced by participants of the workshops with observed outcomes. Our results show that cognitive change and consensus forming were achieved. However, experienced and observed cognitive change were not related. For consensus forming, we did find a modest correlation between experienced and observed outcomes.

In our study, we introduce the concept of a weighted aggregation system that consists of two components: (1) a weighting transformation and (2) an aggregation operator, both induced by a common generator function. We provide the necessary and sufficient condition for the form of a generator function-based weighted aggregation system. We show that the weighted quasi-arithmetic means on the non-negative extended real line are none other than the aggregation functions induced by weighted aggregation systems, i.e., these means are compositions of an n n -ary aggregation operator and n n weighting transformations ( n ∈ N n∈N , n ≥ 1 n≥1 ). Next, using weighted quasi-arithmetic means on the unit interval, we introduce a new, expectation level-based weight determination method and a scoring procedure. In this method, the decision-maker’s expectation levels for the input variables are directly transformed into weights by making use of the generator function of a weighted quasi-arithmetic mean. We utilize this mean as a scoring function to evaluate the decision alternatives. Lastly, by the means of illustrative numerical examples, we present a novel decision model, in which the expectation levels can be even intervals, i.e., the weights are also intervals. Finally, we get an interval-valued score for each alternative.},

The specific model is an M/M/c queue in which any customer may be tagged at her arrival time if her queueing time will be above a certain fixed threshold. All tagged customers are then served at a given rate that may differ from the rate used for the non-tagged customers. We show how it is possible to model the virtual queueing time of this queueing system by a specific Markov chain. Then, solving the corresponding balance equations, we give a recursive solution to compute the stationary distribution, which involves a mixture of exponential terms. Using numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the differences in service rates can have a crucial impact on queueing time performance.},

In this paper, we develop the Decision Programming framework which extends the applicability of influence diagrams by developing mixed-integer linear programming formulations for such problems. In particular, Decision Programming makes it possible to (i) solve problems in which earlier decisions cannot necessarily be recalled later, for instance, when decisions are taken by agents who cannot communicate with each other; (ii) accommodate a broad range of deterministic and chance constraints, including those based on resource consumption, logical dependencies or risk measures such as Conditional Value-at-Risk; and (iii) determine all non-dominated decision strategies in problems which multiple value objectives. In project portfolio selection problems, Decision Programming allows scenario probabilities to depend endogenously on project decisions and can thus be viewed as a generalization of Contingent Portfolio Programming (Gustafsson &amp; Salo, 2005). We present several illustrative examples, evidence on the computational performance of Decision Programming formulations, and directions for further development.},

We introduce a class of flexible and measurement-based routing policies called “partition-based random routing” (PBRR) and show that the performance measure of interest can be formulated as a constrained optimization problem with a convex objective function when the system is heavily loaded. This formulation enables us to establish strong theoretical results that are in aid of finding the optimal routing solution; however, in practice, finding this solution requires rather involved numerical calculations. To that end, we propose a surrogate, easy to design and implement, optimization algorithm for finding the desired optimal routing solution.

We first consider the one-period problem where the demands for the two manufacturers’ products are uncertain and independent. The unmet demand of one manufacturer&#39;s product can be met by the other manufacturer&#39;s leftover stock of the same product, if available, and is lost otherwise. The manufacturers compete for the substitute demands by choosing their own purchase/processing quantities. We show the existence of the unique Nash equilibrium processing quantity, and examine the impact of competition by comparing the total equilibrium quantity of the game with that of the centralized-decision case. We then study the multi-period production/inventory competition problem in which the manufacturers make decisions in each period according to the initial inventory levels of the products and the rivals’ decisions. We show the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium strategy and that the equilibrium strategy has the simple base-stock structure. We then consider the case where the manufacturers’ demands are correlated. In addition, studying the case where the manufacturers are capacitated, we show that the unique Nash equilibrium exists and has a modified base-stock structure . We further generalize the results to the infinite-period case and the case with more than two products.

  abstract     = {As supply chains become more complex and multi-tiered, managing corporate social responsibility (CSR) of lower-tier suppliers is more challenging and draws increasing attention. In this paper, we develop a game theory model with a multi-tier supply chain, which consists of a Tier 0 buyer, a direct Tier 1 supplier and an indirect Tier 2 supplier. To reduce the CSR violations of Tier 2 supplier, the Tier 0 buyer can either provide funding to the Tier 1 supplier ( delegation strategy ) or fund the Tier 2 supplier directly ( control strategy ). We theoretically analyze the optimal strategy under two different supply chain leaderships: Tier 1 leads Tier 2 , and Tier 2 leads Tier 1 , and further discuss the impact of supply chain leadership. Unlike empirical studies arguing that delegation is more effective when the Tier 1 leads Tier 2, we find that when the funding factor is uniform among suppliers (exogenous), the control strategy is more likely to ensure a lower violation probability than the delegation strategy. Besides, when the loss of Tier 0 buyer due to violations in Tier 2 is relatively small, the buyer may adopt the strategy with a higher violation probability to maximize his profit. In addition, we also consider information asymmetry between the Tier 0 buyer and Tier 2 supplier, and find that the buyer is more inclined to choose the delegation strategy if he is more uncertain about the Tier 2 supplier. Finally, we explore four model extensions and show that the main results are robust.},

  abstract     = {Container drayage operations with tractor-trailer distinction and trailer reposition exist widely in real-world logistics yet have seldom been reported in the literature. This paper studies a container drayage problem with trailer reposition (CDPTR), in which trailers might be provided at pickup locations and kept at delivery locations. A two-stage solution framework is adopted to solve the problem. The first stage generates tractor schedules to maximize profit, and the second stage aims to ensure sufficient trailers at each trailer depot during the container drayage operation. A hybrid large neighborhood search and tabu search (LNS-TS) heuristic is developed to solve the problem. We construct 72 instances with different characteristics, for example, time window duration, initial trailer resource and distribution, and the number of requests. Results show that our solutions outperform the solutions obtained from the solver. A detailed analysis of the results also reveals several insights for container drayage operators.},

  abstract     = {A binary constraint satisfaction problem (BCSP) consists in determining an assignment of values to variables that is compatible with a set of constraints. The problem is called binary because the constraints involve only pairs of variables. The BCSP is a cornerstone problem in Constraint Programming (CP), appearing in a very wide range of real-world applications. In this work, we develop a new exact algorithm which effectively solves the BCSP by reformulating it as a k k -clique problem on the underlying microstructure graph representation. Our new algorithm exploits the cutting-edge branching scheme of the state-of-the-art maximum clique algorithms combined with two filtering phases in which the domains of the variables are reduced. Our filtering phases are based on colouring techniques and on heuristically solving an associated boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem. In addition, the algorithm initialization phase performs a reordering of the microstructure graph vertices that produces an often easier reformulation to solve. We carry out an extensive computational campaign on a benchmark of almost 2000 instances, encompassing numerous real and synthetic problems from the literature. The performance of the new algorithm is compared against four SAT-based solvers and three general purpose CP solvers. Our tests reveal that the new algorithm significantly outperforms all the others in several classes of BCSP instances.},

We consider the shelf space allocation problem with additional features (e.g., integer facings, rectangular arrangement restrictions) motivated by literature and our interactions with a local bookstore. We determine optimal number of facings of all products in two aspects (width and height of a rectangular arrangement space for each product), and allocate them as contiguous rectangles to maximize profit. We first develop a mixed-integer linear mathematical programming model (MIP) for our problem and propose a solution method based on logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD). Next, we construct an exact 2-stage algorithm (IP1/IP2), inspired by LBBD, which can handle larger and real-world size instances. To compare performances of our methods, we generate 100 test instances inspired by real-world applications and benchmarks from the literature. We observe that IP1/IP2 finds optimal solutions for real-world instances efficiently and can increase the local bookstore’s profit up to 16.56\%. IP1/IP2 can provide optimal solutions for instances with 100 products in minutes and optimally solve up to 250 products (assigned to 8 rows x 160 columns) within a time limit of 1800 s. This exact 2-stage IP1/IP2 solution approach can be effective in solving similar problems such as display problem of webpage design, allocation of product families in grocery stores, and flyer advertising.},

  abstract     = {In the traditional single-machine scheduling problem with uncertain processing time, distributionally robust optimization models are established in situations where the distribution information is not known exactly. One well-studied robust optimization method used in scheduling is the distributionally β β -robust optimization technique. The goal of this technique is to maximize the probability that the total flow time of the job sequence does not exceed the predetermined target level T T . However, it is possible that the excess value of the total flow time beyond the target T T may be incredibly large, and therefore it is necessary to consider the optimized excess value. To address this concern, two new target-based risk measures are introduced. First, target-oriented CVaR, the worst-case conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is used to minimize the excess value beyond T T , which accounts for both the excess probability and the excess value. Second, the essential riskiness index (ERI) is extended to a multi-piecewise linear function for excess value control in single-machine scheduling problems. To obtain a tractable closed-form solutions of the risk measures, the CVaR-based measure is decomposed into an assignment problem and a second-order cone programming problem, and the ERI is converted to its equivalent semi-definite programming and second-order cone counterparts. To efficiently solve the risk measures for single-machine scheduling, a bisection search algorithm and a Benders decomposition algorithm are designed. In the numerical analysis, the excess value and the probability are investigated with respect to two distributions, namely the two-point distribution and the truncated normal distribution. The experiment design also considers different ranges of expectation and variance, tolerance levels, and problem scales. It is discovered that the CVaR and ERI-based methods are always better than the distributionally β β -robust scheduling approach in terms of excess value.},

  abstract     = {We are concerned with the interaction and integration between demand forecasting and inventory control, in the context of supply chain operations. The majority of the literature is fragmented. Forecasting research more often than not assumes forecasting to be an end in itself, disregarding any subsequent stages of computation that are needed to transform forecasts into replenishment decisions. Conversely, most contributions in inventory theory assume that demand (and its parameters) are known, in effect disregarding any preceding stages of computation. Explicit recognition of these shortcomings is an important step towards more realistic theoretical developments, but still not particularly helpful unless they are somehow addressed. Even then, forecasts often constitute exogenous variables that serially feed into a stock control model. Finally, there is a small but growing stream of research that is explicitly built around jointly tackling the inventory forecasting question. We introduce a framework to define four levels of integration: from disregarding, to acknowledging, to partly addressing, to fully understanding the interactions. Focusing on the last two, we conduct a structured review of relevant (integrated) academic contributions in the area of forecasting and inventory control and argue for their classification with regard to integration. We show that the development from one level to another is in many cases chronological in order, but also associated with specific schools of thought. We also argue that although movement from one level to another adds realism, it also adds complexity in terms of actual implementations, and thus a trade-off exists. The article makes a contribution into an area that has always been fragmented despite the importance of bringing the forecasting and inventory communities together to solve problems of common interest. We close with an indicative agenda for further research and a call for more theoretical contributions, but also more work that would help to expand the empirical knowledge base in this area.},

Because of its importance, the operating room scheduling problem has been addressed from many different perspectives since the early 1960s. One of the main difficulties that has reduced the applicability of the current results is the high variability in surgery duration, making schedule recommendations hard to implement. In this work, we propose a time-indexed scheduling formulation to solve the operational problem. Our main contribution is that we propose the use of chance constraints related to the surgery duration’s probability distribution for each surgeon to improve the scheduling performance. We show how to implement these chance constraints as linear ones in our time-indexed formulation, enhancing the performance of the resulting schedules significantly. Through data analysis of real historical instances, we develop specific constraints that improve the schedule, reducing the need for overtime without affecting the utilization significantly. Furthermore, these constraints give the operating room manager the possibility of balancing overtime and utilization through a tuning parameter in our formulation. Finally, through simulations and the use of real instances, we report the performance for four different metrics, showing the importance of using historical data to get the right balance between the utilization and overtime.},

  abstract     = {High-dimensional multivariate systems often lack closed-form solutions and are therefore resolved using simulation. Random Orthogonal Matrix (ROM) simulation is a state-of-the-art method that has gained popularity in this context because certain simulation errors are completely removed (Ledermann, Alexander, and Ledermann, 2011). Specifically, every sample generated with ROM simulation exactly matches a target mean and covariance matrix. A simple extension can also target a scalar measure of skewness or kurtosis. However, targeting non-scalar measures of higher moments is much more complex. The problem of targetting exact Kollo skewness has already been considered, but the algorithm proceeds via time-consuming trial-and-error which can be very slow. Moreover, the algorithm often fails completely. Furthermore, it produces simulations with very long periods of inactivity which are inappropriate for most real-world applications. This paper provides an in-depth theoretical analysis of a much quicker ROM simulation extension which always succeeds to target Kollo skewness exactly. It also derives new results on Kollo skewness in concatenated samples and applies them to produce realistic simulations for many applications, especially those in finance. Our first contribution is to establish necessary and sufficient conditions for Kollo skewness targeting to be possible. Then we introduce two novel methods, one for speeding up the algorithm and another for improving the statistical properties of the simulated data. We illustrate several new theoretical results with some extensive numerical analysis and we apply the algorithm using some real data drawn from two different multivariate systems of financial returns.},

  abstract     = {Concerns regarding the assumptions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis have led to a greater emphasis on how the behaviour of different groups of traders might impact the evolution of financial markets; ideas encapsulated in the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis (AMH). A key assumption of the AMH is that the dynamics of competition and natural selection will drive ‘noise traders’, those least likely to push prices to efficient levels because they follow sub-optimal trading strategies, to exit the market. To test the key assumptions of the AMH, survival analysis is employed to examine the behaviour of retail spread-traders, a group who are widely reported to include many noise traders. Analysis of the trades executed by 5,164 individuals in the period 24th March 2006 to 7th February 2012 found that the least profitable and those who adopted ill-disciplined trading strategies tended to cease trading sooner than others. These findings are consistent with the AMH. However, profitable traders were also found to be more likely to cease trading than the average trader and a V-shaped relationship was found between a trader&#39;s Sharpe ratio and their likelihood of ceasing to trade (cf. the average trader). Furthermore, during the financial crisis of 2008–09, the disposition effect of traders and the proportion of noise traders increased and throughout the period of the study, the ill-discipline of new generations of traders increased. The results suggest that the forces underpinning the AMH are complex and the move towards market efficiency may not be as straightforward as some expect.},

  abstract     = {The growing penetration of stochastic renewable energy sources increases the need for operational flexibility to cope with imbalances. Existing proposals for flexibility procurement are envisioning markets where the transmission system operator (TSO) can access flexible resources located at the distribution system operator (DSO)-level and vice versa, but the coordination between these two entities is a matter of active research. We consider two trading floors, i.e., day-ahead and real-time markets, and propose a method for day-ahead coordination on how to share flexible resources, described as a complementarity model. The proposed coordination approach is to optimize prices and capacity limits at the physical interface of TSO and DSO, the so-called “coordination variables”. For given values of these variables, the DSO pre-qualifies the participation of DSO-level resources in the day-ahead market by capping their quantity bids. This way, the DSO ensures that the constraints of its system, modeled by a conic program, will be respected. Pursuing computational tractability, we decompose the model using a multi-cut Benders’ decomposition approach. It separates the conic modeling of real-time power flows under each scenario from the mixed-integer linear formulation of the day-ahead market-clearing problem. We quantify the potential benefit of the proposed coordination method in terms of improved social welfare. Using an ex-post out-of-sample simulation, the performance of the proposed coordination method is assessed against two benchmarks: ( i ) a fully uncoordinated scheme which obtains a lower bound for the expected social welfare, and ( ii ) an ideal benchmark which co-optimizes the TSO and DSO problems, providing an upper bound for the expected social welfare.},

Compact microwave passives constitute a representative case: reduction of the circuit footprint area is detrimental to electrical figures of merit (e.g., the operating bandwidth). Identification of the best available trade-off designs requires multi-objective optimization (MO). This is a computationally expensive task, especially when executed at the level of full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulation. The computational complexity issue can be mitigated through the employment of surrogate modeling methods, yet their application is limited by a typically high nonlinearity of system responses, and the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, a novel technique for fast MO of compact microwave components is proposed, which allows for sequential rendition of the trade-off designs using triangulation of the already available Pareto front as well as rapid refinement algorithms. Our methodology is purely deterministic; in particular, it does not rely on population-based nature-inspired procedures. The three major benefits are low computational cost, possibility of handling explicit design constraints, and a capability of producing a visually uniform representation of the Pareto front. The algorithm is demonstrated using a compact branch-line coupler and a three-section impedance matching transformer. In both cases, considerable savings are obtained over the benchmark, here, the state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted MO technique.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents exact and approximate methods for constructing daily walking tours for parking enforcement officers the Parking Enforcement Routing Problem (PERP), a problem faced by EMEL, a municipal company that manages parking in Lisbon. Parking Enforcement Officers (PEO) must ensure that the users of the street parking lots pay the corresponding fee, and that they also comply with the parking rules imposed by the legislation in force. The duration of the tours must be compatible with the PEO daily work schedules. A street cannot be supervised more than once in consecutive hours, nor supervised simultaneously by two PEOs. The PERP is a new generalisation of an Arc Routing Problem with profits aiming to maximise the total criticality, a concept defined to represent the need for enforcement of the street segments, related to the number of vehicles parked in transgression. Moreover, parking rules lead to some specificities regarding the underlying network, which needs to be built with additional unusual characteristics. A flow-based mixed integer linear programming model and heuristics which return two daily trips for each PEO are proposed. Computational results carried out on 50 instances based on real data show that it was appropriate to propose both types of methods, exact and heuristic. Furthermore, PEOs working for EMEL reacted positively to the trips corresponding to the generated solutions. A Decision Support System built on the heuristics was also developed to be easily used by practitioners in EMEL.},

  abstract     = {Urban public transportation agencies sometimes have to operate mixing vehicles of different sizes on their routes, due to resource limitations or historical reasons. Services with different passenger-carrying capacities are provided to passengers during a mixed-fleet operation. A fundamental question arising here is how to optimally deploy a given fleet of different bus sizes to provide services that minimize passenger waiting time. We formulate a mixed-fleet vehicle dispatching problem as a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model to optimize dispatching schemes (dispatching orders and times) when a given set of buses of different sizes are available to serve demand along a route. The objective is to minimize the average passenger waiting time under time-dependent demand volumes. Stochastic travel times between stops and vehicle capacity constraints (i.e., introducing extra waiting time due to denied boarding) are explicitly modeled. A Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm coupled with a Monte Carlo simulation framework is developed to solve large real-world instances in the presence of stochastic travel times. Results show that, in addition to dispatching headway, bus dispatching sequence can strongly affect waiting times under a mixed-fleet operation. Indeed, with an optimal dispatching sequence, a more accurate adjustment of supply to demand is possible in accordance with time-dependent demand conditions, and the total savings in waiting time are mainly driven by a further reduction in the number of passengers left behind. The optimality of uneven dispatching headways stems from two elements: having a mixed fleet and having localized peaks on demand that make buses run full.},

We adopt the notion that a solution is robust efficient (RE) if the region that dominates its worst-case realizations of the biobjectives under uncertainty does not contain (all) the worst-case realizations of the biobjectives of any other solution under uncertainty. Our algorithm aims to efficiently find a set of RE solutions through a series of function evaluations or simulations. First, we design surrogate-model guided search mechanisms for the worst-case neighbors of the current iterate. Subsequently, we determine the iteration distance along an effective local move direction, which excludes the worst-case neighbors from the neighborhood of the new iterate. Depending on the practical need for solution diversity, multiple initial solutions can be specified in our algorithm, and the final iterates of these solutions generate a set of RE solutions. The test results of a synthetic biobjective nonconvex optimization problem show the effectiveness of the BORSO method and its superior performance against a sampling-based robust multiobjective optimization solver. Furthermore, when the proposed algorithm is applied to a real-world biobjective traffic signal timing problem, satisfactory solutions can be obtained under a limited computational budget. These results indicate that the proposed BORSO method can solve unconstrained biobjective simulation-based optimization problems under uncertainties.},

The model incorporates a general ‘effectiveness function’ that determines the relationship between the value of an advertising bid at a given time and the number of newly exposed users at that time. We develop closed-form solutions for dynamic budget allocation for several forms of the effectiveness function. We apply the approach to data obtained from a real-life ad campaign and show how a curve fitting regression procedure can estimate the shape and the parameters of the effectiveness function.

  abstract     = {When demand exceeds available inventory, suppliers ration their inventory among customers (e.g., retail channels). While there are quantitative methods to facilitate these choices, in practice, humans play an important role in making final decisions that affect allocation efficiency. How do inventory risk and contractual differences (i.e. payment schemes) behaviorally affect allocation decisions when there is scarcity? We study inventory allocations between two retail channels: a high value channel with risk, and a low value channel without risk. The retail channels may also differ in terms of the timing and type of payments that take place. We develop theoretical predictions from behavioral models based on risk aversion, loss aversion, and mental accounting and test these through incentivized controlled laboratory experiments. When profit differences between channels are medium to large, subjects allocate significantly less inventory than the expected–profit–maximizing quantity to the risky, yet more profitable, channel and subjects with stronger risk appetite allocate larger quantities to the risky channel. More interestingly, risk appetite moderates the effect of the timing and type of payments on allocations in these settings. When profit differences between channels are small, the effect of risk appetite depends on the timing of payments. Overall, the possibility of experiencing negative payments (e.g., through buy–backs) reduces allocated quantities across settings. Our insights can inform planner assignment to tasks but also the design of support systems that provide information to planners who make allocation decisions.},

  abstract     = {Some traffic management measures route drivers towards socially-desired paths in order to achieve the system optimum: the traffic state with minimum total travel time. In previous attempts, the behavioral response to route advice is often not accounted for since some drivers are advised to take significantly longer paths for the system’s benefit. Hence, these drivers may not comply with such advice and the optimal state will not be achieved. In this paper, we propose a social routing strategy to approach the optimal state while accounting for fairness in the resulting state. This routing strategy asks travelers to take a limited detour in order to improve efficiency. We show that the best possible paths (in terms of efficiency) to be proposed by a service adopting this strategy can be found by solving a bilevel optimization problem with a non-unique lower-level solution. We use techniques from parametric analysis to show that the directional derivative of the lower-level link flows however exists. This derivative is the optimal solution of a quadratic optimization problem with a suitable route flow solution as parameter. We use the derivative in a descent algorithm to solve the bilevel problem. Numerical experiments in a realistic environment show that the routing strategy only asks a small fraction of the drivers to take a limited detour and thereby substantially improves the performance of the traffic system.},

Internet backbone router is essentially the core router of Internet backbone and its performance is mainly relevant to the reliability of its mainboard. The mainboard is an embedded system consisting of hardware and software. Its reliability testing involves executing a number of test cases, which are designed to expose potential defects, under harsh environmental conditions. The testing process is largely prolonged due to the dramatic increase of the number of test cases, mainly due to the continuous increase and upgrade of its functional modules. Thus, there is a big demand from industry to improve the reliability testing efficiency and effectiveness. In this work, we exploit the principles of regression testing in software maintenance: test case selection and prioritization, and construct two testing planning models to largely reduce the testing time as well as to improve the effectiveness of failure detections. The former is a two-step model we introduced in previous work that optimizes test case selection and test case sequencing sequentially. The latter, an integrated model is newly developed, optimizing the test case selection and sequencing simultaneously with the precedence constraints among the test cases. Moreover, we propose exact algorithms based on branch-and-price for solving these two models. Finally, we present a case study demonstrating that the integrated model outperforms the two-step method and the advantage is more significant if the sequencing objective has greater weight in the integrated objective function.},

When both the manufacturer and the retailer can sell through 3P platforms, a question arises: Who should use a 3P platform channel? Having the option of more than one channel, the manufacturer and the retailer may adopt different pricing strategies: a uniform pricing strategy (UP strategy) or differentiated pricing strategy (DP strategy). This study explores the impact of the pricing strategy on the selection of the channel structure and the joint decision of the channel structure and pricing strategy. We establish a Stackelberg game with the manufacturer being the leader and consider three channel structures: the manufacturer uses the 3P platform channel (M), the retailer uses the 3P platform channel (R) and both of them use the 3P platform channel (MR). We find that the pricing strategy has a huge impact on the channel structure selection. Specifically, the intuitive result is that the manufacturer prefers MR, but the retailer prefers R under the DP strategy. However, under the UP strategy, both the manufacturer and the retailer prefer MR (Pareto zone) if the channel competition and the agency fee are low and prefer R (Pareto zone) otherwise. When both the manufacturer and the retailer jointly determine the pricing strategy and the channel structure, for the manufacturer, (MR, DP) is his best choice when the agency fee is reasonable, while the retailer&#39;s best choice may be (MR, UP) or (R, DP), depending on the channel competition and the agency fee. We also find that the inter-firm conflict can be reduced due to the manufacturer&#39;s use of UP strategy.},

  abstract     = {We present an efficient cutting-plane based approach to exactly solve a directed fixed charge network design (DFCND) problem, wherein the valid inequalities to the problem are generated using the polar duality approach. The biggest challenge in using this approach arises in constructing the polar dual of the problem. This would require enumerating all the extreme points of the convex hull of DFCND, which is computationally impractical for any instance of a reasonable size. Moreover, the resulting polar dual would be too large to solve efficiently, which is required at every iteration of the cutting-plane algorithm. The novelty of our solution approach lies in suggesting a way to circumvent this challenge by instead generating the violated facets, using polar duality, of the smaller substructures involving only a small subset of constraints and variables, obtained from 2-, 3-and 4-partitions of the underlying graph. For problem instances based on sparse graphs with zero flow costs, addition of these inequalities closes more than 20\% of the optimality gap remaining after the addition of the knapsack cover inequalities used in the literature. This allows us to solve the problem instances in less than 400 s, on average, which otherwise take around 1000 s with the addition of only the knapsack cover inequalities, and around 4 hours for the Cplex MIP solver at its default setting.},

  abstract     = {The unweighed oriented variable-sized two-dimensional guillotine bin packing problem consists in packing without overlap small rectangular items into large non-identical rectangular bins, with the items obtained via guillotine cuts. It minimizes the waste of the used bins. It is herein approximately solved using a hybrid matheuristic, which applies a sequence of low-level mixed-integer programs that reserve space for unpacked items and that are guided by feasibility constraints and by upper bounds on the objective function. The embedded constraints constitute a lookahead mechanism that prohibits the investigation of infeasible directions and constrains the search to improving ones. The matheuristic further employs high-level diversification and intensification mechanisms. The diversification incorporates a sequential value correction algorithm that tags a pseudo-price to each item to govern the fitness functions of mixed integer programs and subsequently their solution construction process. The intensification is a local search that investigates the neighbourhood of promising solutions. The extensive computational experiments provide evidence of the good performance of the proposed matheuristic. For the variable-sized bin packing benchmark instances, the matheuristic matches and improves 90.8\% of the upper bounds. For the single bin-size bin packing benchmark instances, the matheuristic further proves the optimality of 82.6\% upper bounds while it matches 14.4\% and improves 2.6\% existing bounds.},

This leads to the order acceptance and scheduling problem with release times and sequence dependent setup times that determines which orders to accept and how to schedule them simultaneously to maximize the revenue (GOAS). The aim of this study is to develop an effective and efficient solution methodology for the GOAS problem. To achieve this aim, we develop a mixed integer linear programming model, a constraint programming model, and a matheuristic algorithm that consists of a time-bucket based mixed integer linear programming model, a variable neighborhood search algorithm and a tabu search algorithm. Computational results show that the proposed matheuristic outperforms both the proposed exact models and previous state-of-the-art algorithms developed for the GOAS problem. The boundary of optimally solved instance size is pushed further and near optimal solutions are obtained in reasonable time for instances falling beyond this boundary.},

However, manufacturers may speed up their production by employing multiple lines, where each line produces sub-parts of the final product; which must be assembled by a synchronization machine. This study presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach for the PFSP with multiple lines and demand plans. Our approach differs from existing RL-based scheduling methods as we train the policy to directly generate the sequence in an iterative way, where actions denote the job type to be sequenced next. During cutoff time, we follow a multistart approach that generates sequences with the trained policy, which are subsequently optimized by local search. Our numerical evaluation based on 1050 problem instances with up to three production lines shows that our approach outperforms existing methods on the multi-line problems for short cutoff times, while there is a tie with existing methods for medium and long cutoff times. A further analysis suggests that our approach can also be applied to problems with imbalanced demand plans.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies computational approaches for solving large-scale optimization problems using a Lagrangian dual reformulation, solved by parallel sub-gradient methods. Since there are many possible reformulations for a given problem, an important question is: Which reformulation leads to the fastest solution time? One approach is to detect a block diagonal structure in the constraint matrix, and reformulate the problem by dualizing the constraints outside of the blocks; the approach is defined herein as block dual decomposition. Main advantage of such a reformulation is that the Lagrangian relaxation has a block diagonal constraint matrix, thus decomposable into smaller sub-problems that can solved in parallel. We show that the block decomposition can critically affect convergence rate of the sub-gradient method. We propose various decomposition methods that use domain knowledge or apply algorithms using knowledge about the structure in the constraint matrix or the dependence in the decision variables, towards reducing the computational effort to solve large-scale optimization problems. In particular, we introduce a block decomposition approach that reduces the number of dualized constraints by utilizing a community detection algorithm. We present empirical experiments on an extensive set of problem instances including a real application. We illustrate that if the number of the dualized constraints in the decomposition increases, the computational effort within each iteration of the sub-gradient method decreases while the number of iterations required for convergence increases. The key message is that it is crucial to employ prior knowledge about the structure of the problem when solving large scale optimization problems using dual decomposition.},

In other words, at each step we minimize the augment ed Lagrangian using Newton’s method and project the solution on the box. Most of the papers in this area deal with quadratic separable problems. Our proposal is more general in the sense that the problem can be non-quadratic and non-separable.

The relationship between semi-quasidifferentials and the Clarke subdifferential is studied, and a mean value theorem in terms of semi-quasidifferentials is proved. It is shown that this notion is helpful to investigate nonsmooth optimization problems even when the objective and/or constraint functions are discontinuous. Considering a multiobjective optimization problem, a characterization of some cones related to the feasible set is provided. They are used for deriving necessary and sufficient optimality conditions. We close the paper by obtaining optimality conditions in multiobjective optimization in terms of semi-quasidifferentials.

It is generally assumed that while the data missing in stage one are not known, their probability distribution is known. In this paper, we consider a special form of such problems where the objective function is quadratic in the first and second stage decisions and the goal is to minimize the expected quadratic cost function. We assume that the decisions must lie in a standard simplex, but do not require convexity of the uncertain objective. It is well known that such quadratic optimization programs are NP-complete and thus belong to the most complex optimization problems. A viable method to attack such problems is to find bounds for the original complicated problem by solving easier approximate problems. We describe such approximations and show that by exploiting their properties, good but not necessarily optimal solutions can be found. We also present possible applications, such as selecting invited speakers for conferences with the aim to generate a community with high coherence.

Horizontal information sharing occurs as the two retailers exchange signals, while vertical information sharing occurs as the supplier acquires the retailers’ signals with differential payments. The retailers can adopt a cooperative (competitive) regime to manage operations and information decisions jointly (independently). We demonstrate that the decision regime adopted by the retailers and market competition mode intricately influence information flow and firms’ profit performance. Adopting the cooperative regime by the retailers insulates the system from the change in the mode of market selling, which would, however, impact the strategic interplay of horizontal and vertical information sharing, producing substantial profit implications, as the retailers adopt the competitive regime. Moreover, cooperation between the retailers, despite precluding system-wide information transparency, can increase system profit gain from information flow.},

The fund manager of the firm collects the entry fees to a portfolio savings account and this wealth is to be invested optimally in a Black–Scholes type financial market. As such schemes usually last for many years, we extend our framework, by: (i) augmenting the financial market with an inflation-adjusted bond, and, (ii) taking into account mortality of the fund members. Model uncertainty aspects are introduced as the fund manager does not fully trust the model he/she faces. By resorting to robust control and dynamic programming techniques, we provide: (a) closed-form solutions for the case of the exponential utility function, (b) a detailed study of the qualitative features of the problem at hand that elucidates the effect of robustness and inflation on the optimal investment decisions.},

To model these problems, multi-level programming has been suggested as a suitable methodology for modeling the interaction between the different levels of decisions. However, multi-level programming, even for the case of bi-levels, is known to be strongly N P NP -hard. To address this computational challenge, we develop three different heuristic-based approaches for solving a specific class of tri-level programming problems, in which the leader has direct control over the follower’s decisions to a certain extent, with a common objective function shared at all levels. As expected, each heuristic type offers a trade-off between solution quality and computational time. To illustrate our solution approach, we present an application for defending critical infrastructure to improve its resilience against intentional attacks. In this context we use a defender-attacker-defender model and apply it to electrical power grids. We also propose a modified implementation of a widely adopted enumeration algorithm in this area, with a warm-starting solution technique that significantly enhanced the computational performance of the enumeration algorithm. We test our solution approaches on three electrical transmission networks and present the results of our numerical computations as well as some insights.},

The decision protocols used for ambulance dispatch and dynamic redeployment during a simulation run are flexible and easy to customize. Analytical optimisation models relevant to EMS decision-making are included, such as for station location and ambulance deployment problems. The simulations run quickly, requiring less than a second to simulate 100 days for a realistic city model. Data to simulate Auckland, New Zealand is included in the package and other cities will be added to enable researchers to conduct a more varied and fair comparison of newly developed EMS strategies. The JEMSS package includes a visualisation tool to view the simulation as it is running. The simulation model has been validated by comparing the simulation trace and output of existing EMS simulation and analysis software BartSim. This paper details the JEMSS design and presents a case study showing how to apply integer programming, local search, and simulation optimisation using JEMSS.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, implementation of pay-for-performance (P4P) programmes in health care has become a worldwide initiative. However, most P4P programmes incorporate systems of Performance Indicators (PI) without accounting for trade-offs between indicators. This article has two objectives: (1) to develop a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology for performance assessment of primary care providers; and (2) to propose an innovative methodology for P4P contracting based on the DEA assessment results. To achieve the first objective, we modify the standard DEA model to account for the necessary relations between the weights attributed to each PI and domain of performance and to account for the effect of the relevant environmental variables. To achieve the second objective, we combine relative and absolute performance assessments in the elaboration of several bases for reward, and then we link these assessments to a system of graduated rewards. A benchmarking programme is also proposed to contribute to the dissemination of best practices. This article contributes to the literature by proposing an enhanced methodology for performance assessment of primary care providers which can form the basis for P4P rewards planning. The applicability and advantages of the proposed methodology are illustrated with data from Portugal, but it can easily be adapted to different sets of PIs or domains, making it relevant for performance assessment and for P4P reward setting in other contexts and countries.},

This problem is quite challenging given the specific operating constraints of nuclear units, the stochasticity of both the demand and non-nuclear units availability, and the scale of the instances. To tackle these difficulties we use a combined decomposition approach. The operating constraints of the nuclear units are built into a Dantzig-Wolfe pricing subproblem whose solutions define the columns of a demand covering formulation. The scenarios of demand and non-nuclear units availability are handled in a Benders decomposition. Our approach is shown to scale up to the real-life instances of the French nuclear fleet.},

Hubs, such as cross docks for trucks, central ports for container vessels, transshipment yards for freight trains, and air hubs for airplanes, allow to consolidate less-than-vehicle-load shipments and to improve the utilization of transport capacities. In this context, we consider a generic optimization problem to streamline hub processes. We assign vehicles consolidating their shipments at a central hub each an arrival time slot where a vehicle is unloaded and a later departure time slot where it is loaded with the goods it takes back to its designated territory. Since the processing of goods inside a hub terminal takes some time, we want to synchronize the exchange of goods among vehicles such that three different consolidation-oriented objectives are optimized. For instance, we aim to minimize the number of goods missing their dedicated departures after a fixed consolidation time for goods inside the hub. We prove important structural properties, provide a comprehensive analysis of computational complexity, and derive suited solution procedures. Our problem occurs in the real world at the air hub of postal service provider DHL in Leipzig, where freight airplanes from all over the world exchange goods and need to be assigned landing and departure slots on the runway. Our problem, however, is generic, and we sketch some extensions in order to adapt it to further hubs.},

  abstract     = {As an effective paradigm to address uncertainty in payoffs and transition probabilities, robust stochastic games have been formulated in the literature. This paper is concerned with the computation of subgame perfect equilibria in stationary strategies (SSPEs) in robust stochastic games. To tackle this problem, we develop in this paper a globally convergent differentiable path-following method by exploiting the structures of the games. Incorporating a logarithmic-barrier term into each player’s payoff function with an extra variable between zero and one, we constitute a logarithmic-barrier robust stochastic game in which each player solves in each state a convex optimization problem. An application of the optimality conditions to the barrier game together with a fixed-point argument yields a polynomial equilibrium system for the barrier game. As a result of this system, we establish the existence of a smooth path that starts from an arbitrary mixed strategy profile and ends at an SSPE as the extra variable descends from one to zero. As an alternative scheme, we make up a convex-quadratic-penalty robust stochastic game and attain a globally convergent convex-quadratic-penalty differentiable path-following method for SSPEs in robust stochastic games. Numerical comparisons show that the logarithmic-barrier path-following method significantly outperforms the convex-quadratic-penalty path-following method. To further evince the value of the proposed methods, we apply the logarithmic-barrier path-following method to solve a supply chain configuration problem and a market entry problem from medical waste recycling.},

  abstract     = {Complexity, resulting from interactions among many components, is a characterizing feature of healthcare systems and related decisions. It scales up in the face of pandemics that give rise to multiple sources of uncertainty and where various contextual factors interact with each other and with policy parameters that combine to yield outcome distributions. This paper proposes a unified agent-based modeling framework to derive qualitative insights that assist and inform policy decisions related to pandemics. The general framework comprises a contagion model that explicates exogenous policy-relevant variables, as well as their links with features of the environment in which the policy decisions will be implemented. Furthermore, the framework identifies sources of uncertainty at different system layers. The characterization of the macro level, for example, as manifested in the network structure, encompasses two constitutive factors. These two factors, in turn, capture much of the stochasticity that results from the network’s inherent randomness. By synthesizing the model components further into a broader agent-based model, the current framework also accounts for heterogeneous micro-level attributes that collectively yield macro-level outcomes. Several stylized examples help establish insights into the overall tendency of complex systems to produce multidimensional outputs. A comprehensive, controlled, computational experiment offers further evidence across a range of scenarios and various policy conditions.},

Our approach uses the characterization of vector efficiency based on the strongly connection of a certain digraph associated with the matrix. By imposing some conditions on the magnitudes of the perturbations, we identify a class of matrices for which the principal eigenvector is efficient. This class is the union of two subclasses such that the digraph of all the matrices in the same subclass contains a common cycle with all vertices. The matrices we analyse include the simple perturbed consistent matrices, as well as a subfamily of the double perturbed consistent matrices, whose principal eigenvector efficiency has been studied in the literature. For completeness, we also include some examples of triple perturbed matrices for which the principal eigenvector is not efficient.

To overcome this problem, two formulations based on Boolean satisfiability have recently been proposed to learn the parameters of the Non-Compensatory Sorting model from perfect preference information, i.e. when the set of reference assignments can be completely represented in the model. In this paper, two popular variants of the Non-Compensatory Sorting model are considered, the Non-Compensatory Sorting model with a unique profile and the Non-Compensatory Sorting model with a unique set of sufficient coalitions. For each variant, we start by extending the formulation based on a separation principle to the multiple category case. Moreover, we extend the two formulations to handle inconsistency in the preference information using the Maximum satisfiability problem language. A computational study is proposed to compare the efficiency of both formulations to learn the two Non-Compensatory Sorting models (with a unique profile and with a unique set of sufficient coalitions) from noiseless and noisy preference information.},

While research has shown that discrete choice models are suitable to estimate the distribution of passengers on routes, this has not been considered in timetabling yet. We investigate how to integrate a passenger distribution into an optimization framework for timetabling and present two mixed integer linear programs for this problem. Both approaches design timetables and simultaneously find a corresponding passenger distribution on available routes. One model uses a linear distribution model to estimate passenger route choices. The other model uses an integrated simulation framework to approximate a passenger distribution according to the logit model, a commonly used route choice model. We compare both new approaches with three state-of-the-art timetabling methods and a heuristic approach on a set of artificial instances and a partial network of Netherlands Railways (NS). Our experiments provide insights into the impact of considering multiple routes instead of a single route, and of integrated route choice versus predetermined route assignment with respect to the solution quality.},

  abstract     = {A bike-sharing system is a shared mobility mechanism that provides an alternative transportation mode for short trips with almost no added travel speed loss. However, this model’s low usage ratio and high depreciation rate pose a risk to the sustainable development of the bike-sharing industry. Our study proposes a new integrated station location and rebalancing vehicle service design model. This model aims to maximize daily revenue under a given total investment for station locations and bike acquisition. To address demand ambiguity due to possible bias and loss of data, we present a two-stage robust optimization model with a demand-related uncertainty set. The first stage of our model determines the station locations, initial bike inventory, and service areas of rebalancing vehicles. In contrast to the literature, which either simplifies the rebalancing process as an inventory transshipment problem or formulates it as a complex dynamic bike rebalancing problem, we assign each rebalancing vehicle to a service area composed of several specified stations. An approximate maximum travel distance for each rebalancing vehicle is also designed and constrained to ensure that the rebalancing operation can be performed within each period. In the second stage, our model optimizes the daily fleet operation and maximizes the total revenue minus the rebalancing cost. To solve our model, we design a customized row generation approach. Our numerical studies demonstrate that our algorithm can efficiently obtain exact solutions in small instances. For a real-size problem, the nearly optimal solutions of our model also reveal a high-quality worst-case performance with a small loss in mean performance, particularly when the value of the budget ratio (that is, the average number of bikes per station) is at a medium level. Moreover, the distribution of service areas depends on the bike supply and demand level at each station. The optimal fleet rebalancing operation does not have to be confined to one geographical area. Furthermore, our robust model can achieve larger mean and worst-case revenues and a higher revenue stability than a stochastic model with a small data set.},

The van stops at parking nodes to drop off and/or pick up its robot, and to replenish its robot and/or swap its robot’s battery if needed. Five van/robot pickup and delivery cases are considered, according to the roles the van/robot plays in the process of pickup/delivery and whether the van transports its robot. To model the proposed problem, we introduce a mixed-integer program including time, freight, and energy. We further propose an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm to solve larger instances and a capacity feasibility test approach for a single route. We then assess the influence of parking node density on model output. A case study based on a realistic city scenario is introduced. A sensitivity analysis is performed on the robot’s travel cost and maximum travel distances, and the effect of van no-go areas is studied. Two classical models (two-echelon vehicle routing with hybrid pickup and delivery and parallel van and robot scheduling with hybrid pickup and delivery) are compared with ours, and results show our model is competitive in appropriate scenario settings. We therefore advocate using the two-echelon van-based robot last-mile pickup and delivery system in urban areas.},

  abstract     = {While emission tax and mandatory emission capacity regulations are widely implemented to control greenhouse gas emissions, it remains unclear which will lead to better performance in an uncertain environment. Furthermore, a regulated sustainable manufacturer with only partial demand information may be challenged by more uncertainties than a manufacturer would be in a free market without regulation. These factors motivate us to examine the effects of two types of emission reduction regulations on the optimal production decisions of a manufacturer facing stochastic demand with partial distribution information. Based on distributionally robust newsvendor models, we use the Hurwicz decision criterion to build robust optimization models for a regulated sustainable manufacturer. We first solve the closed-form expressions of the optimal production quantities for two optimization models; then, we compare their expected profits and carbon emissions. The comparisons show that an emission tax may be more favorable than mandatory emission capacity regulation in terms of the manufacturer’s environmental performance. A numerical study with a Taguchi experiment is performed to compare the two policies and to test the robustness. We find interesting insights: For manufacturers, a decision maker with an optimistic attitude to demand uncertainty, can gain higher profits and emit less carbon, which differs from the results of some previous research. For regulators, with a large carbon cap, mandatory emission capacity regulation can lead manufacturers to gain higher profits and emit more carbon than those achieved under emission tax regulation, which provides new insights for policy makers.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the problem of scheduling automated guided vehicles (AGVs) with battery constraints. Each transport request involves a soft time window, and the AGV fleet used to service those requests is heterogeneous with a diverse set of capabilities and travel costs. In contrast to the existing literature, each transport request may require different AGV material handling capabilities (such as lift loads, tow loads, or handle loads with a mounted robot arm), and the AGV batteries can be recharged partially under consideration of a critical battery threshold. The problem is to assign the transport and charging requests to AGVs, sequence the requests, and determine their starting times and the recharging durations of the AGVs with the objective of minimizing a weighted sum of the tardiness costs of transport requests and travel costs of AGVs. A mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated. We also propose a new matheuristic that makes use of an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm and a linear program to solve industry-size instances. We illustrate the efficacy of our approach with an industry case study using real-world data.},

We first present new and novel MIP formulations that are built upon the well-known uncapacitated FLOWLOC model proposed by O&#39;Kelly and Bryan (1998). The proposed reliable models aim at simultaneously determining (a) the optimal location of the hubs, (b) the allocation of demand to these hubs,(c) the backup facilities for each demand point, (d) the hub capacity level to handle the normal flow, (e) the additional capacity to handle excessive rerouted flows due to possible hub disruption, (f) the values of discount factor for inter-hub links at normal and (g) the discount factor to be applied on inter-hub links should volume of flow increases because of hub disruption. The proposed mathematical models could solve small instances to optimality using a commercial optimiser such as CPLEX. To solve large instances we propose a variant of the VNS algorithm, namely, the reduced VNS. We present computational results including lower and upper bounds of the optimal solutions to problems with 15, 20 and 25 nodes and the upper bounds of the solutions to larger problems up to 170 nodes. Managerial insights for the reliable hub location problem with and without the use of flow dependent discount factors are presented and recommendations on the use of trade-off curves between the two objectives of minimizing the network cost in normal and disrupted conditions are also provided.},

  abstract     = {The maximum weighted submatrix coverage problem is a recently introduced problem with applications in data mining. It is concerned with selecting K submatrices of a given numerical matrix such that the sum of the matrix-entries, which occur in at least one of the selected submatrices, is maximized. In the paper introducing the problem, a problem-specific constraint programming approach was developed and embedded in a large neighborhood-search to obtain a heuristic. A compact integer linear programming formulation was also presented, but deemed inefficient due to its size. In this paper, we introduce new integer linear programming formulations for the problem, one of them is based on Benders decomposition. The obtained Benders decomposition-based formulation has a nice combinatorial structure, i.e., there is no need to solve linear programs to separate Benders cuts. We present preprocessing procedures and valid inequalities for all formulations. We also develop a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure for the problem, which is enhanced with a local search. A computational study using the instances from literature is done to evaluate the effectiveness of our new approaches. Our algorithms manage to find improved primal solutions for ten out of 17 real-world instances, and optimality is proven for two real-world instances. Moreover, for over 700 of 1617 large-scale synthetic instances, our algorithms find improved primal solutions compared to the heuristics from the literature.},

In such problems, a sequence of vehicle routing decisions has to be made in reaction and anticipation of newly revealed stochastic information. To this end, a variety of computational operations research methods has emerged in the literature, increasingly integrating potential future information in their decision making. The integration of information models into decision models via computational methods is known as prescriptive analytics, the most recent advance of business analytics. In this paper, we explore the existing work and future potential of prescriptive analytics for stochastic dynamic vehicle routing. We identify the characteristics of decision models and information models unique in stochastic dynamic vehicle routing and analyze how different methodology meets the characteristics&#39; requirements. We use the insights to derive recommendations about promising methodology when approaching specific stochastic dynamic vehicle routing problems.},

Recently published articles based on high-frequency data fail to disentangle efficient market price variance from microstructure noise, which produces biased estimates of announcements’ market impacts. By using a Markov Chain framework, we address the shortcomings of previous research and assess the market response to key public information releases affecting agricultural markets. We compare two mechanisms to release public information that have been used in these markets: the trading halt and the real-time. We show how the value of microstructure noise can be used to improve public policy decisions. We find that the real-time release of information brings faster efficient price discovery at the cost of large microstructure frictions. Increases in the cost of noise are not compensated by the improvements in the speed of efficient price discovery. Overall, our findings are highly relevant to public policy and have implications for market design.},

  abstract     = {As one of the earliest crucial applications of Bayesian statistics, credibility theory (see Bühlmann and Gisler, 2006) was first developed for net premium calibration in insurance by optimally combining individual claim history with other claim histories from the whole population; for a century, this research direction has become a major discipline in the interplay among actuarial science, operational research and statistics. Traditionally, for the ease of calibration, the credibility formula is a linear functional of historical observations, which greatly simplifies the underlying computational complexity; yet, its downside is the resulting high sensitivity towards outliers. To remedy this shortcoming, De Vylder (1976) proposed to first transform the observations collected by truncation in particular, and this semi-linear approach was further investigated in Bühlmann &amp; Gisler (2006) . Gisler (1980) suggested that the L 2 L2 -optimal truncation point can be determined in an ad hoc manner, but the derivation of its general explicit formula is difficult. In our present work, to strike a balance between practical usage and mathematical tractability, we focus on heterogeneous risks all coming from possibly different maximum domain of attractions of the extreme value distributions, which well suffices in practice. By incorporating the satisficing method commonly used in operational research, we close the gap by providing the explicit formula for the aforementioned optimal truncation point up to a slowly varying function of the sample size in an asymptotic sense. A comprehensive numerical study also illuminates that with the aid of this newly obtained truncation point, the corresponding semi-linear credibility formula outperforms the classical Bühlmann model.},

The jumps are assumed to follow a compound Poisson process. The stochastic gradient representation of the resulting model risk is general: it can be applied to quantify the difference between performance functions of two Markov Chains at multiple future times. The sensitivity estimator samples the jump-diffusion within the base diffusion process. We show that our statistical test is vastly superior to the two-sample t -test.

  abstract     = {For a rapid dissemination of information during crisis events, official agencies and disaster relief organizations have been utilizing social media platforms, which are susceptible to rumor propagation. To minimize the impact of rumors with limited time and resources, the agencies and social media companies not only need to wisely choose the cases to clarify amongst the numerous cases, but they should also make an informed decision on the timing of clarification. Reacting fast can be misjudged as an obvious best policy as partial/imprecise information may fail to contain the impact of the rumors. On the other hand, investment in terms of time, effort, and money to clarify with more complete information also allows the rumors to spread with their full force during the learning phase, thereby making the process of decision-making very challenging. The objective of this paper is to determine the optimal strategies for the official agencies and social media companies by developing two novel sequential game-theoretic models, namely “Rumor Selection for Clarification” and “Learning for Rumor Clarification”, that can help decide which rumor to clarify and when to clarify, respectively. Results from this study indicate that posting verified information on social media reduces the uncertainties involved in rumor transmission, thereby enabling social media users to make informed decisions on whether to support or oppose the rumor being circulated. This verification needs to be obtained within reasonable limits of time and cost to keep the learning process worthwhile.},

However, the solutions implemented by government agencies have been inadequate as they fail to understand the diversity of challenges and preferences of slum residents. While the traditional prescriptive approaches to study slum communities do not capture the uncertainties that riddle slums, we explore this domain of inquiry alternatively through theories of Community Operational Research (COR) and Community Based Operations Research (CBOR) that develop an understanding of housing problems from slum resident perspectives. In this paper, we study slum communities’ housing priorities by learning how they structure their concerns and identify specific solutions that could enable access to improved housing facilities. This is one of the first studies to apply Strategic Options Development &amp; Analysis (SODA) and Value Focused Thinking (VFT) to engage with slum residents and generate in-depth insights into the lives of slum communities. Our findings from a slum in the Indian state of Odisha highlight the diverse challenges and needs of the community with regard to housing and basic infrastructure facilities from the slum-dwellers’ perspective, a voice often missing in slum policymaking. We believe that our findings could inform policymakers about most valued preferences of slum residents among many possible slum upgrading interventions. The study contributes to the extension of Operations Research tools and methodologies for meaningful engagement of vulnerable communities to develop interventions for improving social welfare.},

Such systems make use of their own dedicated fleets but will also use a crowdsourced delivery mode by hiring occasional fleets. These mixed logistics systems with both dedicated and occasional fleets serve both retailers’ internal delivery tasks and external tasks requested by local businesses. This paper studies the problem of scheduling heterogeneous (internal and external) delivery tasks on a mixed logistics platform with multiple depots and two types of vehicles (dedicated and occasional). A delivery task is executed by either a dedicated vehicle or an occasional vehicle. The dedicated vehicles depart from and return to the platform&#39;s depots; the occasional vehicles depart from their original location and pick up goods from depots or external pickup locations, fulfill the delivery tasks, and finish their route at the final delivery location. We propose mixed integer programming models and column generation-based solution methods to solve the problem. A computational study is conducted based on a series of randomly generated instances and real-world instances involving 15 depots, 120 internal customers, 15 external delivery tasks, and 38 dedicated and occasional vehicles. The results obtained demonstrate the efficiency of the column generation-based solution methods. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed models is validated by a significant cost saving in comparison to intuitive decision rules. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to derive a number of managerial implications.},

  abstract     = {Ensuring the security of stable, efficient and reliable energy supplies has intensified the interconnections between energy markets. Imbalances between supply and demand due to operational failures, congestion and other sources of risk faced by market connections can lead to a system that is vulnerable to the spread of risk and its spill-over. The main contribution of this paper is the development and estimation of a Bayesian Graphical Vector-AutoRegression and a Bayesian Graphical Structural Equation Modelling with external regressors - BG-VARX and BG-SEMX, respectively - enhancing the proper analysis of market connections. The Italian electricity market has been chosen because it is a clear example of a zonal market where risk can spread over connected zones. We estimate, for the first time, within-day and across-day zonal market interconnections with a multivariate time series of hourly prices, actual and forecast power demand and forecast wind generation over the period 2014–2019 and evaluate the dynamics and persistence of zonal market connections, examining the spread of risk in the zones of the Italian electricity market. Our findings provide an improved, accurate explanation of risk contagion, identifying the zones that are most influential in terms of hub centrality (major transmitters) and authority centrality (major recipients), respectively, for intra-day and inter-day risk propagation in the Italian electricity market. In addition, the policy implications in terms of market-monitoring are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Modelling audience size for televised football matches has utility for a number of stakeholders. In the short-term it can inform the choice of broadcasters as to which matches to show and decisions of firms regarding how much to bid for advertising slots during the game. For elite clubs and leagues, for which television rights is their principal source of revenue, it offers a means of understanding which match characteristics will draw the largest audience and this should inform long-term decisions on how to structure their competitions. The paper argues that previous modelling in this area has typically depended on an inappropriate measure of audience size and unsatisfactory metrics to capture important match characteristics such as the quality of the talent on show and the significance of the match for the championship or relegation. In contrast to this prior literature, the present paper draws on sport analytics to derive its measures of player talent and match significance. This makes a material difference to findings from modelling audience size for 790 English Premier League matches between 2013 and 2019. For example, it identifies elevated interest for matches potentially significant for end-of-season outcomes. This has implications when organisers consider the optimal structure of the competition and revenue sharing arrangements between member clubs of the league. For the wider television industry, we show that measurement of audience size (and some results from modelling) are sensitive to whether focus is on the whole programme or just its core content (in this case the match itself).},

The aim of this paper is to develop an effective and efficient solution approach for the operating room planning and scheduling capable to take into account the patient priority maximisation and workload balance criteria at the same time. This work is inspired by the need of a deeper understanding of the quality of the solutions obtained when a combination of the two criteria leads the OR planning decisions. Starting from a hierarchical multi-objective optimisation model for the combined master surgical scheduling and surgical cases assignment problems, we develop a class of new multi-neighbourhood local search based matheuristic algorithms, whose main feature is to exploit an ad hoc neighbourhood to generate better solutions in a significant shorter running time. A broad quantitative analysis on new realistic instances proves the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed matheuristic algorithms as well as to evaluate the quality of the computed solution from an operating room management perspective.},

In particular, the increasing risks of extended electricity supply disruptions and/or severe electricity price fluctuations are stressing the need for an assessment of the European countries’ electricity supply resilience. This paper proposes an elaborative multicriteria decision support methodological framework, based on three major resilience dimensions, namely: “resist”, “restabilise” and “recover”. In total, 35 European countries are evaluated and ranked according to their performance on 17 interacting evaluation criteria. The overall evaluation of the countries is established based on a synergy of two complementary multicriteria decision aid (MCDA) methods. Specifically, the Choquet Integral is approached and assessed as an importance indicator to properly accommodate and incorporate the interacting criteria into the value system, negating therefore their arbitrary effects on the final benchmarking. Simultaneously, a procedure based on the Simos method supports the robust elicitation of the Choquet capacities. All preferential information required for the implementation of the MCDA framework has been elicited from an expert, highly knowledgeable of the European energy system. This research work aims to support energy policymakers in Europe and provide guidelines and areas for improvement at a country level.},

  abstract     = {When making long-term strategic decisions, organizations may benefit from characterizing their future operational environment with a set of scenarios. These scenarios can be built based on combinations of levels of uncertainty factors describing, e.g., alternative political or technological developments. However, the number of such combinations grows exponentially in the number of the uncertainty factors, whereby the selection of a few combinations to work as a basis for scenario development can be difficult. In this paper, we develop a method for identifying a small but diverse set of plausible combinations of uncertainty factor levels. The method filters an exponentially large set of possible combinations to a smaller set of most plausible combinations, as assessed by the consistencies of the pairs of uncertainty factor levels in the combinations. To support the selection of the final set of combinations from the most consistent ones, we formulate a weighted set cover problem, the solution to which gives the smallest number of maximally consistent combinations that together cover all uncertainty factor levels. Moreover, we develop an interactive software tool utilizing Multiple Correspondence Analysis to visualize the consistency and diversity of the combinations, thus improving the transparency and communicability of the methods. This paper also presents a real case in which our method was used to identify a set of plausible scenarios for the Finnish National Emergency Supply Organization to support their strategic decision making.},

Whilst the biologically inspired Clonal Selection Algorithms (CSA) have been applied to efficiently solve several combinatorial optimization problems, they have not yet been tested for optimal product lines. By adopting a previous comparative analysis with real and simulated conjoint data, we adapt and compare in this context 23 CSA variants. Our comparison demonstrates the efficiency of specific cloning, selection and somatic hypermutation operators against other optimization algorithms, such as Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithm. To further investigate the robustness of each method to combinatorial size, we extend the previous paradigm to larger product lines and different optimization objectives. The consequent performance variation elucidates how each operator shifts the search focus of CSAs. Collectively, our study demonstrates the importance of a fine balance between global and local search in such combinatorial problems, and the ability of CSAs to achieve it.},

For both policies, we present stochastic dynamic programs (SDP) to determine optimal policy parameters and introduce mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) heuristics that leverage piecewise-linear approximations of the cost function.

However, in practice, some companies do not deter piracy actively which seems counterintuitive. To explore the rationale behind the uncommon phenomenon, this paper explores the piracy issue from the entry deterrence perspective. In particular, we study an incumbent’s entry deterrence strategy using piracy when facing a potential entrant who offers similar products in the market. The incumbent decides whether to deter the piracy, and the entrant chooses whether to enter the market by anticipating the competition in the potential market and the entry cost. By analyzing the strategies of both the incumbent and the entrant, we find that deterring piracy is not always a good strategy since piracy could be used as a deterring strategy on the entrant, which explains the practices in many companies. Specifically, we find that when the entry cost is moderate, the incumbent accommodates piracy when the entrant is more of a threat, and piracy serves as a partner of the incumbent to prevent the entry of a powerful entrant. This conclusion also holds when considering the entry deterrence cost, network effect and the entrant is a high end substitute.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates an integrated rolling stock deadhead routing and timetabling problem from the rolling stock scheduling in a complicated urban rail transit line. Given the train sequences composed of passenger train trips within an operation day, the deadhead routing sub-problem aims at selecting the rolling stock deadhead routes between the depots and the first/last stations of each train sequence. The task of the deadhead timetabling sub-problem is to determine the arrival and departure times of rolling stocks along these selected routes. By means of a time-space network representation, we formulate the studied problem as a new (generalized set partitioning type) binary linear model, to minimize the weighted sum of total deadhead distance and total deadhead running time of rolling stocks during the depot exiting and entering operations. Owing to large numbers of constraints and decision variables in our model, a row and column generation-based algorithm is developed to solve practical-size problems efficiently. A row generation and a column generation are executed iteratively to reduce the numbers of considered constraints and decision variables in our algorithm, respectively. The pricing sub-problem (to identify new variables) in column generation is decomposed into multiple simplified problems, each of which is equivalent to a shortest path problem in the constructed time-space sub-network for any candidate route of each train sequence. These shortest path problems can be solved efficiently by using an existing shortest path algorithm. Computational experiments on a set of hypothetical, realistic, and real-world instances demonstrate that our approach can compute both tight lower bounds and (near-)optimal solutions (with a maximum relative optimality gap of 1.07\%) for all the tested instances within a maximum computation time of approximately 3 hours for the studied tactical problem. Furthermore, our best-known solution for the real-world instance is better than the empirical solution designed by the rail managers mainly based on experience.},

The production process is equipped with a predictive model, generating alert and no-alert signals. An alert signal indicates that production process is in the defective state, while a no-alert signal indicates it is in the healthy state. The signals are imperfect, meaning that an alert signal can be generated for a healthy process and a no-alert signal can be generated for a defective process. Only a costly inspection can detect the true condition. We introduce a new inspection policy, which generalizes the age-based inspection policy that performs planned inspections at predetermined intervals, by considering that an inspection can also be triggered by a certain number of alerts from the predictive model. To optimize the proposed inspection policy, a stochastic dynamic programming model is formulated with the objective of minimizing the long-run expected cost rate. The performance improvement achieved by the optimal policy is quantified by comparing it to practically relevant benchmark policies. Numerical experiments with a set of realistic problem instances show that adding alert-triggered inspections to traditional age-based inspection scheduling brings up to 44\% reduction in the expected cost rate when the predictive model is sufficiently accurate. Characterizing the performance of the optimal policy at a given level of imperfectness is especially useful in practice as it allows making an assessment on how much can be invested to justify a certain level of improvement in the predictive model.},

The upper-level problem determines a cordon-based road pricing scheme, while the lower-level problem models the interaction between land use and transportation. To facilitate decision-making in a scenario characterized by a hierarchical ordering of objectives, a novel α -conditional lexicographic optimization method is established, which uses an α value to capture the decision-maker&#39;s perceived acceptability of the trade-off between different objectives with respect to the hierarchical objective ordering. The properties associated with this approach are derived, and an algorithm to find the α -conditional lexicographic dominance solutions is developed. To solve the model, a revised genetic algorithm is further developed to illustrate how the proposed α -conditional lexicographic optimization method can be embedded into existing heuristic or metaheuristic methods. A case study using data from Jiangyin, China, demonstrates the significance of considering land use effects when evaluating road pricing scenarios. The results reveal the trade-off between transportation and various land use objectives and the variation of such a trade-off among different types of traffic analysis zones. It is demonstrated that the proposed α -conditional lexicographic approach can improve most of the land use objective values while ensuring that the total travel time is constrained within an acceptable range, enabling a balance between various land use and transportation objectives.},

The PRP is a hard-to-solve combinatorial optimization problem with numerous practical applications in the field of freight transportation, logistics and supply chain management. A manufacturer is responsible for determining production decisions, as well as the timing and the quantity of replenishment services offered to a set of geographically dispersed customers over a multi-period time horizon. The problem calls for jointly optimizing the production, inventory, distribution and routing decisions. The paper provides a novel two-commodity flow formulation and proposes a two-phase infeasible space matheuristic algorithm for solving the examined problem. The first phase deals with a relaxation of the problem to construct production-distribution plans. In the second phase, these are completed with routing information and optimized via a local search framework which oscillates between the feasible and the infeasible solution space. The framework is equipped with mixed integer programming components for restoring infeasibility and for diversifying the conducted search. Computational experiments demonstrate that the infeasibility space exploration significantly contributes to the quality of the final solutions. The results obtained by the proposed matheuristic out-match the results of state-of-the-art approaches. More specifically, 594 and 55 new best solutions out of 1440 and 90 instances of two well-established benchmark data sets of small-medium and large instances are reported, respectively.},

  abstract     = {This study considers single processor scheduling problems incorporating a rate-modifying activity (RMA) as well as processing time deterioration rates. The RMA fully restores the processing speed of a processor. As discussed in recent literature, the optimal position of an RMA for a single processor scheduling problem with the objective of makespan minimization, 1|p[j]A=α[j]S[j],rm|Cmax , where the processing time of a job ( p[j]A:[j]denotesthejthposition) is determined by its start time ( S[j]) and position-dependent rate ( α[j]) , can be found easily. This study considers six variants of the problem: (P1) 1|p[j]A=p¯+α[j]S[j],rm|Cmax , (P1+)1|p[j]A=p¯+α[j]S[j],drm|Cmax , (P2) 1 |p[i,j]A=pj+α[i]Sj,rm|Cmax , (P2+)1|p[i,j]A=pj+α[i]Sj,drm|Cmax , (P3) 1|pjA=αjSj,rm|Cmax , and (P3+)1|pjA=αjSj,drm|Cmax , where p¯ is the common basic processing time, pj is the basic processing time for job j , [ i,j ] is the job j scheduled at the i th position, and drm is the deteriorating RMA. We show that (P1) and (P1 + ), where the common basic processing time is considered, can be converted into the problem 1|p[j]A=α[j]S[j],rm|Cmax , so that the optimal position of the RMA can be found easily. In the other variants, the optimal sequences of jobs and positions of the RMA must be determined. In (P2) and (P2 + ), the basic processing time for each job ( pj) is considered, whereas, in (P3) and (P3 + ), the deterioration rate depends not on the position of the job ( α[j]) but on the job itself ( αj ). We show that the optimal schedules for (P2), (P2 + ) and (P3), (P3 + ) can be found by solving the assignment problems and the knapsack problems, respectively.},

It is known from the existing literature that so-called strongly correlated instances, i.e., instances where each job has the weight equal to its processing time plus a constant, are significantly harder to solve compared to instances without this relation. In this work, we extend an exact algorithm proposed in Baptiste et al. (2010) with the aim of solving the strongly correlated instances significantly faster. The main improvement is the new integer linear programming model for strongly correlated instances utilizing a decomposition according to the number of tardy jobs. Other proposed improvements are tighter lower and upper bounds which can be applied to all types of instances. The best-known algorithm proposed in Baptiste et al. (2010) cannot solve all instances with 250 jobs to the optimum within an hour. On the same hardware, our relatively simple improvements implemented into the algorithm proposed by Baptiste et al. enable solving all examined strongly correlated instances to the optimum within an hour for up to 5,000 jobs and reduce the computational time on other instances as well.},

Existence of a solution and some of its qualitative properties are proved. A Markov-chain approximation is used to numerically approximate the solution is introduced. The model is applied to a real-world railway project for which it is found that it does not represent value for money (VfM) and is unlikely to do so in the next decade. A comparative statics analysis reveals that the presence of an abandonment option can increase project value substantially and can speed up investment. Finally, it is argued that the commonly-used benefit-to-cost ratio (BCR) is not an appropriate measure to summarize a project’s VfM. Instead, the value ratio (VR) is suggested as an alternative.},

The model explicitly captures the impact of interest rate expectations in the marking-to-market feature of futures, as predicted by Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1981) theory. The backwardation vs. contango regime of financial futures depends on a new parameter, the contango factor, which paves the way for future empirical studies. Akin to the implied volatility of option contracts, the contango factor provides market participants with a universal gauge of futures contracts’ level of contango, consistent across futures markets and maturities. Our numerical simulations show significant deviations from the traditional cost-of-carry model of futures prices, with price deviations above 1\% even for short-term futures contracts.},

Especially in rural areas training transfer services are common to recruit promising underage players. If the demand for training transfers exceeds the available pickup capacities, a prioritization of pickups is necessary. Additionally, the transport of underage children has the special premises of consistent driver-player assignments. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present an algorithmic approach to passenger transportation problems with priorities under limited capacity and consistency requirements. We propose an iterative template-based procedure to handle the trade-off between priority maximizing pickups and assignment consistency. So far, the literature has focused on the consistent service of a predefined subset of customers. With our work we focus on the consistent service of all requesting customers. Consequently, the identification of promising template players is endogenous to our approach. We discuss the effect of template players on the service of non-template players and identify drivers of consistency. In addition, we provide a new Tabu Search neighborhood structure for heterogeneous vehicle routing under consistency, ensuring efficient vehicle deployment. We highlight the benefits of the approach by comparing our results with the routing solutions of a Bundesliga soccer club.},

The company can also invest in marketing to incentivize clients to shift to more recent technologies, hopefully leading to cheaper overall costs. To model the effect of marketing campaigns, previous works have relied on the Bass model. Since that model only provides a rough approximation of the actual shifting mechanism, the purpose of this work is to consider uncertainty in the shifting mechanism through the lens of robust optimization. We thus assume that the (discrete) shifting function can take any value in a given polytope and wish to optimize against the worst-case realization. The resulting robust optimization problem possesses integer recourse variables and non-linear dependencies on the uncertain parameters. We address these difficulties as follows. First, the integer recourse is tackled heuristically through a piece-wise constant policy dictated by a prior partition of the uncertainty polytope. Second, the non-linearities are handled by a careful analysis of the dominating scenarios. The scalability and economical relevance of our models are assessed through numerical experiments performed on realistic instances. In particular, we choose one of these instances to perform a case study with simulations illustrating the possible benefit of using robust optimization.},

In this paper, we propose a generalization of the recently published interval outranking approach to deal with this kind of problems. This new method allows an easy setting of weights (including interaction weights), and other model parameters as interval numbers. The proposal also allows to set outranking relations associated with each non-elementary criterion. On this background, the INTERCLASS-nB and INTERCLASS-nC multi-criteria ordinal classification (multi-criteria sorting) methods are generalized to cope with interacting and hierarchical criteria; these methods can suggest assignments of actions to ordered classes for each non-elementary criterion. Finally, an application of the classification methods is illustrated by evaluating research and development projects.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a modelling framework which combines Data Envelopment Analysis and Markov Chains into an integrated decision aid. Markov Chains are typically used in contexts where a system (e.g. staff profile in a large organisation) is at the start of the planning horizon in a given state, and the aim is to transform the system to a new state by the end of the horizon. The planning horizon can involve several steps and the system transits to a new state after each step. The transition probabilities from one step to the next are influenced by both organisational and external (non-organisational) factors. We develop our generic methodology using as a vehicle the homogeneous Markov manpower planning system. The paper recognizes a gap in existing Markovian manpower planning methods to handle stochasticity and optimization in a more tractable manner and puts forward an approach to harness the power of DEA to fill this gap. In this context, the Decision Maker (DM) can specify potential anticipated future outcomes (e.g. personnel flows) and then use DEA to identify additional feasible courses of action through convexity. These feasible strategies can be evaluated according to the DM&#39;s judgement over potential future states of nature and then employed to guide the organisation in making interventions that would affect transition probabilities to improve the probability of attaining the ultimate state desired for the system. The paper includes a numerical illustration of the suggested approach, including data from a manpower planning model previously addressed using classical Markov modelling.},

  abstract     = {People will always consciously or unconsciously compare their cost or benefits of actions with those of others and make judgments about fairness. Aiming at consensus reaching process where decision makers have fairness concern behaviors, this paper proposes a limited cost consensus model with fairness concern. To do this, we define the fairness utility function and fairness utility level based on fairness preference theory and explore some properties. In view of this, we propose a limited cost consensus approach with fairness concern of decision makers, which can obtain a stable and balanced consensus. Through emission reduction consensus problem of Chinese manufacturing enterprises, comparative analysis and sensitivity analysis are used to explain the proposed model. Conclusions about fairness preferences, consensus cost budget, and unit compensation cost can provide significant managerial references for real-world economic and management activities.},

Since capacity of e.g. ICUs is highly restricted, this bottleneck plays an important role in the management of an efficient flow of surgical patients through the system. This paper aims to provide hospital decision makers with easy-to-follow guidelines for the daily patient scheduling decisions and presents a novel chance-constraint optimisation model to develop efficient admission templates for elective surgeries on a tactical level. With a given patient mix, we decide on the number of surgeries that can realistically be treated during a typical week, with respect to limited resources of OR and ICU and considering stochastic demand. The benefit of such templates is exemplified using a dedicated simulation model in a realistic case study. The simulation model rebuilds daily operations in OR and ICU and allows to mimic typical decision making in OR and ICU. Computational studies show that continually applying such templates as admission guidelines leads to a well-utilised OR and efficiently used ICUs. The extensive simulation studies confirm that the template plans obtained from the chance-constraint optimisation model can provide guidance for an operating room planner.},

Sensitivity analysis of CVaR is common in risk management and gradient-based optimization algorithms. In this paper, we study the infinitesimal perturbation analysis estimator for CVaR sensitivity using randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) simulation. RQMC has proved valuable in financial option pricing with a better rate of convergence compared to Monte Carlo sampling, but theoretical guarantees for this new application of RQMC shall be studied. To this end, we first prove that the RQMC-based estimator is strongly consistent under very mild conditions. Under some technical conditions, RQMC yields a mean error rate of O ( n − 1 / 2 − 1 / ( 4 d − 2 ) + ϵ ) O(n−1/2−1/(4d−2)+ϵ) for arbitrarily small ϵ &gt; 0 ϵ&amp;gt;0 , where d d represents the dimension of RQMC points and n n is the sample size. Some typical applications of CVaR sensitivity estimation are conducted to both show how the theoretical results can be applied, as well as to provide numerical results documenting the superiority of the RQMC estimator.},

  abstract     = {Conditional value at risk (CVaR), which in essence is conditional expectation (CE), is a widely used risk measure commonly applied by financial engineers. This paper generalizes the concept of CE to the expected value of a loss function given that its value falls in between the α α - and β β -quantiles of the output distribution of a simulation model. We present a simulation optimization framework capable of efficiently estimating and optimizing this CE-based problem over a discrete feasible region. In order to allow our algorithm to be applicable to a wide range of problems including those of the black-box variety, we propose a gradient- and convexity assumption-free methodology known as Adaptive Particle and Hyperball Search for Conditional Expectation (APHS-CE). Besides applying the newly-developed Adaptive Particle Search to explore the whole feasible region globally, APHS-CE also dynamically and iteratively defines hyperball-based neighborhoods and exploits the most promising region locally through Latin Hyperball Sampling to speed up and facilitate the convergence to the global optimum. Convergence of the algorithm to the global optimal solution(s) is proved. Moreover, in order to enhance the algorithm efficiency, the variance reduction method of Importance Sampling in conjunction with a mechanism, called SOCBA-1, which is based on Optimal Computing Budget Allocation (OCBA) but tailored to fit the CE-based problems, are both applied. Numerical and empirical studies were conducted to evaluate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed framework. Results show that the performance is promising and the framework is worth further investigation.},

The servers operate at different speeds and preemptions are allowed. The jobs have random release times that are not known in advance, but whenever a job is released, its due date is fixed and becomes known to the scheduler. We first consider three stochastic scheduling problems with three due date related objective functions and consider variations of the Earliest Due Date ( EDD ) rule, including the preemptive policy that at any point in time assigns the job with the Earliest Due Date to the Fastest Server ( EDD-FS ). Our optimality results turn out to be examples of stochastic scheduling problems that have relatively simple priority rules that are optimal while their deterministic counterparts do not allow such simple priority rules to be optimal. We furthermore extend our results to include a priority queueing model with m m exponential servers that operate at different speeds and preemptions being allowed. The jobs arrive according to an arbitrary renewal process, and we assume that the utilization factor of the system is less than 1. Upon a job’s release the time difference between its due date and release time is set by the draw of a random variable from a given distribution. At a job’s release time, its due date is then immediately fixed and known while its actual processing time only becomes known upon its service completion. We show that for this priority queueing model the preemptive EDD-FS rule also minimizes the limit of several due date related objective functions as the number of jobs converges to infinity.},

  abstract     = {Efficient order fulfillment processes in warehouses are a key success factor in times of increasing global retail sales volumes and same-day deliveries. To streamline order fulfillment processes, warehouse managers frequently rely on autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). By supporting human order pickers with AMRs, unproductive picker walking time can be reduced, which is essential for increasing the performance of a traditional picker-to-parts system. We study an AMR-assisted picker-to-parts system in which the warehouse is partitioned into disjoint zones, each with one order picker assigned to it. A set of customer orders is given, each associated with a due date until which its items are to be collected. Each AMR of a given fleet is responsible for transporting the items of a single batch of customer orders from the picking area to the depot. An order picker collects those batch items that are stored in her zone and transports them to a handover location. The AMR visits the handover locations and returns to the depot after collecting all batch items. The objective is to minimize the total tardiness of all customer orders. We define the resulting problem as mixed integer program and provide an efficient heuristic solution approach. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of increasing the AMR fleet size and varying travel and walking speed ratios between AMRs and order pickers. We find that a slight increase in the speed ratio leads to a larger reduction of the total tardiness compared to increasing the AMR fleet size.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the commonly observed commercial used apparel collection (UAC) programs in fashion retail supply chain operations, this paper analytically explores the associated operational challenges that firms face. First, in the basic model, we consider the case when a fashion retail brand promotes its UAC program and collects the used apparel from consumers. Depending on the conditions of the collected apparel products, the fashion retail brand will classify and either donate them for charity or send them to remanufacturing. For either case, the fashion retail brand gains a benefit. We analytically derive in closed-form the optimal promotion effort and study the mechanism for “profit” coordination. Our results indicate that many traditional supply chain contracts fail to achieve “profit” coordination. Thus, the effort cost sharing (ECS) contract is proposed and proven to be effective for “profit” coordination. Finally, to check the robustness of findings from the basic model, we examine various UAC practice related extended models, such as i) consumer coupon offering, ii) “no remanufacturing” model, iii) consumer heterogeneity in environmental consciousness, iv) own-brand collection vs any-brand collection. Our findings show that the qualitative insights continue to hold in the extended scenarios. Some novel scenario-dependent findings are also obtained. Insights derived in this paper not only contribute to the literature but also provide scientifically sound managerial guidance and insights to practitioners on how UAC programs can be best operated.},

This paper analyzes a supply chain with revenue sharing and wholesale price contracts under manufacturer rebate policy, where the stochastic multiplicative demand function depends on both retail price and manufacturer rebate. We identify Stackelberg equilibrium for the supply chain under each contract. It is our finding that under the manufacturer’s respective optimal decisions for revenue sharing and wholesale price contracts with rebates, the retailer’s optimal retail prices are the same. We recognize sufficient conditions under which a revenue sharing contract and a wholesale price contract with rebate can achieve Pareto improvement , i.e., both the manufacturer and the retailer obtain a greater expected profit, compared with the cases without rebate. A sufficient condition is found, under which a revenue sharing contract with rebate policy can achieve Kaldor–Hicks improvement , i.e., yielding a greater expected profit for the manufacturer, a lower expected profit for the retailer, and a greater expected total profit, over pure revenue sharing contract without rebate. Further, it is shown that with rebate, a revenue sharing contract can achieve Kaldor–Hicks improvement over a wholesale price contract. Finally, our findings are demonstrated using numerical studies.},

However, some deep-rooted pricing anomalies frequently observed in various markets loom large, questioning the rationality of such eagerness. One of these anomalies is the favorite-longshot bias, and sometimes its opposite, the reverse favorite-longshot-bias. We propose an equilibrium model consisting of bettors with cumulative prospect theory-based utility and heterogeneous beliefs to explain these two anomalies in a unified framework. Unlike existing results that mostly focus on one aspect of the underlying model, our model enables us to isolate and analyze the impacts of probability weighting, loss aversion, belief concentration, and belief tailedness. We show how these parameters jointly determine the properties of the equilibrium price. Empirical results also suggest this model has adequate flexibility to explain the behavior of actual historical data.},

We present two families of mathematical programming formulations. The first one is time-dependent and captures a number of characteristics of real applications at the price of using three indexes variables. The second family of formulations is not time-dependent, instead it uses connectivity properties to ensure the proper definition of routes. We compare them on a testbed of instances with different shapes of elements: second order cone (SOC) representable and polyhedral neighborhoods and polygonal chains. The computational results reported in this paper show that our models are useful and our formulations can solve to optimality medium size instances of sizes similar to other combinatorial problems including neighborhoods that have already been studied in the literature. To address larger instances we also present a heuristic algorithm that runs in two phases: clustering and Variable Neighborhood Search. This algorithm performs very well since it provides promising feasible solutions and, in addition, it can be used to initialize the solvers with feasible solutions.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops new formulations for the Strategic Berth Template Problem, which combines strategic and operational decisions for medium-term berth planning of a given set of cyclically calling ships. The strategic decisions determine the ship calls that will be served, whereas the operational ones establish the berth template that will be applied in a cyclic fashion in the planning horizon. The proposed formulations use binary variables that classify served ships depending on whether or not their service starts in their arrival cycle or in the next one. This helps modeling the problem, since a closed linear expression can be obtained for the waiting times. Constraints imposing that the availability of the berths is respected at each time period can be derived by defining additional binary variables pointing to the starting service times of the served ships. Aggregating such variables over all berths leads to a relaxed formulation, which can be solved in remarkably small computing times. Furthermore, the solution of an auxiliary subproblem produces feasible solutions to the original problem as well as a simple optimality check. Disaggregating the initial service time variables for the different berths leads to a valid formulation. Numerical results from extensive computational tests over a set of benchmark instances from the literature are presented and analyzed. The obtained results assess the excellent performance of the proposed formulations, which outperform existing ones.},

A local search is used to adjust the division of pairwise item values in order to improve the upper bound. Reduced costs from the solution of the transportation problem are used to forbid some item-to-knapsack assignments. Information from the upper bound is also used in selecting the item to branch on next. Computational experiments are carried out on three sets of benchmark instances from the literature, two sets of smaller instances with 20–35 items and 3–10 knapsacks per instance, and one set of larger instances with 40–60 items and 3–10 knapsacks per instance. Our algorithm finds and verifies optimal solutions for all small benchmark instances in less than one hour of CPU time apiece and outperforms the best previously proposed algorithms for the problem in terms of both the average computation time and the number of instances for which optimality is verified.

  abstract     = {When transporting goods, truck drivers may have to perform load transfers between two vehicles at cross-dock or transfer locations. These transfers create interdependencies between the routes of different truck drivers and require careful temporal synchronization. The situation becomes even more complicated when driver schedules must comply with customer time windows, working periods and regulatory resting requirements. Although the scheduling of hours of service for truck drivers is a well-known problem, existing algorithms cannot cope with interdependent routes. We introduce the Truck Driver Scheduling Problem with Interdependent Routes to successfully accommodate this real-world characteristic. This paper proposes a mathematical model and a label propagation algorithm to solve this new problem under the regulations of the European Union. Experiments indicate that the algorithm can quickly schedule a large number of interdependent routes and outperforms a mathematical programming approach. The algorithm produces valid schedules for multiple drivers and thus becomes a foundation for future vehicle routing algorithms that address interdependent routes and hours of service regulations.},

  abstract     = {The feasibility problem is at the core of the modeling of many problems in various areas, and the quasi-convex function usually provides a precise representation of reality in many fields such as economics, finance and management science. In this paper, we consider the quasi-convex feasibility problem (QFP), that is to find a common point of a family of sublevel sets of quasi-convex functions, and propose a unified framework of subgradient methods for solving the QFP. This paper is contributed to establish the quantitative convergence theory, including the iteration complexity and the convergence rates, of subgradient methods with the constant/dynamic stepsize rules and several general control schemes, including the α α -most violated constraints control, the s s -intermittent control and the stochastic control. An interesting finding is disclosed by iteration complexity results that the stochastic control enjoys both advantages of low computational cost requirement and low iteration complexity. More importantly, we introduce a notion of Hölder-type error bound property for the QFP, and use it to establish the linear (or sublinear) convergence rates for subgradient methods to a feasible solution of the QFP. Preliminary numerical results to the multiple Cobb-Douglas productions efficiency problem indicate the powerful modeling capability of the QFP and show the high efficiency and stability of subgradient methods for solving the QFP.},

Originally designed for solving network flow problems for which it runs in strongly polynomial time, most of its properties are preserved. This is at the price of adapting the fundamental decomposition theorem of a network flow solution together with various definitions: that of a cycle and the way to calculate its cost, the residual problem, and the improvement factor at the end of a phase. We also use the primal and dual necessary and sufficient optimality conditions stated on the residual problem for establishing the pricing step giving its name to the algorithm. It turns out that the successive solutions need not be basic, there are no degenerate pivots, and the improving directions are potentially interior in addition to those on edges. For solving an m × n m×n linear program, it requires a pseudo-polynomial number O ( n Δ ) O(nΔ) of so-called phases, where Δ Δ depends on the number of rows and the coefficient matrix.},

Batching can lead to reduced production costs, but depending how the jobs are grouped into a batch can lead to better or worse delivery times of products. Scheduling jobs on batch processing machines requires grouping decisions in addition to the conventional assignment and sequencing decisions. Parallel batching is important in such diverse areas such as semiconductor manufacturing, aircraft manufacturing, shoe manufacturing, and healthcare. This paper surveys the literature on parallel batching and will focus primarily on deterministic scheduling. We provide a taxonomy of parallel batching problems, distinguishing the compatible case where all jobs can be used to form a batch from the incompatible families setting where only jobs from the same family can be used to form a batch. Makespan, flow time-, and due date-related measures are considered. We discuss scheduling approaches for single machines, parallel machines, and other environments such as flow shops and job shops. In addition to the discussion of archived and current papers, we discuss also recent trends in scheduling jobs on machines with parallel batch processing. Finally, we provide a discussion of future research directions for p-batch scheduling.},

However, logistic regression remains the benchmark in the credit risk industry mainly because the lack of interpretability of ensemble methods is incompatible with the requirements of financial regulators. In this paper, we propose a high-performance and interpretable credit scoring method called penalised logistic tree regression (PLTR), which uses information from decision trees to improve the performance of logistic regression. Formally, rules extracted from various short-depth decision trees built with original predictive variables are used as predictors in a penalised logistic regression model. PLTR allows us to capture non-linear effects that can arise in credit scoring data while preserving the intrinsic interpretability of the logistic regression model. Monte Carlo simulations and empirical applications using four real credit default datasets show that PLTR predicts credit risk significantly more accurately than logistic regression and compares competitively to the random forest method.},

We apply machine learning approaches for intertemporal analysis of U.S. corporate bonds’ recovery rates. We show that machine learning techniques significantly outperform traditional approaches not only out-of-sample as documented in the literature but also in various out-of-time prediction setups. The newly applied sparse power expectation propagation approach provides the most compelling out-of-time prediction results. Motivated by the association of systematic factors with the time-varying characteristic of recovery rates, we study the effect of text-based news measures to account for bond investors’ expectations about the future which translate into market-based recovery rates. Especially during recessions, government-related news are associated with higher recovery rates. Although machine learning is a data-driven approach rather than considering economic intuition for ranking a group of predictors, the most informative groups of predictors for recovery rate prediction are nevertheless economically meaningful.},

As a time-change, we use the inverse of an α α -stable subordinator. Performing such a time-change allows to incorporate two particular features in the survival probability curves implied by the model. Firstly, it introduces random periods of time where the survival probability is frozen, thereby modeling periods of time where the viability of the company is not threatened. Secondly, the time-change implies possible sharp drops in the survival probability. This feature corresponds to the occurrence of one-time events that threaten the creditworthiness of the company. We show that the joint probability density function and Laplace transform of the time-changed intensity and associate compensator are solutions of fractional Fokker–Planck equations. After a discussion regarding approximation of Caputo fractional derivatives, we describe a simple and fast numerical method to solve the Fokker–Planck equation of the Laplace transform. This Laplace transform is used to obtain the survival probabilities implied by our model. Finally, we use our results to calibrate the model to real market data and show that it leads to an improvement of the fit.},

In a committee operating under a democratic governance structure, all members have the right to vote, but the majority of voters ultimately decide which projects to undertake. Alternatively, in a committee operating under an elite governance structure, the decision is made only by a restricted number of voters. Therefore, in an elite governance, there are decision makers or “elite” members, and non-decision makers or “common” members. In this article, we study how committee members under either a democratic or elite governance structure interact and communicate information to each other, and ultimately make a decision about a project with uncertain revenues. We find that the efficient committee governance structure, i.e., the one that maximizes the expected surplus of the committee, can be determined by focusing on one specific communication between elite and common committee members. Further, we establish a sufficient condition on the revenues distribution for each governance structure to be efficient. Finally, when this sufficient condition on the revenues distribution does not hold, we find that governance efficiency depends on the probability of the decision makers to learn the true value of the revenues being sufficiently high or the one of the non-decision makers being sufficiently low or both these two conditions.},

  abstract     = {Liberalized gas markets in Europe are organized as entry-exit regimes so that gas trade and transport are decoupled. The decoupling is achieved via the announcement of technical capacities by the transmission system operator (TSO) at all entry and exit points of the network. These capacities can be booked by gas suppliers and customers in long-term contracts. Only traders who have booked capacities up-front can “nominate” quantities for injection or withdrawal of gas via a day-ahead market. To ensure feasibility of the nominations for the physical network, the TSO must only announce technical capacities for which all possibly nominated quantities are transportable. In this paper, we use a four-level model of the entry-exit gas market to analyze possible welfare losses associated with the decoupling of gas trade and transport. In addition to the multilevel structure, the model contains robust aspects to cover the conservative nature of the European entry-exit system. We provide several reformulations to obtain a single-level mixed-integer quadratic problem. The overall model of the considered market regime is extremely challenging and we thus have to make the main assumption that gas flows are modeled as potential-based linear flows. Using the derived single-level reformulation of the problem, we show that the feasibility requirements for technical capacities imply significant welfare losses due to unused network capacity. Furthermore, we find that the specific structure of the network has a considerable influence on the optimal choice of technical capacities. Our results thus show that trade and transport are not decoupled in the long term. As a further source of welfare losses and discrimination against individual actors, we identify the minimum prices for booking capacity at the individual nodes.},

Financial institutions use ML for building risk scorecards that support a range of credit-related decisions. Yet, the literature on fair ML in credit scoring is scarce. The paper makes three contributions. First, we revisit statistical fairness criteria and examine their adequacy for credit scoring. Second, we catalog algorithmic options for incorporating fairness goals in the ML model development pipeline. Last, we empirically compare different fairness processors in a profit-oriented credit scoring context using real-world data. The empirical results substantiate the evaluation of fairness measures, identify suitable options to implement fair credit scoring, and clarify the profit-fairness trade-off in lending decisions. We find that multiple fairness criteria can be approximately satisfied at once and recommend separation as a proper criterion for measuring the fairness of a scorecard. We also find fair in-processors to deliver a good balance between profit and fairness and show that algorithmic discrimination can be reduced to a reasonable level at a relatively low cost.

  abstract     = {With the increasing penetration of renewable generating units, especially in remote areas not well connected with load demand, there are growing interests to co-optimize generation and transmission expansion planning (GTEP) in power systems. Due to the volatility in renewable generation, a planner needs to include the operating decisions into the planning model to guarantee feasibility. However, solving the GTEP problem with hourly operating decisions throughout the planning horizon is computationally intractable. Therefore, we propose several spatial and temporal simplifications to the problem. Built on the generation expansion planning (GEP) formulation of Lara et al. (2018), we propose a mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the GTEP problem. Three different formulations, i.e., a big-M formulation, a hull formulation, and an alternative big-M formulation, are reported for transmission expansion. We theoretically compare the tightness of the LP relaxations of the three formulations. The proposed MILP GTEP model typically involves millions or tens of millions of variables, which makes the model not directly solvable by the commercial solvers. To address this computational challenge, we propose a nested Benders decomposition algorithm and a tailored Benders decomposition algorithm that exploit the structure of the GTEP problem. Using a case study from Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), we are able to show that the proposed tailored Benders decomposition outperforms the nested Benders decomposition. The coordination in the optimal generation and transmission expansion decisions from the ERCOT study implies that there is an additional value in solving GEP and TEP simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {The efficiency calculated from the conventional slacks-based measure (SBM) model is the minimum in terms of efficiency scores, and the corresponding target point requires more effort for an inefficient decision making unit (DMU) to become efficient. To find the closest target point to the assessed DMU, several models have been proposed via calculating the maximum efficiency. This paper proposes a set of models to measure the maximum SBM efficiency for DMUs with multi-period data. It is found that, when the non-Archimedean number is not in effective in claculating the radial efficiency, the maximum SBM efficiency is greater than or equal to the radial efficiency. The corresponding target point is easier for an inefficient DMU to reach. This efficiency is more reliable than radial efficiencies because the latter may be affected by the non-Archimedean number. Furthermore, the SBM efficiency can be decomposed into the product of the input and output efficiencies. Under the different-multiplier models, the DMU efficiency can also be decomposed into a weighted average of the individual year efficiencies. The factor and year that cause the unsatisfactory performance can thus be detected. A case of Taiwanese commercial banks is used as an illustration.},

  abstract     = {Preference aggregation in Group Decision Making (GDM) is a substantial problem that has received a lot of research attention. Decision problems involving fuzzy preference relations constitute an important class within GDM. Legacy approaches dealing with the latter type of problems can be classified into indirect approaches, which involve deriving a group preference matrix as an intermediate step, and direct approaches, which deduce a group preference ranking based on individual preference rankings. Although the work on indirect approaches has been extensive in the literature, there is still a scarcity of research dealing with the direct approaches. In this paper we present a direct approach towards aggregating several fuzzy preference relations on a set of alternatives into a single weighted ranking of the alternatives. By mapping the pairwise preferences into transitions probabilities, we are able to derive a preference ranking from the stationary distribution of a stochastic matrix. Interestingly, the ranking of the alternatives obtained with our method corresponds to the optimizer of the Maximum Likelihood Estimation of a particular Bradley-Terry-Luce model. Furthermore, we perform a theoretical sensitivity analysis of the proposed method supported by experimental results and illustrate our approach towards GDM with a concrete numerical example. This work opens avenues for solving GDM problems using elements of probability theory, and thus, provides a sound theoretical fundament as well as plausible statistical interpretation for the aggregation of expert opinions in GDM.},

  abstract     = {In this paper good consensus is associated with a high level of group satisfaction and a low level of dissatisfaction. A new method to improve consensus through a reformulation of the original group multi-objective optimization problem is introduced. For each point in the feasible decision set, the level of satisfaction or dissatisfaction from each group member is determined by multi-criteria ordinal classification approaches. Intense satisfaction and dissatisfaction are both modeled. Group satisfaction (respectively, dissatisfaction) is maximized (resp. minimized), finding the best possible consensus solutions in correspondence with a current stage of closeness among group members’ preferences, judgments, beliefs, and conservatism attitudes. Logic models are introduced to evaluate conditions for best consensus. Imperfect information (imprecision, uncertainty, ill-definition, arbitrariness) on the values of objective functions, required and available resources, and decision model parameters is handled by using interval numbers. Two different kinds of multi-criteria decision model are considered: i) an interval outranking approach and ii) an interval weighted-sum value function. The proposal can handle very general cases of group multi-objective optimization problems. The method is illustrated by solving a real size multi-objective project portfolio optimization problem using evolutionary computation tools.},

In contrast to the Multi-Attribute Value Theory methods, Electre-Score does not construct a value function for each criterion to proceed then to the aggregation into a single value. Instead, Electre-Score makes use of the outranking relations to make a comparison with sets of reference actions (to which a score is assigned) and assigns a score range to each action and a representative score in the range to each action. This is a more robust way of proceeding given the fragility of a single score. The reference actions have similar nature and characteristics of limiting profiles in Electre Tri-nB and the reference scores are assigned to them through the application of the deck of cards technique. Because this method uses outranking relations, it makes also possible to take into account the imperfect knowledge of data and to avoid systematic compensatory effects.

This research presents a novel approach to formally model, analyze, and optimize equity of transplant waiting times and probabilities using queuing models, network flows, and Rawls’ Theory of Justice. The presented formal models address inequities resulting from blood type incompatibilities, which are interrelated to ethnic differences in patient and donor rates. Moreover, we present results of an application to the deceased donor kidney wait lists in the United States. The findings indicate that the allocation policies currently practiced red can virtually resolve blood type related inequities in average waiting time and transplant probability.},

The principal seeks to reduce the expected waiting time by incentivizing the agent to modify the service rate through a performance-based payout. We show that a large range of improvement is achievable by selecting event-dependent service rates. However, the agent’s payout can grow high in the realized improvement, suggesting to limit the use of incentives for event-dependent service rates to a bounded waiting time improvement. When the service rate after an arrival is contractible, the agent should be paid more in contexts with a low variability inter-arrival time. The opposite conclusion holds when the average service rate is contractible. Further, we provide a criterion to determine when it is optimal for the agent to accelerate after an arrival or after a service completion.

We develop a novel model framework considering the risks resulting from uncertainties on both supply and demand sides that the manufacturer may delay part of delivery and the social planner may order under or over demand. Based on the framework, we first discuss the production and procurement decision-making problem in a centralized and a decentralized system. By comparing the two systems, we present the existence and extent of the inefficiency in the influenza vaccine supply chain. Further, we propose a procurement strategy that provides the social planner with two ordering opportunities and explore the conditions under which the two members would be willing to accept the strategy. The results show that such a strategy is effective on improving the influenza vaccine supply chain coordination.

Planning complexity is compounded by uncertainty in whether each supplier will deliver on time, in addition to the existence of an option for reserving capacity with a perfectly reliable supplier and the presence of a spot market for the input with an uncertain price. We apply analytical methods including two-stage stochastic programming with recourse, nonlinear optimization, and exact and efficient model-based heuristic solution methods. We show that for a selected supplier, the newsvendor’s conditional service level, given that the supplier delivers on time, equals a critical ratio value determined by the supplier’s cost and reliability parameters. Post-optimality analysis reveals interesting insights on the way reliability and cost parameters interact to determine whether a supplier receives a positive order allocation, as well as the impact of payment schemes on supplier selection decisions. The analysis clarifies an insightful relationship between the conditional service level and a critical ratio value for each selected supplier. The results also sharpen insights on the way relative supplier reliability and cost parameter values interact to determine an optimal supply portfolio. Furthermore, the ability to interpret a perfectly reliable supplier with a capacity reservation cost as an equivalent unreliable supplier reveals additional insights on the relative value of capacity reservation and facilitates direct comparison among seemingly disparate supply options.},

  abstract     = {Improved supply chain optimization strategies can play a major role in addressing global food security and safety in years to come. In particular, tighter safety regulations, changing consumer quality requirements and more stringent market competition call upon integrated supply chain decision-making frameworks that explicitly consider product quality control. This effort requires metrics of quality that accurately reflect product physico-chemical properties, as well as consumer purchasing preferences. However, a critical challenge linked to embedding the complex dynamics of the evolution of product quality in time within supply chain models is the large-scale nature of the ensuing optimization problems, which are computationally intractable even for moderate-size, single-item systems. In the present work, we introduce a computationally efficient optimal production and distribution planning framework for perishable products having multiple quality attributes that evolve in time as a function of environmental conditions during shipment and storage. We also propose a model reduction strategy and a decomposition framework that enhance the scalability of our approach. We perform extensive numerical simulations using different network instances to validate our theoretical findings, as well as to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed supply chain management scheme.},

We study the interaction among the firm, its supplier, and the external capital market investors who assess the firm’s interim equity price. We first analyze when it is beneficial for the firm to acquire demand forecast information, and if such information is acquired, when the firm should disclose it to the supplier and investors. Then, we investigate how the firm’s information acquisition and disclosure decisions influence the investors’ and the supplier’s pricing strategies. We show that the optimal information disclosure policy for the firm is highly dependent on the corporate myopia level (CML): when the CML is low, the firm discloses low demand information only; when the CML is medium, the firm always withholds demand information; and when the CML is high, the firm discloses high demand information only. Our findings provide a novel plausible explanation to firms’ non-disclosure behaviors commonly observed in practice and highlight the importance of considering the interaction between the supply chain and the capital market.},

Motivated by the practical situations, the sequence-dependent setup time and DeJong’s learning effect are considered in seru scheduling problems, and the objective is to minimize the makespan. The seru scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming (MIP), and then reformulated to a set partitioning master problem and some independent subproblems by employing the logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD) method. Subsequently, the set partitioning master problem is used to assign jobs to serus of SPS, and the subproblems are applied to find the optimal schedules in each seru given the assignment of the master problem. Finally, computational studies are made, and results indicate that the LBBD method is able to return high-quality schedules for solving seru scheduling problems.},

It was used for identifying bi-clusters in gene expression data or to extract a submatrix that is then visualized in a circular plot. The state-of-the-art results for MSS are obtained using an advanced Constraint Programing approach that combines a custom filtering algorithm with a Large Neighborhood Search. We improve the state-of-the-art approach by introducing new upper bounds based on linear and mixed-integer programming formulations, along with dedicated pruning algorithms.

  abstract     = {One-dimensional bin-packing is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem which is strongly NP-hard. It consists of allocating a given set of items of different sizes into bins of the same capacity to minimize the number of bins used. The capacity of each bin cannot be exceeded. This paper deals with some variants of this problem to take into account the cases when there are items with uncertain sizes. The goal is to obtain robust solutions taking into account possible variations of item sizes around their nominal values. First, two robust approaches are considered which are based on a stability radius calculation, to ensure that the stability radius , measured either with the Manhattan or Chebyshev norm, is not below a given threshold. Then, a complementary robust approach is applied which is based on a relative resiliency calculation. To solve to optimality these robust variants of the bin-packing problem, a compact 0-1 linear programming formulation, which is also valid for the standard bin-packing problem, is introduced. Then, a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition is suggested in order to provide a set-cover reformulation with a stronger linear relaxation, but an exponential number of columns. Finally, to obtain integer optimal solutions, a branch-and-price algorithm is developed, whose linear relaxation of the set-cover formulation is solved by a dynamic column generation. Numerical experiments are conducted on adapted benchmark sets from the literature. The performance of the branch-and-price algorithm allows us to investigate what protection against uncertainty is offered by each approach, and at which cost of robustness.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the Graph-Connected Clique-Partitioning Problem (GCCP), a clustering optimization model in which units are characterized by both individual and relational data. This problem, introduced by Benati, Puerto, and Rodríguez-Chía (2017) under the name of Connected Partitioning Problem, shows that the combination of the two data types improves the clustering quality in comparison with other methodologies. Nevertheless, the resulting optimization problem is difficult to solve; only small-sized instances can be solved exactly, large-sized instances require the application of heuristic algorithms. In this paper we improve the exact and the heuristic algorithms previously proposed. Here, we provide a new Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation, that solves larger instances, but at the cost of using an exponential number of variables. In order to limit the number of variables necessary to calculate the optimum, the new ILP formulation is solved implementing a branch-and-price (B&amp;P) algorithm. The resulting pricing problem is itself a new combinatorial model: the Maximum-weighted Graph-Connected Single-Clique problem (MGCSC), that we solve testing various Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations and proposing a new fast “random shrink” heuristic. In this way, we are able to improve the previous algorithms: The B&amp;P method outperforms the computational times of the previous MILP algorithms and the new random shrink heuristic, when applied to GCCP, is both faster and more accurate than the previous heuristic methods. Moreover, the combination of column generation and random shrink is itself a new MILP-relaxed matheuristic that can be applied to large instances too. Its main advantage is that all heuristic local optima are combined together in a restricted MILP, consisting in the application of the exact B&amp;P method but solving heuristically the pricing problem.},

Though, many methods have in common that the results to be assessed are mainly determined by the inputs and outputs of the activities which are to be evaluated. Based on both production and decision theory, our comprehensive framework integrates and systematically distinguishes specific types of production-based performance assessment. It allows to examine and categorise the existing literature on such approaches. Our review focuses on sources which explicitly apply concepts or methods of multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA). We did not find any elaborated methodology that fully integrates MCDA with production theory. At least, a basic approach to multicriteria performance analysis, which generalises the methodology of data envelopment analysis, appears to be well-grounded on production theory. It was already presented in this journal in 2001 and has rarely been noticed in the literature until now. A short overview outlines its recent insights and main findings. A key finding is that a category mistake prevails among well-known methodologies of efficiency measurement like DEA. It may imply invalid empirical results because the inputs and outputs of production processes are confused with resulting impacts destroying or creating values (to be minimised or maximised, respectively). We conclude by defining open problems and by indicating prospective research directions.},

The resulting regression coefficients are sparse, meaning that many of them are set to zero, hereby selecting the most relevant predictors. A distinct feature of the method is its robustness with respect to outliers in the cells of the data matrix. The excellent performance of this robust variable selection and prediction method is shown in a simulation study. A real data application on car fuel consumption demonstrates its usefulness.},

This research aims to provide insights and evidence for data-driven decision making in reforming individual health insurance markets and optimizing individual health insurance operations. We employ traditional, non-oriented slack-based, order-α partial frontier, bootstrapped bias-corrected, and modified context-dependent data envelopment analysis (DEA) models, as well as generalized linear, Tobit, and residual inclusion regression models. We find that higher competition or expansion is not associated with higher consumer efficiency or societal efficiency. Our results also indicate that, in minimizing premiums or expenses given enrollment and utilization of medical services, individual health plans are less efficient than Medicaid managed care plans, but more efficient than Medicare Advantage plans. Our findings imply that, for individual plans, expanding interstate markets is not accompanied with lower premiums or expenses without the sacrifice of medical services. This research suggests that it should be advisable to structure individual health insurance markets following the Medicaid managed care model but not the Medicare Advantage model. To “Medicaid-ize” individual markets, we propose to structure the individual coverage in two layers: a conditionally subsidized Medicaid managed care program with mandatory essential benefits, and an unsubsidized “Medicaid Supplement” program for optional additional coverages.},

At the same time, it is also frequently rejected on the grounds that it ignores the higher moments of non-Gaussian returns. However, higher-moment portfolios are associated with many different objective functions, are numerically more complex, and exacerbate estimation risk. In this paper, we reconcile mean-variance portfolio theory with non-Gaussian returns by identifying, among all portfolios on the mean-variance efficient frontier, the one that optimizes a chosen higher-moment criterion. Numerical simulations and an empirical analysis show, for three higher-moment objective functions and adjusting for transaction costs, that the proposed portfolio strikes a favorable tradeoff between specification and estimation error. Specifically, in terms of out-of-sample Sharpe ratio and higher moments, it outperforms the global-optimal portfolio, and also the global-minimum-variance portfolio except when using monthly returns for which estimation error is more prominent.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores a problem faced by many coastal states worldwide: Should the rights to fish in their exclusive economic zones be attributed to national firms or sold to foreign countries/firms? The European Union for instance, with the so-called Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreements gives financial and technical support to developing countries in exchange for fishing rights in their jurisdiction. In order to understand and quantify the basis upon which those agreements are drawn up, we propose a framework based on a multistage game that can be used as a tool to evaluate the fairness of natural resource agreements in general, including fishery ones. By capturing how much it is worth for coastal states to give access to their fishery resources to foreign fleets, this framework can help authorities to decide on a fair sharing of resource rents during negotiations. The problem is addressed through a two-country game, in which “home” represents the resource owner, and “foreign” the one that seeks access to the resource. In each country, there are two decision makers: authorities and harvesting firms. Two markets for selling the resource are considered, one at home and one abroad, where prices are determined endogenously. We begin with the case of exogenous quotas. In a symmetric equilibrium, both firms are active when the foreign authority maximises welfare, but only the home firm is active when it maximises profit. Under cost asymmetry, the home authority has a pool of mutually exclusive price strategies that depend on market conditions and induce a plethora of outcomes. When quotas are endogenous, the shape of optimal price regions changes and the distinct number of pricing options increases.},

  abstract     = {Companies rely widely on coopetition, that is, cooperation with competitors, to foster their innovation. However, despite its increasing popularity, the impact of coopetition on innovation remains unclear. Different theories predict different results, and empirical evidence suggests that coopetition can either improve or reduce innovation performance, or even make no impact. The lack of consensus makes further exploration of this important relationship essential. Our study attempts to shed new light on the impact of sourcing from competitors on innovation, using a data-driven exploratory model that needs no prior specification of the direction and form of this relationship. We use a recently developed analytical method based on the preference disaggregation approach to analyze data from a sample of 112 firms operating in the petroleum, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries. We find that sourcing from competitors fosters the innovation performance of firms with financial constraints (small firms receiving no financial support from the government for innovation). In contrast, our results show that sourcing from competitors has a non-linear negative impact on large and small firms receiving such financial support, and that sourcing from competitors is much riskier for small firms in this category. Our findings contribute to the coopetition for innovation literature by highlighting that the relationship between sourcing from competitors and innovation performance depends on firm characteristics, i.e., size and financial capability. Our use of a preference disaggregation method confirms its value when studying relationships between variables where the conceptual and empirical evidence leaves this relationship unclear.},

  abstract     = {In many container terminals, containers are piled vertically and horizontally in the terminal yard, limited mainly by the dimensions of the yard crane. Import and export containers are typically stacked separately. An external truck can access the terminal to pick up an import container only after making an appointment reserving a pickup time. To reduce truck waiting time inside the terminal, container pickup appointments are normally scheduled on a time window basis. However, when a truck arrives at the terminal yard at the appointed time, it is common for the target container not to be at the top of its stack, resulting in unproductive relocations to remove all the containers stacked above the target container and thus increasing the truck&#39;s waiting time. To minimize the number of relocations, the Block Relocation Problem ( BRP ) is usually solved independently, without consideration of appointment scheduling. In this paper, we introduce a new optimization problem—the Block Relocation Problem with Appointment Scheduling ( BRPAS )—to jointly address the two issues. To solve the problem, two binary IP models are proposed, and examples from the literature are solved to confirm the performance of the two models. The proposed formulations are further extended to cover several operational aspects related to the flexibility of container pickup operations. Results show that the proposed approach can improve container relocation operations at terminal yards by coordinating with appointment scheduling.},

In particular, constraints on carbon emissions reduction have become imperative for various jurisdictions around the world. The challenge is that energy sources have different risk profiles in terms of supply uncertainties, operational (in-)flexibilities, high/low carbon emission rates, rare but extreme accident costs, etc. In this work, we propose a novel model for optimal expansion planning to incorporate this heterogeneity. Trade-offs occur due to different characteristics of energy sources. We study optimal long-term capacity expansion planning while achieving carbon emissions reduction targets. This is accomplished under different risk measures such as mean and value-at-risk. Numerical experiments are conducted based on the data of South Korea, from which we observe notable and combined effects of operational flexibility, emissions reduction, and extremal risks.},

The aim of the project is to provide enhanced access to the new prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment technology. Hence, location and allocation decisions need to be optimised to facilitate this goal. A fuzzy logic based methodology based on measures of prevalence and current access to treatment centres is developed in order to identify a set of priority locales (postcode districts) for improved access. An extended goal programming facility location model is then formulated which incorporates both priority and general postcode access measures. The p-median, p-centre and coverage variants of facility location are modelled via a set of six goals. A comprehensive weight sensitivity analysis is used to generate 25 distinct solutions across the six-dimensional objective space. Analysis of the results with respect to methodology, location and allocation decisions, number of robotic devices and trade-offs between goals is undertaken and conclusions are drawn.},

This paper analyzes the use of HB draws for shares of choice predictions. Five different choice rules are compared: the first choice rule applied to HB draws, the logit choice rule applied to HB draws, the randomized first choice rule, the traditional first choice rule and the traditional logit choice rule. Each two different holdout choice scenarios are constructed containing one time two extremely similar and the other time very unique alternatives to assess how well the choice rules tolerate the IIA property in predicting choice shares. We present a Monte Carlo study to systematically explore shares of choice predictions based on the different choice rules and further verify whether our findings hold in empirical settings. The key finding of our Monte Carlo study is that using HB draws either combined with the first choice rule or the logit choice rule substantially improves choice share predictions when compared to the other choice rules, regardless of the type of holdout choice scenario. While the logit choice rule applied to HB draws performs a touch better for simulated data, the first choice rule applied to HB draws provides the best choice share predictions for each of the five empirical data sets. Using HB draws does not only provide the best predictive validity but, more importantly, it is theoretically correct when applying a Bayesian estimation approach to CBC data.},

Utilizing a hybrid method, the CGA combines a genetic algorithm with dynamic programming (DP); it is a fast alternative to an ILP solver for finding efficient solutions, particularly for large dimensions. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used as a base multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Real data are used for target trajectories, from a case study of application of a surveillance boat to measure greenhouse-gas emissions of ships on the Baltic sea. The CGA ’s performance is evaluated in comparison to ILP solutions in terms of accuracy and computation efficiency. Results over multiple runs indicate convergence to the efficient frontier, with a considerable computation speed-up relative to the ILP solver. The study stays as a model for hybridizing evolutionary optimization and DP methods together in solving complex real-world problems.},

This study determines the evolutionary stable strategy for the pharma-distributors’ population, and finds which marketing strategy of the pharma-distributors will ultimately be adopted by the majority of them. We investigate a supply chain (SC), including one pharma-manufacturer and a population of pharma-distributors where the pharma-distributors can either offer a credit time scheme or adopt a pricing strategy for customers’ convenience, using an evolutionary game theory approach. The uncertainty of customer default risk is incorporated into the pharma-distributors’ and pharma-manufacturer&#39;s payoffs. Both numerical and parametric sensitivity analyses are provided to give insights into the way SC managers use towards demand promotion. The results reveal that the credit time option considering the uncertain default risk is the evolutionary stable strategy for the pharma-distributors in the long term. Moreover, the findings demonstrate that under intense competition on the pricing strategy, the credit time scheme will be preferred by the majority of the population of pharma-distributors. However, under intense competition on the credit time scheme, the pricing policy will be employed by the majority of the pharma-distributors.},

When there are data that need to be estimated, a group of experts is consulted. The opinions of the experts can be aggregated at either the data level, based on which the efficiency is calculated, or the efficiency level, where the efficiencies calculated from the data provided by individual experts are aggregated. However, the results may not be consistent, which leads to a puzzling situation as which result to follow. In this paper, a method of determining appropriate weights by which the opinions of the experts can be used to calculate the efficiency of alternatives is proposed. One radial model and one slacks-based measure (SBM) model are constructed based on this idea. It is shown that, for both models the results obtained from aggregating the opinions at the data level and at the efficiency level are the same. The final efficiencies are thus reliable. A case of a robot selection problem for a manufacturing company in Taiwan is used for the purpose of illustration. The results show that the radial efficiency is dependent on the non-Archimedean number and will overstate the performance of the robot. The SBM efficiency, which does not have this drawback, is more reliable than the radial efficiency to be used for ranking. A robot is suitably selected based on the SBM efficiency.},

The gift can either be transfered upon meeting, as in traditional rendezvous, or it can be dropped off by player II at a location he passes, in the hope it will be found by player I. The gift might be a water bottle for a traveller lost in the desert; a supply cache for Captain Scott in the Antarctic; or important information (left as a gift). The common aim of the two players is to minimize the time taken for I to either meet II or find the gift. We find optimal agent paths and drop off times when the search region is a line, the initial distance between the players is known and one or both of the players can leave gifts. A novel and important technique introduced in this paper is the use of families of linear programs to solve this and previous rendezvous problems. Previously, the approach was to guess the answer and then prove it was optimal. Our work has applications to other forms of rendezvous on the line: we can solve the symmetric version (players must use the same strategy) with two gifts and we show that there are no asymmetric solutions to this two gifts problem. We also solve the GiftStart problem, where the gift or gifts must be dropped at the start of the game. Furthermore, we can solve the Minmax version of the game where the objective function is to minimize the maximum rendezvous time. This problem admits variations where players have 0,1 or 2 gifts at disposal. In particular, we show that the classical Wait For Mommy strategy is optimal for this setting.},

In contrast to existing literature, we incorporate fairness in the form of welfare dominance, ensuring that the resultant distribution of benefits to beneficiaries is at least as good as some reference distribution with respect to a set of social welfare functions that satisfy commonly accepted efficiency and fairness related axioms. We introduce a practical means to parameterize the problem, which allows for excluding welfare functions that are deemed insufficiently or overly sensitive to inequality. This allows for analyzing the impact of changes in inequality aversion on efficiency, thus revealing the trade-off between efficiency and fairness. We develop tractable reformulations for the resulting non-linear multi-level optimization problems. We then extend this approach for cases where resources are allocated to groups of individuals with different sizes. We demonstrate the potential use of the suggested framework on two case studies: a workload allocation problem and a healthcare provisioning problem.},

This study investigates the response of competing original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) when the developer strategically updates the platform quality. Consumers have two-dimensional valuations of the product: one valuation for the device provided by the OEM and another valuation for the platform provided by the developer. The developer offers two types of agreements: acceptance and rejection of preinstallation of core services that profit the developer. OEMs can preinstall the core services and pay nothing to use the platform, or they can pay a wholesale price for the platform and reject the installation of the core services. We propose a game-theoretic model to examine the strategic agreement choices of dominant and weak OEMs when the developer strategically offers an updated platform quality to enhance a weak OEM&#39;s competitiveness. We find that the developer benefits from the OEMs’ acceptance only when the exogenous wholesale price for the dominant OEM is low and the cost difference is moderate. Also, when the research and development (R&amp;D) efficiency is high, an increase in the cost difference induces a conversion from acceptance to rejection for the dominant OEM, and an opposite outcome for the weak OEM. One OEM&#39;s installation acceptance may enhance or weaken the advantage of the other OEM&#39;s acceptance for the consumer surplus, depending on the value of the R&amp;D efficiency. Several extensions are examined to complement the basic model, and implications behind each strategic choice are revealed.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the concept of Design for Environment (DfE) is getting more and more important and popular for sustainable operations. Observations from real-world practices and extant literature indicate that currently, companies do not have strong incentive to establish DfE. To this end, this paper proposes the use of an environmental tax to enhance DfE, which will contribute to reducing wastes from the origins, improving the environmental performance and maximizing the social welfare. In this paper, by building a stylized analytical model, we examine three forms of environmental taxes (linear tax, constant tax and zero tax) and evaluate how they affect the producer&#39;s optimal DfE level. We interestingly find that the “constant tax” does not encourage sustainable product design and the “zero tax” is even better than the “constant tax”. On the contrary, the “linear tax” can promote sustainable product design and can be regarded as the best. We further discover that the “linear tax” can help balance the DfE level, the stakeholders’ benefits and the social welfare performance. The leveraging effect of marginal DfE allowance in the “linear tax” is surprisingly important and useful. Finally, we extend the basic model to cover four cases to check the robustness of the analytical results in the basic model and several important managerial insights for the development of sustainable product design are generated from the stakeholders and environment perspectives.},

  abstract     = {In this study, the periodic train timetabling problem is formulated using a time-space graph formulation that exploits the properties of a symmetric timetable. Three solution methods are proposed and compared where solutions are built by what we define as a dive-and-cut-and-price procedure. An LP relaxed version of the problem with a subset of constraints is solved using column generation where each column corresponds to the train paths of a line. Violated constraints are added by separation and a heuristic process is applied to help to find integer solutions. The passenger travel time is computed based on a solution timetable and Benders’ optimality cuts are generated allowing the method to integrate the routing of the passengers. We propose two large neighborhood search methods where the solution is iteratively destroyed and repaired into a new one and one random iterative method. The problem is tested on the morning rush hour period of the Regional and InterCity train network of Zealand, Denmark. The solution approaches show robust performance in a variety of scenarios, being able to find good quality solutions in terms of travel time and path length relatively fast. The inclusion of the proposed Benders’ cuts provide stronger relaxations to the problem. In addition, the graph formulation covers different real-life constraints and has the potential to easily be extended to accommodate more constraints.},

  abstract     = {The pricing and reverse logistics network design problem in remanufacturing has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to increasingly serious environmental problems. In this study, we consider a pricing and reverse logistics network design problem with price-dependent return quality uncertainty. To handle the high uncertainty in return quality, we propose a distributionally robust risk-averse model to safeguard the profits of investors in extreme situations. We propose a Benders decomposition approach to solve the proposed model. It is enhanced through valid inequalities, local branching, in-out variant methods and scenario-based aggregated cuts. Computational experiments demonstrate that the distributionally robust model can effectively hedge against high uncertainty and that the enhanced Benders decomposition methods significantly outperform their classical counterparts and the off-the-shelf solver Gurobi. Lastly, managerial insights are explored, and future research directions are outlined.},

  abstract     = {Frequency competition is critical for a full-service airline in gaining market share, and adopting a proper strategy can improve an airline’s profits. This study proposes a new equilibrium programming model with flow balance to address frequency competition on airports network with time slot constraints. We first show that a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium may not always exist, and thus forming a pure strategy profile in frequency competition among airlines may naturally lead to deviation from current frequency. Therefore, we formulate the problem as a programming model with a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. To avoid shocks from dramatic frequency changes across the network, airlines tend to fine-tune frequencies on select segments during each adjustment. We propose a procedure to generate a computationally tractable amount of representative strategies from a finite set of feasible strategies to demonstrate mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. We conduct an empirical analysis using an example in which industry profitability increased by as much as 7.89\%. We then extend the model to formulate frequency competition among metal-neutral alliances. The results show that forming metal-neutral alliances can improve total industry profits by 10.59\%. In particular, a sensitivity analysis with real data on the tolerance of flow imbalance demonstrates that deducting the potential costs due to the relaxation of flow balance between congested airports may earn additional total industry profits in a frequency competition.},

One feature is that a customer accepts to be visited several times, i.e., splitting a customer demand is allowed. The other feature is that a customer may be used as an intermediate location to collect and deliver commodity temporarily. The problem is called Split-Delivery One-Commodity Pickup-and-Delivery Travelling Salesman Problem, and finds applications in bike sharing systems where a single vehicle moves bikes between bike stations of a city district during the night to set the network to an initial configuration. The paper proposes a new branch-and-cut algorithm to find optimal solutions. A master problem solves a relaxed Mixed Integer Programming model, i.e., a model allowing all feasible solutions and also some invalid ones. A subproblem checks the feasibility of the master solutions and generates valid cuts when they are infeasible. Computational results on benchmark instances demonstrate the good performance of the algorithm compared with others in the literature. In particular, it solves benchmark instances with 60 customers that were unsolved.},

However, in resource-constrained projects, disrupted activities affect their successors due to precedence relations and the other activities due to resource constraints, both of which will result in deviations during project progress. Since the project control approaches solely focus on the deviations based on the network analysis, they do not accurately reflect the progress of resource-constrained projects. This paper extends project control approaches for resource-constrained projects to measure and evaluate whether the project progress is acceptable. Moreover, we design three scenarios considering possible resource conflicts to take corrective actions when needed. In the computational experiment, this project control process is applied to a large set of projects with different characteristics and further validated on real-life project data. The results show that the proposed scenarios and different project control approaches are efficient and reliable, but their use depends on project network structure and resource scarceness.},

For a lot of problem instances of the literature, a few dozens of runs are able to generate a very high proportion of the edges of the best solutions known.

The objective is to maximize the probability that all the jobs are completed before a common due date. The considered problem has many practical applications, but it is notoriously known to be difficult as it involves several non-linearities which complicates its analysis and solution. In this work, we have developed novel lower and upper bounds on the objective function. The upper bound is computed via a solution to a problem where a subset of machines is represented as a single machine having a modified due date. Furthermore, we study lower and upper bounds on the number of jobs that must be scheduled on a machine in an optimal schedule. Subsequently, we use the bounds to construct an efficient branch-and-price algorithm where the pricing problem is found to be related to an inflatable stochastic Knapsack problem. An advantage of the branch-and-price algorithm is a constraint branching mechanism that mitigates symmetries in the solution space. The performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm shows that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art method. In this paper, we also study a special case of the problem assuming two machines. We developed a scalable method whose efficiency arises from the concavity of the relaxed objective function and a fast procedure to recover optimal integer solution from it. These improvements allowed us to solve instances with 500 jobs within a few seconds.},

Both methods are based on the successive insertion (or reinsertion) of jobs into a partial schedule, evaluating the makespan of the resulting schedule for all insertion positions, and selecting the insertion position that presents the shortest makespan. Frequently, there are many tied insertion positions that produce such shortest makespan. Thus, a tiebreaker must be used to discern a selection among the tied insertion positions. Many tiebreakers have been proposed in the literature for this case. These tiebreakers improve the results produced by approximate methods when embedded into them. In this paper we propose two new tiebreakers that use a weighted and an unweighted approximation of the idle time increment produced by inserting the job into each tied insertion position. They were designed considering the reversibility property of the PFSSP. Our computational experiments show that the proposed tiebreakers outperform tiebreakers from the literature when evaluated within the NEH heuristic and within the iterated greedy algorithm. The iterated greedy algorithms with the proposed tiebreakers embedded are the best approximate methods so far for the permutational flow shop scheduling problem.},

The conservative credit guarantee company aims to earn a certain expected return by setting its guarantee service fee rate, whereas the adventurous one sets the guarantee service fee rate to maximize its profit while ignoring the expected return. In a decentralized financing system, the guarantee types will influence all local optimal decision variables in Stackelberg equilibrium, and the optimal order quantity setting under the adventurous credit guarantee type is more flexible than that under the conservative one. We then analyze the centralized financing system and prerequisites for participation to obtain the supply chain financing (SCF) coordinating strategy. Under the adventurous credit guarantee, the P2P lending platform financing system can achieve SCF coordination, but under the conservative credit guarantee, SCF coordination cannot be achieved. When a credit guarantee company is adventurous and the coordination condition on order quantity is satisfied, the information service fee rate linearly decreases in the guarantee service fee rate, and the P2P lending platform’s and the credit guarantee company’s expected profits have different monotonic properties with the information service fee rate (or the guarantee service fee rate) increasing. Finally, we identify the boundary of the retailer’s initial working capital and the suitable ranges of the service fee rates to achieve SCF coordination.},

Targeting a customer is profitable if the impact and associated profit of the marketing treatment are higher than its cost. Despite the growing literature on uplift models to identify the strongest treatment-responders, no research has investigated optimal targeting when the costs of the treatment are unknown at the time of the targeting decision. Stochastic costs are ubiquitous in direct marketing and customer retention campaigns because marketing incentives are conditioned on a positive customer response. This study makes two contributions to the literature, which are evaluated on an e-commerce coupon targeting campaign. First, we formally analyze the targeting decision problem under response-dependent costs. Profit-optimal targeting requires an estimate of the treatment effect on the customer and an estimate of the customer response probability under treatment. The empirical results demonstrate that the consideration of treatment cost substantially increases campaign profit when used for customer targeting in combination with an estimate of the average or customer-level treatment effect. Second, we propose a framework to jointly estimate the treatment effect and the response probability by combining methods for causal inference with a hurdle mixture model. The proposed causal hurdle model achieves competitive campaign profit while streamlining model building. All codes are available at https://github.com/Humboldt-WI/response-dependent-costs .},

We analyze a game-theoretical model taking into account price and emission sensitive demand in the absence and presence of cap-and-trade policy, respectively. In addition to price collusion and production cost savings, we find that carbon emission collusion and green technology investment cost synergies of mergers between low carbon manufacturers have several price and emission implications that have not been addressed by previous research. While a merger reduces competition, our result shows that the merging manufacturers could charge lower prices but increase carbon emissions even in the absence of the two sources of cost savings. We further establish that production cost synergies (green technology investment cost savings) can (cannot) alone lead to a win-win-win outcome in which merging manufacturers enjoy higher profits, consumers benefit from more environmental-friendly products with reduced prices, and environment becomes better off due to reduced carbon emissions in the absence of green technology investment cost savings (production cost savings). Moreover, if the green technology investment cost synergies are relatively small but the production cost savings are not too small, the win-win-win outcome can be achieved. Finally, we show that the cap-and-trade regulation is an efficient policy for antitrust agencies to further protect the consumers and environment.},

  abstract     = {Effectively detecting and interdicting intruders within a defender’s territory is a common security problem. Often, the defender’s territory is decomposed into spatially distinct stages for organizational convenience. Given an intruder attempting to traverse a spatially-decomposed region via multiple possible paths, this research aims to effectively and cost-efficiently identify a defensive strategy that locates sets of detection resources and interdiction resources, each of which has different types of resources that vary by cost and capability. We formulate and validate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model to solve the underlying problem first using a leading commercial solver (BARON) and then via two genetic algorithms (RWGA and NSGA-II). Computational testing first identifies instance size limitations for identifying a global optimal solution via BARON, motivating the use of metaheuristics. Subsequent testing demonstrates the superior performance of RWGA and NSGA-II on 10 randomly generated instances for each of 20 various instance sizes. For each 20 of these instance sizes, both RWGA and NSGA-II produce higher-quality and more non-dominated solutions than BARON while using much less computational effort. Subsequent testing of only RWGA and NSGA-II over a designed set of test instances identifies NSGA-II as the recommended technique to solve larger-sized instances of the underlying problem.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an optimal dynamic strategy for hedging longevity risk in a discrete-time setting. Our proposed hedging strategy relies on standardized mortality-linked securities and minimizes the variance of the hedging error as induced by the population basis risk. While the formulation of our proposed hedging strategy is quite general, we use a stylized pension plan, together with a specified “yearly rollingǥ trading strategy involving q-forwards and a specified stochastic mortality model, to illustrate our proposed strategy. Under these specifications, we show that the resulting hedging problem can be formulated as a stochastic optimal control framework and that a semi-analytic solution can be derived through an extended Bellman equation. Extensive Monte Carlo studies are conducted to highlight the effectiveness of our proposed hedging strategy. We also consider a scheme to approximate the semi-analytic solution in order to reduce the computational time significantly while still retaining its hedge effectiveness. We benchmark our strategy against the “delta” hedging strategy as well as its robustness to q-forwards maturity, reference age, interest rate, and stochastic mortality models. The proposed strategy has many appealing features, including its discrete-time setting which is consistent with market practice and hence conducive to practical implementation, and its generality in that the underlying hedging principle can be applied to other standardized mortality-linked securities and other stochastic models.},

For a fixed network, which satisfies all connection demands, the problem consists of allocating the total cost of the network among its users. Thereby every MCCN problem induces a cooperative cost game where the cost of every coalition of users is the cost of an efficient network satisfying the demand of the users in the coalition. Unlike the MCST-model, we show that the core of the induced cost game in the MCCN-model can be empty even when all locations are demanded. We therefore consider sufficient conditions for non-empty core. It is shown that: when the efficient network and the demand graph (i.e. the graph consisting of the direct connections between the pairs of demanded nodes) consist of the same components, the induced cost game has non-empty core (Theorem 1); and, when the demand graph consists of at most two components, the induced cost game has non-empty core (Theorem 2).},

  abstract     = {Card transaction fraud is a growing problem affecting card holders worldwide. Financial institutions increasingly rely upon data-driven methods for developing fraud detection systems, which are able to automatically detect and block fraudulent transactions. From a machine learning perspective, the task of detecting fraudulent transactions is a binary classification problem. Classification models are commonly trained and evaluated in terms of statistical performance measures, such as likelihood and AUC, respectively. These measures, however, do not take into account the actual business objective, which is to minimize the financial losses due to fraud. Fraud detection is to be acknowledged as an instance-dependent cost-sensitive classification problem, where the costs due to misclassification vary between instances, and requiring adapted approaches for learning a classification model. In this article, an instance-dependent threshold is derived, based on the instance-dependent cost matrix for transfer fraud detection, that allows for making the optimal cost-based decision for each transaction. Two novel classifiers are presented, based on lasso-regularized logistic regression and gradient tree boosting, which directly minimize the proposed instance-dependent cost measure when learning a classification model. The proposed methods are implemented in the R packages cslogit and csboost , and compared against state-of-the-art methods on a publicly available data set from the machine learning competition website Kaggle and a proprietary card transaction data set. The results of the experiments highlight the potential of reducing fraud losses by adopting the proposed methods.},

Within the realm of two-step approaches, this paper challenges the widespread adoption of single-variable clustering: heterogeneity has often multiple sources, which calls for more sophisticated clustering methodologies. In fact, reliable cluster-specific rankings provide firms’ management with more realistic objectives as well as freedom to identify the appropriate strategies to improve efficiency. In order to provide regulatory guidance on this issue, we use a unique dataset of detailed accounting data and unbundled network-related costs for a panel of Italian gas distributors and we test two alternative methods: a hybrid clustering procedure (HCP) and a latent class model (LCM). Our results show that HCP and LCM perform better than size segmentation in the identification of classes, thereby leading to more reliable production frontiers, but do not support a conclusive preference for one or the other method. While both methods are sensitive to outliers, LCMs seem to provide deeper insights on the drivers of firm inefficiency. However, they also present stationarity and convergence issues, which might favour the implementation of HCP methods. Furthermore, the degree of discretionary judgement in the modelling decisions (e.g., model specification and choice of the partition) is slightly higher with LCMs than with HCP. In this respect, the HCP, with its lower modelling and analytical complexity, may feature as a more appealing option, facilitating the interactions between regulator and firm managers.},

  abstract     = {Typical online learning methods have brought fruitful achievements based on the framework of online convex optimization. Meanwhile, nonconvex loss functions also received numerous attentions for their merits of noise-resiliency and sparsity. Current nonconvex loss functions are typically designed as smooth for the ease of designing the optimization algorithms. However, these loss functions no longer have the property of sparse support vectors. In this work, we focus on regression with a special type of nonconvex loss function (i.e., canal loss), and propose a kernel-based online regression algorithm, n ̲ n̲ oise- r ̲ r̲ esilient o ̲ o̲ nline r ̲ r̲ egression (NROR), to deal with the noisy labels. The canal loss is a type of horizontally truncated loss and has the merit of sparsity. Although the canal loss is nonconvex and nonsmooth, the regularized canal loss has a property similar to convexity which is called strong pseudo-convexity. Furthermore, the sublinear regret bound of NROR is proved under certain assumptions. Experimental studies show that NROR achieves low prediction errors in terms of mean absolute error and root mean squared error on the datasets of heavy noisy labels. Particularly, we check whether the convergence assumption strictly holds in practice and find that the assumptions required for convergence are rarely violated, and the convergence rate is not affected.},

This paper is motivated by firms that acquire and resell pre-owned items, such as cell phones. A firm with fixed inventory is always under pressure to sell the remaining inventory, yet when acquisition opportunities arise, the firm may become under pressure to acquire inventory in anticipation of a surge in demand. We establish conditions under which the firm will find itself under pressure to acquire versus pressure to sell. We study how the optimal acquisition and selling prices, and the difference between them (the optimal margin) behaves with respect to time and inventory. In addition, we devise heuristics with fixed prices based on a deterministic approximation, and we evaluate how much the firm gains by using a dynamic acquisition or selling price as opposed to fixing them at the beginning of the horizon.},

The interdictor is not aware of the base costs when the interdiction action is taken, but does know that the base cost values are uniformly distributed within given (arc-specific) intervals. The evader, on the other hand, observes the exact value of the base costs, plus the additional costs due to interdiction actions. The interdictor’s problem is thus to maximize the expected minimum cost attainable by the evader. We provide a partitioning algorithm for computing an exact optimal solution to this problem, leveraging bounds gleaned from Jensen’s inequality as proposed in an earlier study on a maximum-flow interdiction problem.

In this paper, we propose a consensus-reaching approach based on maximum satisfaction under budget constraints for DMs with these two behaviors. To obtain a feasible budget constraint of the CRP, a reference budget consensus model (RBCM) incorporating both of these behaviors is first developed. Under the constraint of the limited budget, we propose a maximum satisfaction consensus model (MSCM) to maximize the satisfaction level of all DMs based on the goal programming theory. To further achieve different levels of consensus, we propose a soft MSCM under a certain threshold using soft consensus measures. Moreover, the proposed consensus models are illustrated by the data of China’s Taihu Lake pollution control. The results suggest that: First, the individual tolerance behavior has a higher impact on the consensus outcome than the compromise limit, whereas the latter is more likely to affect the satisfaction of each DM. Second, as the budget increases, the consensus opinion and group satisfaction level will increase toward a higher average cost until they remain constant. Last, a higher consensus threshold will reduce DMs’ satisfaction levels, and an appropriate threshold should be selected as the control baseline of the CRP in the real application.},

  abstract     = {Budget allocation problems in portfolio management are inherently multi-objective as they entail different types of assets of which performance metrics are not directly comparable. Existing asset management methods that either consolidate multiple goals to form a single objective ( a priori ) or populate a Pareto optimal set ( a posteriori ) may not be sufficient because a decision maker (DM) may not possess comprehensive knowledge of the problem domain. Moreover, current techniques often present a Pareto optimal set with too many options, making it counter-productive. In order to provide the DM with a diverse yet compact solution set, this paper proposes a three-step approach. In the first step, we employ different approximation functions to capture investment-performance relationships at the asset-type level. These simplified relationships are then used as inputs for the multi-objective optimisation model in the second step. In the final step, Pareto optimal solutions generated by a selected evolutionary algorithm are pruned by a clustering method. To measure the spread of representative solutions over the Pareto front, we present two novel indicators based on average Euclidean distance and cosine similarity between original Pareto solutions and representative solutions. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate that this approach can provide a set of representative solutions that maintain high integrity of the original Pareto front. We also put forward suggestions on choosing appropriate approximation functions, pruning methods, and indicators.},

  abstract     = {Coopetition is a business phenomenon that dominates many supply chains. We aim to understand why and how coopetition occurs in supply chains with the presence of process improvement in upstream component production. An original equipment manufacturer (OEM) can purchase the component from either a non-competing supplier (NS) or a competing supplier (CS) that also sells substitutable products in the end consumer market. We demonstrate that without process improvement, coopetition does not exist, because the OEM prefers sourcing from the NS, even though the CS is willing to sell the component to the OEM. Two cases are considered in which process improvement is present: supplier-initiated investment, where the suppliers conduct self-investment, and OEM-initiated investment, where the OEM invests in the supplier&#39;s process. We find that with supplier-initiated investment, the CS always prefers coopetition, but the OEM may not. When the investment is efficient, coopetition occurs as an equilibrium outcome; otherwise, competition occurs. The cause of coopetition equilibrium comes from variable process improvement incentives of the CS that derive from two driving forces: the vertical wholesale price effect and the horizontal quantity competition effect. When the degree of product substitution is low, the CS increases its investment and lowers its wholesale price, benefiting the OEM. When the degree of product substitution is high, the CS reduces its investment as well as production quantity, which also benefits the OEM. Interestingly, with OEM-initiated investment, the CS might not always choose to sell the component to the OEM, and as a result, coopetition never occurs.},

In a location-event model , the nodes are indexed by the location and the number of visits made so far to that location, while in a vehicle-event model the nodes are indexed by the location and the number of visits so far on the vehicle route. Both models are based on continuous time formulations. They are tightened with valid inequalities, and a new branching algorithm is designed to speed up the solution time of the models. Computational tests based on a set of maritime transportation instances are reported to compare both models and the corresponding tightened variants.},

  abstract     = {Due to poor ability to resist risks, penniless retailers face high bankruptcy risk, which may spread to suppliers who provide trade credit for them and then affect suppliers’ trade credit provision decision. A supplier who transacts with downstream retailers with heterogeneous credit ratings has three trade credit provision strategies: null (the supplier does not provide trade credit), exclusive (the supplier provides trade credit for only a part of retailers), and nonchalant trade credit provision (the supplier provides trade credit for all retailers). In this study, we establish a two-echelon supply chain model comprising one supplier and two capital-constrained retailers to investigate the supplier’s and retailers’ preferences for different trade credit provision patterns. By analyzing and comparing the three trade credit provision strategies, we find that the supplier is always beneficial from providing nonchalant trade credit. However, nonchalant trade credit provision is only attractive for the excluded retailer when his creditworthiness is poor and for the privileged retailer, nonchalant trade credit provision is never a preferable option, which leads to a counterintuitive situation that the three parties can never reach an agreement on trade credit provision pattern. Our results indicate that credit rating information serves as a risk warner for the supplier, allowing the supplier to evaluate the retailers’ repayment ability accurately and set interest rates accordingly, but this is unfavorable to the retailers. For policy-makers, they should start with reducing the risk of default in trade credit to promote the development of trade credit.},

To be applicable to real-world make-to-order processes, this versatile proposal significantly extends related approaches that require equidistant delivery dates. Moreover, job release dates and deadlines are covered. The objective function of the proposed optimization model pursues the minimization of the sum of incurred holding and transportation costs. In order to solve the model to optimality, a Branch&amp;Bound procedure is generated that applies several bounding and domination rules. Furthermore, a randomized adaptive search procedure is proposed that attains promising heuristic solutions under tight time restrictions. The practicability of the proposed algorithms is validated by means of a comprehensive computational study in comparison with a commercial solver. While the Branch&amp;Bound approach considerably outperforms the standard solver, the heuristic approach provides optimal or close to optimal upper bounds under tight time restrictions.},

  abstract     = {Originally applied to tennis by the data journalists of FiveThirtyEight.com, the Elo rating method estimates the strength of each player based on her/his career as well as the outcome of the last match played. Together with the regression-based, point-based and paired-comparison approaches, the Elo rating is a popular method to predict the probability of winning tennis matches. Notwithstanding its widely recognized merits in terms of ease of reproducibility and good performance, the Elo method does not completely take into account the current form of each player and their recent performances. This paper proposes a new version of the Elo rating method, labelled Weighted Elo (WElo), where the standard Elo updating is additionally weighted according to the scoreline of the players’ last match. The proposed method considers not only if a player has won (lost) a match, but also how the victory (defeat) was achieved. In the empirical application, the forecasting performance of the WElo method is evaluated and compared against the most popular forecasting methods in tennis, using a sample of over 60,000 men’s and women’s professional matches. Overall, the WElo method outperforms all these competing methods. Moreover, it provides meaningfully profitable opportunities, according to a simple betting strategy.},

  abstract     = {We consider the maximum 2-club problem, which aims at finding an induced subgraph of maximum cardinality with the diameter at most two. Such subgraphs arise from a popular diameter-based clique relaxation concept, as a subgraph is a clique if and only if its diameter is one. In a 2-club every pair of non-adjacent vertices has a common neighbor; this “2-hop” property naturally arises in a variety of applications. In this paper, by exploiting a somewhat different interpretation of the problem, we provide two new mixed-integer programming (MIP) models for finding maximum 2-clubs. Our MIPs provide much tighter linear programming (LP) relaxations for sufficiently sparse graphs and have fewer constraints than the standard integer programming (IP) model at the expense of having slightly more continuous variables. We also consider feasibility versions of our MIPs that verify whether there exists a 2-club of some specified size. Then we incorporate them into a simple-to-implement “feasibility-check” algorithm that iteratively solves one of the feasibility MIPs for each possible 2-club size within some known lower and upper bounds. The upper bound is obtained from an LP relaxation of our new MIPs and is shown to be sharp. Furthermore, we show how to extend our approaches for solving some “robust” (attack- and failure-tolerant) generalizations of the maximum 2-club problem. Finally, we perform an extensive computational study with randomly generated and real-life graphs to support our theoretical results and to provide some empirical observations and insights.},

The paper provides a Mixed Integer Programming formulation for the job sequencing and tool switching problem with machine-dependent processing and tool switching times under the consideration of three conflicting objectives (minimizing the total flowtime, minimizing the makespan and minimizing the total number of tool switches). Different efficient construction heuristics and Iterated Local Search methods are proposed and evaluated, using 640 new and publicly available instances. The results of the construction heuristics, the Iterated Local Search schemes and a Mixed Integer Programming Solver are discussed.

  abstract     = {The Multidimensional Multiple-choice Knapsack Problem (MMKP) is a complex combinatorial optimization problem for which finding high quality feasible solutions is very challenging. Recently, several heuristic approaches and a few exact algorithms have been proposed for its solution. These methods have been able to provide new best-known values for benchmark instances although many of them still remain unclosed to optimality. In this paper, we provide a new variant of the heuristic framework Kernel Search and apply it to the MMKP. The proposed variant keeps the method’s main idea of solving a sequence of restricted mixed-integer subproblems but innovates by partitioning the solution process into two different phases with complementary goals. The first phase strives for feasibility and collects important information to dynamically adapt subproblems’ dimension and solution time in the second phase that is focused on getting high quality solutions. This makes the global approach more scalable and efficient. Computational results on different sets of benchmark instances demonstrate that our method is extremely effective outperforming all state-of-the-art heuristics for the MMKP. The method compares extremely well also with respect to exact approaches running for five hours. The proposed algorithm is able to improve the best-known value of 185 out of 276 open benchmark instances and gets 8 out of 17 optimal solutions for the closed ones. The average deviation from optimality is always negligible.},

(2016), A class of algorithms for mixed-integer bilevel min–max optimization. Journal of Global Optimization, 66(2), 225–262). In this setting, the leader of the upper level problem aims at restricting the follower’s decisions by minimizing an objective function, which the follower intends to maximize in the lower level problem by making decisions still available to her. The x x -space algorithm solves upper and lower bound problems consecutively until convergence, and requires the dualization of an approximation of the follower’s problem in formulating the lower bound problem. We first reformulate the lower bound problem using the properties of an optimal solution to the original formulation, which makes the dualization step unnecessary. The reformulation makes possible the integration of a greedy covering heuristic into the solution scheme, which results in a considerable increase in the efficiency. The new algorithm referred to as the improved x x -space algorithm is implemented and applied to a recent min–max bilevel optimization problem that arises in the context of reducing the misinformation spread in social networks. It is also assessed on the benchmark instances of two other bilevel problems: zero-one knapsack problem with interdiction and maximum clique problem with interdiction. Numerical results indicate that the performance of the new algorithm is superior to that of the original algorithm, and also compares favorably with a recent algorithm developed for mixed-integer bilevel linear programs.},

The proposed algorithm is distinguished owing to its new multi-branching rules, graph coloring-based bounding technique, and reduction rules using structural information. The experiments indicate that the algorithm outperforms the best-known approaches on a wide range of well-known benchmark graphs for different s s values.

Due the particularities of each conference, there is no consensus regarding the problem definition, and researchers have tackled each specific case individually. Despite their distinct characteristics, one often expects the sessions to be composed of presentations of similar scope. This natural assumption led us to define a basic yet sufficiently general version of the problem that aims at maximizing the benefit of clustering papers with common topics in the same session, while leaving the particularities of the event to be addressed by means of side constraints. Three mathematical formulations based on integer linear programming are proposed for the problem, which in turn is shown to be NP-hard. The first model consists of a compact formulation, whereas the second and third models serve as underlying formulations for branch-and-cut (BC) and branch-cut-and-price (BCP) algorithms, respectively. Computational experiments were carried out on real-life and artificial instances derived from two conferences, considering several scenarios. While the compact formulation and the BC procedure could solve instances with moderate size, the BCP approach managed to produce tight bounds for instances with up to 163 presentations.},

It has become a standard problem in the context of project scheduling which has attracted numerous researchers who developed both exact and heuristic scheduling procedures. However, it is a rather stylized model with assumptions that are too narrow to capture many real world requirements. Consequently, various extensions of the basic resource-constrained project scheduling problem have been developed. This paper builds on an overview which was published 10 years ago. Due to the unabated interest in the scientific community since it has been published the overview at hand delivers an update focussing on the last decade. The problem extensions are classified according to the structure of the resource-constrained project scheduling problem. We summarize generalizations of the activity concept, of the precedence relations, and of the resource constraints.

The rapidly increasing blockchain forks have resulted in fierce competition and created significant controversies in blockchain community. To analyze this competitive aspect, we consider blockchain as a two-sided platform that serves both customers and miners. We develop a game-theoretic model to investigate how a blockchain platform&#39;s decision on its settings, such as block size and transaction fee, affects the competition between blockchain platforms as well as the participation behavior of customers and miners. Our findings suggest that increasing the transaction fee alleviates congestion on the platform when customers have a relatively balanced need between efficiency and safety. In contrast, it induces congestion when efficiency is valued over safety. In addition, under hard fork competition, the difference in blockchain platforms&#39; block sizes directs the attention of miners towards different types of mining rewards. Moreover, it also affects the optimal types of customers the blockchain platforms should target. Furthermore, we find that the degree of congestion and the risk attitudes of participants play vital roles in differentiating different block-sized platforms&#39; optimal transaction fees. We provide empirical evidence on the theoretical findings and practical implications for blockchain platform competition with respect to the behaviors of platform participants.},

This study investigates the strategic interaction between manufacturer&#39;s encroachment and retailers’ financing choices (trade credit financing or external financing) in a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and two capital-constrained retailers. We find that only encroachment cost below a certain threshold will make the manufacturer encroach on the market, while manufacturer encroachment is harmful to capital-constrained retailers. Surprisingly, these retailers can expand the ratios of equity financing in anticipation of manufacturer encroachment, which is a new strategic role of equity financing. In addition, the more intense the channel competition (the larger the credit gap between the two retailers) is, the less (more) likely the manufacturer will be to encroach. Further, we find that retailers prefer trade credit (external) financing at a low (high) bank loan interest rate in a non-encroachment scenario, while they prefer external financing in an encroachment scenario. However, the manufacturer always prefers the case that both retailers choosing external financing. Finally, there are financing choice conflicts between the manufacturer and retailers in the non-encroachment scenario. A high-credit retailer choosing trade credit financing may make all members achieve a Pareto improvement when the credit gap between two retailers is large; otherwise, both retailers choosing external financing is a Pareto improvement.},

  abstract     = {In this research, we develop a trading strategy for the optimal liquidation problem of large-order trading, with different market microstructures, in an illiquid market. We formulate the liquidation problem as a discrete-time Markov decision process. In this market, the flow of liquidity events can be viewed as a point process with stochastic intensity. Based on this fact, we model the price impact as a linear function of a self-exciting dynamic process. Our trading algorithm is designed in such a way that when no favourite orders arrive in the Limit Order Book (LOB), the optimal solution takes offers from the lower levels of the LOB. This solution might contradict conventional optimal execution methods, which only trade with the best available limit orders; however, our findings show that the proposed strategy may reduce final inventory costs by preventing orders not being filled at earlier trading times. Furthermore, the results indicate that an optimal trading strategy is dependent on characteristics of the market microstructure.},

The official World Rankings (based on prize money earned) and a player&#39;s win percentage are considered, along with paired comparison approaches in the form of Bradley-Terry and Elo models. The models are assessed through their ability to predict the results of subsequent matches, with relatively little to choose between them. Subsets of matches are then analysed to identify relative strengths and weaknesses of the models and potential improvements. The models tended to under-estimate the performance of ‘new’ players and this is the main limitation of using the World Rankings to predict performance. Accounting for the strength of opposition faced by the highest-ranked players is shown to be relevant; although this is less true for lower-ranked players. Models based on two years of results out-perform those based on a single year but there is some indication that accounting for a recent improvement in form may be beneficial.},

To optimize execution with deep reinforcement learning, we design a problem-specific training environment that introduces a purpose-built reward function, hand-crafted market state features and a virtual limit order exchange. We empirically compare state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms to several benchmarks with market data from major cryptocurrency exchanges, which represent an ideal test bed for our study as liquidity costs are relatively high. In total, we leverage 18 months of high-frequency data for several currency pairs with 300 million trades and more than 3.5 million order book states. We find proximal policy optimization to reliably learn superior order placement strategies. By interacting with our simulated limit order exchange, it learns cryptocurrency execution strategies that are empirically known from established markets. Order placement becomes more aggressive in anticipation of lower execution probabilities, which is indicated by trade and order imbalances.},

Therefore, trade credit may serve as a coordination device. The supplier can optimally choose to offer trade credit for free, since this will guarantee her business for a longer period of time. Optimal trade credit design is analyzed for an integrated supply chain (cooperative solution) and for external procurement (Nash bargaining and Stackelberg solutions). When regulation imposes a limit on trade credit maturity, the wholesale price is reduced, trade credit decreases and internal procurement increases. The model’s predictions are in line with recent empirical evidence on the effects of regulation in the retail industry.},

To simultaneously deal with input excesses and output shortfalls maximizing both projections, this paper proposes a bi-objective DEA model in the context of undesirable factors and mixed integer requirements. These factors and requirements were integrated into the objective function and constraints of the existing bi-objective models. In addition, the proposed model estimates the returns to scale of DMUs that depends on the projections of input reduction and output augmentation. The applicability and usefulness of the proposed model were tested using the dataset of 39 Spanish airports retrieved from the literature.

This is motivated by recursive utilities in the economic literature. It has been studied before for the entropic risk measure and is extended here to general static risk measures. Under direct assumptions on the model data we derive a Bellman equation and prove the existence of optimal Markov policies. For an infinite planning horizon, the model is shown to be contractive and the optimal policy to be stationary. Our approach unifies results for a number of well-known risk measures. Moreover, we establish a connection to distributionally robust MDPs, which provides a global interpretation of the recursively defined objective function. Monotone models are studied in particular.},

  abstract     = {The demand decreases as the price increases. Also, the demand rate for fresh goods depends on its freshness, which can be assessed by its sell-by date. Furthermore, a large pile of consumer goods displayed in a supermarket often provokes consumers to buy more due to its freshness, variety, or visibility. With larger business transactions, the supplier usually requests a good-faith deposit (or an advance payment) to discourage the order cancelation. On the other hand, the retailer likes to hold some portion of the purchase amount until the business transaction is completed and satisfactory (or a credit payment). Consequently, an advance-cash-credit (ACC) payment scheme, which is a combination of advance, cash, and credit payments, becomes commonly used in business transactions. In this study, we explore an inventory system in which: demand curve depends on unit price, displayed volume, and sell-by date; and the supplier and the retailer agree with an ACC payment scheme. The objective for grocery stores is to maximize the total profit by finding its price and order cycle simultaneously. We derive theoretical results, and then propose an algorithm. Finally, we perform sensitivity analyses to gain the following managerial insights: (i) An increase in stock efficiency significantly reduces selling price and cycle time while tremendously raising total profit. (ii) Credit payment generates the lowest selling price but the highest profit among all payment types. (iii) An increase in shelf life through preservation technology investment significantly raises total profit while slightly increasing the unit price and cycle time.},

In the literature, the number of approaches to this problem are increasing, most of which are based on the computation of closest targets. Some of the existing approaches satisfy the important property of strong monotonicity. However, they tend to either propose a complex conceptual framework and multi-stage procedure or change the original definition of Hölder distance functions. Clearly, these approaches cannot be solved easily when there are many “extreme” efficient units with multiple inputs and multiple outputs. To solve this problem, we consider the notion of the extended facet production possibility set (EFPPS). In particular, we propose a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) to find the closest efficient targets and that is related to a measure that satisfies the strong monotonicity property. Additionally, in this paper, the proposed approach is applied to real data from 38 universities involved in China&#39;s 985 university project.},

The objective is to develop a staffing rule for a many-server system facing such an arrival process. So as to obtain approximations for its performance, we first consider the situation of the arrival process being fed into the corresponding infinite-server system. Using the square-root staffing principle leads to a staffing rule that acknowledges the three features. After a slight rearrangement of servers over the time slots, we succeed to stabilize system performance even under highly varying and strongly correlated conditions. We fit the arrival stream model to real data from an emergency department and demonstrate (by simulation) the performance of the novel staffing rule.},

However, in most practical applications, the process parameters have to be estimated from a finite in-control Phase I sample, and therefore the performance of attribute control charts should be evaluated from the perspective of estimated process parameters. In this paper, we compare the run length properties of the hypergeometric n p np chart in both the known and estimated parameter cases. In particular, we investigate the required number of Phase I samples and new specific chart parameters that allow the hypergeometric n p np chart with estimated parameter p p to have approximately the same in-control performance as in the known parameters case. Moreover, we perform a comprehensive in-control and out-of-control comparison of the hypergeometric n p np chart with its binomial counterpart. In order to achieve these objectives, we also present a new approach to effectively compute the probability distribution of the sum of independent and identically hypergeometric-distributed random variables. The proposed approximation reduces the computational effort to a few seconds while keeping a remarkable high accuracy with only negligible deviations compared to the exact distribution obtained via convolution.},

  abstract     = {We study how to design an original equipment manufacturer’s (OEM’s) direct selling channel in a multi-market setup such that the OEM experiences sustained business growth without sacrificing its brand customers’ profits. In this paper, we consider an OEM producing for a brand customer that operates in two markets: the domestic market in which the OEM resides and the international market (i.e., other mature markets). The OEM can offer its brand customers at a discount price in exchange for using the excess capacity to produce products under the OEM’s own brand and then sell these products through its channel. We build a game theoretical model in a Stackelberg setting in which the OEM is the leader and the brand is the follower, and determine their optimal pricing decisions and the associate profits under two different dual channel settings (i.e., one in which the brand cannot flexibly change its retail price and one in which it can). Contrary to the first-order intuition of market cannibalization, we find that the OEM direct selling channel can be a win-win-win strategy for the brand (gaining higher profit margin in the international market), the OEM (gaining a higher market coverage in the domestic market), and consumers in the domestic market (buying the product at a cheaper price). Such insights are generally robust, even when we consider a cost for the OEM’s selling channel, and/or consider a price constraint enforced by the brand, such that the OEM avoids selling the same product at too low a price.},

  abstract     = {Lead-time demand forecasting constitutes the backbone of inventory control. Although there has been a considerable amount of research on forecasting the mean lead-time demand, less has centered around forecasting lead-time demand variance, especially in the case of stochastic lead-times. This represents an important gap in the literature, given that safety stock calculations rely explicitly on the lead-time demand variance (or equivalently the variance of the lead-time demand forecast error for unbiased estimators). We bridge this gap by exploring the viability of three strategies to estimate the variance of the lead-time demand forecast error under stochastic lead-times: (1) aggregating the per period variance of forecast errors over the lead-time, which is the classical approach; (2) considering the variance of the aggregated (over the lead-time) forecast error; (3) considering the variance of the forecast errors resulting from temporally aggregated (over the lead-time length) demand. Analytical results are derived for a first order autoregressive moving average ARMA(1,1) demand process for both a single exponential smoothing and the minimum mean squared error forecasting method. A numerical investigation assesses the effects of demand autocorrelation and lead-time variability on the accuracy of each strategy, and the conditions under which one outperforms the others. The results show that the classical strategy presented in textbooks appears to be the least accurate one, except for cases with a high negative demand autocorrelation. An analysis of the inventory control performance also reveals that the classical strategy often leads to higher inventory costs and lower service levels for positive autocorrelation.},

  abstract     = {Authorisation is a commonly used strategy for OEMs who do not have remanufacturing capability but still want to extract some benefits from the remanufacturing market. In this paper, we analyse two authorisation strategies: one is dealer authorisation, i.e., the OEM turns the independent remanufacturer (IR) into an authorised dealer selling both new and remanufactured products; the other is remanufacturing authorisation, i.e., the OEM authorises the IR to remanufacture used products by charging an authorisation fee. A stylised model is developed to compare the three scenarios: competition, cooperation with dealer authorisation and cooperation with remanufacturing authorisation. Our results show that cooperation depends on the effect of authorisation on the improvement of customers’ willingness-to-pay for remanufactured products. Although remanufacturing authorisation is preferred by the OEM, only dealer authorisation is achievable under certain conditions. Interestingly, while the OEM’s profit decreases in new product cost in general, it may increase when higher cost causes a strategy switch from competition (dealer authorisation) to remanufacturing authorisation. Furthermore, we analyse the environmental and social impact of cooperation and identify the conditions under which cooperation benefits the environment and consumers. While cooperation can achieve a win-win-win situation on the triple bottom line, the choice of authorisation mode always presents a conflict between environmental and consumer benefit.},

  abstract     = {In hierarchical production planning, the consideration of interdependencies between superior top-level decisions and subordinate base-level decisions is essential. In this respect, the anticipation of base-level reactions is highly recommended. In this paper, we consider an example from the metal-processing industry: a serial-batch scheduling problem constitutes the top-level problem and a complex nesting problem constitutes the base-level problem. The top-level scheduling decision includes a batching decision, i.e., the determination of a set of small items to be cut out of a large slide. Thus, to evaluate the feasibility of a batch, the base-level nesting problem must be solved. Because solving nesting problems is time consuming even when applying heuristics, it is troublesome to solve it multiple times during solving the top-level scheduling problem. Instead, we propose an approximative anticipation of base-level reactions by machine learning to approximate batch feasibility. To that, we present a prediction framework to identify the most promising machine learning method for the prediction (regression) task. For applying these methods, we propose new feature vectors describing the characteristics of complex nesting problem instances. For training, validation, and testing, we present a new instance generation procedure that uses a set of 6,000 convex, concave, and complex shapes to generate 88,200 nesting instances. The testing results show that an artificial neural network achieves the lowest expected loss (root mean squared error). Depending on further assumptions, we can report that the approximate anticipation based on machine learning predictions leads to an appropriate batch feasibility decision for 98.8\% of the nesting instances.},

Representing the nondominated set with a small subset of nondominated points is important for a decision maker to get an understanding of the layout of solutions. The shape and density of the nondominated points over the objective space may be critical in obtaining a set of solutions that represent the nondominated set well. We develop an exact algorithm that generates a representative set guaranteeing a prespecified precision. Our experiments on a variety of problems demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing approaches in terms of both the cardinality of the representative set and computation times.},

The generalized quadratic multiple knapsack problem (GQMKP) extends the well-known quadratic multiple knapsack problem by taking into account setups and knapsack preference of the items. In this study, an efficient hybrid evolutionary search algorithm (HESA) is proposed to tackle GQMKP, which relies on a knapsack-based crossover operator to generate new offspring solutions, and an adaptive feasible and infeasible tabu search to improve new offspring solutions. Other new features of HESA include a dedicated strategy to ensure a diversified and high-quality initial population, and a streamlining technique to speed up the evaluations of candidate solutions. The experiments on two sets of 96 benchmark instances as well as one large-scale real-life instance show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature. In particular, HESA finds 44 improved best-known solutions (new lower bounds) (for more than 45\% cases). The key components of the algorithm are studied to assess their effects on the algorithm’s performance.},

A matching is socially fair if supported by the majority of agents against any other matching – popular matching . We observe that when a popular matching exists it is equivalent to a minimal envy-2 matching. We show the equivalence between global and local popularity: a matching is popular if and only if in no group of size up to 3 agents a majority can benefit by exchanging objects, keeping the remaining matching fixed. We algorithmically show that an arbitrary matching is path-connected with a popular matching by locally-popular exchanges in small groups. Thus a corresponding market converges to a popular matching. Popular matchings often do not exist. We define most popular matching as a matching that is popular among the largest (by cardinality) subset of agents. We show that a matching is minimal envy-2 if and only if it is minimal envy and most popular, and propose a polynomial-time algorithm to find a Pareto efficient minimal envy-2 matching.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a new graph-theoretic paradigm called a graph signature that describes persistent patterns in a sequence of graphs. This framework is motivated by the need to detect subgraphs of significance in temporal networks, e.g., social and biological networks that evolve over time. Because the subgraphs of interest may not all “look alike” in the snapshots of the temporal network, the framework deems a subgraph to be persistent if it satisfies one of several preselected properties in each snapshot of a consecutive subsequence. The persistency requirement is parameterized by the length of this subsequence. This discrete mathematical framework can be viewed more broadly as a way to generalize classical graph properties and invariants associated with a single graph to a sequence of graphs. In this introductory article, we formulate the graph signature identification problem as a mixed-integer program and propose an algorithmic framework based on dynamic programming. This methodology is applicable to any collection of mixed-integer representable graph properties. We also demonstrate how this framework can be tailored to exploit property-specific decomposition and scale reduction techniques through three different computational case-studies. Our experiments show that the dynamic programming algorithm solves this problem across most instances in our test bed to optimality. Moreover, for the instances in our test bed, the optimal signature sizes are comparable to those of their static counterparts, suggesting that our new framework can identify subgraphs of significance in complex dynamic networks.},

It is widely used in international arbitration and, in some countries, even in domestic litigation and arbitration.

In this paper, we analize litigation from the certainty equivalent perspective and provide interpretation on how differences between the parties may affect the size of the pie. Furthermore, we formalize TPF and – considering Italian costs, cost shifting rules and length of trials – derive a formula to compute the minimum value of a claim suitable for the funding agreement.

The reinsurer, as the leader of the Stackelberg game, can price reinsurance premium and invest her wealth in a financial market that contains a risk-free asset and a risky asset which is described by the constant elasticity of variance (CEV) model. The two insurers, as the followers of the Stackelberg game, can purchase proportional reinsurance from the reinsurer and invest in the same financial market. The competitive relationship between two insurers is modeled by the non-zero-sum game, and their decision-making will consider the relative performance measured by the difference in their terminal wealth. The bounded memory feature is characterized by the wealth process with delay. The purpose of the reinsurer is to maximize the expected utility of her own terminal wealth with delay. The two insurers aim to maximize the expected utility of the combination of her terminal wealth and the relative performance with delay. By using the idea of backward induction and the dynamic programming approach, we derive the equilibrium strategy and value functions explicitly. Then, we provide the corresponding verification theorem. Finally, some numerical examples and sensitivity analysis are presented to demonstrate the effects of model parameters on the equilibrium strategy. We find the delay factor discourages or stimulates investment depending on the length of delay. Moreover, competitive factors between two insurers make their optimal reinsurance-investment strategy interact, and reduce reinsurance demand and reinsurance premium price.},

  abstract     = {Generalized Nash equilibrium problems are single-shot Nash equilibrium problems, whereby the decisions of all agents are coupled through a shared constraint. Such games are generally challenging to solve as they might give rise to a very large number of solutions. In this context, spanning many equilibria can be interesting to provide meaningful interpretations. In the literature, to compute equilibria, equilibrium problems are classically reformulated as optimization problems, potential games, relaxed and extended games. Applications of these reformulations to an economic dispatch problem under perfect and imperfect competition are provided. Unfortunately, these approaches only enable to describe a very limited part of the equilibrium set. To fill that gap, relying on normalized Nash equilibrium as solution concept, we provide a parametrized decomposition algorithm inspired by the Inexact-ADMM to span many more equilibrium points. Complexifying the setting, we consider an information structure in which the agents can withhold some local information from sensitive data, resulting in private coupling constraints. The convergence of the algorithm and deviations in the players’ strategies at equilibrium are formally analyzed. In addition, the algorithm can be used to coordinate the agents on one specific equilibrium with desirable properties at the system level. The coordination game is formulated as a principal-agent problem, and a procedure is detailed to compute the equilibrium that minimizes a secondary cost function capturing system-level properties. Finally, the Inexact-ADMM is applied to a cellular resource allocation problem, exhibiting better convergence rate than vanilla ADMM, and to compute equilibria that achieve both system-level efficiency and maximum fairness.},

  abstract     = {This paper examines the high-dimensional dependence modelling problem in the context of project risk assessment. As the dimension of uncertain performance units (i.e., itemized costs and activity times) in a project increases, specifying a feasible correlation matrix and eliciting relevant pair-wise information, either from historical data or with expert judgement, becomes practically unattainable or simply not economical. This paper presents a factor-driven dependence elicitation and modelling framework with scalability to large-scale project risks. The multi-factor association model (MFAM) accounts for hierarchical relationships of multiple association factors and provides a closed-form solution to a complete and mathematically consistent correlation matrix. Augmented with the structured association (SA) technique for systematic identification of hierarchical association factors, the MFAM offers additional flexibility of utilizing the minimum information available in standardized, ubiquitous project plans (e.g., work breakdown structure, resource allocation, or risk register), while preserving the computational efficiency and the scalability to high dimensional project risks. Numerical applications and simulation experiments show that the MFAM, further combined with extended analytics (i.e., parameter calibration and optimization), provides credible risk assessments (with accuracy comparable to full-scale simulation) and further enhances the realism of dealing with high-dimensional project risks utilizing all relevant information.},

In this regard, fuel and C O 2 CO2 emission is considered as one of the important factors for such impacts. In particular, the sailing speed of the vessels affects the fuel consumption and therefore the emission directly. In this study, we consider a speed optimization problem in inland waterway, which is characterized by stochastic waiting times at the lock caused by uncertainty in lock processing time estimations of other vessels. The objective is to minimize fuel consumption of an approaching ship, such that it traverses the river segment in a set deadline. We introduce a mathematical model for this problem and evaluate the effectiveness and attractiveness of two solution approaches: an optimal solution and a simple heuristic. This creates intuitive guidelines for skippers based on information provision to select an appropriate speed decision approach to minimize the total expected fuel consumption and C O 2 CO2 emission of inland waterway transportation.},

  abstract     = {The current paper estimates the overall inefficiency indicator of a bank under a network Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) in the presence of undesirable inputs and outputs. We primarily contribute to the DEA literature in four ways. First, we decompose banks’ overall inefficiency performance indicator into five component indicators, namely, the sub-indicators of innovation, two kinds of stability, profitability and corporate social responsibility. Second, since the proposed model, which is an absolute value optimization problem, does not give the overall inefficiency score directly, we introduce a two-step procedure to obtain all sub-indicator scores and the overall inefficiency score. Third, we extend the by-production framework by proposing not only a concept and interpretation of “strategic disposability” for an intermediate undesirable output in estimating the stability sub-indicators, but also another concept of “strategic disposability” for an intermediate undesirable input in gauging the sub-indicator related to corporate social responsibility. Our results show that 1) the Chinese banking industry has a high level of innovation inefficiency and profitability inefficiency is higher than primary business stability inefficiency, strategic management stability inefficiency and corporate social responsibility inefficiency for all the bank ownership types except the state-owned commercial banks; 2) state-owned commercial banks have a higher level of corporate social responsibility inefficiency compared to the other inefficiencies; 3) state-owned commercial banks, rural commercial banks and joint-stock commercial banks are the best three performers with different ownership types performing well in different perspectives; 4) all different ownership types experience a level of performance volatility over the examined period.},

  abstract     = {Predicting customer repurchase propensity/frequency has received broad research interests from marketing, operations research, statistics, and computer science. In the field of marketing, Buy till You Die (BTYD) models are perhaps the most representative techniques for customer repurchase prediction. Those probabilistic models are parsimonious and typically involve only recency and frequency of customer activities. Contrary to BTYD models, a distinctly different class of predictive models for customer repurchase is machine learning. This class of models include a wide variety of computational and statistical learning algorithms. Unlike BTYD models built on low-dimensional inputs and behavioral assumptions, machine learning is more data-driven and excels at fitting predictive models to a large array of features from customer transactions. Using a large online retailing data, we empirically assess the prediction performance of BTYD modeling and machine learning. More importantly, we investigate how the two approaches can complement each other for repurchase prediction. We use the BG/BB model given the discrete and non-contractual problem setting and incorporate BG/BB estimates into high-dimensional Lasso regression. In addition to showing significant improvement over BG/BB and Lasso without BG/BB, the integrated Lasso-BG/BB provides interpretability and identifies BG/BB predictions as the most influential feature among ∼100 predictors. The lately developed CART-artificial neural networks exhibit similar patterns. Robustness checks further show the proposed Lasso-BG/BB outperforms two sophisticated recurrent neural networks, validating the complementarity of machine learning and BTYD modeling. We conclude by articulating how our interdisciplinary integration of the two modeling paradigms contributes to the theory and practice of predictive analytics.},

  abstract     = {Reductions in defense expenditure require holistic and coordinated planning of two critical and interconnected defense capabilities, namely a fleet of assets and the workforce required. In this paper, we model and solve a joint problem of strategic workforce planning and fleet renewal in a military context. The joint problem studied involves addressing a trade-off among several costs (e.g., workforce, maintenance, operating, etc.) and operational readiness (availability) of the fleet. To make such trade-offs, the decisions associated with workforce planning (i.e., the recruitment and the career progression of the workforce) and fleet renewal (i.e., the timing of asset replacements) strategies have to be simultaneously considered and optimized. We develop a simulation-optimization approach by coupling a system dynamics (SD) simulation model and a genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the joint problem. In the developed approach, the GA generates candidate workforce planning and fleet renewal strategies to find the best joint strategy. Then, the candidate workforce planning and renewal strategies are passed to the SD model which simulates both the career progression of the workforce and the life-cycle of assets to evaluate the total cost. We illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the joint model on a realistic case study motivated by the recent modernization efforts of the Royal Australian Navy. The results obtained indicate that this approach leads to a considerable cost reduction and identifies the causes of inferior performance. We also test the robustness of the optimized strategies under uncertainty by sensitivity and scenario discovery analyses to infer further insights.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, some e-tailers have introduced private labels to compete with manufacturers’ products in end markets. With this in mind, manufacturers who sell products through e-tailers should consider carefully when choosing the online sales mode. In this paper, we examine two prevalent sales modes and find that the manufacturer should adopt agency selling (reselling) when the percentage fee is low (high). When the percentage fee is moderate, with a high brand advantage, the manufacturer prefers reselling due to the high effective price. However, the e-tailer prefers agency selling because the percentage fee is more attractive than the decision right of sales quantities. Interestingly, though the manufacturer&#39;s and the e-tailer&#39;s preferences over the sales modes seem opposite, they may both prefer agency selling if the percentage fee and the brand advantage are moderate. Besides, we compare the sales modes from the environmental sustainability perspective and identify two influence factors, i.e., total sales quantities and the manufacturer&#39;s market share. The simultaneous improvement of the manufacturer&#39;s profits, the e-tailer&#39;s profits and the environmental performance is achievable under agency selling. Moreover, it is insightful to find that if the manufacturer&#39;s production technology is enough environmentally friendly, the optimal sales mode in terms of economic sustainability certainly outperforms in environmental sustainability. In the extension, we discuss how asymmetric production and sales costs influence our results. We find that our main findings still hold and further if the manufacturer&#39;s sales costs are high, the “win-win-win” situation can be reached under either reselling or agency selling.},

  abstract     = {Many empirical studies suggest that the realized values of highest-ranked decision alternatives tend to be systematically lower than estimated, causing the decision-maker to experience post-decision disappointment. This systematic overestimation of value has been explained by a systematic bias in the alternatives’ estimated values resulting from, e.g., a behavioural disposition towards overoptimism or even strategic misrepresentation. Nevertheless, even if these estimates are unbiased, the value of the selected alternative is likely to be overestimated due to selection bias. In this paper, we build models for measuring the shares of systematic and selection biases in generating post-decision disappointment, and develop approaches for estimating these models from data which contains the estimated values of all alternatives but the realized values of selected alternatives only. Results obtained from applying these models to real data on 5610 transportation infrastructure projects suggest that out of the total cost overrun of $2.77 billion, only ca. 24\% can be attributed to systematic bias.},

We consider a supply chain model where consumers arriving later will update their beliefs about product quality from the reviews given by earlier consumers. We find that supplier’s optimal wholesale price may decrease in the product quality. Also when consumers’ likelihood to write reviews changes, the supplier should change its wholesale price aiming at improving consumer reviews rather than controlling retailer’s inventory. Finally, the retailer’s ability to carry inventory can alleviate the double marginalization effect even in the presence of consumer reviews. Our results provide guidance for the supplier to manage its wholesale price strategy when faced with consumer reviews and retailer’s strategic inventory.},

  abstract     = {This study addresses a capacity expansion problem (CEP). A typical CEP model usually focuses on addressing demand fluctuation for cost minimization and assumes a constant marginal productivity, which may overestimate the capacity level, thus leading to an infeasible capacity plan. However, the marginal productivity theory has some merits which can complement the CEP; for example, a production function estimates the production possibility set limiting the production behavior and characterizes the law of diminishing marginal returns (DMR). To integrate the perspective of marginal productivity factors in the CEP model, we propose a two-stage model to solve the CEP. The first stage estimates the production possibility set and finds the directional marginal productivity (DMP) towards marginal profit maximization. The second stage, which addresses demand fluctuation, develops the minimax regret model, balancing capacity shortage and capacity surplus to build a robust capacity plan. The results of a numerical illustration validate the robust decision generated by the proposed model and correct a typical CEP model without considering marginal productivity, where the major factor affecting capacity decisions is the ability to raise/leverage resource for marginal productivity rather than demand variation and cost structure.},

In crowdshipping, the under-used assets are transport capacities of private drivers and the users are the retailers aiming for additional and cost-efficient delivery capacities for their home deliveries. A major drawback of crowdshipping is that retailers can hardly guarantee their promised delivery services when subcontracting individuals. To avoid this problem, different retailers are establishing crowdshipping platforms offering a reward to the employees of their distribution centers for crowdshipping online orders on their way back from work. We investigate the resulting optimization problem for matching crowdshipping supply and demand in this context. We present an efficient exact solution procedure based on Benders decomposition, which maximizes the number of matched shipments while considering the employees’ minimum expected earnings per time unit. This procedure is shown to solve instances of real-world size before a work shift is over and the shipments have to be loaded into the trunks of the employees’ cars. Furthermore, we show the impact of crowdshipping on all main stakeholders and identify critical success factors.},

We introduce new mixed-integer programming formulations for aircraft conflict resolution with speed, heading and altitude control which are based on disjunctive linear separation conditions. We first examine the two-dimensional aircraft conflict resolution problem with speed and heading control represented as continuous decision variables. We show that the proposed disjunctive linear separation conditions are equivalent to the classical nonlinear conditions for aircraft separation. Further, we characterise conflict-free trajectories based on aircraft velocity bounds and propose a simple pre-processing algorithm to identify aircraft pairs which are either always conflict-free, or which cannot be separated using speed and heading control only. We then incorporate altitude control and propose a lexicographic optimisation formulation that aims to minimise the number of flight level changes before resolving outstanding conflicts via two-dimensional velocity control. The proposed mixed-integer programming formulations are nonconvex, and we propose convex relaxations, decomposition methods and constraint generation algorithms to solve the two-dimensional and lexicographic optimisation formulations to guaranteed optimality. Numerical experiments on four types of conflict resolution benchmarking instances are conducted to test the performance of the proposed mixed-integer formulations. Further, the proposed method is compared against two benchmarks based on state-of-the-art approaches for the aircraft conflict resolution problem. Our numerical results show that the proposed method largely outperforms both benchmarks in terms of runtime and is able to solve significantly more instances to global optimality.},

Here, the small vehicles depart toward assigned customers, supply shipments, and return to the depot. Once the large vehicle has returned and another batch of small vehicles has been loaded at the depot, the process repeats until all customers are serviced. With autonomous driving on the verge of practical application, this general setting occurs whenever small autonomous delivery vehicles with limited operating range, e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) or delivery robots, need to be brought in the proximity of the customers by a larger vehicle, e.g., a truck. We aim at the most elementary decision problem in this context, which is inspired by Amazon’s novel last-mile concept, the flying warehouse. According to this concept, drones are launched from a flying warehouse and – after their return to an earthbound depot – are resupplied to the flying warehouse by an air shuttle. We formulate the Piggyback Transportation Problem, investigate its computational complexity, and derive suited solution procedures. From a theoretical perspective, we prove different important structural problem properties. From a practical point of view, we explore the impact of the two main cost drivers, the capacity of the large vehicle and the fleet size of small vehicles, on service quality.},

When the block to be retrieved next is not at the top, we have to relocate the blocks above it because we can access only the topmost blocks. The objective is to retrieve all the blocks with the smallest number of relocations. In this study, a novel exact algorithm is proposed for the restricted BRP, a class of the problem where relocatable blocks are restricted. The proposed algorithm computes lower and upper bounds iteratively by solving the corresponding integer programming problems until the optimality gap is reduced to zero. The novelty of the algorithm lies in the formulations based on complete and truncated relocation sequences of the individual blocks. We examine the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through computational experiments for benchmark instances from the literature. In particular, we report that, for the first time, all the instances with up to 100 blocks are solved to proven optimality.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the personnel task rescheduling problem with task retiming. We assume a baseline personnel task schedule that is subject to different types of disruptions, occurring on a daily basis. This operational uncertainty is the result of three sources of variability, i.e. uncertainty of demand, uncertainty of capacity and uncertainty of arrival, which may render the baseline schedule infeasible. Therefore, the rescheduling of the originally constructed personnel schedule is necessary to compose an operational schedule. We propose a dedicated branch-and-price procedure to recover the personnel task schedule, which considers a wide range of recovery mechanisms to reassign the tasks to workers, allowing the retiming of tasks, to restore the feasibility. Different computational experiments are conducted to show the performance of the proposed branch-and-price thriving on different speed-up techniques and optimisation principles. We benchmark the proposed algorithm with other optimisation procedures and show the contribution of the algorithm design choices.},

This problem can be formulated as a compact mixed integer program (MIP). In this article, we focus on neighborhood-based dominance properties, where the neighborhood is associated to insert and swap operations. We derive from these properties a local search procedure providing a very good heuristic solution. The main contribution of this work stands in an exact solving context: we derive constraints eliminating the non locally optimal solutions with respect to the insert and swap operations. We propose linear inequalities translating these constraints to strengthen the MIP compact formulation. These inequalities, called dominance inequalities, are different from standard reinforcement inequalities. We provide a numerical analysis which shows that adding these inequalities significantly reduces the computation time required for solving the scheduling problem using a standard solver.},

We also consider a closely related search problem in which there are multiple searchers to find a target before a given deadline. These natural generalizations of the classical sequential testing problem and search problem are applicable in a wide range of time-critical operations such as machine maintenance, diagnosing a patient, and new product development. We show that both problems are NP-hard, develop a pseudo-polynomial dynamic program for the special case of two time slots, and describe a partial-order-based as well as an assignment-based mixed integer program for the general case. Based on extensive computational experiments, we find that the assignment-based formulation performs better than the partial-order-based formulation for the testing variant, but that this is the other way round for the search variant. Finally, we propose a pairwise-interchange-based local search procedure and show that, empirically, it performs very well in finding near-optimal solutions.},

Since various integration methods with different purposes have been developed, there is a need to review the recent advances in using machine learning techniques to improve meta-heuristics. To the best of our knowledge, the literature is deprived of having a comprehensive yet technical review. To fill this gap, this paper provides such a review on the use of machine learning techniques in the design of different elements of meta-heuristics for different purposes including algorithm selection, fitness evaluation, initialization, evolution, parameter setting , and cooperation . First, we describe the key concepts and preliminaries of each of these ways of integration. Then, the recent advances in each way of integration are reviewed and classified based on a proposed unified taxonomy. Finally, we provide a technical discussion on the advantages, limitations, requirements, and challenges of implementing each of these integration ways, followed by promising future research directions.},

We evaluate the out-of-sample performance of a behavioural investor in relation to both a naïve investor who invests in an equally weighted portfolio and a rational investor, who maximises expected mean-variance utility. We report a number of findings. First, from an expected utility perspective, neither the rational investor nor the CPT investor achieves a risk-adjusted return or certainty equivalent return that significantly outperforms that of the naïve investor. Second, from a CPT utility perspective, the behavioural investor outperforms both the rational and naïve investors. Third, the CPT investor typically displays highly concentrated, lottery-like asset allocations, low turnover and highly stable portfolio allocations. Fourth, the addition of the investor&#39;s memory into the portfolio choice process increases both diversification and turnover, leading to improved investment performance. Finally, by allocating more weight to positively skewed assets and increasing portfolio concentration, the probability weighting function has more impact than the utility function on the behavioural investor&#39;s performance. Our results are robust to the choice of reference return, estimation sample size, probability estimates, the probability weighting function and portfolio weight constraints.},

The borrowing is done in the form of collateralized repurchase agreements, the haircut level of which depends on the total liquidations of all the banks. Similarly the fire-sale price of the asset obtained by each of the banks depends on the amount of assets liquidated by the bank itself and by other banks. By nature of this setup, banks’ behavior is considered as a Nash equilibrium. This paper provides two forms for market clearing to occur: through a common closing price and through an application of the limit order book. The main results of this work are providing the existence of maximal and minimal clearing solutions (i.e., liquidations, borrowing, fire sale prices, and haircut levels) as well as sufficient conditions for uniqueness of the clearing solutions.},

More formally, we formulate a model that minimizes the maximum regret on the expected returns while the conditional value-at-risk is upper bounded under different scenario settings. Several mathematical formulations are analyzed. Duality relations drive us to obtaining bounds on the optimal objective value of the problem in order to develop a cutting plane approach. We show experimentally that, despite the large number (hundreds of thousands) of constraints and variables of the resulting problem, an optimal portfolio can be found in a few seconds. Finally, our model is tested in a financial decision making environment by simulating its application in different markets indexes and under different underlying economic conditions.

In contrast to traditional approaches, distributionally robust optimization offers a risk-aware framework that provides performance guarantees when the distribution of uncertain parameters is not perfectly known. In this paper, we develop a distributionally robust chance-constrained optimization with a Wasserstein ambiguity set for energy and reserve dispatch, and provide an exact reformulation. While preserving the exactness, we then improve the model by enforcing physical bounds on the uncertainty space, resulting in a bilinear program. We solve the resulting bilinear model with an iterative algorithm which is computationally efficient and has convergence guarantee. A thorough out-of-sample analysis is performed to compare the proposed model against a scenario-based stochastic program. We also compare the performance of the proposed exact reformulation against an existing approximate technique in the literature, built upon a conditional-value-at-risk measure. We eventually show that the proposed physically-bounded exact reformulation outperforms the other methods by achieving a cost-optimal yet reliable trade-off between reserve procurement and load curtailment.},

  abstract     = {Radiotherapy treatment (RT) irradiates a patient&#39;s tumour volume while minimising damage to healthy tissue and surrounding critical organs at risk (OAR). In the conventional RT planning process, the RT planner has to iteratively adjust either the planning objectives (tumour or OAR dose levels) or the weights of the planning objectives until an acceptable plan is obtained that satisfies the minimum requirements. At the end of this iterative process, it remains unknown whether this plan is the best that can be obtained for the patient. The oncologist reviews each plan and decides to either treat using this plan or request further plan development, which may or may not lead to an actual improvement of the reviewed plan. We describe how Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used as a real-time decision support tool to assess quality of RT plans for head and neck cancer patients by applying a knowledge-based comparison of each new plan to a library of previous clinically approved plans. This library allows benchmarking, which gives planners and oncologists a better idea of the relative quality of their plan and its improvement potential, resulting in improved use of resources and better quality treatments for patients. Our DEA-based approach provides a novel way of capturing multiple measures of plan quality as well as anatomical differences between patients in the benchmarking process. We present the developed DEA model and results for a set of benchmark instances. Initial results of integrating DEA-based quality feedback into the RT planning process are presented showing that operations research can contribute significantly to planning quality in this setting.},

It has a detrimental impact on neighborhood safety and reputation. Blight also creates low-value areas in urban centers, reduces property values and business investment, and increases unemployment. These effects make urban blight an issue of growing interest as the need to eradicate blighted properties has significantly increased worldwide. This study adopted a constructivist, socio-technical stance that combined cognitive mapping, moving averages, and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory method. This methodological approach facilitated the identification of prevention strategies that control urban blight occurrences and subsequent eradication subject to seasonal constraints. Based on real-world cases, data was collected directly from a panel of urban blight experts. The members analyzed different prevention initiatives in terms of five major dimensions—governance, community involvement, economic context, territorial planning, and operations—which were previously identified during the development of a collective causal map. Practical applications of the proposed decision-support system were analyzed and validated by two independent experts from the Direção Geral do Território (General Directorate of the Territory of Portugal). No prior research was found that has adopted the proposed methodology to address urban blight.

  abstract     = {Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a technique used to measure the relative efficiency of a set of production units that applies multiple inputs to produce multiple outputs. In its original settings, the data is required to be nonnegative. To allow for negative data, several methods have been proposed. While these methods have merits, they also have weaknesses and limitations. This paper generalizes the construction of the production possibility set from production units with nonnegative observations to those with real values. Given the signs of the aggregate target and aggregate observed outputs of the production units to be evaluated, different models are developed to calculate the efficiencies under both variable and constant returns to scale technologies, and an additive model is used to identify the signs of the aggregate target and aggregate observed outputs. Since the efficiencies are calculated from the original observations without transformation or manipulation, the proposed method does not have the drawbacks of the existing methods. A case of the Detroit National Bank shows that the results obtained from the proposed method are more representative and reliable as compared to those obtained from a data transformation method.},

We derive the HHs using expressions with focus on the distinction between hinge location and the bending along each hinge. We argue that the HHs approximation can be estimated using a fixed endogenous determined partitioning of the input space. Assuming a homothetic production function allows us to separate the S-shape scaling law and the underlying core function. We propose an estimation procedure where two HHs function approximations of the core function and the scaling law are estimated simultaneously. A closed form expression of the inverse of the piecewise linear inverse scaling law is proposed and proved. We stress the known result that the HHs formulation is equivalent to the Canonical Piecewise-Linear representation of a piecewise linear function and exploit the result that the HHs formulations for the core function and for the scaling law provide global representations of all piecewise linear functional forms. A simulation study evaluates the performance of the proposed estimation procedure of an S-shaped production function.},

  abstract     = {Mass-scale red blood cell genotyping of donors and transfusion recipients increases the availability of extended antigen matched red blood cell units. Therefore, a new mathematical framework is developed that can be applied for general blood groups (i.e., beyond the ABO, RhD blood groups). It determines which red blood cell units should be issued from inventory, such that requests from hospitals can be satisfied with antigen compatible red blood cell units, shortages for future requests are avoided, and outdating is prevented. The optimization model consists of two steps: a binary vector representation for general blood groups and the formulation of the inventory allocation problem as a minimum cost flow problem. The potential practical performance of the optimization model is evaluated by iterative simulations, based on historical data on supply and demand of red blood cell units in the Netherlands. When including the fourteen clinically most relevant antigens, more than 90\% of all requests can be satisfied with antigen identical red blood cell units. Shortages and outdating can be kept restricted and could even be reduced to virtually zero, when only the ABO, RhD blood groups are considered.},

However, probing all uncertain data is undesirable because each probing may require cost or time depending on the methods of probing. We are interested in finding a solution, which we call Γ Γ -optimal, that is guaranteed to remain the best solution even after additional Γ Γ probings of uncertain data. An iterative algorithm to find the Γ Γ -optimal solution is developed with theoretical probability bounds of the Γ Γ -optimal solution being true optimal. Special algorithms are also developed for the problems on networks. The extensive computational study shows that the proposed approach could find the true optimal solutions at very high percentages, even with small numbers of probings.},

In this paper, we explore these dynamic characteristics, as captured by the Fourier transform of a dynamic steady-state simulation trajectory. We find that Fourier coefficient magnitudes can have greater discriminatory power than the usual test statistics when two systems have different utilisations and/or dynamic behaviour, and with simpler analysis resulting from the statistical independence of coefficient estimates at different frequencies.},

  abstract     = {Post-disruption restoration of critical infrastructures (CIs) often faces uncertainties associated with the required repair tasks and the related transportation network. However, such challenges are often overlooked in most studies on the improvement of CI resilience. In this paper, two-stage risk-averse and risk-neutral stochastic optimization models are proposed to schedule repair activities for a disrupted CI network with the objective of maximizing system resilience. Both models are developed based on a scenario-based optimization technique that accounts for the uncertainties of the repair time and the travel time spent on the underlying transportation network. Given the large number of uncertainty realizations associated with post-disruption restoration tasks, an improved fast forward algorithm based on a wait-and-see solution methodology is provided to reduce the number of chosen scenarios, which results in the desired probabilistic performance metrics. To assess the risks associated with post-disruption scheduling plans, a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) metric is incorporated into the optimization models through a scenario reduction algorithm. The proposed restoration framework is applied to the French RTE electric power network with a DC power flow procedure, and the results demonstrate the added value of using the stochastic optimization models incorporating the travel times related to repair activities. It is essential that risk-averse decision-making under uncertainty largely impacts the optimum schedule and the expected resilience, especially in the worst-case scenarios.},

The aim of the studied ILSSP, here called ILSSP-NT on parallel machines, is to determine a production planning and tasks sequencing that meet period demands without delay and in such a way that the total costs of production, machine setup and inventory are minimized. The dearth of literature on the ILSSP-NT, despite the increasing amount of applications in the industrial sector, mainly in the food processing industry, motivated us to conduct this study. In this paper, we propose efficient methods to solve the ILSSP-NT on parallel machines. The methods virtually consist in the hybridization of the relax-and-fix and fix-and-optimize methods with the path-relinking and kernel search heuristics. To assess how well the heuristics solve the ILSSP-NT on parallel machines, we compared their results with those of the CPLEX solver with a fixed CPU time limit. The proposed matheuristics significantly outperformed CPLEX in most of the tested instances.},

  abstract     = {Official prices are commonly publicized by firms as reference prices to influence consumers’ valuation of products. By characterizing the reference effect as a general nondecreasing concave function of the official price, we study the timing of pricing decisions in dual distribution channels where a manufacturer distributes the product by a direct channel and an indirect retail channel. We investigate two fundamental pricing policies wherein the manufacturer and the retailer put forward their selling prices simultaneously (ST) or sequentially (SQ). Counter intuitively, our analytical results demonstrate that despite facing a more severe downstream price competition, the manufacturer should charge a higher (rather than a lower) official price in the ST setting than in the SQ setting. In addition, with the reference effect of official price, the ideal case for the manufacturers that operate dual distribution channels is to let the direct channel focus on promoting products and let the retail channel function be the major selling channel, an idea which is supported by the practices of Nike, Apple, and many other leading brands around the world. Furthermore, our numerical examples disclose that the dual-channel efficiency under both decentralized cases (i.e., ST and SQ) increases in the magnitude and variability of the reference effect and the retail channel cost, but decreases in the unit direct channel cost. Finally, we extend our model to incorporate an online direct channel and an offline retailer. We find that, under all of CE, ST and SQ scenarios, the shipping fee charged in the online direct channel will reduce the manufacturer’s total profits by lowering her optimal official prices and direct-sales quantities simultaneously. Managerial implications of this study are discussed.},

However, compared with other financing means such as trade credit and bank loans, the effects on the supply chain of a third-party logistics provider (TPL) providing in-transit inventory financing are seldom investigated. This study adopts a channel competition model to examine the impact of such financing on the supply chain. Through comparative analysis with conventional financing approaches, we find that the availability of in-transit inventory financing allows retailers to take advantage of a lower financing fee for trade credit, even when the demand for trade credit decreases. In addition, the TPL-provided financing service can lead to a reduction in financing fee for both trade credit and in-transit inventory financing when both the supplier and retailers have financing demand or the TPL is subject to a high degree of risk aversion. Finally, when the TPL has the first-mover advantage in setting its financing fee, the supplier with a financing demand pays a lower financing fee to the TPL due to the decreased demand for in-transit inventory financing. In this case, we find that the low logistics cost, the low unit product price without trade credit and a high financing ratio can make in-transit inventory financing more attractive than trade credit. Our results have important implications for the implementation of in-transit inventory financing in supply chains.},

We study the operational and financial decisions of a chain with a supplier (Stackelberg leader) selling to a capital-constrained retailer via a debt-shared contract. We derive the equilibrium debt-shared coefficient, wholesale price, order quantity and bank’s interest rate with the retailer in different wealth regions. The very poor retailer always accepts debt-sharing and earns a profit, even if the supplier sets the wholesale price up to the retail price. The medium poor retailer might enter a supplier’s debt-sharing hole (a retailer’s wealth region) and acquire zero profit, by using debt-sharing with a wholesale price up to the retail price. For the medium poor retailer outside the hole or the medium rich retailer, the supplier offers either an optimal debt-shared bank financing contract or an optimal price-only contract at her benefit, mainly depending on the production cost and the retailer’s capital. Under debt-shared bank financing, both the supplier’s profit and the chain’s efficiency improve. The retailer might overstock when the production cost is high. Computational studies show the not very rich retailer’s profit is a bowl-shaped function of his capital and the bottom is the hole. The very poor retailer might earn a larger profit than under the optimal price-only contract. The supplier’s profit is unimodal and it achieves globally optimum in the hole (at the upper bound of the hole if production cost is low).},

In the single-criterion case, robust optimization methodology helps to identify solutions which remain feasible and of good quality for all possible scenarios. A well-known alternative method in the single-objective case is to compare possible decisions under uncertainty with the optimal decision with the benefit of hindsight, i.e. to minimize the (possibly scaled) regret of not having chosen the optimal decision. In this contribution, we extend the concept of regret from the single-objective case to the multiobjective setting and introduce a proper definition of multivariate (robust) (relative) regret. In contrast to the few existing ideas that mix scalarization and optimization, we clearly separate the modelling of multiobjective (robust) regret from its numerical solution. Moreover, our approach is not limited to a finite uncertainty set or interval uncertainty and furthermore, computations or at least approximations remain tractable in several important special cases. We illustrate all approaches based on a biobjective shortest path problem under uncertainty.},

To produce feasible and industrially meaningful schedules, this paper extends the recently proposed batch-oblivious approach by considering unavailability periods and minimum time lags and by simultaneously optimizing multiple criteria that are relevant in the industrial context. A novel criterion on the satisfaction of production targets decided at a higher level is also proposed. Because the solution approach must be embedded in a real-time application, decision makers must express their preferences before the optimization phase. In addition, a preference model is introduced where trade-off is only allowed between some criteria. Two a priori multiobjective extensions of Simulated Annealing are proposed, which differ in how the simultaneous use of a lexicographic order and weights is handled when evaluating the fitness. A known a posteriori approach of the literature is used as a benchmark. All the metaheuristics are embedded in a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure. The different versions of the archived GRASP approach are compared using large industrial instances. The numerical results show that the proposed approach provides good solutions regarding the preferences. Finally, the comparison of the optimized schedules with the actual factory schedules shows the significant improvements that our approach can bring.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study a multi-agent project staffing problem involving a single project, which has to be scheduled under resource constraints. We consider a functional organisational structure where a team leader and a project manager are together responsible for the operational execution of a project. The team leader, which has the formal authority over the resources, is standing at the top of the hierarchy and determines the number and mix of (additional) employees and tries to level the workload over the planning period in order to avoid idle resource times. The project manager is responsible for the scheduling of the project activities and his/her objective is to minimise the project duration. The interaction between both agents in the decision-making process is, on the one hand, hierarchical, i.e. the team leader imposes his/her decision on the project manager. On the other hand, the decision taken by the team leader should comply to the objective of the project manager such that the staffing plan and project schedule is agreed by both parties. We propose a bilevel optimisation model that embeds a nested inner optimisation problem, i.e. the project manager decision problem, as a constraint in the outer optimisation problem, i.e. the decision problem of the team leader. The algorithm is a mathematical programming method thriving on the generation of additional lazy constraints via feasibility callbacks so that the team leader problem has to respect the requirements formulated in the project manager problem. In the computational experiments, we compare this solution approach to alternative classical optimisation approaches and we validate the design choices related to the proposed speed-up mechanisms and parameter settings.},

  abstract     = {Linear energy system models are a crucial component of energy system design and operations, as well as energy policy consulting. If detailed enough, such models lead to large-scale linear programs, which can be intractable even for the best state-of-the-art solvers. This article introduces an interior-point solver that exploits common structures of energy system models to efficiently run in parallel on distributed-memory systems. The solver is designed for linear programs with doubly-bordered block-diagonal constraint matrix and makes use of a Schur complement based decomposition. In order to handle the large number of linking constraints and variables commonly observed in energy system models, a distributed Schur complement preconditioner is used. In addition, the solver features a number of more generic techniques such as parallel matrix scaling and structure-preserving presolving. The implementation is based on the solver PIPS-IPM. We evaluate the computational performance on energy system models with up to four billion nonzero entries in the constraint matrix—and up to one billion columns and one billion rows. This article mainly concentrates on the energy system model ELMOD, which is a linear optimization model representing the European electricity markets by the use of a nodal pricing market-clearing. It has been widely applied in the literature on energy system analyses in recent years. However, it will be demonstrated that the new solver is also applicable to other energy system models.},

  abstract     = {Sensitivity analysis and multiparametric programming in optimization modeling study variations of optimal value and solutions in the presence of uncertain input parameters. In this paper, we consider simultaneous variations in the inputs of the objective and constraint (jointly called the RIM parameters ), where the uncertainty is represented as a multivariate probability distribution. We introduce a tolerance approach based on principal component analysis, which obtains a tolerance region that is suited to the given distribution and can be considered a confidence set for the random input parameters. Since a tolerance region may contain parameters with different optimal bases, we extend the tolerance approach to the case where multiple optimal bases cover the tolerance region, by studying theoretical properties of critical regions (defined as the set of input parameters having the same optimal basis). We also propose a computational algorithm to find critical regions covering a given tolerance region in the RIM parameter space. Our theoretical results on geometric properties of critical regions contribute to the existing theory of parametric programming with an emphasis on the case where RIM parameters vary jointly, and provide deeper geometric understanding of critical regions. We evaluate the proposed framework using a series of experiments for sensitivity analysis, for model predictive control of an inventory management problem, and for large optimization problem instances.},

  abstract     = {We consider facility location problems where n n facilities are present in a convex polygon in the rectilinear plane, over which continuous and uniform demand is distributed and within which a convex polygonal barrier is located (removing all demand and preventing all travel within the barrier), and the optimal location for an additional facility is sought. We start with an in-depth analysis of the representation of the bisectors of two facilities affected by the barrier and how it is affected by the position of the additional facility. Following this, a detailed investigation into the changes in the structure of the Voronoi diagram caused by the movement of this additional facility, which governs the form of the objective function for numerous facility location problems, yields a set of linear constraints for a general convex barrier that partitions the market space into a finite number of regions within which the exact solution can be found in polynomial time. This allows us to formulate a polynomial exact algorithm that makes use of a triangular decomposition of the incremental Voronoi diagram and the first order optimality conditions.},

  abstract     = {Network flow formulations are among the most successful tools to solve optimization problems. Such formulations correspond to determining an optimal flow in a network. One particular class of network flow formulations is the arc flow, where variables represent flows on individual arcs of the network. For N P NP -hard problems, polynomial-sized arc flow models typically provide weak linear relaxations and may have too much symmetry to be efficient in practice. Instead, arc flow models with a pseudo-polynomial size usually provide strong relaxations and are efficient in practice. The interest in pseudo-polynomial arc flow formulations has grown considerably in the last twenty years, in which they have been used to solve many open instances of hard problems. A remarkable advantage of pseudo-polynomial arc flow models is the possibility to solve practical-sized instances directly by a Mixed Integer Linear Programming solver, avoiding the implementation of complex methods based on column generation. In this survey, we present theoretical foundations of pseudo-polynomial arc flow formulations, by showing a relation between their network and Dynamic Programming (DP). This relation allows a better understanding of the strength of these formulations, through a link with models obtained by Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition. The relation with DP also allows a new perspective to relate state-space relaxation methods for DP with arc flow models. We also present a dual point of view to contrast the linear relaxation of arc flow models with that of models based on paths and cycles. To conclude, we review the main solution methods and applications of arc flow models based on DP in several domains such as cutting, packing, scheduling, and routing.},
