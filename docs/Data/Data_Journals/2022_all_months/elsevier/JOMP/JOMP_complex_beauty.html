  abstract     = {Visual perceptual decision-making involves multiple components including visual encoding, attention, accumulation of evidence, and motor execution. Recent research suggests that EEG signals can identify the time of encoding and the onset of evidence accumulation during perceptual decision-making. Although scientists show that spatial attention improves participant performance in decision making , little is known about how spatial attention influences the individual cognitive components that give rise to that improvement in performance. We found evidence in this work that both visual encoding time (VET) before evidence accumulation and other non-decision time processes after or during evidence accumulation are influenced by spatial top-down attention. Specifically, we used an open-source dataset in which participants were informed about the location of a target stimulus in the visual field on some trials during a face-car perceptual decision-making task. Fitting neural drift–diffusion models to response time, accuracy, and single-trial N200 latencies ( ∼ ∼ 125 to 225 ms post-stimulus) of EEG allowed us to separate the processes of visual encoding and the decision process from other non-decision time processes such as motor execution. These models were fitted in a single step in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Quantitative model comparison to simulation-based theories reveals that spatial attention manipulates both VET and other non-decision time processes. We discuss why spatial attention may affect other non-evidence accumulation processes, such as motor execution time (MET), and why this may seem unexpected given the literature. We provide recommendations for future work to deal with this topic by a combination of neuro-cognitive models and model simulations at the single-trial level.},

  abstract     = {Experiments where participants synchronise their taps to rhythmic cues are often used to study human perception and performance of rhythms. This experimental study is novel in two regards: The cyclic rhythms (non-isochronous patterns of cues) presented to participants were more challenging than usual (including many from unfamiliar time signatures), and we have modelled participants’ performance via a conditional point process . Point processes are well suited to describing partly random sequences of events, but have rarely been used previously to model tapping experiments, the only other study we know being Cannon (2021). Our model uses continuous functional parameters to describe participants’ responses to auditory stimuli with much finer temporal resolution than in previous studies. Taking account of both the clock and the dynamic attention theories of sensorimotor synchronisation, we assessed the time course of the propensity to tap within each cycle at a resolution of less than 13 ms ms , identifying the influence of cues on the tapping propensity and the progress of learning their rhythmic patterns. We also sought to determine the trajectory of the putative refractory period (feedback inhibition of tapping) after each tap, and assessed the distribution of tap-cue asynchronies in a more finely resolved manner than usual. Our models also indicated complex kinetics of the feedback over about 100 ms ms .},

The acceptance assessment of success and failure is presented on subjective scales. We set an optimal policy that recommends analyzing applicants up to a certain point in time (a threshold time) without selecting any of them and then selecting the next encountered candidate.

  abstract     = {We propose a hierarchical Bayesian model for working memory updating. This model accounts for both the accuracy of the responses and the reaction times (RT) in the memory updating paradigm, which is a commonly used paradigm to measure working memory capacity . We adapt a mutual interference model from Oberauer and Kliegl (2006) to explain responses. Oberauer and Kliegl (2006) used a Boltzmann equation framework based on the activation levels of items stored in working memory to quantify the probability of correct response at the final recall step after memory updating. We expand the original framework with a Markov chain structure, so that the model accounts for the probabilities of all possible responses, correct or incorrect, at both the intermediate steps during memory updating and the final recall step after memory updating. We use a Wald diffusion process to characterize RT, where the drift rate parameters are associated with the activation levels of items in working memory. This model allows us to investigate the mechanisms underlying choices and RTs in the memory updating paradigm under a joint theoretical framework. A simulation study shows the effectiveness of this model, and posterior predictive distributions and out-of-sample validations show that this model gives a good account of empirical working memory updating findings. We apply the model to two published data sets. The first data set, from Oberauer and Kliegl (2001), examined age differences in working memory. Results from our model reveal an increased level of mutual interference, less use of memory trace information, and potentially less pre-activation of memorized items in older adults compared to younger adults. The second data set, from De Simoni and von Bastian (2018), investigated transfer effects of working memory training . Results from our model reveal a potential transfer effect in the speed of information accumulation, where training in one working memory task may improve the information processing speed in another.},

We first propose a technical classification of these definitions into three groups based on their dependence on an agent’s belief, show how they relate to each other, and prove under what conditions they are indistinguishable. Going beyond this technical analysis, we propose a taxonomy of surprise definitions and classify them into four conceptual categories based on the quantity they measure: (i) ‘prediction surprise’ measures a mismatch between a prediction and an observation; (ii) ‘change-point detection surprise’ measures the probability of a change in the environment; (iii) ‘confidence-corrected surprise’ explicitly accounts for the effect of confidence; and (iv) ‘information gain surprise’ measures the belief-update upon a new observation. The taxonomy poses the foundation for principled studies of the functional roles and physiological signatures of surprise in the brain.},

In addition, this paper gives an explicit characterization to introduce the completeness of polytomous attributions and defines the concept of a complete polytomous knowledge structure by the property that such a polytomous knowledge structure is derived from a complete polytomous attribution. This paper establishes a Galois connection between the collection K of all polytomous knowledge structures and the collection F of all polytomous attributions, where the closed elements are respectively in K the complete polytomous knowledge structures, and in F the complete polytomous attributions. Furthermore, this Galois connection induces a one-to-one correspondence between the two sets of closed elements. Moreover, this Galois connection can also induce a Galois connection between the collection of all granular polytomous knowledge structures and the collection of all granular polytomous attributions.},

As an illustration of the method, in an experiment 20 university students compared, only once, each of 16 job pairs, judging which has the larger salary and creating the size of salary differences. The correlation between a theoretical measure of the size of perceived salary difference and the direct measures of perceived salary difference is 0.99. The probability of correctly predicting individual binary choices between jobs, based on the students’ generated measures of perceived stimulus difference, ranges to 1.00 from 0.935.

  abstract     = {Research on advice utilization often operationalizes the construct via Judge Advisor Systems (JAS), where a judge’s belief is elicited, they are provided advice, and given an opportunity to revise their belief. Belief change, or weight of advice (WOA), is measured as the shift in the judge’s belief proportional to the difference between their original belief and the advice. Several JAS studies have found WOA typically takes on a trimodal distribution, with inflation at the boundary values of 0 (indicating a judge declined advice) and 1 (adoption of advice). A dual hurdle beta model is proposed to account for these inflations. In addition to being an innovative computational model to address this methodological challenge, it also serves as a descriptive theoretical model which posits that the decision process happens in two stages: an initial discrete “choosing” stage, where the judge opts to either decline, adopt, or compromise with advice; and a subsequent continuous “averaging” stage, which occurs only if the judge opts to compromise. The approach was assessed via reanalysis of three recent JAS studies reflective of popular topics in the literature, such as algorithmic advice utilization, egocentric discounting effects, and judgmental forecasting. In each case new results were uncovered about how different correlates of advice utilization influence the decision process at either or both of the discrete and continuous stages, often in quite different ways, providing support for the descriptive theoretical model. A Bayesian graphical analysis framework is provided that can be applied to future research on advice utilization.},

The model accounts for heterogeneity in consideration screening by allowing respondents to have different thresholds for accepting attribute levels. By utilizing a conjunctive consideration rule, the model can capture well-known non-compensatory screening heuristics. The decision stage is modelled with a compensatory utility model. We compare our two-stage approach with the mixed logit model on simulated choice data, and conclude that both models can be distinguished based on the pattern of opt-out responses they produce. If such responses are the result of screening behaviour, the two-stage model is always selected in favour of a single-stage model. In addition, we evaluated several models on empirical choice data concerning preferences towards cinemas. Our results show that the data is best explained by the proposed model, suggesting that 73\% of the participants used a screening rule before making a final choice.},

  abstract     = {A major argument for positional-coding over associative chaining models of immediate serial recall has been the high probability that an error from a prior list will appear in its correct serial-position, so-called “protrusions.” Here we show that a chaining model can produce protrusions if it includes three characteristics that have been incorporated into published chaining models: (a) a “start-signal” item is associated with all first list-items, (b) memory is not cleared following each list, and (c) the retrieval cue for each item is always the full non-redintegrated retrieved information, regardless of the response. The model covertly recalls all studied lists in parallel (weighted by recency), such that when prior-list items intrude, they predominantly occur at the correct output position. In addition to fitting prior protrusion data, we report two new data sets that question the ubiquity of the simple protrusion-dominance characteristic. These findings show that protrusions cannot falsify an associative basis for serial-order memory and speak to the plausibility of mixture models.},

  abstract     = {A central component of human intelligence is the ability to make abstractions, to gloss over some details in favor of drawing out higher-order structure. Clustering stimuli together is a classic example of this. However, the crucial question remains of how one should make these abstractions—what details to retain and what to throw away? How many clusters to form? We provide an analysis of how a rational agent with limited cognitive resources should approach this problem, considering not only how well a clustering fits the data but also by how ‘complex’ it is, i.e. how cognitively expensive it is to represent. We show that the solution to this problem provides a way to reinterpret a wide range of psychological models that are based on principles from non-parametric Bayesian statistics . In particular, we show that the Chinese Restaurant Process prior, ubiquitous in rational models of human and animal clustering behavior, can be interpreted as minimizing an intuitive formulation of representational complexity.},

We begin by looking at a property called forgetting consistency, which enforces a systematic way of forgetting within a knowledge structure. Next, we analyze in detail a concept we call positive knowledge correlation. This concept postulates that knowing more should not make it less likely that a student knows a particular concept. Among other things, we find that satisfying positive knowledge correlation implies the knowledge structure is closed under both union and intersection, and we also perform an empirical evaluation to assess the validity of the property. Finally, in the context of an adaptive assessment, we conclude with an analysis of the related concept of a positively correlated updating rule.},

Following these developments, the paper provides a first counterexample showing that the assumptions in Heller (2021) do not guarantee component-directed joins to be defined item-wise. This leads to an incomplete characterization of the closed elements of the Galois connection in Proposition 8 of Heller (2021), an issue which is resolved in the present paper. A second counterexample in the paper shows that the equivalence between atoms and ⨆ ⨆ -irreducible elements of the polytomous structure stated in Stefanutti et al. (2020) may not hold in general. This paper provides theoretical results showing that the equivalence still holds if the response categories form a linear order or the structure happens to be factorial .},

  abstract     = {We analyze the interaction between two classical tenets of economic rationality: transitivity and completeness. For a single binary relation , the combination of these properties yields a total preorder. For two binary relations, their interplay entails a NaP -preference: this is a nested pair ≿ N , ≿ P ≿N,≿P of relations satisfying mixed forms of transitivity and completeness. It is known that a NaP -preference ≿ N , ≿ P ≿N,≿P is characterized by a family of total preorders having ≿ N ≿N and ≿ P ≿P as their intersection and union, respectively. This paper examines extensions of this approach to more than two relations. First we define generalized NaP -preferences ( GNaP -preferences): these are diamond-shaped quadruples of binary relations on a set such that transitivity and completeness are suitably spread throughout all four components. Then we characterize a GNaP -preference by a family of total preorders witnessing all relations by different combinations of union and intersection. We also show that a suitable amalgamation of NaP -preferences generates a GNaP -preference, and vice versa each GNaP -preference arises by this procedure. Finally, we introduce modal preference structures: these are lattices of binary relations such that the satisfaction of transitivity and completeness is guided by the action of the universal and the existential quantifiers over a family of total preorders. Applications of these novel preference structures to economics and psychology emerge naturally.},

The sensitivity and reliability of the MST make it an extremely valuable tool in clinical settings, where it has been used to identify hippocampal dysfunction associated with healthy aging, dementia, schizophrenia, depression, and other disorders. As with any test used in a clinical setting, it is especially important for the MST to be administered as efficiently as possible. We apply adaptive design optimization methods (Lesmes et al.,2015; Myung et al., 2013) to optimize the presentation of test stimuli in accordance with previous responses. This optimization is based on a signal detection model of an individual’s memory capabilities and decision-making processes. We demonstrate that the adaptive design optimization approach generally reduces the number of test stimuli needed to measure recognition memory.},

  abstract     = {Animal interval timing is often studied through the peak interval (PI) procedure. In this procedure, the animal is rewarded for the first response after a fixed delay from the stimulus onset, but on some trials, the stimulus remains and no reward is given. The standard methods and models to analyse the response pattern describe it as break-run-break, a period of low rate response followed by rapid responding, followed by a low rate of response. The study of the pattern has found correlations between start, stop, and duration of the run period that hold across species and experiments. It is commonly assumed that to achieve the statistics with a pacemaker accumulator model, it is necessary to have start and stop thresholds. In this paper, we will develop a new model that varies response rate in relation to the likelihood of event occurrence, as opposed to a threshold, for changing the response rate. The new model reproduced the start and stop statistics that have been observed in 14 different PI experiments from 3 different papers. The developed model is also compared to the two-threshold Time-adaptive Drift–diffusion Model (TDDM), and the latest accumulator model subsuming the scalar expectancy theory (SET) on all 14 datasets. The results show that it is unnecessary to have explicit start and stop thresholds or an internal equivalent to break-run-break states to reproduce the individual trials statistics, the average behaviour, and the break-run-break analysis results. The new model also produces more realistic individual trials compared to TDDM.},

STA is based on the fact that under very weak conditions, any model in which r r parameters are varying across r r or more tasks predicts an r r -dimensional state-trace plot. Although monotonicity assumptions can sometimes be useful in STA, they are not required. Specifically, there is no need to assume that performance in any task is a monotonic function of whichever parameters are varying. As a result, requiring STA models to assume monotonicity seriously reduces the applicability of STA. Whereas an STA can identify the number of varying parameters, it provides no information about the number of underlying systems. Similarly, STA is ill suited to examining dissociations. It can be used to test for double, but not single dissociations. In particular, a monotonic state-trace plot rules out a double dissociation but provides no information about whether or not the data contain a single dissociation.},

Moreover, unspoken, tacit commitments are often perceived as binding: people often stick to, and are expected to stick to, these commitments, even where it might seem against their interests to do so. If they do not stick to these commitments, they may be punished, and expect to be punished, by others as a result, even if the act of punishment is itself costly for the punisher. These commitments have been widely seen as a crucial underpinning for human collaboration and cooperation. Yet how do such commitments arise, and are they compatible with human rationality? This paper provides a formal, reasoning-based account of tacit commitments based on “virtual bargaining”—a mode of reasoning that joins elements of individualistic and collaborative reasoning. We complement existing accounts by showing that even purely self-interested individuals can, under certain conditions, tacitly commit to punishing counterparts who violate an unenforceable agreement, or to cooperating in dynamic games, including the Centipede game and the finitely repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma game.},

Unlike other goodness-of-fit tests, the new analysis does not examine the statistical structure of the residuals; rather it is based on an examination of the concordance or discordance of the experimental observations from the expectations of the scientific theory. The novel goodness-of-fit procedure is used to assess four highly similar mathematical theories for the probability weighting function from the risky choice literature. Prior research in mathematical psychology and behavioral economics has demonstrated the importance of a nonlinear weighting function for the probabilities that are associated with risky choice, but it has been a challenge to discriminate among a set of different nonlinear functions . However, a reanalysis of the data from a study by Barch and Chechile (2016) with the new goodness-of-fit procedure shows that each of the previously established leading models are sharply discriminated from one another. This analysis is thus an example of how scientific theories, which propose a specific mathematical function , can be assessed with the Bayesian distribution-free goodness-of-fit test. The method is quite general, and it can also be used to assess scientific models that predict multivariate outcomes.},

In this tutorial, we present fundamental concepts and tools for developing analytic likelihood functions for the ACT-R cognitive architecture. These tools are based on statistical concepts such as serial vs. parallel process, convolution , minimum/maximum processing time, and mixtures. Importantly, these statistical concepts are highly composable, allowing them to be combined to form likelihood functions for many models. We demonstrate how to apply these tools within the context of Bayesian parameter estimation using five models taken from the standard ACT-R tutorial. Although the tutorial focuses on ACT-R due to its prevalence, the concepts covered within the tutorial are applicable to other cognitive architectures.},

OGCM incorporates serial order as a feature along ordinary physical features, allowing it to account for the effect of sequential order as a form of distortion of the feature space.

  abstract     = {The active inference framework, and in particular its recent formulation as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), has gained increasing popularity in recent years as a useful approach for modeling neurocognitive processes . This framework is highly general and flexible in its ability to be customized to model any cognitive process , as well as simulate predicted neuronal responses based on its accompanying neural process theory. It also affords both simulation experiments for proof of principle and behavioral modeling for empirical studies. However, there are limited resources that explain how to build and run these models in practice, which limits their widespread use. Most introductions assume a technical background in programming, mathematics, and machine learning. In this paper we offer a step-by-step tutorial on how to build POMDPs, run simulations using standard MATLAB routines, and fit these models to empirical data. We assume a minimal background in programming and mathematics, thoroughly explain all equations, and provide exemplar scripts that can be customized for both theoretical and empirical studies. Our goal is to provide the reader with the requisite background knowledge and practical tools to apply active inference to their own research. We also provide optional technical sections and multiple appendices, which offer the interested reader additional technical details. This tutorial should provide the reader with all the tools necessary to use these models and to follow emerging advances in active inference research.},

  abstract     = {The work deals with the assessment of the set of skills an individual has available in a certain disciplinary domain (which is called the competence state) from the responses of this individual to test items. Competence-based test development is introduced as a novel approach for developing tests for skill assessment. Given a fixed collection of skills of interest in the disciplinary domain, the resulting tests are as informative as possible about individuals’ competence states. The development of conjunctive (all skills associated with an item are necessary for solving it) and disjunctive (each of the skills associated with a certain item is sufficient for solving it) tests is considered. Various applications of the proposed methodology are presented. They cover different scenarios, such as the construction of a test from scratch, or the improvement and shortening of an existing test.},

  abstract     = {Military research encompasses a wide variety of topics that would benefit from the advanced analytical techniques of mathematical psychology . This tutorial provides important context and guidance on how to best prepare and present experimental findings for a military audience. The first discussion points cover how decisions are made by end users and funders in the military. Next, several simple approaches are described to convert inferential statistics and effect size information into data more readily appreciable by military end users. Finally, the tutorial concludes with simple guidance that should help anyone interested in military research better convey their findings to funding agencies and for practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Risk occupies a central role in both the theory and practice of decision-making. Although it is deeply implicated in many conditions involving dysfunctional behavior and thought, modern theoretical approaches to understanding and mitigating risk, in either one-shot or sequential settings, have yet to permeate fully the fields of neural reinforcement learning and computational psychiatry. Here we use one prominent approach, called conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), to examine optimal risk-sensitive choice and a form of optimal, risk-sensitive offline planning. We relate the former to both a justified form of the gambler’s fallacy and extremely risk-avoidant behavior resembling that observed in anxiety disorders. We relate the latter to worry and rumination.},
