  abstract = {As the frequency and duration of grid outages increase, backup power systems are becoming more important for ensuring that critical infrastructure continues to provide essential services. Most facilities rely on diesel generators, which may be ineffective during long outages owing to limited fuel supplies and high generator failure rates. Distributed energy resources such as solar, storage, and combined-heat-and-power systems, coupled with on-site biofuel production, offer an alternative source of on-site generation that can provide both cost savings and resilience (i.e., the ability to respond to catastrophic events with longer-term consequences). A mixed-integer linear program minimizes costs and maximizes resilience at a wastewater treatment plant in Wilmington, North Carolina. We find that the plant can reduce life-cycle energy costs by 3.1\% through the installation of a hybrid combined-heat-and-power, photovoltaic, and storage system. When paired with existing diesel generators, this system can sustain full load for seven days while saving $664,000 over 25 years and reducing diesel fuel use by 48\% compared with the diesel-only solution. This analysis informed a decision by the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority to allocate funds for the implementation of a combined-heat-and-power system at the wastewater treatment plant in fiscal year 2023. The benefits of deploying hybrid combined-heat-and-power technologies and the utilization of on-site biofuel production extend, on a national scale, to thousands of wastewater treatment facilities and other types of critical infrastructure.},

All these establishments contain (in addition to other facilities associated with living, exercising, learning, activities, etc.) dining services managed by an interdisciplinary (finance, nutrition, dietitian, kitchen operations, hospitality, and procurement) team of executives, each with their own objective while cognizant of the overarching organizational, operational, and financial metrics. The residents of these facilities consume most of their meals at these dining facilities, necessitating that the food served meets the complete nutrition, dietary, cost, and operational requirements. Thus, the menu (often rotating every few weeks) of food items must be carefully chosen to be efficiently procured, processed, and served, all the while meeting the nutritional, dietary, and patron satisfaction constraints each put forth by the corresponding stakeholder. We address this complex, unwieldy, and large multiobjective optimization problem using mixed integer linear programming. We demonstrate how menu planners and chefs can analyze their decisions regarding menu structures and evaluate alternative menu interventions to improve menus’ nutritional value while ensuring their residents’ autonomy in making food choice decisions. Along the way, we interviewed various stakeholders, identified their objectives and constraints, gathered the necessary data, formulated and solved the resulting optimization problems, and produced demonstrably effective menus.},

The firm provides these predictions within a set of estimates based on industry standard function count methods as well as firm-specific predictive models based on function points and on initial labor assignments. Company management is thus equipped with predictions from multiple methodologies and multiple information sources, enhancing the firm’s ability to predict project needs. Managers aggregate the forecasts, with prediction performance estimated to improve by 35\%–49\%, measured relative to estimates of the absolute percentage error of the prior method. The improved predictions provide a significant advantage to planning decisions and efficient internal operations.

The literature provides guidance to companies like Capital One planning a major technology implementation, including using a quantitative planning process, involving a diverse set of stakeholders, and reducing information asymmetry. We initially used multiattribute utility theory as a quantitative model to support the planning process. Although our initial approach provided a quantitative view of the impact of various rollout alternatives on the organization, the executives realized that the impacts could vary greatly across business areas. We developed a new approach using group decision theory that provided both individual views on each business area and a combined view. Realizing that each of their current alternatives adversely affected some business areas, the executive stakeholders used the findings to develop a new rollout strategy. Using the new strategy, Capital One avoided the delays experienced by other banks implementing the same technology and saved approximately $30 million while improving customer and employee satisfaction.},

Our collaboration with LTCH&amp;amp;S was initiated to facilitate the increasingly challenging task of scheduling nursing staff and reduce the high absenteeism rate observed among the part-time nurses. We developed a spreadsheet-based scheduling tool to automate the generation of schedules and incorporate nurses’ preferences for different shifts into the schedules. At the core of the scheduling tool is a hierarchical optimization model that generates a feasible schedule with the highest total preference score while satisfying the maximum possible demand. Feasible schedules had to abide by a set of complex seniority requirements, which prioritized more-senior nurses when allocating the available shifts. Our scheduling tool was implemented in a 391-bed home in Toronto. The tool allowed nursing managers to generate feasible schedules within a fraction of an hour, in contrast to the status quo manual approach, which could take up to tens of hours. In addition, the schedules successfully accounted for preferences with, on average, above 94\% of the allocated shifts ranked as most preferred.},

To facilitate team meetings, we offer an exact formulation to ensure students on a given team share a minimum number of common time slots during which they are available. The second team criterion is sufficient soft skills. Using a unique text analysis approach, we ensure that each team includes students with adequate soft skills, such as leadership and interpersonal skills. Our analytic approach enhances the students’ learning experience and class performance and simplifies the faculty task of forming teams.},

  abstract = {Bay Area toll bridges are the main transportation link across the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area. These bridges experience extreme congestion and become bottlenecks during peak hours with long backups at the toll plazas. A solution to ensure smooth vehicle throughput at toll plazas is the widespread adoption of the electronic toll collection system called FasTrak. However, the FasTrak system has experienced low usage rates since its inception relative to other toll collection systems in the country. Forecasting, marketing, and operations research models were utilized to make recommendations and collaborate with transportation authorities to increase FasTrak usage during peak hours (5–10 a.m. and 3–7 p.m.) to address traffic congestion. After these recommendations were implemented, FasTrak usage increased from 40\% in 2006 to the long-term target of 70\% by 2016. This paper presents a synthesis of the challenges and the implementation of the FasTrak Strategic Plan. Furthermore, econometric models are presented that capture the effect on traffic volumes of increased FasTrak usage achieved through congestion pricing. Saved travel time resulted in productivity gains of approximately $569 million per year. This study contributes to an understanding of the role of effective transportation policies in reducing congestion and improving productivity.},

Relief incentive packages were provided via the Iowa Economic Development Authority (IEDA) to Iowa-based companies to support their operations. A team of policy makers, faculty, and industry professionals was formed to conduct text analyses, analyze the survey responses, validate insights, and ensure that the appropriate policies were enacted. The analysis yielded a reproducible process using the statistical software R to quickly analyze large volumes of free-text responses to open-ended survey questions and develop topics comparable to those found through human coding. This process, using biterm topic models (BTMs), was first used to verify and validate the results of human coding and, because of its increased speed to insights compared with that of human coding, to validate hypotheses empirically much more quickly in subsequent surveys. Analyzing free-text responses has given the IEDA confidence that open-ended survey questions provide value not previously captured. In addition to the original survey, the three subsequent ones, along with several additional projects, have been shaped by the original text-mining methods.},

At Clemson University, the administration implemented hybrid schedules for fall 2020, in which students attend classes partly online and partly in person. To limit exposures of COVID-19 in the classroom, we propose two rotational attendance models (the three-cohort model and the once-a-week model) that aim to allow in-person classroom time and minimize exposure between students. In a baseline strategy, students would interact with an average of 84 students per week and attend class in person 2.6 days a week. By contrast, the three-cohort model and once-a-week model achieve about 57 and 83 student interactions per week and 1.6 and 1.9 in-person student attendance days a week, respectively. Although these figures of merit may imply that the three-cohort model is preferable, it achieves its results by forcing about 1,600 of the 21,000 students who want to attend courses in person to participate online instead and forcing courses that meet twice a week to be attended twice in a three-week rotation. Considering the tradeoffs between the figures of merit related to student interaction and anticipated implementation challenges, Clemson University implemented the once-a-week model for fall 2020 and spring 2021.},

We propose a hub-and-spoke design and utilize real data of student activities to identify hub locations and bus stops to be used in the new routes. To reduce disease transmission via expiratory aerosol, we design new bus routes that are shorter than 15 minutes to travel and operate using at most 50\% seat capacity and the same number of buses before the pandemic. We sample a variety of scenarios that cover variations of peak demand, social distancing requirements, and bus breakdowns to demonstrate the system resiliency of the new routes and schedules via simulation. The new bus routes were implemented and used during the academic year 2020–2021 to ensure social distancing and short travel time. Our approach can be generalized to redesign public transit systems with a social distancing requirement to reduce passengers’ infection risk.},

  abstract = {This study examines the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) test accuracy (i.e., sensitivity and specificity) on the progression of the pandemic under two scenarios of limited and unlimited test capacity. We extend the classic susceptible– exposed–infectious–recovered model to incorporate test accuracy and compare the progression of the pandemic under various sensitivities and specificities. We find that high-sensitivity tests effectively reduce the total number of infections only with sufficient testing capacity. Nevertheless, with limited test capacity and a relatively high cross-infection rate, the total number of infected cases may increase when sensitivity is above a certain threshold. Despite the potential for higher sensitivity tests to identify more infected individuals, more false positive cases occur, which wastes limited testing capacity, slowing down the detection of infected cases. Our findings reveal that improving test sensitivity alone does not always lead to effective pandemic control, indicating that policymakers should balance the trade-off between high sensitivity and high false positive rates when designing containment measures for infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, particularly when navigating limited test capacity.},

During the peak of new infections in Germany in April 2020 and October to December 2020, most hospitals had to cancel elective procedures for patients because of capacity shortages. We present a scalable forecasting framework with a Monte Carlo simulation to forecast the short-term bed occupancy of patients with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 in intensive care units and regular wards. We apply the simulation to different granularity and geographical levels. Our forecasts were a central part of the official weekly reports of the Bavarian State Ministry of Health and Care, which were sent to key decision makers in the individual ambulance districts from May 2020 to March 2021. Our evaluation shows that the forecasting framework delivers accurate forecasts despite data availability and quality issues.},

  abstract = {The initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic were marked by widespread shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) because of surging demand and a fragile global supply chain. In response, many domestic suppliers pivoted to producing PPE, such as masks and face shields, made possible by low material costs and simple designs. A key challenge that remained was the lack of an established marketplace for nontraditional suppliers of PPE to connect with healthcare facilities in need. To address this inefficiency, we launched an online platform, Shield-Net, to match requests for face shields with new suppliers of PPE. Our platform was based on an optimization model that produced supplier-requester pairs and took into account request urgency, request size, production capacity, location, and product type. During the period of March to September 2020, Shield-Net produced 390 matches, resulting in the shipment of more than 50,000 face shields to 68 unique requesting organizations. Supplier-requester proximity was found to be the only statistically significant variable in the success of a match. In this paper, we discuss the development and impact of our matching platform, as well as lessons learned during its operation.},

Every year, millions of individuals spanning all ages, races, genders, and nationalities are victims of human trafficking across the globe. Sex trafficking, a form of human trafficking that involves sexual exploitation, is facilitated through the use of online classified advertisements. Our research team has been collaborating with law enforcement agencies at the local, state, and national levels since May 2019 to detect and disrupt sex trafficking activities, which we identified by applying advanced analytics to ad data collected from the internet. Although off-the-shelf software exists to track and analyze individual cases, limited tools and analysis are available for linking information coming from multiple websites, constructing circuits with related ads, filtering networks based on geographical span, and predicting future movements. In response to these analytical gaps, our approach focuses on (1) developing models for predicting the future activity of selected networks for the purpose of interdiction planning; (2) creating unique mathematical and statistical algorithms for linking image and text data across sites into networks, each representing a set of connected text and image data; (3) establishing innovative metrics to classify and filter constructed networks on the basis of spatiotemporal advertisement patterns, text and emoji usage, and images; and (4) designing effective escort ads for use in operations targeting demand reduction. Our tool utilizes data collected from more than 10 ad sites and includes text and image details from more than 30 million ads. Using the tools we developed, the research team has assisted in several operations, which have led to more than 40 arrests in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, since February 2021.

  abstract = {Ride-sharing platforms face a “productivity paradox,” whereby any efficiency gained through improved dispatch or pricing strategies will not benefit drivers or riders. We show that this is a limit of the traditional ride-hailing model and a consequence of the Hall-Horton driver equilibrium earning hypothesis. In response to this challenge, Lyft introduced Priority Mode (PM), which allows drivers to concentrate their work during specific prioritized hours. We prove that PM solves the productivity paradox. As a result, the average driver earnings increase, and the platform and the riders also benefit. Implementing PM requires significant changes to the platform’s dispatch and pricing policy but most importantly requires careful control of the number of drivers that can be offered the opportunity to be prioritized at any given time. In this paper, we introduce a queuing setting to model the market dynamics of PM and illustrate the challenges of this control problem. We then leverage this intuition to build a real-time priority admission control system that can balance the number of drivers offered priority and achieve the desired productivity increase. Lyft has successfully rolled out PM throughout North America, and drivers have completed hundreds of thousands of driving hours thus far. It has generated tens of millions of dollars of value that the drivers, the riders, and Lyft have shared, with the potential to generate much more when rolled out in all markets. Finally, our internal driver surveys reveal that it has been well received by drivers.},

Using this stochastic model, we optimize zone-redesign plans using mixed-integer linear programming. Our proposed design was implemented by the Atlanta Police Department in March 2019. By analyzing data before and after the zone redesign, we show that the new design has reduced the response time to high-priority 911 calls by 5.8\% and the imbalance of police workload among Atlanta’s zones by 43\%.},

Specifically, we describe the design of Eva’s supply chain to collect and process thousands of biological samples per day with special emphasis on capacity procurement. Then, we propose a novel, empirical Bayes estimation strategy to estimate COVID-19 prevalence among various passenger types with limited data and showcase how these estimates were instrumental in making a variety of downstream decisions. Finally, we propose a novel, multiarmed bandit algorithm that dynamically allocates tests to arriving passengers in a nonstationary environment with delayed feedback and batched decisions.

We describe an industry/university collaboration designed to improve sales forecasting for an organization that has adopted pop-up retailing as its exclusive business model. Early in the company’s history, the generation of sales forecasts relied heavily on expert opinion, a method that resulted in costly overstock of merchandise inventory. Accordingly, the organization developed a test market protocol in which small numbers of items are sold during a test market period to gauge future demand. Application of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) and stochastic gradient boosting methodologies to the test market data along with other information about 508 products resulted in notable improvement in forecast accuracy over expert opinion. Specifically, the percentage of items that went unsold dropped by about 40\% when using the predictive analytics tools in place of expert opinion. This striking result reflects, in part, the difficulty of using expert opinion to forecast sales of new, trendy merchandise in the absence of historical time-series sales information. By using the predictive analytics sales forecasts, the company now manufactures fewer products that never sell and, in general, manages its supply chain more effectively.},

It provides operational set-point recommendations to continuously improve site-wide operations for throughput measured in additional barrels of oil produced per day. A key contribution and differentiator is the utilization of sensor data to continuously learn the behavior of all the subsystems of an oil-producing plant and use this within an optimization framework to provide advisory control in near real time. This is novel in that it does not require a model of the plant to be provided as input. The predictive model is learned automatically and continuously from data. This work required the development of a new prediction-optimization modeling framework that optimizes throughput while staying in the vicinity of the historical process behavior and employing the model’s structure in designing algorithms to solve it. This solution has been deployed at Suncor Energy, an oil-sands company, since January 2019 and is estimated to generate business value in the order of tens of millions of dollars per year. The generalized approach of this framework lends it the ability to be applied to any processing or manufacturing plant.},

  abstract = {Restaurants often face strong pressure to reduce costs. Managers regularly respond by hiring temporary or part-time workers and by trying to reduce the size of the workforce as much as possible, which makes it difficult to develop a personnel schedule that provides sufficient service to the customers. The problem gets even more complicated if (frequent) employee turnover and demand fluctuations occur and if employees have different experience levels. This paper presents mathematical models to support waitstaff scheduling at a restaurant chain based in Baku, Azerbaijan, taking into account the managerial requirements of the company. The problem we address is equivalent to a general tour scheduling problem that assigns waitstaff to work shifts throughout the week. We develop three integer programming models taking account of factors, such as employee types and experience levels, differences in the complexity of customer orders, and side tasks and responsibilities, to find the optimal number of employees together with the best tour for each of them. The models are solved to optimality, and the results are applied at a branch of the restaurant chain in Baku.

  abstract = {Each year, the faculty of medicine and health sciences (Ghent University, Belgium) has to compose a medical student roster, assigning graduate students to different internships over the course of the academic year. An internship embodies a specific medical discipline and is carried out at a local hospital. This problem is complex because of conflicting requirements of different involved stakeholders, comprising educational requirements set by the university, limited capacity of local hospitals offering internships, and student preferences and requests. In this paper, we discuss a heuristic and required calibration to attain high-quality rosters, and it builds upon different decomposition-based heuristic solution steps and different control mechanisms to regulate the candidate assignments in each step. The proposed heuristic meets the software requirements of the university and is implemented as the scheduling module in the information system of the faculty to manage student internships. Computational experiments are carried out on real-life data related to the academic year 2020–2021 to validate the performance of the heuristic and the different improvement mechanisms. In addition, we demonstrate the use of the software as a simulation tool to devise different managerial insights relevant for the university with regard to curriculum design and student preferences.},

Each order only consumes a portion of one steel plate, so plate selection and job placement are the critical factors that affect the service center’s primary performance metric: plate yield. In conjunction with a steel service center, Artco Steel, we model this problem as a two-dimensional online bin-packing algorithm. Unique in the online bin-packing literature, we calculate the maximum inscribed rectangle (MIR) before and after job placement as the basis for heuristics that assign each job to a plate and position the job on the plate. Our work is the first paper to extend the online two-dimensional bin-packing problem to incorporate scrap, rectangular bin sizes, and a finite number of bins. The MIR procedure significantly outperformed Artco’s existing practice of giving priority to the most recently used plate, and the heuristic’s straightforward nature allowed easy adoption in 2010.},

Offering ancillaries at dynamic and personalized prices based on flight characteristics and customer needs could greatly improve airline revenue and customer satisfaction. Through a start-up (Deepair) that builds and deploys novel machine learning techniques to introduce such dynamically priced ancillaries to airlines, we partnered with a major European airline, Galactic Air (pseudonym), to build models and algorithms for improved pricing. These algorithms recommend dynamic personalized ancillary prices for a stream of features (called context) relating to each shopping session. Our recommended prices are restricted to be lower than the human-curated prices for each customer group. We designed and compared multiple machine learning models and deployed the best-performing ones live on the airline’s booking system in an online A/B testing framework. Over a six-month live implementation period, our dynamic pricing system increased the ancillary revenue per offer by 25\% and conversion rate by 15\% compared with the industry standard of human-curated rule-based prices.},

  abstract = {Humanity relies on cultivated lands to feed itself and thrive. Fertilizers are responsible for 30\%–50\% of food production, and phosphate, the naturally occurring form of phosphorus, which does not have a substitute, is an essential component of fertilizers. OCP, based in Morocco, is the world’s largest phosphate mining and processing company and therefore plays a critical role in global food security. Over the past decade, OCP, in collaboration with Dynamic Ideas, an analytics consulting company, developed a mixed-integer optimization model to holistically optimize its entire sales and supply chain—from the mines to physical treatments, to chemical facilities, to inventory facilities, and to the port for global distribution. The optimization model brings clarity to a complex supply chain, informs management decisions throughout OCP, and has consistently resulted in an improvement of over 20\% in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) annually. This amounted to over $2.3 billion in the period 2015–2020 (23.6\% of the cumulative EBITDA of $9.9 billion over this period). This incremental profitability has fueled OCP’s financing capacity; as a result, OCP is implementing a $20 billion capital expenditures (CAPEX) program. The first phase of the CAPEX program led to the doubling of OCP’s mining capacity and the tripling of its fertilizer production capacity. As a result, OCP increased its fertilizer production capacity by eight million tons in the past decade. The model enabled OCP to produce customized fertilizers that helped improve agricultural yields, which in turn led to increased food production, especially in Africa. The increased production of fertilizers and the availability of customized fertilizers have contributed toward global food security. By demonstrating the interconnectedness of all OCP businesses, the model contributed to creating a culture of collaboration, innovation, and entrepreneurship across the company while breaking the existing silos among departments. This transformation led to the establishment of an analytics-based problem-solving approach throughout OCP and a successful executive education class at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, thus enriching the university.},

  abstract = {Each year, approximately 18 million new cancer cases are diagnosed worldwide, and about half must be treated with radiotherapy. A successful treatment requires treatment planning with the customization of penetrating radiation beams to sterilize cancerous cells without harming nearby normal organs and tissues. This process currently involves extensive manual tuning of parameters by an expert planner, making it a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, with quality and immediacy of critical care dependent on the planner’s expertise. To improve the speed, quality, and availability of this highly specialized care, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center developed and applied advanced optimization tools to this problem (e.g., using hierarchical constrained optimization, convex approximations, and Lagrangian methods). This resulted in both a greatly improved radiotherapy treatment planning process and the generation of reliable and consistent high-quality plans that reflect clinical priorities. These improved techniques have been the foundation of high-quality treatments and have positively impacted over 5,000 patients to date, including numerous patients in severe pain and in urgent need of treatment who might have otherwise required longer hospital stays or undergone unnecessary surgery to control the progression of their disease. We expect that the wide distribution of the system we developed will ultimately impact patient care more broadly, including in resource-constrained countries.},

The system schedules production orders at all LCFC’s 43 assembly manufacturing lines, balancing the relative priorities of production volume, changeover cost, and order fulfillment. The multiobjective optimization scheduling problem is solved using a deep reinforcement learning model. The approach combines high computing efficiency with a novel masking mechanism that enforces operational constraints to ensure that the machine-learning model does not waste time exploring infeasible solutions. The use of the new model transformed the production management process enabling a 20\% reduction in the backlog of production orders and a 23\% improvement in the fulfillment rate. It also reduced the entire scheduling process from six hours to 30 minutes while it retained multiobjective flexibility to allow LCFC to adjust quickly to changing objectives. The work led to increased revenue of US $1.91 billion in 2019 and US $2.69 billion in 2020 for LCFC. The methodology can be applied to other scenarios in the industry.},

To meet these service commitments, quick online routing decisions must be made to optimize order picking routes at warehouses and delivery routes for drivers. The solutions to these routing problems are complicated by stringent service commitments, uncertainties, and complex operations in warehouses with limited space. Alibaba has developed a set of algorithms for vehicle routing problems (VRPs), which include an open-architecture adaptive large neighborhood search to support the solution of variants of routing problems and a deep learning-based approach that trains neural network models offline to generate almost instantaneous solutions online. These algorithms have been implemented to solve VRPs in several Alibaba subsidiaries, have generated more than $50 million in annual financial savings, and are applicable to the broader logistics industry. The success of these algorithms has fermented an inner-source community of operations researchers within Alibaba, boosted the confidence of the company’s executives in operations research, and made operations research one of the core competencies of Alibaba Group.},

Significant investments over the last decade have put planning and optimization at the forefront of tackling emergencies at WFP. A data-driven approach to managing operations has gradually become the norm and has culminated in the creation of a supply chain planning unit and savings of more than USD 150 million—enough to support two million food-insecure people for an entire year. In this paper, we describe three analytical solutions in detail: the Supply Chain Management Dashboard, which uses descriptive and predictive analytics to bring end-to-end visibility and anticipate operational issues; Optimus, which uses a mixed-integer programming model to simultaneously optimize food basket composition and supply chain planning; and DOTS, which is a data integration platform that helps WFP automate and synchronize complex data flows. Three impact studies for Iraq, South Sudan, and COVID-19 show how these tools have changed the way WFP manages its most complex operations. Through analytics, decision makers are now equipped with the insights they need to manage their operations in the best way, thereby saving and changing the lives of millions and bringing the world one step closer to zero hunger.},
