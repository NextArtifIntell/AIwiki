  abstract     = {Problem definition : Onion is an indispensable ingredient of the Indian diet, and plays a vital role in Indian economy, society, and politics. The ever-lasting volatility in its prices leads to significant social unrest. In this paper, we are interested in helping decision makers to rigorously evaluate a recent policy proposal to make dehydrated onion widely available to remedy the situation. Methodology/results : Using a stylized analytical model, we look for conditions under which it is optimal to introduce a processed substitute and whether it should be managed by nonprofit or for-profit firms. We find that the solution is identified by threshold-based policies and outcomes are far better under the nonprofit management. We also find that a nonprofit processing firm may purposefully choose a strategy where consumers do not purchase its offering for a certain medium range of raw onion deterioration levels. In addition, we find that a for-profit firm would always choose to be the lower-quality substitute in the market unless the raw onion deterioration is high. We also find that when supply capacity is constrained, sales of the processed substitute might decrease with increased supply availability. Managerial implications : This is the first paper that takes perishability and consumer welfare into account in a two-period vertically differentiated market model and compares various scenarios of competition when there is consumer prejudice for the processed substitute. For India’s policymakers, we find ample evidence to work toward implementing the processed substitute policy. We go deep and discuss tailored insights for certain regions in India. We find that although improved consumer perception is favorable in general, policymakers should be careful about some unintended consequences such as increased prices and lower availability.

  abstract     = {Problem Definition : With increasing concerns about the quality and safety of agricultural products, many agricultural cooperatives (co-ops) have begun to specify quality provisions in contracts with farmers. Correspondingly, they are pooling products to quality-differentiated markets and offering quality-differentiated prices to farmers in multiple stages. Methodology/results : We propose a two-stage stochastic program to study the quality coordination problem in a setting where a co-op specifies a quality standard and offers a multistage payment scheme in its contract with multiple farmers who can exert quality-related effort and also show preference toward prompt payment timing. We first analyze a commonly adopted payment scheme, the pooling payment scheme, and then propose an improved payment scheme, the upfront incentive (UI) payment scheme. We find that the pooling payment scheme is able to coordinate the supply chain only when farmers’ time preference is higher than a threshold; otherwise, the scheme leads to the problem of over-motivation with respect to effort. However, the UI payment scheme can coordinate the supply chain unconditionally and is also robust to farmers heterogeneous in farm size. We further conduct two extensions, including farmers heterogeneous in farm size and dynamic market size. Managerial implications : The results provide guidance on a co-op’s contract design, including quality provision and payment mechanisms in multiple periods.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Although physical (or “social”) distancing is an important public health intervention during airborne pandemics, physical distancing dramatically reduces the effective capacity of classrooms. Academic/practical relevance : During the COVID-19 pandemic, this presented a unique problem to campus planners who hoped to deliver a meaningful amount of in-person instruction in a way that respected physical distancing. This process involved (1) assigning a mode to each offered class as remote, residential (in-person), or hybrid and (2) reassigning classrooms under severely reduced capacities to the non-remote classes. These decisions need to be made quickly and under several constraints and competing priorities, such as restrictions on changes to the timetable of classes, trade-offs between classroom density and educational benefits of in-person versus online instruction, and administrative preferences for course modes and classrooms reassignments. Methodology : We solve a flexible integer program and use hierarchical optimization to handle the multiple criteria according to priorities. We apply our methods using actual Georgia Institute of Technology (GT) student registration data, COVID-19–adjusted classroom and laboratory capacities, and departmental course mode delivery preferences. We generate optimal classroom assignments for all GT classes at the Atlanta campus and quantify the trade-offs among the competing priorities. Results : When classroom capacities decreased to 20%–25% of their normal seating capacities, optimization afforded students 15.5% more in-person contact hours compared with no room reassignments (NRRs). Among sections with an in-person preference, our model satisfies 87% of mode preferences, whereas only 47% are satisfied under NRR. Additionally, in a scenario in which all classes are preferred to be delivered in person, our model can satisfy 90% of mode preferences compared with 37% under NRR. Managerial implications : Multiobjective optimization is well suited for classroom assignment problems that campus planners usually manage sequentially and manually. Our models are computationally efficient and flexible, with the ability to handle multiple objectives with different priorities and build a new class-classrooms assignment or optimize an existing one, and they can apply under normal or sudden capacity scarcity constraints.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In the U.S. auto market, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) implements a stricter fuel economy standard in California than the federal standard implemented by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Trump administration’s 2018 announcement to freeze the EPA standard threatened to widen its gap from the CARB standard and cause a split market where automakers offer differentiated car models in CARB and non-CARB states. Inspired by this crisis, we investigate three research questions: when is market unification (all vehicles meeting a common efficiency standard) attainable? Is unifying a split market likely to reduce total CO 2 emissions? If so, what strategies can help unify the market when unification does not occur naturally? Methodology/results : We adopt a game-theoretic model where two regulators with different levels of environmental awareness set efficiency standards in their respective markets, a firm offers product(s) for these markets, and consumers make purchases. We find that there exist cases where the firm offers a unified product for both markets, a different product in each market, or only serves one market, and our analysis suggests that unifying a split market may help curb emissions. We then propose and show that horizontal negotiations (between the regulators) and vertical negotiations (between a regulator and the firm) are potentially effective strategies to unify a split market and reduce emissions. Managerial implications : Our findings show that a more environmentally aware regulator can leverage its market power and reduce CO 2 emissions outside its jurisdiction through negotiations. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the regulator should prioritize horizontal negotiations while using vertical negotiations as a back-up option.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Electric vertical-takeoff-and-landing (eVTOL) vehicles enable urban aerial mobility (UAM). This paper optimizes the number, locations, and capacities of vertiports in UAM systems while capturing interdependencies between strategic vertiport deployment, tactical operations, and passenger demand. Academic/practical relevance : The model includes a “tractable part” (based on mixed-integer second-order conic optimization) and also a nonconvex demand function. Methodology : We develop an exact algorithm that approximates nonconvex functions with piecewise constant segments, iterating between a conservative model (which yields a feasible solution) and a relaxed model (which yields a solution guarantee). We propose an adaptive discretization scheme that converges to a global optimum—because of the relaxed model. Results : Our algorithm converges to a 1% optimality gap, dominating static discretization benchmarks in terms of solution quality, runtimes, and solution guarantee. Managerial implications : We find that the most attractive structure for UAM is one that uses a few high-capacity vertiports, consolidating operations primarily to serve long-distance trips. Moreover, UAM profitability is highly sensitive to network planning optimization and to customer expectations, perhaps even more so than to vehicle specifications. Therefore, the success of UAM operations requires not only mature eVTOL technologies but also tailored analytics-based capabilities to optimize strategic planning and market-based efforts to drive customer demand.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Airports and airlines have been challenged to improve decision making by producing accurate forecasts in real time. We develop a two-phased predictive system that produces forecasts of transfer passenger flows at an airport. In the first phase, the system predicts the distribution of individual transfer passengers’ connection times. In the second phase, the system samples from the distribution of individual connection times and produces distributional forecasts for the number of passengers arriving at the immigration and security areas. Academic/practical relevance : To our knowledge, this work is the first to apply machine learning for predicting real-time distributional forecasts of journeys in an airport using passenger level data. Better forecasts of these journeys can help optimize passenger experience and improve airport resource deployment. Methodology : The predictive system developed is based on a regression tree combined with copula-based simulations. We generalize the tree method to predict distributions, moving beyond point forecasts. We also formulate a newsvendor-based resourcing problem to evaluate decisions made by applying the new predictive system. Results : We show that, when compared with benchmarks, our two-phased approach is more accurate in predicting both connection times and passenger flows. Our approach also has the potential to reduce resourcing costs at the immigration and transfer security areas. Managerial implications : Our predictive system can produce accurate forecasts frequently and in real time. With these forecasts, an airport’s operating team can make data-driven decisions, identify late passengers, and assist them to make their connections. The airport can also update its resourcing plans based on the prediction of passenger flows. Our predictive system can be generalized to other operations management domains, such as hospitals or theme parks, in which customer flows need to be accurately predicted.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We focus on modeling and evaluating an emergency service system in which cross-trained fire-medics are pooled and respond to both fire calls and medical emergencies. Academic/practical relevance : Fire demand in the United States has decreased dramatically in the last nearly four decades, whereas emergency medical calls have surged. With this changing landscape, cities are under pressure to reduce their budgets by closing fire stations. We evaluate the alternative of implementing a fire-medic system in terms of cost savings and response time performance. Methodology : A cross-trained fire-medic unit may be in one of three states: available, busy at an emergency medical incident, or busy at a fire call. An exact model for the fire-medic system has exponential complexity. We develop a fast approximation algorithm that has linear complexity and can be used to solve three-state problems of any size. Results : Our approximation algorithm yields accurate predictions of response times and unit workloads and provides rapid solution times. We apply our model to the fire-medic system in St. Paul, MN, and find close agreement between predicted and actual average response times. A traditional system would require 33% more personnel to achieve about the same average response times. In sensitivity analyses, we show that the fire-medic system outperforms a traditional system over a wide range of values for call rates and number of joint units. Managerial implications : The fire-medic system in St. Paul, MN, saves more than three million dollars annually. The greatest benefit of the fire-medic system is in reducing response times to medical emergencies. We also show that in a fire-medic system that includes separate engine units, it is advantageous to convert the separate engines to fire-medic units. Our fast approximation algorithm can be applied even in the largest cities that implement fire-medic systems to improve resource deployment and reduce costs.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Rapid innovations in technology have created opportunities for different modes of healthcare delivery including digital services provided via mobile applications (mHealth). mHealth technology has the potential to provide efficient, effective, and patient-centered healthcare to manage chronic conditions. However, the economics associated with the adoption and integration of mHealth into the care delivery process is not well understood. In a chronic care clinical practice setting, we investigate fee-for-service (FFS) and capitation payment systems, and explore their performance in a traditional office-visit mode and in a mHealth-adopted mode. We identify conditions under which it is preferable to switch to an mHealth-based practice from an office visit-based practice. Methodology/results : We use an analytical model to track the progression of a chronic disease and formulate an optimization problem in which the clinic decides the time between scheduled visits and patient panel size. We consider many patient-doctor interaction factors including the risk-index of patients, the cost of being sick, and the effectiveness of treatment. We measure the performance based on four different criteria: physician net revenue, physician panel size, total patient utility, and payor net revenue. Although patients may find mHealth mode to be very beneficial, physicians under an FFS system may only adopt mHealth for moderately risky patients but for neither low-risk nor high-risk patients. Capitation clinics are likely to adopt mHealth (higher net revenue) even if the technology is moderately effective. Importantly, mHealth is preferred by patients (higher total utility) and policy makers (greater coverage) when the clinic serves moderate-risk or high-risk patients. Managerial implications : Chronic conditions need continuous care management and use of mHealth has been very promising. However, adoption of mHealth by healthcare providers has been very slow. Our research explores payment systems, physician incentives, and optimal conditions for mHealth to achieve its full potential.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We develop a framework to plan capacity in each of three sequential stages for ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs). The interdependence of activities, their stochastic durations, and the uncertainties in patient-mix pose significant challenges to managing the capacity of each activity and to achieving a smooth patient ow by coordinating the stages for each patient&#39;s visit. These strategic and operational decisions must efficiently cover all variations of daily patient demand. The overall objective is to minimize the total cost incurred in satisfying this demand, where the total cost is defined as the sum of the overtime cost and the amortized construction cost for the three stages. Methodology/results : In contrast to the traditional top-down approach to capacity planning, our approach proposes a bottom-up strategy based on optimization methods and data analytics. Specifically, we model ASCs as hybrid ow shops (HFS) from the scheduling literature, then relax the fixed capacity assumption of traditional HFS problems by using the trade-o_ between the overtime cost and the amortized capacity construction cost. Because the HFS is strongly NP-hard, we develop a straightforward and easy to implement heuristic to find cost-efficient capacities for the three stages. Our computational study, informed by operational-level archival patient data, examines how stochastic business parameters, e.g., patient-mix, service durations, and overnight-stay probabilities, affect the capacity planning decision. Managerial implications : Timely capacity adjustment is important for ASC practitioners, but related research is limited. This study highlights the benefit of considering the three stages together for capacity planning, rather than focusing solely on the operating rooms. We expect our approach to guide the more than 5,700 ASCs in the U.S., which perform 23 million surgeries annually, to make appropriate investments that will improve ASC operations via capacity adjustment and patient scheduling.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper analyzes a market design problem in Medicare Advantage (MA), the largest risk-adjusted capitation payment program in the U.S. healthcare market. Evidence exists that the current MA capitation payment program unintentionally incentivizes health plans to cherry pick profitable patient types, which is referred to as “risk selection”. However, the root causes of the risk selection are not comprehensively understood, which we study in this paper. Academic / Practical Relevance : The existing literature primarily attributes the observed risk selection in MA market to data limitations and low explanatory power (e.g. low R 2 ) of the current risk adjustment design. As a result, the current understanding and expectation are that risk selection would gradually disappear over time with increased availability of big data. However, if informationally imperfect risk adjustment is not the only cause of risk selection, big data would provide false assurance to key stakeholders, which we investigate in this paper. Given that risk-adjusted capitation payment models have been increasingly adopted by payers in the U.S., our study would be of primary interest to payers, providers and policy makers in the healthcare market. Results : This paper shows that big data alone cannot cure risk selection in the MA capitation program. In particular, we show that even if the current MA risk adjustment design became informationally perfect (e.g. R 2 = 1), health plans would still have incentives to conduct risk selection, as imperfect risk adjustment is not the only cause of risk selection in the MA market. More specifically, we show that incentives would continue to persist for risk selection in the age of big data through strategically subsidizing some subgroups of patients using capitation payments collected from other subgroups, which we call “risk selection induced by cross subsidization.” We further propose a simple mechanism to address this risk selection problem induced by cross subsidization in MA. Methodology : We construct a game-theoretical model to derive the MA capitation rates under informationally perfect risk adjustment, and show that these capitation rates cannot eliminate risk selection in MA. Managerial Implications : To eliminate risk selection, payers should modify their current capitation mechanisms to take into account the cross subsidization incentives, as proposed in this paper.

  abstract     = {Problem definition: We investigate how the degree of standardization (DoS) across service chain-belonging units impacts units’ performance outcomes. We study this question in the nursing home industry, focusing on the DoS in three operational dimensions—customer mix, service offering, and service delivery—and its impact on three nursing home outcomes: financial performance, clinical outcome, and resident welfare. Academic/practical relevance: All service chains must decide how unique or standardized each of their units should be, but it is unclear how this decision affects units’ performance outcomes. We assess standardization strategies in multiple operational dimensions in chain-belonging nursing homes and their impact on important operational outcomes, and generalize our findings to other service industries. Methodology: We use a panel data set covering 11 years (2005–2015) of comprehensive measurements of all nursing homes in the United States. We estimate the relationship between the DoS and important nursing home outcomes using fixed-effect models with instrumental variables and clustered standard errors. Results: We find that chain-belonging nursing homes that (1) customize service delivery and standardize customer mix relative to the chain norm tend to experience improved financial performance; (2) standardize customer mix tend to experience improved clinical outcome; and (3) customize service delivery tend to experience enhanced resident welfare. Managerial implications: To our knowledge, this study is the first systematic multidimensional assessment of multiunit service firms’ standardization strategies from a chain perspective. Our results guide nursing home chains in their (1) strategies of within-chain standardization, and (2) investment decisions in acquiring new properties. Our results also provide broader managerial insights for service chains’ standardization strategies and merging and acquisition activities.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study the effects of emergency department (ED) physician workload on healthcare system utilization after the patient leaves the ED. Further, we explore the mediating effects of care intensity in the ED on post-ED care use. Academic/practical relevance : ED crowding has been a pressing concern in healthcare systems in the United States and other developed countries. As such, many researchers have studied its effects on outcomes within the ED. In contrast, we present novel results regarding the impacts of ED crowding on system performance outside the ED—specifically, on post-ED care utilization. Methodology : We utilize a data set assembled from more than four years of microdata from a large U.S. hospital and exhaustive billing data in an integrated health system. We use count models and instrumental variable analyses to answer the proposed research questions. Results : We find that there is an increasing concave relationship between ED physician workload and post-ED care use. When ED workload increases from its fifth percentile to the median, the number of post-discharge care events (i.e., medical services) for patients who are discharged home from the ED increases by 5%, and it is stable afterward. Further, we identify physician test-ordering behavior as a mechanism for this effect; when the physician is busier, she responds by ordering more tests for less severe patients. We document that this “extra” testing generates “extra” post-ED care utilization for these patients. Managerial implications : This paper contributes new insights on how physician and patient behaviors under ED crowding impact a previously unstudied system performance measure: post-ED care utilization. Our findings suggest that prior studies estimating the cost of ED crowding underestimate the true effect, as they do not consider the “extra” post-ED care utilization.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study how algorithmic (versus human-based) task assignment processes change task recipients’ fairness perceptions and productivity. Academic/practical relevance : Since algorithms are widely adopted by businesses and often require human involvement, understanding how humans perceive algorithms is instrumental to the success of algorithm design in operations. Particularly, the growing concern that algorithms may reproduce inequality historically exhibited by humans calls for research about how people perceive the fairness of algorithmic decision making (relative to traditional human-based decision making) and, consequently, adjust their work behaviors. Methodology : In a 15-day-long field experiment with Alibaba Group in a warehouse where workers pick products following orders (or “pick lists”), we randomly assigned half of the workers to receive pick lists from a machine that ostensibly relied on an algorithm to distribute pick lists, and the other half to receive pick lists from a human distributor. Results : Despite that we used the same underlying rule to assign pick lists in both groups, workers perceive the algorithmic (versus human-based) assignment process as fairer by 0.94–1.02 standard deviations. This yields productivity benefits: receiving tasks from an algorithm (versus a human) increases workers’ picking efficiency by 15.56%–17.86%. These findings persist beyond the first day when workers were involved in the experiment, suggesting that our results are not limited to the initial phrase when workers might find algorithmic assignment novel. We replicate the main results in another field experiment involving a nonoverlapping sample of warehouse workers. We also show via online experiments that people in the United States also view algorithmic task assignment as fairer than human-based task assignment. Managerial implications : We demonstrate that algorithms can have broader impacts beyond offering greater efficiency and accuracy than humans: introducing algorithmic assignment processes may enhance fairness perceptions and productivity. This insight can be utilized by managers and algorithm designers to better design and implement algorithm-based decision making in operations.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We use a realistically large, publicly available data set from a global fintech lender to simulate the impact of different antidiscrimination laws and their corresponding data management and model-building regimes on gender-based discrimination in the nonmortgage fintech lending setting. Academic/practical relevance : Our paper extends the conceptual understanding of model-based discrimination from computer science to a realistic context that simulates the situations faced by fintech lenders in practice, where advanced machine learning (ML) techniques are used with high-dimensional, feature-rich, highly multicollinear data. We provide technically and legally permissible approaches for firms to reduce discrimination across different antidiscrimination regimes whilst managing profitability. Methodology : We train statistical and ML models on a large and realistically rich publicly available data set to simulate different antidiscrimination regimes and measure their impact on model quality and firm profitability. We use ML explainability techniques to understand the drivers of ML discrimination. Results : We find that regimes that prohibit the use of gender (like those in the United States) substantially increase discrimination and slightly decrease firm profitability. We observe that ML models are less discriminatory, of better predictive quality, and more profitable compared with traditional statistical models like logistic regression. Unlike omitted variable bias—which drives discrimination in statistical models—ML discrimination is driven by changes in the model training procedure, including feature engineering and feature selection, when gender is excluded. We observe that down sampling the training data to rebalance gender, gender-aware hyperparameter selection, and up sampling the training data to rebalance gender all reduce discrimination, with varying trade-offs in predictive quality and firm profitability. Probabilistic gender proxy modeling (imputing applicant gender) further reduces discrimination with negligible impact on predictive quality and a slight increase in firm profitability. Managerial implications : A rethink is required of the antidiscrimination laws, specifically with respect to the collection and use of protected attributes for ML models. Firms should be able to collect protected attributes to, at minimum, measure discrimination and ideally, take steps to reduce it. Increased data access should come with greater accountability for firms.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Treating many blood-related diseases requires transplantation of genetically compatible hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) extracted from the bone marrow (BM) of live donors or the umbilical cord blood (CB) of babies. To facilitate the search for HSCs, institutions known as BM registries collect the details of potential donors and CB banks store units of CB. This paper focuses on the problem of joint optimization of the capacity of these two institutions. Academic/practical relevance : With more than 10 million genetic variants, limited inventory relative to this variety, and random replenishment, BM registry and CB bank compositions are random, interdependent, and change nondeterministically over time. Furthermore, BM and CB differ in their supply, costs, genetic matching criteria, and influences on medical outcomes, giving rise to important tradeoffs such that neither is preferred exclusively to the other. Jointly determining the optimal capacity of both sources is therefore both technically challenging and has immediate policy implications. Methodology : We develop a simulation-based approach to estimate the temporal variation in matching probabilities before incorporating the associated regression parameters into a mathematical model closely matching the research context. Results are contrasted against a simplified mathematical model, highlighting the importance of the dynamic setup. Results : Inventories of 17.5 million registered BM donors and 335,000 CB units are estimated as optimal for the U.S. population under reasonable assumptions. Expanding capacity to these levels would satisfy 33% of the currently unmet demand, increasing the transplantation rate to 98.7% and delivering $770 million of extra social surplus annually. Managerial implications : Rigorous policy analyses are imperative for designing evidence-based, cost-effective policies that deliver societal benefits. To this end, we provide quantitative evidence in support of calls for further expansion of the national BM registry and CB banks in the United States. We also propose annual recruitment targets for BM donors and CB units to maintain the two institutions at their suggested levels.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Six million refugees have been living in camps in 2021 due to multiple armed conflicts worldwide. Regulations often impede refugees’ integration into host countries; thus, refugees have to seek help from humanitarian organizations (HOs). HOs traditionally provide in-kind (e.g., food) assistance and now offer cash (monetary assistance) that refugees can spend at local retail stores. However, cash assistance can be exploited by local retailers’ market power, which challenges HOs’ mission of helping refugees while doing no harm to host communities. Practical relevance : Completely informed by field research in three refugee camps in northwestern Greece, we analyze the trade-off between in-kind and cash assistance from the perspective of an HO. We propose two cash assistance policies, implementable by a partnership between the HO and the local government, to curb the retailer’s market power and ensure that the refugees, the local residents, and the retailer are better off than if only in-kind assistance is provided. Methodology : We use field research to define our research setting and support our main modeling assumptions and parameters. Then, we use a game-theoretical model to analyze the interactions among multiple stakeholders in an ecosystem consisting of an HO, refugees, a monopolistic retailer, local residents, and a local government. Results : We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed cash assistance policies that benefit refugees and local residents while ensuring the retailer’s profitability. In particular, a price-dependent cash assistance (PDCA) policy aligns the incentives between the retailer and the HO-government partnership. This new policy for cash assistance acts as a lever for the retailer to voluntarily set desirable prices, which benefit both refugees and their host community. Managerial implications : We provide tools and implementable policies that guide HOs to improve their budget allocation between in-kind and cash assistance for refugees living in areas where local market power exists. Moreover, we clearly outline the roles of HOs and the local government in a partnership for cash assistance to refugees.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In high-product-variety businesses like fashion, mass production (MP) systems create environmental waste in the form of overproduction on a colossal scale. Mass customization (MC) has been proposed—without solid evidence—as a solution. In this paper, we analyze whether MC can indeed offer a win-win solution that helps both the bottom line and the environment. We also study the impact of three real policy options: promoting MC, charging a disposal fee for overproduction, and recycling. Academic/practical relevance : There is increasing interest in mass-customizing fashion goods, not only because consumers value customization, but also because MC is perceived to be environmentally friendly. Our paper puts this advocacy for MC to the test. We contribute to the literature, which has been largely silent on the issue, by uncovering when MC offers a win-win and relating such market outcomes to policy ideas. Methodology : We develop an analytical model of an MP firm adopting MC (going hybrid ). The firm’s profit-maximizing variety, price, and inventory decisions then form the basis of our understanding the environmental impact of adopting MC and assessing various policy options. Results : Adopting MC can be a win-win, but it can also increase overproduction and hurt the environment. Our policy analyses reveal two kinds of insights. The first kind is about whether a policy expands win-win outcomes—encouraging sustainable adoption of MC. Among the policy ideas we explore, only promoting MC so as to increase consumers’ tolerance for waiting for mass-customized products can do that unambiguously. The second kind of insight is about whether a policy reduces the hybrid firm’s environmental impact. Only a disposal fee and costly recycling programs can do that unambiguously. Managerial implications : For MC adoption to be a win-win, policy makers must (1) work on convincing consumers to wait for bespoke fashion; (2) target MP firms with low cost of variety (high product-mix flexibility) with disposal fees or costly recycling programs; and (3) encourage those with relatively higher cost of variety to develop/acquire technology that would make recycling profitable.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Faced with the challenge of serving beneficiaries with heterogeneous needs and under budget constraints, some nonprofit organizations (NPOs) have adopted an innovative solution: providing partially complete products or services to beneficiaries. We seek to understand what drives an NPO’s choice of partial completion as a design strategy and how it interacts with the level of variety offered in the NPO’s product or service portfolio. Academic/practical relevance : Although partial product or service provision has been observed in the nonprofit operations, there is limited understanding of when it is an appropriate strategy—a void that we seek to fill in this paper. Methodology : We synthesize the practices of two NPOs operating in different contexts to develop a stylized analytical model to study an NPO’s product/service completion and variety choices. Results : We identify when and to what extent partial completion is optimal for an NPO. We also characterize a budget allocation structure for an NPO between product/service variety and completion. Our analysis sheds light on how beneficiary characteristics (e.g., heterogeneity of their needs, capability to self-complete) and NPO objectives (e.g., total-benefit maximization versus fairness) affect the optimal levels of variety and completion. Managerial implications : We provide three key observations. (1) Partial completion is not a compromise solution to budget limitations but can be an optimal strategy for NPOs under a wide range of circumstances, even in the presence of ample resources. (2) Partial provision is particularly valuable when beneficiary needs are highly heterogeneous, or beneficiaries have high self-completion capabilities. A higher self-completion capability generally implies a lower optimal completion level; however, it may lead to either a higher or a lower optimal variety level. (3) Although providing incomplete products may appear to burden beneficiaries, a lower completion level can be optimal when fairness is factored into an NPO’s objective or when beneficiary capabilities are more heterogeneous.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Achieving broad access to health services (a target within the sustainable development goals) requires reaching rural populations. Mobile healthcare units (MHUs) visit remote sites to offer health services to these populations. However, limited exposure, health literacy, and trust can lead to sigmoidal (S-shaped) adoption dynamics, presenting a difficult obstacle in allocating limited MHU resources. It is tempting to allocate resources in line with current demand, as seen in practice. However, to maximize access in the long term, this may be far from optimal, and insights into allocation decisions are limited. Academic/practical relevance : We present a formal model of the long-term allocation of MHU resources as the optimization of a sum of sigmoidal functions. We develop insights into optimal allocation decisions and propose pragmatic methods for estimating our model’s parameters from data available in practice. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by applying our methods to family planning MHUs in Uganda. Methodology : Nonlinear optimization of sigmoidal functions and machine learning, especially gradient boosting, are used. Results : Although the problem is NP-hard, we provide closed form solutions to particular cases of the model that elucidate insights into the optimal allocation. Operationalizable heuristic allocations, grounded in these insights, outperform allocations based on current demand. Our estimation approach, designed for interpretability, achieves better predictions than standard methods in the application. Managerial implications : Incorporating the future evolution of demand, driven by community interaction and saturation effects, is key to maximizing access with limited resources. Instead of proportionally assigning more visits to sites with high current demand, a group of sites should be prioritized. Optimal allocation among prioritized sites aims at equalizing demand at the end of the planning horizon. Therefore, more visits should generally be allocated to sites where the cumulative demand potential is higher and counterintuitively, often those where demand is currently lower.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Lack of patient adherence to treatment protocols is a main barrier to reducing the global disease burden of tuberculosis (TB). We study the operational design of a treatment adherence support (TAS) platform that requires patients to verify their treatment adherence on a daily basis. Academic/practical relevance : Experimental results on the effectiveness of TAS programs have been mixed; and rigorous research is needed on how to structure these motivational programs, particularly in resource-limited settings. Our analysis establishes that patient engagement can be increased by personal sponsor outreach and that patient behavior data can be used to identify at-risk patients for targeted outreach. Methodology : We partner with a TB TAS provider and use data from a completed randomized controlled trial. We use administrative variation in the timing of peer sponsor outreach to evaluate the impact of personal messages on subsequent patient verification behavior. We then develop a rolling-horizon machine learning (ML) framework to generate dynamic risk predictions for patients enrolled on the platform. Results : We find that, on average, sponsor outreach to patients increases the odds ratio of next-day treatment adherence verification by 35%. Furthermore, patients’ prior verification behavior can be used to accurately predict short-term (treatment adherence verification) and long-term (successful treatment completion) outcomes. These results allow the provider to target and implement behavioral interventions to at-risk patients. Managerial implications : Our results indicate that, compared with a benchmark policy, the TAS platform could reach the same number of at-risk patients with 6%–40% less capacity, or reach 2%–20% more at-risk patients with the same capacity, by using various ML-based prioritization policies that leverage patient engagement data. Personal sponsor outreach to all patients is likely to be very costly, so targeted TAS may substantially improve the cost-effectiveness of TAS programs.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Cash transfer programs (CTPs) have spread in the last decade to help fight extreme poverty in different parts of the world. A key issue here is to ensure that the cash is distributed to the targeted beneficiaries in an appropriate manner to meet the goals of the programs. How do we design efficient and egalitarian allocation rules for these programs? Academic/practical relevance : Big data and machine learning have been used recently by several CTPs to target the right beneficiaries (those living in extreme poverty). We demonstrate how these targeting methods can be integrated into the cash allocation problem to synthesize the impact of targeting errors on the design of the allocation rules. In particular, when the targeting errors are “well calibrated,” a simple predictive allocation rule is already optimal. Finally, although we only focus on the problem of poverty reduction (efficiency), the optimality conditions ensure that these allocation rules provide a common ex ante service guarantee for each beneficiary in the allocation outcome (egalitarian). Methodology : We design allocation rules to minimize a key indicator in poverty reduction—the squared gap of the shortfall between the income/consumption and the poverty line. The rules differ in how the targeting error distribution is being utilized. Robust and online convex optimization are applied for the analysis. We also modify our allocation rules to ensure that the cash is spread more evenly across the pool of beneficiaries to reduce the (potential) negative effect on nonbeneficiary households living close to the poverty line but missing the benefits of the CTPs because of imperfect targeting. Results : Given a targeting method, we compare and contrast the performance of different allocation rules—predictive, stochastic, and robust. We derive closed-form solutions to predictive and stochastic allocation models and use robust allocation to mitigate the negative impact of imperfect targeting. Moreover, we show that the robust allocation decision can be efficiently computed using online convex optimization. Managerial implications : Using real data from a CTP in Malawi, we demonstrate how a suitable choice of allocation rule can improve both the efficiency and egalitarian objectives of the CTP. The technique can be suitably modified to ensure that the wealth distribution after allocation is “smoother,” reducing the bunching effect that may be undesirable in some circumstances.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This study addresses three important questions concerning the effectiveness of stay-at-home orders and sociodemographic disparities. (1) What is the average effect of the orders on the percentage of residents staying at home? (2) Is the effect heterogeneous across counties with different percentages of vulnerable populations (defined as those without health insurance or who did not attend high school)? (3) If so, why are the orders less effective for some counties than for others? Academic/practical relevance : To combat the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a number of states in the United States implemented stay-at-home orders that prevent residents from leaving their homes except for essential trips. These orders have drawn heavy criticism from the public because whether they are necessary and effective in increasing the number of residents staying at home is unclear. Methodology : We estimate the average effect of the orders using a difference-in-differences model, where the control group is the counties that did not implement the orders and the treatment group is the counties that did implement the orders during our study period. We estimate the heterogeneous effects of the orders by interacting county features with treatment dummies in a triple-difference model. Results : Using a unique set of mobile device data that track residents’ mobility, we find that, although some residents already voluntarily stayed at home before the implementation of any order, the stay-at-home orders increased the number of residents staying at home by 2.832 percentage points (or 11.25%). We also find that these orders are less effective for counties with higher percentages of uninsured or less educated (i.e., did not attend high school) residents. To explore the mechanisms behind these results, we analyze the effect of the orders on the average number of work and nonwork trips per person. We find that the orders reduce the number of work trips by 0.053 (or 7.87%) and nonwork trips by 0.183 (or 6.50%). The percentage of uninsured or less educated residents in a county negatively correlates with the reduction in the number of work trips but does not correlate with the reduction in the number of nonwork trips. Managerial implications : Our results suggest that uninsured and less educated residents are less likely to follow the orders because their jobs prevent them from working from home. Policy makers must take into account the differences in residents’ socioeconomic status when developing new policies or allocating limited healthcare resources.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper investigates and compares two types of food safety auditing structures: decentralized and centralized audits. Academic/practical relevance : Decentralized food safety auditing systems are common among developing economies, that is, different tiers of a food supply chain are audited by separate government agencies. Such an auditing structure has been widely criticized as ineffective at mitigating food safety risks. Some developing countries began implementing centralized auditing systems as a remedy for the mis-coordination across local auditing agencies. We compare food safety outcomes and economical payoffs of the two auditing systems. Methodology : We study a parsimonious game-theoretic model of a one-supplier, one-buyer supply chain and two agencies auditing each tier of the supply chain, respectively. Under decentralized audits, each of the two agencies minimizes its individual cost, and their decisions are sequential; under centralized audits, the agencies minimize total agency cost and make auditing commitment up front. Results : We identify forces that drive equilibrium decisions under decentralized audits. The penalty-shield effect of an agency’s auditing capability may lead to risky behavior by the supplier. The free-riding effect between the two agencies may lead to less auditing. A centralized commitment makes the agencies the leader in the game at the expense of them losing the flexibility to respond to the actions of supply chain members. The common objective under centralization strengthens the incentives for at least one agency to conduct an audit, but it may also induce the lower-cost, less-capable agency to audit. Hence, centralized audits can be detrimental to performance regarding both food safety outcomes and system payoff. Managerial implications : Changing the auditing structure from decentralization to centralization may fail to improve food safety and system payoff insofar as it may replace one form of inefficiency with another. Addressing the new inefficiencies should be part of the ongoing effort to enhance the efficacy of centralized audits.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study the management of social responsibility in a three-tier supply chain with a tier 2 supplier selling to a tier 1 supplier, in turn selling to a tier 0 buyer. The tier 2 supplier may violate social and environmental standards, resulting in harm to all firms in the supply chain; we analyze the equilibrium allocation of costly effort by each firm to improve responsibility in tier 2. We also examine how pressure from external stakeholders (consumers, nongovernmental organizations, and governments) influences the optimal level of responsibility. Academic/practical relevance : Recently, there have been numerous serious responsibility violations in tiers 2+ of multinational supply chains, leading to significant negative consequences for firms and society; understanding how best to manage such violations is of practical importance to multiple stakeholders. Methodology : We employ a game theoretic model wherein each firm in the supply chain optimizes its responsibility efforts to maximize its own profit and study the implications of this decentralized optimization for the overall supply chain. Results : Under the conditions of our model, the buyer’s optimal strategy is one of extremes, consisting of direct control (only tier 0 works with tier 2), delegation (only tier 1 works with tier 2), or no effort (neither firm works with tier 2); we determine when each is optimal and discuss key drivers of the optimality of these extreme strategies. We further find that increasing some types of external pressure can backfire, leading to a lower level of responsibility. Managerial implications : For firms using multitier supply chains, we show how to manage risk by choosing between different responsibility management strategies. For external stakeholders seeking to encourage responsibility, we provide insights on how to achieve this while avoiding “backfiring.” For researchers, we provide a modeling framework to study responsibility and risk management problems in multitier supply chains.

@article{ ,
  abstract     = {Problem definition: Machine learning is often employed in appointment scheduling to identify the patients with the greatest no-show risk, so as to schedule them into or right after overbooked slots. That scheduling decision maximizes the clinic performance, as measured by a weighted sum of all patients’ waiting time and the provider’s overtime and idle time. However, if a racial group is characterized by a higher no-show risk, then the patients belonging to that racial group will be scheduled into or right after overbooked slots disproportionately to the general population. Academic/Practical Relevance: That scheduling decision is problematic because patients scheduled in those slots tend to have a worse service experience than the other patients, as measured by the time they spend in the waiting room. Thus, the challenge becomes minimizing the schedule cost while avoiding racial disparities. Methodology : Motivated by the real-world case of a large specialty clinic whose black patients have a higher no-show probability than non-black patients, we analytically study racial disparity in this context. Then, we propose new objective functions that minimize both schedule cost and racial disparity and that can be readily adopted by researchers and practitioners. We develop a race-aware objective, which instead of minimizing the waiting times of all patients, minimizes the waiting times of the racial group expected to wait the longest. We also develop race-unaware methodologies that do not consider race explicitly. We validate our findings both on simulated and real-world data. Results : We demonstrate that state-of-the-art scheduling systems cause the black patients in our data set to wait about 30% longer than nonblack patients. Our race-aware methodology achieves both goals of eliminating racial disparity and obtaining a similar schedule cost as that obtained by the state-of-the-art scheduling method, whereas the race-unaware methodologies fail to obtain both efficiency and fairness. Managerial implications : Our work uncovers that the traditional objective of minimizing schedule cost may lead to unintended racial disparities. Both efficiency and fairness can be achieved by adopting a race-aware objective.

Academic/practical relevance : In a constrained hospital environment, forecasts on patient demand patterns could help match capacity and demand and improve hospital operations. Methodology : We use data from 63,432 admissions at a large academic hospital (50% female, median age 64 years old, median length of stay 3.12 days). We construct an expertise-driven patient representation on top of their EHR data and apply a broad class of machine learning methods to predict several aspects of patient flows. Results : With a unique patient representation, we estimate short-term discharges, identify long-stay patients, predict discharge destination, and anticipate flows in and out of intensive care units with accuracy in the 80%+ range. More importantly, we implement this machine learning pipeline into the EHR system of the hospital and construct prediction-informed dashboards to support daily bed placement decisions.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Lawmakers have begun to introduce “fair schedule” legislations that require employers to provide shift workers with more predictable and consistent work schedules. Business owners are concerned that the resultant loss of scheduling flexibility could reduce overall operational efficiency. We argue this is not necessarily the case. Academic/practical relevance: Although recent studies suggest that increasing schedule predictability by reducing “just-in-time” scheduling can increase productivity, few have examined the effects of schedule consistency on worker productivity. Our study fills this void by investigating the impact of schedule consistency on cashier productivity in grocery retailing. Methodology : We estimate econometric models using transaction level scanner data including more than 1.2 million shopping baskets processed by 126 cashiers working for a local grocer. Work schedule consistency is operationalized via two metrics: (1) hour-of-the-day consistency measuring whether a cashier is consistently scheduled to work in the same hours of the day, and (2) day-of-the-week consistency measuring whether a cashier is consistently scheduled to work on the same days of the week. Results: We find that, on average, hour-of-the-day consistency and day-of-the-week consistency increase cashier productivity by 0.95% and 1.63%, respectively. These effects are much stronger for inexperienced cashiers (e.g., an average productivity boost of 3.39% and 7.93%, respectively, for the new hires). Managerial implications : Our findings suggest that (a) business owners can increase shift workers’ productivity by providing them with more consistent work schedules, and (b) the productivity of less-experienced shift workers, especially new hires, is more vulnerable to inconsistent work schedules, highlighting the potential for operational efficiency gains from greater schedule consistency, especially for businesses employing a high portion of inexperienced shift workers.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study customer-centric privacy management in service systems. Academic/practical relevance : We explore the consequences of extended control over personal information by customers in such systems. Methodology : We adopt a stylized queueing model to capture a service environment that features a service provider and customers who are strategic in deciding whether to disclose personal information to the service provider—that is, customers’ privacy or information disclosure strategy . A customer’s service request can be one of two types, which affects service time but is unknown when customers commit to a privacy strategy. The service provider can discriminate among customers based on their disclosed information by offering different priorities. Results : Our analysis reveals that, when given control over their personal data, strategic customers do not always choose to withhold them. We find that control over information gives customers a tool they can use to hedge against the service provider’s will, which might not be aligned with the interests of customers. More importantly, we find that under certain conditions, giving customers full control over information (e.g., by introducing a privacy regulation) may not only distort already efficiently operating service system but might also backfire by leading to inferior system performance (i.e., longer average wait time), and it can hurt customers themselves. We demonstrate how a regulator can correct information disclosure inefficiencies through monetary incentives to customers and show that providing such incentives makes economic sense in some scenarios. Finally, the service provider itself can benefit from customers being in control of their personal information by enticing more customers joining the service. Managerial implications : Our findings yield insights into how customers’ individually rational actions concerning information disclosure (e.g., granted by a privacy regulation) can lead to market inefficiencies in the form of longer wait times for services. We provide actionable prescriptions, for both service providers and regulators, that can guide their choices of a privacy and information management approach based on giving customers the option of controlling their personal information.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Consider an online personalized assortment optimization problem in which customers arrive sequentially and make their decisions (e.g., click an ad, purchase a product) following the multinomial logit choice model with unknown parameters. Utilizing a customer’s personal information that is high-dimensional, the firm selects an assortment tailored for each individual customer’s preference. Academic/practical relevance : High dimensionality of a customer’s contextual information is prevalent in real applications, and it creates tremendous computational challenge in online personalized optimization. Methodology : In this paper, an efficient learning algorithm is developed to tackle the computational complexity issue while maintaining satisfactory performance. The algorithm first applies a random projection for dimension reduction and incorporates an online convex optimization procedure for parameter estimation, thus overcoming the issue of linearly increasing computational requirement as data accumulates. Then, it integrates the upper confidence bound method to balance the exploration and revenue exploitation. Results : The theoretical performance of the algorithm in terms of regret is derived under some plausible sparsity assumption on personal information that is observed in real data, and numerical experiments using both synthetic data and a real data set from Yahoo! show that the algorithm performs very well, having scalability and significant advantage in computational time compared with benchmark methods. Managerial implications : Our findings suggest that practitioners should process high-dimensional sparse customer data with an appropriate feature engineering technique, such as random projection (instead of abandoning the sparse portion) to maximize the effectiveness of online optimization algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We investigate the effect of using subcontracted workers together with permanent workers on project financial performance. Academic/practical relevance : It is widespread practice, across disparate businesses, to staff project teams with subcontracted workers—and yet, despite the prevalence of this phenomenon, there is scant research on how subcontracted workers impact project performance. Investigating such an effect is important because past findings on the effects of subcontracting in retail or assembly lines cannot be hastily extrapolated to the more qualified workers and more demanding tasks normally associated with project environments. Methodology : Building on previous findings about the higher motivation level of subcontracted versus permanent workers when the latter are protected from individual dismissal by the law, we develop hypotheses to conceptualize how and under what conditions subcontracted workers positively impact project performance. We then test our hypotheses by analyzing 413 projects of a European high-tech firm. Results : We find that with increased use of subcontracted workers comes increased project profit margins. This positive effect is stronger for larger teams and weaker when large project scope changes occur or when higher-skilled workers are subcontracted. We also find this effect to be stronger when subcontracted workers are involved in technical rather than administrative roles and when subcontractors join in the later stages of the project. Managerial implications : This study offers guidelines on how project managers can use subcontracting to increase project margins, highlighting strategic and tactical factors that affect the benefits of using subcontracted labor.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper empirically investigates how customer email engagement affects the profitability of subscription service providers and retailers. They have been using email engagement to increase customer retention. However, it is unclear whether email engagement improves their profitability. The existing literature focuses on email engagement’s benefit of customer retention but ignores its associated operating cost to serve retained customers. Methodology/results : We analyze the outcome of a field experiment conducted by a large U.S. car wash chain that offers tiered subscription services to consumers and employs an radiofrequency identification-based technology to track subscriber service events. We apply survival analysis and difference-in-differences methods to estimate the effects of email engagement on subscribers’ retention and service consumption. We find that a one-month engagement with two emails separated by a half-month interval increased the likelihood of subscriber retention by 7.4% five months after the experiment started and decreased the subscriber churn odds by 26.3% for the entire five-month duration. Meanwhile, we find that the same engagement increased a subscriber’s per-period service consumption by 7.0%. We provide suggestive evidence for two behavioral mechanisms that explain the effect of email engagement on subscribers’ service consumption. First, the engagement effect decays over time and exhibits fatigue after the second email, suggesting that emails act as reminders to subscribers. Second, the engagement effect persists after engagement ends but weakens over time, suggesting the habit formation of subscribers. By computing subscriber lifetime value and the operating cost of service, we find that email engagement increases profit when deployed on mid-level infrequent-use subscribers and top-level subscribers but decreases profit when deployed on mid-level frequent-use subscribers and basic-level subscribers. Therefore, we recommend that the company use a selective strategy by sending engagement emails to only profitable subscribers. Managerial implications : Our study highlights that email engagement is a double-edged sword; it increases both customer retention and service consumption, and it may decrease profitability when the increased operating cost to serve retained customers outweighs the benefit of customer retention. We recommend that subscription service providers and retailers adopt a data-driven approach to optimize their email engagement strategies.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition: We consider an OEM supplying a single part to multiple buyers over an infinite horizon. We study how the OEM can digitize the spare parts supply chain by leveraging 3D printing via intellectual property (IP) licensing. Academic/practical relevance: Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, has the potential to shift supply chains from global networks that rely on centralized production with traditional manufacturing technologies to mainly digital networks with distributed, local printing. Particularly well positioned to drive this transition are original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) who design and produce capital goods. Methodology: We first set up a benchmark model of the traditional physical supply chain with centralized production by the OEM. We then propose the OEM to act as an IP licensor by selling spare parts designs, rather than physical parts. With the license agreement, a buyer can print parts locally through a third-party printing service provider, enjoying a shorter lead time and lower setup cost. Given a license, each buyer chooses whether to switch to the IP licensing channel or stay in the traditional channel. The OEM selects the license terms to maximize the total profit across both channels. Results: We characterize the OEM’s optimal license and the resulting supply chain configuration. We show that 3D printing’s competency in price plays a dominant role in production decentral- ization. The conventional wisdom that 3D printing is suitable for slow moving parts holds only when it is competent along several dimensions. In a numerical experiment with realistic parameter settings, decentralized production occurs in a surprisingly large number of cases, and the proposed new business model can significantly increase the OEM’s profit. Managerial implications: Our results indicate that IP licensing by OEMs can become a major enabler in the transition to digital supply networks with distributed 3D printing, benefiting all parties involved.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition: Sequential experiments that are deployed in a broad range of practices are characterized by an exploration-exploitation trade-off that is well understood when in each time period feedback is received only on the action that was selected in that period. However, in many practical settings, additional information may become available between decision epochs. We study the performance that one may achieve when leveraging such auxiliary information and the design of algorithms that effectively do so without prior knowledge of the information arrival process. Methodology/results: Our formulation considers a broad class of distributions that are informative about rewards from actions and allows auxiliary observations from these distributions to arrive according to an arbitrary and a priori unknown process. When it is known how to map auxiliary observations to reward estimates, we characterize the best achievable performance as a function of the information arrival process. In terms of achieving optimal performance, we establish that upper confidence bound and Thompson sampling algorithms possess natural robustness with respect to the information arrival process, which uncovers a novel property of these popular algorithms. When the mappings connecting auxiliary observations and rewards are a priori unknown, we characterize a necessary and sufficient condition under which auxiliary information allows performance improvement and devise an adaptive policy (termed 2UCBs) that guarantees near optimality. We use a data set from a large media site to analyze the value that may be captured by leveraging auxiliary observations in the design of content recommendations. Managerial implications: Our study highlights the importance of utilizing auxiliary information in the design of sequential experiments and characterizes how salient features of the auxiliary information stream impact performance. Our study also emphasizes the risk in processing auxiliary information using nonadaptive approaches that are predicated on correct interpretation of this information, as opposed to deploying flexible, adaptive methods.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Carbon abatement opportunities are diverse, making it difficult to classify them. Do latent classes of carbon abatement opportunities exist and is there a type that is financially and environmentally superior? Methodology/results : In this study, we classify 16,525 implemented carbon abatement projects using text analysis. We benchmark our clustering method to the latent Dirichlet allocation model and verify our classifications using a crowd-sourcing platform. We then compare the payback period, financial hurdle (measured in upfront cost), savings, and carbon emissions reduction by type. Our results show that latent classes exist, and they statistically differ in the metrics we examine. Our regression results show that the type of project explains more of the variation in the financial and environmental outcomes than the firm-level financial controls we included. We find that liquidity (measured using cash-to-asset and current ratios) is associated with the number of reported projects, but the magnitude and direction varies by type. Our extension shows that marginal abatement costs statistically differ by type with a few exceptions. Lastly, we show that our classification is robust to sector-level variation. Managerial implications : Although the results show that no single type of opportunity dominates in all four metrics, our classification provides a ranking of the types firms should pursue depending on their goals. Our results suggest that firms likely place different weights across these four metrics. This means that policies targeted at making investment costs more attractive (e.g., subsidies or better financing) may not have the same impact on firms that put more weight on savings compared with those more sensitive to costs. A classification of opportunities can contribute toward understanding whether a unifying theory or pattern across carbon abatement activities may exist or not.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Although it is well known that a reseller’s ability to hold strategic inventory under a short-term supply contract can potentially benefit both the reseller and a supplier, existing research on strategic inventory focuses almost exclusively on exclusive reselling environments. However, in practice, multiple suppliers often sell to the same nonexclusive reseller, and it is not uncommon for suppliers to ask for future commitments to order quantities from resellers in return for their own commitment to wholesale prices. We investigate how the possibility of strategic inventory influences competing suppliers’ choices between short-term transactional and long-term commitment contracts to a nonexclusive reseller. Methodology/results : Using a game-theoretic model, we consider the interactions between two partially substitutable suppliers and a single, nonexclusive reseller over a two-period horizon in which demand is deterministic. We demonstrate that in nonexclusive reselling environments, where more than one supplier sells its product through the same reseller, the use of strategic inventory under short-term contracts intensifies the price competition between suppliers. We show how this effect can be mitigated when one or both suppliers offer a long-term contract. Moreover, we show that long-term contracts can arise as an equilibrium outcome, particularly when products are more substitutable or holding costs are large. Managerial implications : By considering the interactions between two partially substitutable suppliers and a nonexclusive reseller in a multiperiod setting, we contribute to the literature on strategic contracting and long versus short-term contracts. Our research provides managers with a new explanation, beyond the need to encourage idiosyncratic investments or eliminate the possibility of hold-up, for why long-term contracts may benefit suppliers in practice, who face competition while selling through a nonexclusive reseller.},

Methodology and Results : Online gig workers sharply increased their labor supply on the platform by 23% from the announcement of national emergency to the end of April (stage 1); the increase became smaller in May and June (stage 2) and disappeared in July and August (stage 3). Year to year difference-in-difference analyses show that these findings are robust after controlling for seasonality and worker heterogeneity. Results : We show that the increase in gig workers’ labor supply is not driven by a higher demand or excessive entry of new workers during the pandemic. A series of mediation analyses indicates that unemployment and nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) rather than the risk of contracting COVID-19 can better explain why online gig workers increased their labor supply. The impact of unemployment is smaller than that of NPI policies, indicating that the increase in gig workers’ labor supply is more driven by temporary changes in working arrangements because of the policies rather than relatively long-term changes in employment situations. We also examine how online gig workers change their quality of work and how their earning potential on the platform relates to their changes in behavior during the pandemic.

@article{ ,
  abstract     = {Problem definition : Complementary sourcing, with which a product depends on both a supplier’s and a manufacturer’s engineering and production efforts, is ubiquitous in modern supply chains. A unique feature of complementary sourcing is that efforts by one party enhance the marginal value of the other party’s efforts. Whereas this positive spillover effect can benefit both parties, it is well-established in the literature that it paradoxically induces a first-mover disadvantage; neither party is willing to exert efforts ex ante, resulting in significant lost opportunities for improving sourcing performance. The question we consider in this paper is whether the first-mover disadvantage is a valid concern in more realistic sourcing environments in which the market is risky and price is endogenous. Methodology/results : We analyze a sequential-investment model and investigate how market risk and endogenous pricing affect the first-mover disadvantage. In the presence of market risk, the first mover may face greater market uncertainty than the second mover and, thus, is at an apparent disadvantage. Surprisingly, we find the introduction of market risk can favor the first mover. In effect, the presence of market risk weakens the second mover’s ability to free ride on the first mover’s investment, which increases the leverage of the first mover. This finding persists with exogenous pricing even if the first mover has weak power. Managerial implications : Our results suggest that the first-mover disadvantage identified in the extant literature ignores the operational aspect of practical sourcing environments, and sourcing managers should recognize that advance effort investment is often beneficial in more realistic complementary sourcing environments.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper addresses the question whether or not self-learning algorithms can learn to collude instead of compete against each other, without violating existing competition law. Academic/practical relevance : This question is practically relevant (and hotly debated) for competition regulators, and academically relevant in the area of analysis of multi-agent data-driven algorithms. Methodology : We construct a price algorithm based on simultaneous-perturbation Kiefer–Wolfowitz recursions. We derive theoretical bounds on its limiting behavior of prices and revenues, in the case that both sellers in a duopoly independently use the algorithm, and in the case that one seller uses the algorithm and the other seller sets prices competitively. Results : We mathematically prove that, if implemented independently by two price-setting firms in a duopoly, prices will converge to those that maximize the firms’ joint revenue in case this is profitable for both firms, and to a competitive equilibrium otherwise. We prove this latter convergence result under the assumption that the firms use a misspecified monopolist demand model, thereby providing evidence for the so-called market-response hypothesis that both firms’ pricing as a monopolist may result in convergence to a competitive equilibrium. If the competitor is not willing to collaborate but prices according to a strategy from a certain class of strategies, we prove that the prices generated by our algorithm converge to a best-response to the competitor’s limit price. Managerial implications : Our algorithm can learn to collude under self-play while simultaneously learn to price competitively against a ‘regular’ competitor, in a setting where the price-demand relation is unknown and within the boundaries of competition law. This demonstrates that algorithmic collusion is a genuine threat in realistic market scenarios. Moreover, our work exemplifies how algorithms can be explicitly designed to learn to collude, and demonstrates that algorithmic collusion is facilitated (a) by the empirically observed practice of (explicitly or implicitly) sharing demand information, and (b) by allowing different firms in a market to use the same price algorithm. These are important and concrete insights for lawmakers and competition policy professionals struggling with how to respond to algorithmic collusion.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study profit allocation for a sourcing network, in which a buyer sources from a set of differentiated suppliers with limited capacity under uncertain demand for the final product. Whereas the buyer takes the lead in forming the sourcing network and designing the contract mechanism, due to their substantial bargaining power, the suppliers take the lead in determining the terms of the contract. Academic/practical relevance : We identify contracting mechanisms that will ensure the stability of the sourcing network in the long term, where a stable sourcing network requires an effective profit-allocation scheme that motivates all members to join and stay in the network. Methodology : We apply methods from game theory to model the network and analyze the Nash equilibrium of a noncooperative game under a proposed contracting mechanism. We then use a cooperative game model to study the stability of the resulting equilibrium. Results : We show that the optimal network profit, as a set function of the set of suppliers, is submodular, which allows us to demonstrate that the core of the cooperative game is not empty. We also establish a set of conditions that are equivalent to, but much simpler than, the original conditions for the core. We use these results to demonstrate that the proposed fixed-fee contracting mechanism can implement a stable network in the competitive setting by achieving a profit allocation that is in the core of the cooperative game. We also demonstrate that the grand coalition is stable in a farsighted sense under the Shapley value allocation. Managerial implications : Under the fixed-fee mechanism, the buyer’s decisions maximize the network profit, and each supplier earns a profit equal to its marginal contribution. When the aggregate capacity of the supplier network is high relative to demand, or demand is more likely to be small, the fixed-fee mechanism is likely to outperform the Shapley value allocation from the perspective of the buyer.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study the emerging practice of using opaque selling to dispose of leftover inventory in vertically differentiated markets. With this selling strategy, a firm offers a synthetic product (after the regular selling season) for which consumers do not know the exact identity until after purchase. Academic/practical relevance : This opaque-selling strategy is implemented in several industries—for example, travel and retail. However, its mechanisms are yet to be fully understood, as the extant literature considers other settings wherein opaque selling’s mechanisms do not carry over to ours. Methodology : We develop a game-theoretic model featuring a firm’s inventory and dynamic selling strategies and consumers’ strategic waiting. We characterize the optimal inventory levels, product offerings, and prices. Results : We find that, compared with last-minute selling (i.e., selling leftover inventory separately), opaque selling increases regular-season profits by softening intertemporal cannibalization from sales-season products to high-quality products sold in the regular season. However, it may decrease sales-season profits, as products with different qualities are probabilistically allocated to all purchasing consumers, irrespective of their valuations. We further demonstrate that these mechanisms are fundamentally different from those identified in the literature for other settings, and this contrast generates opposite recommendations as for the optimal usage of opaque selling. With endogenous inventory, interestingly, opaque selling is even more attractive, and it prompts the firm to procure fewer high-quality products than under last-minute selling. Managerial implications : We demonstrate the value of opaque selling as an inventory-clearance strategy in vertical markets. We show that a firm can further strengthen its profitability by combining opaque selling with inventory management. We also provide guidelines on managing inventory and illustrate the nontrivial impact of opaque selling.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : “Slugging,” or casual carpooling, refers to the commuting practice of drivers picking up passengers at designated locations and offering them a free ride in order to qualify for high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes. Academic/practical relevance : It is estimated that tens of thousands of daily commuters rely on slugging to go to work in major U.S. cities. As drivers save commute time and passengers ride for free, slugging can be a promising Smart Mobility solution. However, little is known about the welfare, policy, and environmental implications of slugging. Methodology : We develop a stylized model that captures the essence of slugging. We characterize commuters’ equilibrium behavior in the model. Results : We find that slugging indeed makes commuters better off. However, the widely observed free-ride tradition is socially suboptimal. As compared with the social optimum, commuters always underslug in the free-slugging equilibrium when highway travel time is insensitive to slugging activities but may overslug otherwise. The socially optimal outcome can be achieved by allowing pecuniary exchanges between drivers and passengers. Interestingly, passengers may be better off if they pay for a ride than if they do not under free slugging. We also find that although policy initiatives to expand highway capacity or improve public transportation always increase social welfare in the absence of slugging, they may reduce social welfare in areas where free slugging is a major commuting choice. Nevertheless, these unintended consequences would be mitigated by the introduction of pecuniary exchanges. Finally, contrary to conventional wisdom, slugging as a form of carpooling can result in more cars on the road and thus, more carbon emissions. Managerial implications : Our results call upon the slugging community to rethink the free-ride practice. We also caution that slugging benefits commuters possibly to the detriment of the environment.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study an urban bike lane planning problem based on the fine-grained bike trajectory data, which are made available by smart city infrastructure, such as bike-sharing systems. The key decision is where to build bike lanes in the existing road network. Academic/practical relevance : As bike-sharing systems become widespread in the metropolitan areas over the world, bike lanes are being planned and constructed by many municipal governments to promote cycling and protect cyclists. Traditional bike lane planning approaches often rely on surveys and heuristics. We develop a general and novel optimization framework to guide the bike lane planning from bike trajectories. Methodology : We formalize the bike lane planning problem in view of the cyclists’ utility functions and derive an integer optimization model to maximize the utility. To capture cyclists’ route choices, we develop a bilevel program based on the Multinomial Logit model. Results : We derive structural properties about the base model and prove that the Lagrangian dual of the bike lane planning model is polynomial-time solvable. Furthermore, we reformulate the route-choice-based planning model as a mixed-integer linear program using a linear approximation scheme. We develop tractable formulations and efficient algorithms to solve the large-scale optimization problem. Managerial implications : Via a real-world case study with a city government, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms and quantify the trade-off between the coverage of bike trips and continuity of bike lanes. We show how the network topology evolves according to the utility functions and highlight the importance of understanding cyclists’ route choices.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : By providing an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional vehicles, electric vehicles will transform urban mobility, particularly in smart cities. In practice, after an electric vehicle is plugged in, the charging station completes charging as soon as possible. Given that the procurement cost of electricity and associated emissions vary significantly during a day, substantial savings can be achieved by smart charging—delaying charging until the cost is lower. In this paper, we study smart charging as an innovative business model for utility firms. Academic/practical relevance : Utility firms are already investing in charging stations, and they can achieve significant cost savings through smart charging. Methodology : We consider a mechanism design problem in which a utility firm first announces pairs of charging price and completion time. Then, each customer selects the pair that maximizes their utility. Given the selected completion times, the utility firm solves the optimal control problem of determining the charging schedule that minimizes the cost of charging under endogenous, time-varying electricity procurement cost. We assume that there are ample parking spots with chargers at the charging station. Results : We devise an intuitive and practically implementable policy for scheduling charging of electric vehicles under given completion times. We prove that this policy is optimal if all customers arrive at the station simultaneously. We also characterize the optimal pairs of charging price and completion time. By using real electricity demand and generation data from the largest electricity market in the United States, we find that cost and emissions savings from smart charging are approximately 20% and 15%, respectively, during a typical summer month. Managerial implications : In contrast to the current practice of charging vehicles without delay, we show that it is economically and environmentally beneficial to delay charging some vehicles and to set charging prices based on customers’ inconvenience cost of delays. We also find that most of the savings from implementing smart charging can be achieved during peak-demand days, highlighting the effectiveness of smart charging.},

We analyze key problems with respect to prediction, optimization, and evaluation as well as trade-offs between different quality measures and crime types. Academic/practical relevance: Data-driven prescriptive analytics is gaining substantial attention in operations management research, and effective policing is at the core of the operations of almost every city in the world. Given the vast amounts of data increasingly collected within smart city initiatives and the growing safety challenges faced by urban centers worldwide, our work provides novel insights on the development and evaluation of prescriptive analytics applications in an urban context. Methodology: We conduct a computational study using crime and auxiliary data on the city of San Francisco. We analyze both strong and weak prediction methods along with two optimization formulations representing the deterrence and response time impact of police vehicle allocations. We analyze trade-offs between these effects and between different crime types. Results: We find that even weaker prediction methods can produce Pareto-efficient outcomes with respect to deterrence and response time. We identify three different archetypes of combinations of prediction methods and optimization objectives that constitute the Pareto frontier among the configurations we analyze. Furthermore, optimizing for multiple crime types biases allocations in a way that generally decreases single-type performance along one outcome metric but can improve it along the other. Managerial implications: Although optimization integrating all relevant crime types is theoretically possible, it is practically challenging because each crime type requires a collectively consistent weight. We present a framework combining prediction and optimization for a subset of key crime types with exploring the impact on the remaining types to support implementation of operations-focused smart city solutions in practice.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The Singapore government has recently proposed the concept of “Locker Alliance” (LA), an interoperable network of public lockers in residential areas and hot spots in community, to improve the efficiency of last mile parcel delivery operations. This is to complement the existing infrastructure, composed mainly of proprietary lockers and collection points in commercial areas set up by large delivery companies. How do we determine the density and coverage of the LA network to promote adoption of locker pickup in Singapore? What will be the impact on the delivery profile in the central business district, far from the residential areas? Academic/practical relevance : We discuss the operational challenges associated with the problem of public locker installation in a city, following a new smart nation initiative in Singapore. We used data analytics to address the following questions: What are the chances that a customer will choose to pick up the parcel from a locker, over home or office deliveries, based on walking distance (to lockers) and a variety of other features? Without knowing the transit routes of the customers, how do we design the LA network to ensure that the lockers will be well utilized? Methodology : We use a set of locker usage data from a commercial courier company to calibrate a locker choice model to determine the impact of walking distance on locker pickup intentions. We use the current (observed) parcel delivery profile to develop a facility location model for the LA network. We use this model to extrapolate and approximate the true adoption and new delivery profiles when the LA network is built. Results : Contrary to conventional wisdom, our model does not always place lockers near areas with peak parcel volume (in preexisting data) because the LA lockers provide another option for customers to pick up from lockers near residential areas. Furthermore, the model suggests that a coverage of 250 meters is appropriate for the LA network in Singapore. Managerial implications : Commercial parcel locker installation has traditionally focused on hot spots in the transit routes of the citizens in the city. The LA network is the first attempt in Singapore to allow public lockers in residential areas. This paper develops an analytical method to determine network density and coverage based on a locker choice model and argues how useful insights can be gleaned from the model, despite not having the full transit route information of all citizens in the city.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition: We develop a crossdisciplinary analytics framework to understand citywide mobility-energy synergy. In particular, we investigate the potential of shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEVs) for improving the self-sufficiency and resilience of solar-powered urban microgrids. Academic/practical relevance: Our work is motivated by the ever-increasing interconnection of energy and mobility service systems at the urban scale. We propose models and analytics to characterize the dynamics of the SAEV-microgrid service systems, which were largely overlooked by the literature on service operations and vehicle-grid integration (VGI) analysis. Methodology: We develop a space-time-energy network representation of SAEVs. Then, we formulate linear program models to incorporate an array of major operational decisions interconnecting the mobility and energy systems. To preventatively ensure microgrid resilience, we also propose an “ N − 1” resilience-constrained fleet dispatch problem to cope with microgrid outages. Results: Combining eight data sources of New York City, our results show that 80,000 SAEVs in place of the current ride-sharing mobility assets can improve the microgrid self-sufficiency by 1.45% (benchmarked against the case without grid support) mainly via the spatial transfer of electricity, which complements conventional VGI. Scaling up the SAEV fleet size to 500,000 increases the microgrid self-sufficiency by 8.85% mainly through temporal energy transfer, which substitutes conventional VGI. We also quantify the potential and trade-offs of SAEVs for peak electricity import reduction and ramping mitigation. In addition, microgrid resilience can be enhanced by SAEVs, but the actual resilience level varies by microgrids and by the hour when grid contingency occurs. The SAEV fleet operator can further maintain the resilience of pivotal microgrid areas at their maximum achievable level with no more than a 1% increase in the fleet repositioning trip length. Managerial implications: Our models and findings demonstrate the potential in deepening the integration of urban mobility and energy service systems toward a smart-city future.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Marketplace platforms such as Amazon or Farfetch provide a convenient meeting point between customers and suppliers and have become an important element of e-commerce. This sales channel is particularly interesting for suppliers that sell seasonal goods under a tight time frame because they provide expanded reach to potential customers even though it entails lower margins. In this dyadic relationship, a supplier needs to optimize when to share inventory with the platform, and the platform needs to set the right commission structure during the season. Academic/practical relevance : We characterize supplier participation into the platform in a dynamic setting and link it to inventory levels, demand rates, time left in the season, and commission structure. This directly drives the commission structure decision made by the platform. We, thus, provide a framework to evaluate platform commission fee policies, taking into account supplier responses. Methodology : We use an optimal control framework with limited inventory supply and a stochastic demand process. We study the conditions under which the supplier accepts participation and use the platform as a sales channel. We also study the optimal commission structure that the platform should employ and the supplier procurement response. Results : We find that suppliers only participate if inventory is high relative to the time left to sell the items. As a result, the platform can only offer limited supply at the beginning of the season. Given this behavior, we find that the platform and the system are always better off with flexible pricing via fully dynamic commissions, which hurts the supplier the most (better off with less flexible commission fees). Interestingly, when the inventory decision is contingent on the platform pricing policy, the platform often finds it beneficial to commit to a static fee to incentivize the supplier to stock up, highlighting that inability to commit to fixed commissions may destroy value through double marginalization effects. Managerial implications : Our work suggests that short-term profit for the platform is maximized with fully dynamic commission fees at the expense of supplier profit. If inventory is endogenous, suppliers can retaliate by reducing their commitment at the start of the season. Despite the increased revenue obtained with the fully dynamic commission fee, the lost sales from the inventory drop incentivize the platform to opt for supplier-friendly commission fees, which are better for long-term profit.},

These devices appear useful, yet little is known about their broader impact on worker productivity and behavior. Academic/practical relevance : Efficient production ramp-ups are particularly important when product life cycles are short. An ongoing debate among academics and practitioners pertains to how Industry 4.0, and AR devices in particular, can accelerate the ramp-up. The current study provides empirical evidence related to AR in the production ramp-up context, examines the strengths and weaknesses of AR, and tests four hypotheses, leading to a more nuanced view of AR use in the manufacturing ramp-up. Methodology : A framed field experiment in a manufacturing plant provides a test of how quickly workers can perform new tasks with and without AR support and how the use of AR affects their ability to suggest process improvements. Results : When faced with a new task, workers instructed by AR smart glasses use 43.8% less time to complete the task compared with a control group that relies on paper-based instructions. However, workers that use AR glasses consistently use 23% more time than the control group when both groups repeat the task without either AR or paper-based instructions. Task difficulty moderates this relationship; workers assigned to a more difficult task benefit the most from AR instructions. After the devices are removed, workers instructed based on paper improve their productivity faster through learning than those instructed by AR. In addition, the former group suggests better process improvements than the latter one. Managerial implications : Although these results indicate substantially higher productivity resulting from AR devices, they also support the view that, once instructed through AR devices, workers come to rely on this new technology without fully internalizing the task. This failure to internalize their task then leads workers to suggest less useful process improvements.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Scan based trading (SBT) represents a type of replenishment system in which the supplier retains title until the product is scanned through checkout at the retail store by the consumer. Although SBT carries potential benefits for both parties in the supplier-retailer dyad, it may also yield asymmetric gains to these parties, particularly because SBT can impose greater inventory costs to suppliers through shrink. We document the financial benefits in terms of supply chain profit creation and allocation based on the differences in bargaining power between parties in a vertical channel under SBT vis-à-vis the more traditional vendor-managed inventory (VMI) contracts. Academic/practical relevance : Although prior literature has examined inventory benefits and drawbacks from VMI and SBT contracts in retailer-supplier dyads, it has failed to offer a systematic evaluation of the relative impact of these contract forms on bargaining power and profits in these dyads. We address this knowledge gap. Methodology : To that end, we use a methodological approach that incorporates an empirical Nash-in-Nash bargaining model, a supplementary regression, and a counterfactual simulation. Results : We find that retailer bargaining power is higher under SBT relative to VMI contracts. Moreover, the direct effects of a retailer switching from VMI to SBT regimes generate an average increase of 25% in total supply chain profit, allowing the retailer and its supplier to increase their profit by 20% and 29%, respectively. However, although the retailer’s profit share decreases by approximately 3.5%, the supplier’s increases by about 3.3%. We attribute the decrease in the retailer’s share to a stronger bargaining position on the supplier side based on higher supplier shrink costs. Managerial implications : Our findings provide managers with more transparent information regarding the set of outcomes they can expect should they choose to enter into SBT contracts. Importantly, we show how an outcome that has significantly hindered the adoption of SBT contracts (i.e., shrink costs) can enter into the negotiation between retailers and suppliers to optimally split the dyadic surplus of the contracts between these parties.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study the optimal inventory ordering, expediting, and allocation decisions in a multiechelon supply chain over a finite horizon, in which customer orders are quoted with a fixed fulfillment time window, termed the service time target (STT). Academic/practical relevance : Service time target is commonly used as a marketing strategy to increase customer satisfaction and strengthen firms’ competitive edge. However, how to efficiently manage a multistage supply chain to meet the target has received relatively scant attention in the literature. Our study fills this gap. Methodology : We use dynamic programming to characterize the optimal policy. Results : We show that an echelon base stock policy and a rationing policy are optimal for inventory ordering and inventory allocation/expediting, respectively. We also develop a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the optimal policy. To derive these results, we uncover a new functional property named the decomposable of degree 2 property, which is a nontrivial generalization of the celebrated Clark-Scarf decomposition. This property further allows us to derive induced penalty and compensation to coordinate a decentralized serial system with STT and expediting. Managerial implications : Our result provides an efficient decision tool for managing centralized and decentralized serial supply chains with STT and expediting. Our model can be used to quantify the tradeoff between marketing and operational decisions, such as the impact of a marginal reduction in STT on system cost and expedition frequency, as explored in our numerical studies.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Agile project management, in particular Scrum, is enjoying increased use in practice despite only scant scientific validation. This article explores how agile project management impacts project performance and execution. We compare the effects of agile sprints—short-term project phases characterized by time-boxed progression from one sprint to the next and self-imposed, phase-specific output goals—with those of traditional project management. Methodology/results : We decompose the two sprint elements of time-boxed progression and self-imposed, phase-specific output goals as factors in a 2 × 2 experimental design. We then conceptualize project execution as a simple real-effort task and conduct a controlled laboratory study. For a given duration, participants perform better with time-boxed progression as, without it, that is, with flexible progression, they spend too much time on early project phases at the expense of later ones. We refer to this effect as “progression fallacy” and show how it differs from well-known behavioral effects that cause project delays. Introducing self-imposed, phase-specific output goals in combination with time-boxed progression, as proposed by Scrum, does not significantly improve performance when compared with time-boxed progression alone. However, the combination of self-imposed, phase-specific output goals and flexible progression, as is common in traditional project management, amplifies the progression fallacy with the result that goal-setting has a negative performance effect. In two control treatments, we show that the progression fallacy is robust to planning and progression prompts despite some mitigation. Managerial implications : This study contributes evidence of higher project performance when working in agile sprints, which mitigate behavioral flaws present in traditional project management. Not only do these behavioral insights apply to project management; they are also relevant in the broader context of task completion.},

Academic/practical relevance : The problem is motivated by the practice in coal-fired power plants, an important part of the energy sector, where two types of coal with different energy content per unit mass are blended for electrical power generation. Our model is the first to capture the key operational features in this context.

Results : We show that a use-down-to/balancing production policy and modified order-up-to ordering policy is optimal. We also propose a heuristic policy based on piece-wise linear value function approximation. Whereas computing the value function approximation via brute-force is time-consuming because of the curse of dimensionality, we leverage the structure of the optimal policy to develop an algorithm that greatly improves the computational time of the value function approximation. Our numerical studies on both a synthetic data set and real-world data show that the proposed heuristic provides significant profit improvement over three simpler straw policies, some of which are used in practice. Managerial implications : Our paper suggests the significant profit improvement opportunity of using our proposed policy and demonstrates how one can develop computationally more efficient heuristic policies by leveraging the structure of the optimal policy.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The mobile commerce (m-commerce) channel is poised to be the future of online markets. It offers search features distinct from conventional personal computer (PC)-based e-commerce channels. Its easy accessibility extends the time available for customers to search, although its shopping environment constraints (e.g., small screen size, single-tab browsing) may inflate search costs. Collectively, these competing features cause ambiguity about the mobile channel’s true effect on sales concentration—a key criterion in managing retail operations. The focus of this study is to understand the net impact of the mobile channel on driving sales concentration. Academic/practical relevance : Our study extends the empirical literature focusing on online retailers’ channel strategies and their implication on operations practice. It examines differences in primary online channels—mobile and PC—on shaping sales concentration across products and the cost of ignoring such a difference on inventory management, a core decision for operations managers. Methodology : We collaborate with a large online apparel retailer to access customer-level transactional data. We identify the mobile channel’s effect on sales concentration using a difference-in-differences strategy that leverages a quasi-experiment stemming from the retailer’s decision to discontinue its PC sales channel. Results : We find that the mobile channel increases the share of popular products by 6.4% compared with the PC channel. We also identify scenarios where ignoring this significant sales concentration difference will yield suboptimal inventory stocking by 4.2%–12.9%. Managerial implications : Our paper highlights that the mobile and PC channels have different sales concentrations because of different search features. Ignoring this difference affects inventory decisions, such as safety and cycle inventory levels. Therefore, it is imperative for managers to revise their status quo strategies, such as on inventory procurement, assortment planning, and product display, when integrating m-commerce with e-commerce.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Inspired by variations in warranty length specifications in the U.S. automotive industry, we study how a durable good producer’s product warranty length choice relates to its product reliability. We introduce a producer’s secondary market interference (e.g., buyback of used products) as a possible driver for such variations observed in practice. Methodology/results : Using an analytical model of a monopolist finitely durable good producer, we first study the interaction between product reliability and the producer’s warranty length choice in the presence of secondary market interference. This analysis suggests that a durable good producer’s warranty length offering is U-shaped in its product reliability. That is, only producers with sufficiently low or high product reliability benefit from offering longer product warranties. Otherwise, a short warranty offering is preferred. We show that this result is driven by a producer’s strategic use of secondary market interference. We then test the predictions from these results in the automotive industry. An exploratory analysis of U.S. automotive industry data also suggests a U-shaped association between warranty offerings and product reliability, and points to the theoretically predicted dependency between producers’ secondary market interference and warranty length. Managerial implications : Producers with sufficiently high product reliability will benefit from longer warranties, as longer warranty coverage has marginal impact on their new product demand cannibalization by used products and warranty fulfillment costs. In contrast, producers with sufficiently low product reliability can use secondary market interference to jointly avoid the cannibalization from used products and high warranty fulfilment costs associated with long warranties for low reliability products. Producers with moderate product reliability, on the other hand, cannot leverage secondary market interference as effectively, and benefit more from shorter warranty offerings.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Warranty reserves are funds used to fulfill future warranty obligations for a product. In this paper, we investigate the warranty reserve planning problem faced by a manufacturing firm who manages warranties for multiple products. Academic/practical relevance : It is nontrivial to determine a proper amount of reserves to hold, because warranty expenditures are random in nature and reserving either excess or insufficient cash would incur losses. How can warranty reserve levels be optimized and promptly adjusted is a focal issue, especially for firms selling multiple products. Methodology : Inspired by the general pattern of empirical warranty claims data, we first develop an aggregate warranty cost (AWC) forecasting model for a single product by coupling stochastic product sales and failure processes, which can be used to plan for warranty reserves periodically. The reserve levels are then optimized via a distributionally robust approach, because the exact distribution of AWC is generally unknown. To reduce the losses generated from managing the funds, we further investigate two potential loss-reduction approaches: demand learning and funds pooling. Results : For the demand learning algorithm, we prove that, as the sales period grows, the optimal learning parameter asymptotically converges to a constant in a fairly fast rate; our simulation experiments show that the performance of demand learning is promising and robust under general warranty claim patterns. Moreover, we find that the benefits of funds pooling change over different stages of the warranty life cycle; in particular, the relative pooling benefit in terms of reserve losses is nonincreasing over time. Managerial implications : This study offers guidelines on how manufacturers should adaptively forecast and dynamically plan warranty reserves over the warranty life cycle.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We examine the impact of four classes of workplace interruptions on short-term (working hours) and long-term (across-shifts) worker performance in an agribusiness setting. The interruptions are organized in a two-by-two framework in which they result (or do not result) in a physical task requirement and lead to a varying degree of attention shift from the primary task. Academic/practical relevance : Prior operations management literature primarily examines the long-term effects of a single class of interruption that reduces performance. Our study contributes to this literature by examining multiple classes of interruptions that lead to positive and negative outcomes over the short-term in addition to the long-term. Further, our study also contributes to understanding the impact of general task transitions (interruptions) on worker performance, and the interrupting tasks include tasks that are not part of workers’ primary job duties. Our study is relevant to work settings that envelop high manual labor and experience interruptions regularly. Finally, we offer strategies to improve operational performance. Methodology : Using a granular data set on worker productivity from 211 harvesters yielding 117,581 truckloads of fruit harvested for 9,819 worker shifts, we utilize an instrumental variable approach with two-stage residual inclusion estimation on a mix of linear and nonlinear models to examine and quantify the impact of interruptions on both short- and long-term worker productivity. Results : We identify a new interruption class, a pause —interruptions that provide the physical respite and limit the degree of attention shift from the primary task. We find that pauses improve worker productivity in the short- and long-term. Next, we find that scheduled breaks hurt (improve) the worker’s productivity in the short-term (long-term). Finally, we find that harvester breakdown and travel across field interruptions that drain physical resources and cause attention shift hurt worker productivity in the short- and long-term. We quantify the impact (in our field context) of a five-minute increase in each of these work interruptions on average worker productivity. Managerial implications : Our study demonstrates that various work interruptions can have positive or negative effects on workers’ productivity. We suggest that introducing brief pauses in a workday and simultaneously reminding (before initiating the pause) employees about the tasks yet to be completed or goals to be achieved for the rest of the shift can help maintain their focus on the work and yield high-performance benefits. We also suggest strategies that limit the restart costs and increase the predictability of interruptions that hurt performance. For example, in regards to scheduled breaks, planning the break after completing a subtask or reaching a subgoal can limit their adverse effects. Further, informing workers on the possibility of interruption circumstances at the beginning of the work shift can help them plan for these events and improve engagement and performance on the primary job.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In practice, trade credit (TC) is often offered in a contract that stipulates a single, fixed interest, rather than an interest menu contingent on the loan amount. We examine why a supplier uses such a single-interest contract and why a buyer who can access perfect external capital (EC) with contingent interest may use TC, when the supplier does not share the buyer’s demand risk. Methodology/results : We solve a dynamic game between a supplier and two buyers, who have access to EC and compete in a Cournot game in the product market. We show that the single-interest contract incentivizes a buyer to order more. Thus, such a contract benefits the supplier and makes TC a strategic device for buyers to commit to competing aggressively. Opposite to well-known results, we show that buyers may benefit from using strategic TC, because their access to EC gives them strong pricing power that yields sufficiently low wholesale price. The entire supply chain also benefits because the over-ordering distortion under TC mitigates the under-ordering problem caused by double marginalization. Managerial implications : Our analysis implies that, to weaken buyers’ pricing power and improve profit, the supplier should offer cheap TC—for example, in net terms to—financially resourceful buyers and expensive TC—for example, with early payment discount—to financially constrained buyers, as observed in practice. We find strategic TC to yield increasingly more benefit for the supplier as its production cost decreases and may allow the buyer to maximize its payoff at an intermediate consumers’ willingness-to-pay that leads to strong pricing power and low wholesale price.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In theory, all coordinating contracts are equivalent; however, the minimum order quantity (MOQ) contract is observed to be more popular in practice. We seek to understand whether decision makers as suppliers can perform better with the MOQ contract and, if so, why. We also study whether MOQ is indeed the preferred contract when subjects are allowed to choose among coordinating contracts. Academic/practical relevance : The behavioral operations management literature has established a trade-off between complex coordinating and simple noncoordinating contracts. This paper fills a gap in the literature by studying whether and how the coordinating MOQ contract attenuates this trade-off. Methodology : First, we test whether subjects in the role of suppliers given only a single contract type can optimize its parameters. Second, we introduce treatments where the coordinating contracts subject to demand risk are hedged such that risk is eliminated. Third, we repeat two of the initial sets of treatments with a cognitive load survey and introduce single-variable versions of those treatments to reduce cognitive burden. Fourth, we introduce a novel experimental design where, in each period, subjects choose both the type of contract to offer and the parameters of that contract. Results : We find that (i) subjects perform significantly better with the MOQ contract compared with other coordinating contracts; (ii) this can be attributed to the risk inherent in and cognitive burden induced by those contracts; and (iii) subjects choose the MOQ contract more frequently over theoretically equivalent coordinating contracts. Managerial implications : We show that the trade-off between efficiency and complexity can be mitigated by simpler yet efficient contracts. Hence, there is considerable benefit to identifying contractual mechanisms that ameliorate the adverse effects of complexity. This explains the prevalence of MOQ terms in supply contracts.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Although the analytical literature extensively studies distribution channels, empirical evidence on the value of omnichannel distribution is limited, especially for the omnichannel used by manufacturing companies to fulfill retail orders. I empirically evaluate the extent to which the dual–distribution center (dual-DC) distribution channel and the factory-direct distribution channel contribute to fulfilling orders from retail stores compared with the traditional single–distribution center (single-DC) channel. Academic/practical relevance : Many manufacturing companies develop their distribution omnichannel to fulfill retail orders. To make proper decisions on various channels, they need to understand the trade-offs between different order-fulfillment measures and costs in different distribution channels. Methodology : I exploit two switches in distribution channels of a manufacturing company to its retail customers: one from single-DC to dual-DC distribution and the other from single-DC to factory-direct distribution. To account for the trade-offs between order fulfillment and the costs associated with each distribution channel, I develop three equations for fill rate, lead time, and production and distribution costs in a difference-in-difference framework and then estimate the equations using proprietary data of retail orders and delivery records. Results : The results quantify the contributions of distribution channels to order fulfillment. Compared with the single-DC distribution channel, the dual-DC distribution channel raises the fill rate by 0.4% and reduces the lead time by 9.7% without incurring additional costs, whereas the factory-direct distribution channel increases the fill rate by 0.5% and provides a 5.2% cost savings but extends the lead time by 12.5%. I further analyze these contributions to order fulfillment across demand variability and order quantity. Managerial implications : The findings provide manufacturing companies with valuable knowledge of their distribution channel choices and means to find a cost-effective distribution channel to improve order fulfillment for various customers and products.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Reward points function as a new currency that consumers can spend on products and services. We study how point redemption affects the seller’s day-to-day pricing and inventory decisions. Academic/practical relevance : Despite widespread use of point redemption, little has been done on its implication on the seller’s operational decisions. This paper extends the revenue management literature to incorporate the impact of point redemption and provides managerial insights on how the seller can factor point redemption into decisions about price and inventory. Methodology : We develop a choice model in which a consumer chooses to pay with cash or points based on the attributes of reservation price, point balance, and the perceived value of a point. We incorporate this choice model into a dynamic model where a seller adjusts the price along with redemption availability and the required point amount. Results : We show that the effect of point redemption on the seller’s price is nontrivial, as the optimal price tilts upward or downward to the reimbursement rate (the compensatory revenue for a reward sale) depending on the inventory level, time, and the reimbursement rate. Furthermore, such price adjustments can attenuate the optimal markup/markdown level, reducing the price fluctuation derived by a dynamic pricing policy in the absence of reward sales. We find that operationalizing reward sales with some discretionary policies (e.g., control over the reward availability or point requirement) can considerably increase the seller’s revenue. Managerial implications : Our results guide how sellers manage prices and inventory dynamically when consumers can redeem points for purchases. Specifically, we show that a seller can benefit from allowing reward sales even when the reimbursement rate is substantially lower than the cash price. Although the seller benefits from having full control over the required point balance, the greatest benefit can be realized via the control of reward availability.},

  abstract     = {Problem description. We consider a dual channel in which a focal manufacturer (he) sells his output through his online store and an independent brick-and-mortar retailer (she). In this manufacturer-centric dual channel, we study product line, stocking, and pricing decisions in the presence of stochastic demand and inventory constraints. The pricing decisions include choosing whether to give price match guarantees (PMGs), standard in the U.S. retail practice. Methodology/Results. We analyze a game-theoretic model in which a focal manufacturer designs a product line, sets wholesale prices, and decides what products to sell in the dual channel. An independent brick-and-mortar retailer responds to the product line design and the wholesale prices by making stocking decisions in her store. Then, both stores observe demand and independently set retail prices subject to any PMGs that the stores gave to consumers. The brick-and-mortar store (online store) fulfills demand in a make-to-stock (make-to-order) fashion. We find that whenever one of the stores holds a competitive advantage, the manufacturer sells the same product line in both stores. If the brick-and-mortar store holds an advantage, it matches the online store’s retail price to obtain favorable wholesale pricing from the manufacturer. We find no equilibria where the online store price matches the brick-and-mortar store or the stores’ prices match each other. Finally, when neither store has a clear advantage, the manufacturer mitigates price competition by designing a different product for each store. Managerial implications. Our model helps identify optimal stocking and pricing strategies that depend on e-fulfillment cost and demand uncertainty and offers a novel reason for offering PMGs in a supply chain.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study the combined value of observing future demand realizations (partial demand visibility) and flexible capacity, two hedging mechanisms against demand uncertainty, when signing capacity contracts with short temporal commitment. Academic/practical relevance : With new technological innovations, short commitment contracts are found in dynamic environments like distribution, processing, and manufacturing, a trend likely to grow in the future. In contrast to classic procurement, where commitments are long, short commitments lead to new dynamics in which demand visibility allows companies to use flexible resources more efficiently by adapting to demand observations. Methodology : We incorporate flexible capacity and demand visibility simultaneously using a multiperiod newsvendor network model with two nodes that are supplied using dedicated and flexible capacity contracts with short temporal commitment. Results : The optimal commitment to capacity contracts adapts within bounds to the observed demand at each node. The ability to adapt to visible demand becomes more valuable when flexible capacity contracts are available. This allows us to show that demand visibility and flexible capacity can act as complements. Managerial implications : In contrast to conventional wisdom, when contracts have short commitment, companies can enhance the value of demand visibility if flexible capacity is also available as an option.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : When selling multiple products with different feature combinations over a short selling season, a seller often adopts a “reactive” upgrade policy by offering a free upgrade to the next-price-level product only after a customer’s preferred product is out of stock. However, when customers’ preferences are heterogeneous for different feature combinations, some unyielding customers may reject free upgrades. In this paper, we consider a new “proactive” upgrade policy under which the seller may offer free upgrades even before a product is out of stock. Academic/practical relevance : The proactive upgrade policy enables the seller to strategically keep some units of a product in reserve to secure future sales of this product for those unyielding customers. However, the value of the proactive upgrade policy over the traditional reactive upgrade policy remains unclear. Methodology : Given the product choice probability the “upgrade acceptance probability” of each arriving customer, we formulate the problem of how to offer proactive upgrades as a finite horizon dynamic program with an embedded Markov decision process, and we determine the optimal proactive upgrade policy. Results : By exploiting the underlying mathematical structure, we prove that the optimal value function possesses the “anti-multimodularity” property such that the optimal upgrade strategy under the proactive upgrade policy is governed by two state-dependent thresholds: one threshold dictates when to offer proactive upgrades, and the other threshold dictates when to offer reactive upgrades. We also show that the proactive upgrade policy can create significant value over the reactive upgrade policy when the next-price-level product has similar consumer utility or when the price sensitivity is intermediate. Managerial implications : We identify the conditions under which the proactive upgrade policy provides significant value over the traditional reactive upgrade policy. These results can be useful for sellers who sell variants of similar products with different feature combinations to customers with heterogeneous feature preferences.},

  abstract     = {Problem Definition : Firms can reduce the risk of rare disasters by accounting for more frequent near misses: precursor events that could have escalated to a disaster but did not. Investigating a near miss reveals its root cause, allowing the firm to improve process safety and reduce disaster risk. A managing firm, however, usually does not directly observe the occurrence of a near miss but instead relies on the report of an agent (an employee or contractor) who is also responsible for precautionary measures that prevent such incidents. This paper explains why near-miss reporting may not take place in such a decentralized setting. Academic/practical relevance : Literature and practitioners have acknowledged the crucial role of near-miss reports in improving process safety. Nevertheless, even at sophisticated and experienced organizations, disaster inquiries invariably uncover a history of unreported or ignored near misses preceding an accident. We provide an explanation for this persistent phenomenon based on rational economic incentives. Methodology : We examine the firm’s problem through a dynamic principal-agent model that captures the agent’s potential for under-reporting near misses along with moral hazard related to their precautionary effort. Results : We find that the firm may fail to capitalize on near miss information because of conflicting incentives. For instance, the agent may be unwilling to report near misses because the resulting safety improvements hurt them financially. This happens because safety improvements replace the need for the agent’s precautionary effort, thereby lowering moral hazard and allowing the firm to extract more rent from the agent. However, even when the agent is willing to report near misses, we find that the firm may choose not to record them, opting instead to create stronger incentives for precaution. In both scenarios, the firm forgoes opportunities for process-safety improvement and instead focuses on existing precautionary measures. Managerial implications : Our findings highlight the challenges in providing incentives for both reporting and precautionary measures that can result in a failure to leverage near miss information. We examine remedies that alleviate these issues and increase reporting in both voluntary and mandatory reporting environments.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Solar power companies have introduced innovative non-ownership business models—leasing and power purchase agreement (PPA)—in addition to sales. Under these models, the company installs solar panels for a customer, who purchases the electricity generated from the panels. Under leasing, a customer pays a fixed fee, whereas under PPA, a customer pays a per-unit price for the electricity generated. The adoption of solar panels is also promoted by investment and generation subsidies, which are received by customers under sales, but by the solar power company under non-ownership models. In addition, some states currently have restrictions on non-ownership model(s) to protect utility firms’ profits. Motivated by this context, we analyze the economic and environmental implications of such subsidies and restrictions. Academic/practical relevance : The share of non-ownership business models of the residential solar installations is approximately 40%, and we contribute to the operations management literature by being the first to endogenize a solar power company’s business model decisions to inform policymakers regarding the ongoing discussion on subsidies and restrictions. Methodology : We develop a sequential game between a profit-maximizing solar power company and utility-maximizing residential customers to characterize a solar power company’s optimal business model decisions. Results : We find that a higher investment subsidy makes it more attractive for the company to offer sales, whereas a higher generation subsidy makes it more attractive to offer non-ownership models. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we show that restricting the solar power company from offering leasing can actually lead to higher total adoption and generation of renewable energy. Managerial implications : We show that, although a higher generation subsidy leads to higher total adoption and generation of renewable energy, interestingly, a higher investment subsidy can backfire by leading to lower total adoption and generation. Consequently, a higher investment subsidy can actually lead to a higher profit for the utility firm. Finally, we find that restricting leasing can be detrimental for the utility firm and beneficial for the environment.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The continuously soaring prices of new drugs and their uncertain effectiveness in clinical practice have put substantial risks on insurers/payers. To induce insurer coverage of their new drugs, manufacturers start to propose an innovative outcome-based reimbursement (OBR) scheme under which manufacturers refund insurers (and possibly patients) if the drugs fail to achieve a prespecified treatment target. We investigate the impact of OBR on insurers, manufacturers, and patients. Academic/practical relevance : Although OBR sounds intuitively appealing, its true impact is under much debate and depends particularly on the design of OBR. Our study sheds light on the optimal design of OBR and the debate around OBR, considering key trade-offs and key elements not covered in prior literature. Methodology : We develop a Stackelberg game under which the manufacturer designs a rebate scheme for its drug, either non-OBR or OBR, considering the trade-off between a favorable formulary position and the rebate provided. The insurer subsequently determines its formulary for the drug as well as other alternative drugs within the same disease category considering the trade-off between its spending and patient health benefits. Using data on 14 drugs treating a common disease, hyperlipidemia, we estimate through a multinomial logit model the demand of the 14 drugs and conduct counterfactual analyses on the impact of OBR. Results : Under the optimal OBR, the manufacturer lowers the insurer’s risk but inflates the wholesale price (hence, may not reduce insurer spending). OBR also induces a better formulary position for the manufacturer, which, hence, improves patient access to new drugs. Further, rebates to the insurer and patients affect demand through different mechanisms. Including patient rebates in OBR lowers patient expenses and increases drug demand but further increases insurer spending. Managerial implications : We demonstrate the structure of an optimal formulary and its application in practice. We caution insurers/payers who are seeking OBR to reduce their spending.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study personalized product recommendations on platforms when customers have unknown preferences. Importantly, customers may disengage when offered poor recommendations. Academic/practical relevance : Online platforms often personalize product recommendations using bandit algorithms, which balance an exploration-exploitation trade-off. However, customer disengagement—a salient feature of platforms in practice—introduces a novel challenge because exploration may cause customers to abandon the platform. We propose a novel algorithm that constrains exploration to improve performance. Methodology : We present evidence of customer disengagement using data from a major airline’s ad campaign; this motivates our model of disengagement, where a customer may abandon the platform when offered irrelevant recommendations. We formulate the customer preference learning problem as a generalized linear bandit, with the notable difference that the customer’s horizon length is a function of past recommendations. Results : We prove that no algorithm can keep all customers engaged. Unfortunately, classical bandit algorithms provably overexplore, causing every customer to eventually disengage. Motivated by the structural properties of the optimal policy in a scalar instance of our problem, we propose modifying bandit learning strategies by constraining the action space up front using an integer program. We prove that this simple modification allows our algorithm to perform well by keeping a significant fraction of customers engaged. Managerial implications : Platforms should be careful to avoid overexploration when learning customer preferences if customers have a high propensity for disengagement. Numerical experiments on movie recommendations data demonstrate that our algorithm can significantly improve customer engagement.},

Methodology/Results : We conduct a behavioral experiment using the beer distribution game. We estimate decision rules using multilevel modeling approaches that overcome several drawbacks of the estimation methods used in the earlier literature. We find robust evidence that, contrary to the overreaction when in backlog hypothesis and reports from popular press, decision makers order less aggressively and become insensitive to the scope of the problem when in backlog—a scope neglect phenomenon. Managerial implications : We propose a dual-process theoretical account predicated on affective reactions to explain this scope neglect. Our results suggest that affective reactions under novel operating conditions or dramatic events in supply chains, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can overwhelm cognitive processing of managers and make them fail to recognize the full scope of the problems faced and update decision models accordingly.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Many studies have examined quantitative customer reviews (i.e., star ratings) and found them to be a reliable source of information that has a positive effect on product demand. Yet the effect of qualitative customer reviews (i.e., text reviews) on demand has been less thoroughly studied, and it is not known whether (or how) the sentiment expressed in text reviews moderates the influence of star ratings on product demand. We are therefore led to examine how the interplay between review sentiment and star ratings affects product demand. Academic/practical relevance : Consumer perceptions of product quality and how they are shared via customer reviews are of extreme relevance to the firm, but we still do not understand how product demand is affected by the quantitative and qualitative aspects of customer reviews. Our paper seeks to fill this critical gap in the literature by analyzing star ratings, the sentiment of customer reviews, and their interaction. Methodology : Using 2002–2013 data for the U.S. automobile market, we investigate empirically the impact of star ratings and review sentiment on product demand. Thus, we estimate an aggregated multinomial choice model after performing a machine learning–based sentiment analysis on the entire corpus of customer reviews included in our sample. We take advantage of a quasi-exogenous shock to establish a causal link between online reviews and product demand. Results : We find robust empirical evidence that (i) review sentiment and star ratings both have a decreasingly positive effect on product demand and (ii) the effect (on demand) of their interaction suggests that the two components of reviews are complements. Positive sentiments in text reviews increase the positive effect of ratings when the effect of ratings is decidedly positive while they also compensate for the tendency of consumers to discount extremely high star ratings. Managerial implications : The firm should pay greater attention to quantitative and qualitative customer reviews to better understand how consumers perceive the quality of its offerings.},

Methodology : We analyze two queues serving two classes of customers; the redundant class joins both queues, whereas the nonredundant class joins a single queue randomly. We compare this system against a benchmark wherein the redundant class resorts to joining the shortest queue (JSQ) if multiple queue joining were not allowed, capturing the most likely case if multilisting was prohibited: Affluent patients could still afford to list in the region with the shorter wait list. Results : We prove that when the arrival rate of nonredundant customers is balanced across both queues, they actually benefit under redundancy of the other class—that is, redundancy is fair. We also establish that redundancy may be unfair under some circumstances: Nonredundant customers are worse off if their arrival rate is strongly skewed toward one of the queues. We illustrate how these findings apply in the organ-transplantation setting through a numerical study using publicly available data. Managerial implications : Our analysis helps identify when, and by how much, multiple listing may be unfair and, as such, could be a useful tool for policy makers who may be concerned with trying to ensure equitable access to resources, such as organs, across patients with differing wealth levels.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study a monopolistic robust pricing problem in which the seller does not know the customers’ valuation distribution for a product but knows its mean and variance. Academic/practical relevance : This minimal requirement for information means that the pricing managers only need to be able to answer two questions: How much will your targeted customers pay on average? To measure your confidence in the previous answer, what is the standard deviation of customer valuations? Methodology : We focus on the maximin profit criterion and derive distribution-free upper and lower bounds on the profit function. Results : By maximizing the tight profit lower bound, we obtain the optimal robust price in closed form as well as its distribution-free, worst-case performance bound. We then extend the single-product result to study the robust pure bundle pricing problem where the seller only knows the mean and variance of each product, and we provide easily verifiable, distribution-free, sufficient conditions that guarantee the pure bundle to be more robustly profitable than à la carte (i.e., separate) sales. We further derive a distribution-free, worst-case performance guarantee for a heuristic scheme in which customers choose between buying either a single product or a pure bundle. Moreover, we generalize separate sales and pure bundling to a scheme called clustered bundling that imposes a price for each part (i.e., cluster) of a partition of all products and allows customers to choose one or multiple parts (i.e., clusters), and we provide various algorithms to compute clustered bundling heuristics. In parallel, most of our results hold for the minimax relative regret criterion as well. Managerial implications : The robust price for a single product is in closed form under the maximin profit or minimax relative regret criterion and hence, is easily computable. Its interpretation can be easily explained to pricing managers. We also provide efficient algorithms to compute various mixed bundling heuristics for the multiproduct problem.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition: We examine a firm’s investigation and recall decisions when a defect occurs and provide policy implications on how to deter long delayed recalls. Practical relevance: When a safety defect occurs, manufacturers often use product recalls to mitigate potential consequences. Although consumers expect on-time recalls for product defects, anecdotal examples suggest that firms may be passive in investigating potential defects and/or severely delay their recall decisions. Understanding how firms make their recall timing decisions has important business and social implications. Methodology: We study decisions on investigation efforts and recall timings for a profit-maximizing manufacturer by incorporating a Bass diffusion model to capture sales patterns for products with long life cycles. We then test our implications using data from the automobile industry and find supporting evidence. Results: We first find that a firm will consider a delayed recall when the defect is noticed early, when sales suffer more negative impacts from (external) media exposure on a recall, and when the product has a relatively high margin-to-recall-cost ratio. Second, a firm that will consider a delayed recall exerts a smaller investigation effort, and it will further reduce the effort when the defect is more likely to lead to a recall. When we consider the case in which a firm’s learning effect and information updating occur in an investigation and recall process, our results remain consistent. Managerial implications: Our model not only helps us understand how firms make their decisions when defects occur but also offers governments and regulatory bodies new instruments (e.g., investigation efforts, penalty design, information disclosure, firm supervision) to help firms be proactive should a defect occur, thereby reducing potential casualties associated with delays in a recall progress.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Product bundling has been a pervasive marketing strategy, and its success has been largely attributed to its strength in reducing customers’ valuation dispersion. Less is known about the efficacy of bundling in settings where customers are less sure about their valuations for a product, especially when that product is newly launched or has an experience nature, and can conduct costly search to learn the product content and discover their true valuations. In this paper, we investigate the interplay between product bundling and customer search and its implications for a monopolist’s optimal pricing strategy. Academic/practical relevance : The existing search theory has focused on decision making that selects the best among multiple alternatives, with costly search being mandatory for the acquisition of each alternative. In this paper, we introduce a framework of multiproduct demands and nonobligatory search , where customers demanding multiple products strategically decide whether to conduct costly search to resolve valuation uncertainty, while reserving the right to purchase these products without having to search them first. Methodology : We apply a nonobligatory search framework to study two different markets: (1) a market of one mature and one new product, in which valuation uncertainty exists for the new product only; and (2) a market of two new products, in which valuation uncertainty exists for both products. The firm fully anticipates the customers’ search behaviors, determines whether to bundle these products or unbundle them, and optimally sets prices. Results : We show that bundling cultivates search in a market of one mature and one new product, but inhibits search in a market of two new products. This contrast emerges as a result of market structures: Bundling reduces the appeal of search by making the search decisions sequential and path-dependent in the latter market, but is less effective in doing so due to the existing heterogeneity in the former market. Our results thus point to an intricate interplay between customer search, market heterogeneity, and prices and their joint impact on the monopolist’s optimal bundling strategy. We also study mixed bundling and show that its economic benefits only carry through when customers’ search cost is not too large. In this case, mixed bundling can lead to considerable revenue improvement in a market of one mature and one new product, but only tiny revenue improvement in a market of two new products. We also study the joint management of product return and product bundling and show that a positive refund should generally be offered for returned products to stimulate customers’ no-search purchase. Managerial implications : Our paper provides guidance for firms selling multiple experience or new products. We propose product bundling to manage customer search, identifying regimes for its economic benefits and clarifying its implication for customer welfare.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Novel life-improving products, such as solar lanterns and energy-efficient cookstoves address essential needs of consumers in the base of the pyramid (BOP). However, their profitable distribution is often difficult because BOP customers are risk-averse, their ability to pay (ATP) is lower than their willingness to pay, and they face uncertainty regarding these products’ value. Academic/practical relevance : We examine two practical strategies from distributors in the BOP: (1) improving the product’s affordability through a discount and (2) increasing awareness of the product’s value. Our results identify BOP-specific operational trade-offs in implementing these strategies. We also propose strategies to manage these trade-offs that can increase consumer surplus in the BOP. Methodology : We introduce a supply chain model for the BOP and analyze the distributor’s pricing problem with refunds as well as the distributor’s optimal budget allocation between strategies (1) and (2). Results : We find that, in the BOP, the distributor’s profit-maximizing budget allocation often yields the lowest consumer surplus. This misalignment between profits and consumer surplus disappears if customers’ ATP is high. Moreover, the misalignment can be resolved if the distributor offers free product returns and commits to a maximum retail price. We confirm the robustness of our results through numerical simulations. Managerial implications : Best operations strategy practices in the BOP can differ significantly from developed markets. Furthermore, BOP customers’ limited ATP and high risk aversion generate a BOP-specific misalignment between profits and consumer surplus. Operational commitments, such as free returns, reduce this misalignment and can serve as a signal to investors of a social enterprise’s focus on consumer surplus.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We use the guaranteed service (GS) framework to investigate how to coordinate a multiechelon supply chain when two self-interested parties control different parts of the supply chain. For purposes of supply chain planning, we assume that each stage in a supply chain operates with a local base-stock policy and can provide guaranteed service to its customers, as long as the customer demand falls within certain bounds. Academic/practical relevance : The GS framework for supply chain inventory optimization has been deployed successfully in multiple industrial contexts with centralized control. In this paper, we show how to apply this framework to achieve coordination in a decentralized setting in which two parties control different parts of the supply chain. Methodology : The primary methodology is the analysis of a multiechelon supply chain under the assumptions of the GS model. Results : We find that the GS framework is naturally well suited for this decentralized decision making, and we propose a specific contract structure that facilitates such relationships. This contract is incentive compatible and has several other desirable properties. Under assumptions of complete and incomplete information, a reasonable negotiation process should lead the parties to contract terms that coordinate the supply chain. The contract is simpler than contracts proposed for coordination in the stochastic service (SS) framework. We also highlight the role of markup on the holding costs and some of the difficulties that this might cause in coordinating a decentralized supply chain. Managerial implications : The value from the paper is to show that a simple contract coordinates the chain when both parties plan with a GS model and framework; hence, we provide more evidence for the utility of this model. Furthermore, the simple coordinating contract matches reasonably well with practice; we observe that the most common contract terms include a per-unit wholesale price (possibly with a minimum order quantity and/or quantity discounts), along with a service time from order placement until delivery or until ready to ship. We also observe that firms need to pay a higher price if they want better service. What may differ from practice is the contract provision of a demand bound; our contract specifies that the supplier will provide GS as long as the buyer’s order are within the agreed on demand bound. This provision is essential so that each party can apply the GS framework for planning their supply chain. Of course, contracts have many other provisions for handling exceptions. Nevertheless, our research provides some validation for the GS model and the contracting practices we observe in practice.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider the problem faced by a welfare-maximizing service provider who must make a decision on how to split a fixed quantity of resources between two variants of the service: a standard variant and an expedited variant. The service is mandatory, but customers can choose between the two variants. Choosing the expedited variant requires enrollment that incurs a fixed cost per period. Customers are strategic and have the same cost of waiting but are heterogeneous in the rate at which they use the service. Academic/practical relevance : The option of expedited security at U.S. airports (TSA PreCheck) is an instance where this problem arises. As has been the case with the PreCheck program, providers that offer expedited service may face criticism from customers, with the main concern being that the diversion of resources to expedited services increases wait time for regular customers. This has important policy implications for the provider, especially a government organization such as the TSA. Existing literature has focused on service differentiation as a means to maximize profit or overall social welfare, but its effect on individual customers has received little attention. Methodology : We find customer’s equilibrium decisions for any allocation choice made by the provider. Using the equilibrium result, we solve for the allocation choice that maximizes social welfare. Results : Even when customers behave strategically, an expedited service offered in parallel to a standard service cannot only increase overall welfare, but also do so for each customer individually. We also find that in a scenario where some customers lose out because of the expedited service, improving the efficiency of the expedited service is more effective than decreasing the enrollment cost to help those who are worse off. Managerial implications : The gains from offering expedited service do not have to come at the expense of regular customers. When they do, we provide recommendations for which decision levers are most effective at making the system fair.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider the quality competition between two hospitals under the plan of one insurer. The insurer aims to maximize the overall achievable quality in the system by selecting either the fee-for-service (FFS) or the bundled payment (BP) scheme to compensate each hospital. The demand, the costs, and the probability of successfully treating patients depend on a hospital’s chosen quality. Under such a setting, we use game theoretic models to study the choice of insurer and the impact of payment schemes on the equilibrium qualities of hospitals. Our models seek answers to the following questions. Is BP (FFS) payment scheme always associated with high (low) equilibrium quality? What factors affect the equilibrium qualities of competing hospitals and the choice of the insurer and how? Academic/practical relevance : Competing hospitals under same or different payment models from an insurer is rather common for healthcare delivery in the United States. However, there is a lack of understanding about the impact of payment schemes on quality outcomes from both the hospital’s and the insurer’s perspective. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first paper to incorporate competition and the insurer’s perspective to study the impact of different payment models on quality. Methodology : Game theory, equilibrium analysis. Results : We show that BP (FFS) is not always associated with high (low) equilibrium quality and that the equilibrium qualities of the two hospitals are strategic complements. We characterize when the insurer might assign the BP to both hospitals, the FFS to both hospitals, or the BP to one and the FFS to the other hospital. Managerial implications : Our findings provide prescriptive guidelines to an insurer choosing payment models. We also show that a specific quality outcome is achievable not by choosing any payment model but by a careful design of its parameters. Our numerical studies show that hospital readmission reduction initiatives are most effective when run in conjunction with cost reduction initiatives.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This study explores the performance implications of collaboration structures in an integrated healthcare delivery system, namely, an accountable care organization (ACO). ACOs consist of providers from various stages of the care continuum (preacute, acute, and postacute) that voluntarily assume collective responsibility for the quality and cost of care for a defined patient population. Academic/practical relevance : ACOs’ unsatisfied outcomes are largely due to a lack of provider collaboration. There is a dearth of empirical studies on how to develop collaboration structures. Studies in the healthcare operations management primarily have focused on collaboration within a single organization, shedding little light on this problem. We address this issue by exploring two distinct dimensions of collaboration: partnership scope and scale. Partnership scope measures the presence of providers from the preacute, acute, and/or postacute care-continuum stages, whereas partnership scale measures the presence of providers within a single care-continuum stage. Methodology : We assemble a unique data set of provider types, collaboration structures, and system-level performance for 528 Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) ACOs from 2013–2016. To investigate the impact of partnership scope and scale on ACO performance, we then use econometric estimation approaches that account for endogeneity in collaboration structure decisions. ACO performance is measured by experiential quality and 30-day readmission rates. As additional tests, we also investigate our research questions by assembling data sets at both the hospital level (20,975 hospital-year panel data spanning 2009 to 2015) and patient level (859,145 Medicare patients admitted to 39 California hospitals over a four-year period from 2012 to 2015). Results : We find that synergies exist between partnership scope and scale with respect to ACO performance. Specifically, an average-sized ACO can realize 3.2% more improvement in experiential quality and a 6.6% greater reduction in 30-day readmission rates through partnership scope and scale synergies in the preacute care stage. We also show that the benefits of increasing partnership scope are consistent across providers and patient-level analysis. Further, we find that these benefits come at some cost, suggesting an initial cost-quality trade-off when developing collaboration structures. Managerial implications : Our results offer important insights into the healthcare operations management literature on designing effective healthcare delivery systems extending beyond a single organization.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : With heightened global uncertainty, supply chain managers are under increasing pressure to craft strategies that accommodate both supply and demand risks. Although product flexibility is a well-understood strategy to accommodate risk, there is no clear guidance on the optimal flexibility configuration of a supply network that comprises both unreliable primary suppliers and reliable backup suppliers. Academic/practical relevance : Existing literature examines the value of flexibility with primary and backup suppliers independently. For a risk-neutral firm, research shows that (a) incorporating flexibility in a primary supplier by replacing two dedicated ones (in absence of backup supply) is always beneficial and that (b) adding flexibility to a reliable backup supplier (in absence of product flexibility in primary suppliers) is always valuable. It is unclear, however, how flexibility should be incorporated into a supply network with both unreliable primary suppliers and reliable backup suppliers. This research studies whether flexibility should be incorporated in a primary supplier, a backup supplier, or both. Methodology : We develop a normative model to analyze when flexibility benefits and when it hurts. Results : Compared with a base case of no flexibility, we prove that incorporating flexibility in either primary or backup suppliers is always beneficial. However, incorporating flexibility in both primary and backup suppliers can be counterproductive because the supply chain performance can decline with saturated flexibility, even if flexibility is costless. A key reason is that the risk-aggregation effect of consolidating flexibility in an unreliable supplier becomes more salient when flexibility is already embedded in a backup supplier. Managerial implications : This research refines the existing understanding of flexibility by illustrating that flexibility is not always beneficial. When there is a choice, a firm should prioritize incorporating flexibility in a reliable backup supplier.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Process innovation is commonly claimed to be a major source of competitive advantage for firms. Despite this perceived influence, it has received substantially less attention than product innovation, and much uncertainty remains about its true association with firm performance. We investigate the relationship between a pharmaceutical firm’s portfolio of manufacturing process innovations and its economic performance. Academic/practical relevance : We uniquely conduct a multidimensional evaluation of a firm’s portfolio of manufacturing process innovations at the product level. This allows a quantitative evaluation of both the relative benefit of the different dimensions of a portfolio as well as the potential complementarities between these in different technological landscapes. Methodology : Through a collaboration with expert patent attorneys, we develop a unique longitudinal data set that combines secondary data and evaluations of a firm’s portfolio of process patents along two key dimensions: novelty and scope. We conduct econometric analyses for a large-scale sample of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) whose product patents have expired and for which process innovation is thus the main source of competitive advantage. Results : We find a positive association between the presence of manufacturing process innovation and firm performance. However, although portfolio’s scope appears to always be beneficial to performance, the effect of novelty alone depends on the ruggedness of the technological landscape: negative in smoother landscapes and positive in more rugged landscapes. Results further suggest that novelty and scope of a portfolio of process innovations are complementary across technological landscapes. Managerial implications : Our results provide important practical insights that can inform the organization and execution of the research and development process across high-technology industries. In particular, although process innovations can be economically beneficial, investing in high-novelty process innovations without a corresponding high scope could jeopardize payoffs, especially in technological landscapes that are relatively smooth.},

We model the SSC as a multiclass M / M / c queueing system subject to service-level constraints.

One key issue in fostering collaboration is the allocation of costs among different firms. Methodology : To incentivize collaboration, we investigate cost allocation rules for the SSC by applying concepts from cooperative game theory. Results : To empower our analysis, we show that a cooperative game with polymatroid optimization can be analyzed via simple auxiliary games. By exploiting the polymatroidal structures of the multiclass queueing systems, we show when the games possess a core allocation. We explore the extent to which our results remain valid for some general cases.

  abstract     = {Problem definition: We study the bullwhip effect and analyze the impact of human behavior. We separate rational ordering in response to increasing incoming orders from irrational ordering. Academic/practical relevance: Prior research has shown that the bullwhip effect occurs in about two-thirds of firms and impacts profitability by 10%–30%. Most bullwhip mitigation efforts emphasize processes such as information sharing, collaboration, and coordination. Previous work has not been able to separate the impact of behavioral ordering from rational increases in order quantities. Methodology: Using data from a laboratory experiment, we estimate behavioral parameters from three ordering models. We use a simulation to evaluate the cost impact of bullwhip behavior on the supply chain and by echelon. Results: We find that cost increases are not equally shared. Human biases (behavioral ordering) at the retailer results in higher relative costs elsewhere in the supply chain, even as similar ordering by a wholesaler, distributor, or factory results in increased costs within that echelon. These results are consistent regardless of the behavioral models that we consider. The cognitive profile of the decision maker impacts both echelon and supply chain costs. We show that the cost impact is higher as more decision makers enter a supply chain. Managerial implications: The cost of behavioral ordering is not consistent across the supply chain. Managers can use the estimation/simulation framework to analyze the impact of human behavior in their supply chains and evaluate improvement efforts such as coordination or information sharing. Our results show that behavioral ordering by a retailer has an out-sized impact on supply chain costs, which suggests that upstream echelons are better placed to make forecasting and replenishment decisions.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study a supply chain in which a supplier sets the wholesale price and a retailer responds with an order quantity. Both of the two firms can be either risk-neutral—maximizing the expected profit—or target-oriented, which is to maximize her or his ability to reach a target profit. Academic/practical relevance : Our work not only sheds light on the benefit/loss of trading with target-oriented decision makers but also, adds new knowledge to the supply chain coordination literature. Methodology : We provide strong support for firms’ target-based preference and the linear target formation model through a survey as well as analyzing company data. With the firms’ target-oriented behavior evaluated by a CVaR-satisficing measure, we apply a game theoretical framework to investigate how the target-based preference affects supply chain performance. Results : A firm, be it a supplier or a retailer, is always hurt by its target-based preference but can benefit from its trading partner’s target-based preference. A risk-neutral supplier, for example, can sometimes reap the whole supply chain’s profit if the retailer is target-oriented, and a target-oriented supplier always performs better with a target-oriented retailer than a risk-neutral one. Furthermore, a target-oriented retailer and/or supplier can help alleviate the double-marginalization effect and with a specific target, can help the supply chain achieve the same efficiency level as in a risk-neutral centralized system, with just a wholesale price contract. Another important finding is that if both firms are target-oriented, then the supply chain can have a higher expected profit under a decentralized system than a centralized one. This contrasts with the case when both firms are risk-neutral. We also investigate the role of outside option and retailer-type misidentification and find that both can alleviate the retailer’s disadvantage of being target-oriented. Managerial implications : (i) The target-based preference can be exploited by the trading partner, and hence, a firm should adopt the target-oriented decision criterion with caution. (ii) A target-oriented retailer can explore strategies such as revealing his outside option or hiding his target-based preference in order to be less manipulated. (iii) Whether a firm (and the supply chain) can benefit from its trading partner’s target-based preference often depends on how ambitious the trading partner (and the firm itself if it is target-oriented) sets the target. (iv) Target-based preference of one or both firms can help the supply chain reach the first-best efficiency. (v) When both firms are target-oriented, decentralization can be preferred to centralization.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper investigates the issue of sharing the private demand information of a manufacturer that sells a product to retailers competing on prices and service efforts. Academic/practical relevance : In the existing literature, which ignores service effort competition, it is known that demand signaling induces an informed manufacturer to distort the wholesale price downward, which benefits the retailers, and so, they do not have any incentive to receive the manufacturer’s private information. In practice, many manufacturers share demand information with their retailers that compete on prices and service efforts (e.g., demand-enhancing retail activities), a setting that has not received much attention from the literature. Methodology : We develop a game-theoretic model with one manufacturer selling to two competing retailers and solve for the equilibrium of the game. Results : We show how an informed manufacturer may distort the wholesale price upward or downward to signal demand information to the retailers, depending on the cost of service effort, the intensity of effort competition, and the number of uninformed retailers. We fully characterize the impact of such wholesale price distortion on the firms’ incentive to share information and derive the conditions under which the manufacturer shares information with none, one, or both of the retailers. We derive conditions under which a higher cost of service effort makes the retailers or the manufacturer better off. Managerial implications : Our results provide novel insights about how service effort competition impacts the incentives for firms in a supply chain to share a manufacturer’s private demand information. For instance, when the cost of effort is high or service effort competition is intense, a manufacturer should share information with none or some, but not all, of the retailers.},

Academic/practical relevance: We are the first to comprehensively study ad hoc and forward multiple-sourcing negotiations for food importing.

Methodology: We develop an analytical negotiation model in the Nash bargaining framework and adopt the Nash-in-Nash framework to analyze multiple-sourcing negotiations. Results: We find that while forward negotiations are not necessarily better than ad hoc negotiations for the buyer, it would be true with sufficiently many suppliers. When facing a supplier pool, we show that it may be optimal to mix forward and ad hoc suppliers. In general, fewer suppliers should be assigned as ad hoc as the pool size increases. We also find that adding a hybrid supplier (engaged in a forward negotiation with an ad hoc negotiation as the fallback option) may be better or worse than adding a forward supplier in the presence of other suppliers. Managerial implications: Our findings inform how a food importer should strategically utilize ad hoc and forward negotiations with its suppliers to improve the outcome.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We analyze a firm that sells repeatedly to a customer population over multiple periods. Although this setting has been studied extensively in the context of dynamic pricing —selling the same product in each period at a varying price—we consider intertemporal content variation , wherein the price is the same in every period, but the firm varies the content available over time. Customers learn their utility on purchasing and decide whether to purchase again in subsequent periods. The firm faces a budget for the total amount of content available during a finite planning horizon, and allocates content to maximize revenue. Academic/practical relevance : A number of new business models, including video streaming services and curated subscription boxes, face the situation we model. Our results show how such firms can use content variation to increase their revenues. Methodology : We employ an analytical model in which customers decide to purchase in multiple successive periods and a firm determines a content allocation policy to maximize revenue. Results : Using a lower bound approximation to the problem for a horizon of general length T , we show that, although the optimal allocation policy is not, in general, constant over time, it is monotone: content value increases over time if customer heterogeneity is low and decreases otherwise. We demonstrate that the optimal policy for this lower bound problem is either optimal or very close to optimal for the general T period problem. Furthermore, for the case of T = 2 periods, we show how two critical factors—the fraction of “new” versus “repeat” customers in the population and the size of the content budget—affect the optimal allocation policy and the importance of varying content value over time. Managerial implications : We show how firms that sell at a fixed price over multiple periods can vary content value over time to increase revenues.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition: Omnichannel retailing has led to the use of traditional stores as fulfillment centers for online orders. Omnichannel fulfillment problems have two components: (1) accepting a certain number of online orders prior to seeing store demands and (2) satisfying (or filling) some of these accepted online demands as efficiently as possible with any leftover inventory after store demands have been met. Hence, there is a fundamental trade-off between store cancellations of accepted online orders and potentially increased profits because of more acceptances of online orders. We study this joint problem of online order acceptance and fulfillment (including cancellations) to minimize total costs, including shipping charges and cancellation penalties in single-period and limited multiperiod settings. Academic/practical relevance: Despite the growing importance of omnichannel fulfillment via online orders, our work provides the first study incorporating cancellation penalties along with fulfillment costs. Methodology: We build a two-stage stochastic model. In the first stage, the retailer sets a policy specifying which online orders it will accept. The second stage represents the process of fulfilling online orders after the uncertain quantities of in-store purchases are revealed. We analyze threshold policies that accept online orders as long as the inventories are above a global threshold, a local threshold per region, or a hybrid. Results: For a single period, total costs are unimodal as a function of the global threshold and unimodal as a function of a single local threshold holding all other local thresholds at constant values, motivating a gradient search algorithm. Reformulating as an appropriate linear program with network flow structure, we estimate the derivative (using infinitesimal perturbation analysis) of the total cost as a function of the thresholds. We validate the performance of the threshold policies empirically using data from a high-end North American retailer. Our two-location experiments demonstrate that local thresholds perform better than global thresholds in a wide variety of settings. Conversely, in a narrow region with negatively correlated online demand between locations and very low shipping costs, global threshold outperforms local thresholds. A hybrid policy only marginally improves on the better of the two. In multiple periods, we study one- and two-location models and provide insights into effective solution methods for the general case. Managerial implications: Our methods provide effective algorithms to manage fulfillment costs for online orders, demonstrating a significant reduction over policies that treat each location separately and reflecting the significant advantage of incorporating shipping in computing thresholds. Numerical studies provide insights as to why local thresholds perform well in a wide variety of situations.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper examines whether and, if so, how much an online–off-line return partnership between online and third-party retailers with physical stores (or “location partners”) generates additional value to location partners. Academic/practical relevance : Online shoppers often prefer to return products to stores rather than mailing them back. Many online retailers have recently started to collaborate with location partners to offer the store return option to their customers, and we quantify its economic benefit to a location partner. Methodology : We analyze proprietary data sets from Happy Returns (which provides return services for more than 30 online retailers) and one of its location partners, using a panel difference-in-differences model. In our study, a treatment is the initiation of the return service at each of the location partner’s stores, and an outcome is the store and online channel performance of the location partner. We then explore the mechanisms of underlying customer behavior that drive these outcomes. Results : We find that the partnership increases the number of unique customers, items sold, and net revenue in both store and online channels. We identify two drivers for this improved performance: (1) the location partner acquires new customers in both store and online channels, and (2) existing customers change their shopping patterns only in the store channel after using the return service; in particular, they visit stores more often, purchase more items, and generate higher revenue after their first return service. Managerial implications : To our knowledge, we provide the first direct empirical evidence of value to location partners from a return partnership, and as these partnerships become more prevalent, our findings have important managerial implications for location partners and online retailers alike.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition: Our research is motivated by the product expiration problem in consumer packaged goods retailing, which creates substantial landfill waste and drains firm profits. We analyze shipment policies (i.e., the rules to determine the quantity and age composition of inventory to ship from a warehouse to a retail location) and their impact on profits and waste. Academic/practical relevance : The same firm often bears the cost of expiration at the warehouse and the retail store, which is why the problem necessitates a supply chain perspective. The ship oldest first ( SOF ) policy (commonly referred to as first in, first out) is advocated by industry experts to manage product shelf lives. Although its optimality in a single location is well established in the literature, it has not been studied in the context of a two-stage supply chain. Methodology : We conduct empirical analysis on a real-life data set to motivate the relevance of our problem. Then, we formulate an infinite horizon dynamic programming problem with stochastic demand for which we obtain analytical and numerical results. Results : The SOF policy is found to always minimize waste at the warehouse and total waste (warehouse and retail level combined) and under certain practically unlikely conditions, to maximize profits. However, in most practical applications, it is suboptimal, and the optimal policy is shown to have a complex structure. We analyze deterministic and myopic versions of our problem in order to generate insights on the trade-off between the issuing cost and the expiration cost. Then, we develop heuristic policies based on the myopic analysis of the problem, which are shown to perform well in terms of profits, waste, and product freshness; in our numerical analysis, the best such heuristic yields a median optimality gap of 9.5% versus 21% for SOF , pantry life of 69% versus 56% for SOF , and retail waste of 4% versus 10% for SOF . Managerial implications : The SOF policy is shown to generate high waste at the retail store, where waste is more likely to be disposed of at landfills as opposed to being donated; therefore, it may have an adverse impact on the environment. Our results also show that it is not effective at managing shelf lives in the supply chain, contrary to what practitioners argue, as evidenced by poor pantry life leading to excessive waste at the household level. Our analysis also questions the value of flow-through stocking systems to facilitate SOF as we show that firms can gain much more from improving their issuing policies.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study how the government should design the subsidy policy to promote electric vehicle (EV) adoptions effectively and efficiently when there might be a spatial mismatch between the supply and demand of charging piles. Academic/practical relevance : EV charging infrastructures are often built by third-party service providers (SPs). However, profit-maximizing SPs might prefer to locate the charging piles in the suburbs versus downtown because of lower costs although most EV drivers prefer to charge their EVs downtown given their commuting patterns and the convenience of charging in downtown areas. This conflict of spatial preferences between SPs and EV drivers results in high overall costs for EV charging and weak EV adoptions. Methodology : We use a stylized game-theoretic model and compare three types of subsidy policies: (i) subsidizing EV purchases, (ii) subsidizing SPs based on pile usage, and (iii) subsidizing SPs based on pile numbers. Results : Subsidizing EV purchases is effective in promoting EV adoptions but not in alleviating the spatial mismatch. In contrast, subsidizing SPs can be more effective in addressing the spatial mismatch and promoting EV adoptions, but uniformly subsidizing pile installation can exacerbate the spatial mismatch and backfire. In different situations, each policy can emerge as the best, and the rule to determine which side (SPs versus EV buyers) to subsidize largely depends on cost factors in the charging market rather than the EV price or the environmental benefits. Managerial implications : A “jigsaw-piece rule” is recommended to guide policy design: subsidizing SPs is preferred if charging is too costly or time consuming, and subsidizing EV purchases is preferred if charging is sufficiently fast and easy. Given charging costs that are neither too low nor too high, subsidizing SPs is preferred only if pile building downtown is moderately more expensive than pile building in the suburbs.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We address the problem of how to estimate lost sales for substitutable products when there is no reliable on-shelf availability (OSA) information. Academic/practical relevance : We develop a novel approach to estimating lost sales using only sales data, a market share estimate, and an estimate of overall availability. We use the method to illustrate the negative consequences of using potentially inaccurate inventory records as indicators of availability. Methodology : We suggest a partially hidden Markov model of OSA to generate probabilistic choice sets and incorporate these probabilistic choice sets into the estimation of a multinomial logit demand model using a nested expectation-maximization algorithm. We highlight the importance of considering inventory reliability problems first through simulation and then by applying the procedure to a data set from a major U.S. retailer. Results : The simulations show that the method converges in seconds and produces estimates with similar or lower bias than state-of-the-art benchmarks. For the product category under consideration at the retailer, our procedure finds lost sales of around 3.0% compared with 0.2% when relying on the inventory record as an indicator of availability. Managerial implications : The method efficiently computes estimates that can be used to improve inventory management and guide managers on how to use their scarce resources to improve stocking execution. The research also shows that ignoring inventory record inaccuracies when estimating lost sales can produce substantially inaccurate estimates, which leads to incorrect parameters in supply chain planning.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : International humanitarian organizations (IHOs) prepare a detailed annual allocation plan for operations that are conducted in the countries they serve. The annual plan is strongly affected by the available financial budget. The budget of IHOs is derived from donations, which are typically limited, uncertain, and to a large extent earmarked for specific countries or programs. These factors, together with the specific utility function of IHOs, render budgeting for IHOs a challenging managerial problem. In this paper, we develop an approach to optimize budget allocation plans for each country of operations. Academic/practical relevance : The current research provides a better understanding of the budgeting problem in IHOs given the increasing interest of the operations management community for nonprofit operations. Methodology : We model the problem as a two-stage stochastic optimization model with a concave utility function and identify a number of analytical properties for the problem. We develop an efficient generalized Benders decomposition algorithm as well as a fast heuristic. Results : Using data from the International Committee of the Red Cross, our results indicate 21.3% improvement in the IHO’s utility by adopting stochastic programming instead of the expected value solution. Moreover, our solution approach is computationally more efficient than other approaches. Managerial implications : Our analysis highlights the importance of nonearmarked donations for the overall performance of IHOs. We also find that putting pressure on IHOs to fulfill the targeted missions (e.g., by donors or media) results in lower beneficiaries’ welfare. Moreover, the IHOs benefit from negative correlation among donations. Finally, our findings indicate that, if donors allow the IHO to allocate unused earmarked donations to other delegations, the performance of the IHO improves significantly.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper investigates the channel choice problem of an online platform that exerts service effort to enhance the demand in its sales channels. Academic/practical relevance : In the existing literature on the channel structure of an online retail platform, it is usually assumed that a manufacturer sells through either the platform’s agency or reselling channel but not both. In practice, many manufacturers sell the same products through both channels of the same online retail platform, a phenomenon that cannot be explained by the existing theory. Moreover, online retail platforms routinely invest in retail services that enhance the demand in their sales channels. Methodology : We develop a game-theoretic model to investigate the equilibrium channel choice, wholesale price, and retail quantity decisions. We also conduct sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of some parameters on the equilibrium. Results : We derive conditions under which each of the three channel structures (agency channel, reselling channel, and dual channel) emerges in equilibrium. We show that the wholesale price in the reselling channel is reduced because of the addition of the agency channel even when both channels are equally efficient, which extends the wholesale price effect because of the addition of a less efficient direct channel in the supplier encroachment literature. Our analysis highlights the flexibility of a dual channel for firms to shift sales between the two channels, which could increase the retail platform’s incentive to exert service effort. Managerial implications : Our study provides useful insights to managers to understand and make channel choice decisions in supply chains with manufacturers selling through online retail platforms.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study a joint product framing and order fulfillment problem with both inventory and cardinality constraints faced by an e-commerce retailer. There is a finite selling horizon and no replenishment opportunity. In each period, the retailer needs to decide how to “frame” (i.e., display, rank, price) each product on his or her website as well as how to fulfill a new demand. Academic/practical relevance : E-commerce retail is known to suffer from thin profit margins. Using the data from a major U.S. retailer, we show that jointly planning product framing and order fulfillment can have a significant impact on online retailers’ profitability. This is a technically challenging problem as it involves both inventory and cardinality constraints. In this paper, we make progress toward resolving this challenge. Methodology : We use techniques such as randomized algorithms and graph-based algorithms to provide a tractable solution heuristic that we analyze through asymptotic analysis. Results : Our proposed randomized heuristic policy is based on the solution of a deterministic approximation to the stochastic control problem. The key challenge is in constructing a randomization scheme that is easy to implement and that guarantees the resulting policy is asymptotically optimal. We propose a novel two-step randomization scheme based on the idea of matrix decomposition and a rescaling argument. Managerial implications : Our numerical tests show that the proposed policy is very close to optimal, can be applied to large-scale problems in practice, and highlights the value of jointly optimizing product framing and order fulfillment decisions. When inventory across the network is imbalanced, the widespread practice of planning product framing without considering its impact on fulfillment can result in high shipping costs, regardless of the fulfillment policy used. Our proposed policy significantly reduces shipping costs by using product framing to manage demand so that it occurs close to the location of the inventory.},

Are competing platforms helped or harmed by platforms’ obtaining access to AVs? Are the humans who participate on the platforms—driver-workers and rider-consumers (hereafter, agents)—collectively helped or harmed by the platforms’ access to AVs? How do the conditions under which access to AVs reduces platform profits, agent welfare, and social welfare depend on the AV ownership structure (i.e., whether platforms or individuals own AVs)? Academic/practical relevanc e: AVs have the potential to transform the economics of ride-hailing, with welfare consequences for platforms, agents, and society. Methodology : We employ a game-theoretic model that captures platforms’ price, wage, and AV fleet size decisions. Results : We characterize necessary and sufficient conditions under which platforms’ access to AVs reduces platform profit, agent welfare, and social welfare. The structural effect of access to AVs on agent welfare is robust regardless of AV ownership; agent welfare decreases if and only if the AV cost is high. In contrast, the structural effect of access to AVs on platform profit depends on who owns AVs. The necessary and sufficient condition under which access to AVs decreases platform profit is high AV cost under platform-owned AVs and low AV cost under individually owned AVs. Similarly, the structural effect of access to AVs on social welfare depends on who owns AVs. Access to individually owned AVs increases social welfare; in contrast, access to platform-owned AVs decreases social welfare—if and only if the AV cost is high.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Condition monitoring (CM) of durable assets, whereby sensors continuously monitor the health of an asset, is heralded as a key application of the Internet of Things. However, questions about ownership of the sensor data are seen as a key barrier to adoption. We model an after-sales supply chain in which the asset manufacturer provides maintenance and repair services to a customer that operates the asset. The asset condition deteriorates in a stochastic fashion and will eventually fail if not repaired. Methodology/results : We analyze a performance-based contracting problem considering manufacturer maintenance effort (the condition at which preventive maintenance is performed) and customer operating effort (which reduces the rate of condition deterioration). With information asymmetry on the customer’s effort cost, we analyze this contracting problem in a principal-agent model with double moral hazard. In the centralized setting, we establish that the benefit of CM increases and then decreases in the asset’s deterioration rate and that CM may increase or decrease the benefit of customer effort depending on the deterioration rate. In the decentralized setting, we prove that CM always benefits the manufacturer and the supply chain, but it may hurt the customer if the asset reliability is sufficiently high. Managerial implications : These results have important implications for the effect of sensor-data ownership. The manufacturer will adopt CM if it owns the data, but the customer may block CM adoption if it owns the data. We show that this CM adoption barrier can be overcome by the manufacturer offering to pay an appropriate data access fee. However, under this arrangement, the manufacturer may not benefit from a more-effective customer operating effort. We discuss the resulting implication on the manufacturer’s product design and the business model between selling and leasing.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Diabetes is a highly prevalent and expensive chronic disease that affects millions of Americans and is associated with multiple comorbidities. Clinical research has found long-term variation in a patient’s glycated hemoglobin levels to be linked with adverse health outcomes, such as increased hospitalizations. Consequently, there is a need for innovative approaches to reduce long-term glycemic variability and efficient ways to implement them. Academic/practical relevance : Although the operations literature has extensively explored ways to manage variability across patients, relatively little attention has been paid to within-patient variability. We draw on the management and healthcare literatures to hypothesize and then show that a key operational lever—continuity of care (CoC)—can be used to reduce glycemic variability, which in turn, improves patient health. In the process, we explore the moderating role of a key demographic characteristic: patient’s marital status. We also shed light on an important mechanism through which CoC reduces variability—adherence of patients to prescribed medications—thereby advancing the compliance literature. Academically, our study adds to the understanding of the importance of managing variability (via continuity in service) in settings where customers repeatedly interact with service providers. Methodology : We use a detailed and comprehensive data set from the Veterans Health Administration, the largest integrated healthcare delivery system in the United States. This permits us to control for potential sources of heterogeneity. We analyze more than 300,000 patients—over an 11-year period—with diabetes, a chronic disease whose successful management requires managing glycemic variability. We use an empirical approach to, first, quantify the relationship between CoC and glycemic variability and second, show how this relationship differs based on patient’s marital status. Third, we estimate the mediation effect of patients’ adherence to medications. Finally, we quantify how glycemic variability mediates the relationship between CoC and three important outcomes. Our findings are validated by extensive robustness checks and sensitivity analyses. Results : We find that CoC is related to reductions in glycemic variability, more so for patients who are not married. However, this reduction is not linear in continuity; we find evidence of curvilinearity but with a sufficiently high stationary point so that benefits almost always accrue, albeit at a diminishing rate. Additionally, we find that one mechanism through which CoC may reduce variability is through patients’ adherence to medications. We also find evidence of partial mediation for glycemic variability in the CoC outcomes process chain. Our counterfactual analysis reveals the extent of improvement that enhanced continuity can bring, depending on where it is targeted. Managerial implications : Identifying the process measures through which continuity of care reduces variability is of interest to practitioners and policy makers as it can help design appropriate policies and pathways in terms of both processes and staffing/work allocation.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : There is a concerted effort across multiple academic disciplines to understand the recall decision-making process. Specifically, what steps does a manufacturer take following a product defect discovery and resulting in the product recall decision? This effort has often been limited to case studies within a particular manufacturer, largely due to the absence of consistent and comparable data across firms. Methodology/results : This data paper provides a foundation for future research on recall decisions by processing and coding textual disclosures on 2,120 recalls initiated in the United States by 27 automobile manufacturers from 2009 to 2018. For each recall, the data set provides the time the firm took to make the recall decision by comparing the defect awareness date to the recall decision date, whether the recall was associated with a supplier, the number of events in the recall decision-making process, and the date and description of each event. Managerial implications : Not only can these data enhance product recall research by providing key recall decision-making variables unavailable in related research, but an additional indication of the value of our data set also comes from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the automobile regulator in the United States. We held discussions with a senior leader at the NHTSA’s Recall Management Division related to this data set. This discussion revealed that the NHTSA does not have these data in an analyzable form and that they might be interested in using our data set for their reports, such as the NHTSA’s biennial reports to the U.S. Congress. This signal suggests that regulators, as well as researchers, practitioners, and other safety advocates, may find our data set useful.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We explore consumer equilibrium and efficiency in group buying events, in which the unit price for a good or service decreases with higher number of consumer sign-ups. Specifically, we study the following questions: (i) How does the dynamic consumer sign-up equilibrium evolve during these events? (ii) Is there empirical evidence that employing group buying increases demand? If so, by how much? (iii) Are there profit gains from employing this mechanism and how can they be improved? Academic/practical relevance : Group buying events are becoming increasingly popular in certain markets, especially in China. Our study contributes to better understanding of this innovative pricing mechanism and its effects on demand and profits, and can help with more effective implementation in practice. Methodology : We build a continuous-time dynamic game theoretical model to study consumer behavior and solve for its equilibrium. We then apply it to data obtained from group buying events employed by a large retailer and use structural regression methods and data clustering to estimate and evaluate demand and profit effects. Results : We demonstrate that our theoretical equilibrium is a good fit for the observed consumer behavior. We empirically show that group buying discounts are not very effective in boosting demand for very low and very high base demand levels but can significantly improve demand for intermediate levels. We estimate that employing group buying improved the retailer’s product demand and profits by 16.6% and 11.1%, respectively, and with better price and discount selections, it can improve profits by more than 30% on average.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Providing fast and reliable delivery services is key to running a successful online retail business. To achieve a better delivery time guarantee policy, we study how to estimate and promise delivery time for new customer orders in real time. Academic/practical relevance : Delivery time promising is critical to managing customer expectations and improving customer satisfaction. Simply overpromising or underpromising is undesirable because of the negative impacts on short-/long-term sales. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to develop a data-driven framework to predict the distribution of order delivery time and set promised delivery time to customers in a cost-effective way. Methodology : We apply and extend tree-based models to generate distributional forecasts by exploiting the complicated relationship between delivery time and relevant operational predictors. To account for the cost-sensitive decision-making problem structure, we develop a new split rule for quantile regression forests that incorporates an asymmetric loss function in split point selection. We further propose a cost-sensitive decision rule to decide the promised delivery day from the predicted distribution. Results : Our decision rule is proven to be optimal given certain cost structures. Tested on a real-world data set shared from JD.com, our proposed machine learning–based models deliver superior forecasting performance. In addition, we demonstrate that our framework has the potential to provide better promised delivery time in terms of sales, cost, and accuracy as compared with the conventional promised time set by JD.com. Specifically, our simulation results indicate that the proposed delivery time promise policy can improve the sales volume by 6.1% over the current policy. Managerial implications : Through a more accurate estimation of the delivery time distribution, online retailers can strategically set the promised time to maximize customer satisfaction and boost sales. Our data-driven framework reveals the importance of modeling fulfillment operations in delivery time forecasting and integrating the decision-making problem structure with the forecasting model.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper examines the economic effects of the fulfillment services offered by Amazon (FBA) to the third-party sellers on its retail platform. Academic/practical relevance : Logistics is critical for e-commerce. It is intriguing that the third-party sellers that use FBA may directly compete with Amazon. By FBA, their service levels are substantially improved and so is their competitiveness. Such a phenomenon has been little investigated in prior literature. Methodology : We develop a strategic competition model where Amazon and a representative third-party seller engage in both price and service competition. Results : Interestingly, we find that although FBA may intensify the service competition between Amazon and the third-party seller, it can mitigate their price competition besides the direct revenue Amazon collects from the service. The latter effects dominate the former when the cross-service sensitivity of the consumers is either sufficiently low or sufficiently high. Therefore, not only the third-party sellers but also Amazon may benefit from FBA. Moreover, because the sales of Amazon’s products may increase because of FBA, its OEM (original equipment manufacturer) supplier may gain from FBA also. These findings extend to the settings where the third-party seller is Amazon’s OEM supplier, cross-price and cross-service sensitivities are correlated, or the parties set their retail prices sequentially. Managerial implications : Our analysis provides insights about when FBA is more likely to be beneficial and when it can be harmful. They are useful for understanding the impacts of FBA on both Amazon and the third-party sellers.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper investigates the impact of COVID-19 on e-commerce sales and the underlying operational driver. Academic/practical relevance : As COVID-19 continues to disrupt offline retail, anecdotal evidence suggests a rapid growth of e-commerce. However, the pandemic may also significantly decrease offline logistics capacity, which in turn decreases e-commerce sales. Then, how does e-commerce respond to COVID-19, and what are the corresponding opportunities and challenges? Methodology : We leverage e-commerce sales data from Alibaba and construct a city-day panel across three years, representing sales for all buyers and sellers on the platform across 339 cities in mainland China. We develop three identification strategies to estimate the overall impact of COVID-19 (based on a year-on-year comparison), the impact of COVID-19 intensity (based on the different number of cases across cities), and the impact of corresponding containment measures (leveraging policy changes of checkpoint, partial shutdown, and complete shutdown measures across cities). Results : We provide two key findings. First, across different identification strategies, we observe a common drop and recovery pattern, which illustrates the digital resilience of e-commerce during the pandemic. For example, we estimate an overall decrease of 22% in e-commerce sales during the period of the Wuhan shutdown (January 23–April 7, 2020). However, it recovers in most cities within five weeks. Second, we identify a key operational driver— logistics capacity —that significantly explains the decline and recovery of e-commerce sales during and after the outbreak. Managerial implications : We provide important evidence on how e-commerce responds to and recovers from COVID-19, contrary to the common perception. The evidence in the recovery phase can also inform platforms and policymakers to design digital strategies and invest in logistics infrastructure.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We present a data-driven pricing problem motivated from our collaboration with a satellite service provider. In particular, we study a variant of the two-part tariff pricing scheme. The firm offers a set of data plans consisting of a bundle of data at a fixed price plus additional data at a variable price. Most literature on two-part tariff problems focuses on models that assume full information. However, little attention has been devoted to this problem from a data-driven perspective without full information. One of the main challenges when working with data comes from missing data. Methodology/results : First, we develop a new method to address the missing data problem, which comes from different sources: (i) the number of unobserved customers, (ii) customers’ willingness to pay (WTP), and (iii) demand from unobserved customers. We introduce an iteration procedure to maximize the likelihood by combining the expectation maximization algorithm with a gradient ascent method. We also formulate the pricing optimization problem as a dynamic program (DP) using a discretized set of prices. From applying Sample Average Approximation, the DP obtains a solution within 3.8% of the optimal solution of the sampled instances, on average, and within 18% with 95% confidence from the optimal solution of the exact problem. By extending the DP formulation, we show that it is better to optimize on prices rather than bundles, obtaining revenues close to optimizing jointly on both. Managerial implications : The sensitivity analysis of the problem parameters is key for decision makers to understand the risks of their pricing decisions. Indeed, assuming a higher variability of customers’ WTP induces higher revenue risks. In addition, revenues are barely (highly) sensitive to the customers’ assumed WTP variability when considering a high (low) number of unobserved customers. Finally, we extend the model to incorporate price-dependent consumption.},

We provide a rigorous performance evaluation of DRL in three classic and intractable inventory problems: lost sales, dual sourcing, and multi-echelon inventory management. Methodology : We model each inventory problem as a Markov decision process and apply and tune the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) DRL algorithm for a variety of parameter settings. Results : We demonstrate that the A3C algorithm can match the performance of the state-of-the-art heuristics and other approximate dynamic programming methods. Although the initial tuning was computationally demanding and time demanding, only small changes to the tuning parameters were needed for the other studied problems. Managerial implications : Our study provides evidence that DRL can effectively solve stationary inventory problems. This is especially promising when problem-dependent heuristics are lacking. Yet, generating structural policy insight or designing specialized policies that are (ideally provably) near optimal remains desirable.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Adoption and continued use of novel technologies have the potential to significantly accelerate social and economic development in emerging markets. In this paper, we examine to what extent timely after-sales service—that is, faster resolution of repair tasks—impacts technology adoption. In particular, we empirically assess the impact of service wait times on the adoption of solar home systems by first-time users (i.e., adopters of the technology) in off-grid Uganda. Academic/practical relevance : Our study sheds light on a previously understudied driver of technology adoption—customers’ postpurchase experience related to after-sales service. We also provide evidence on how negative word-of-mouth stemming from long service wait times hampers customer acquisition. Methodology : We address our research question using detailed customer-level sales and service data from a leading assembler and distributor of solar home systems in Uganda. We develop a fixed-effects base specification and two instrumental variables specifications that leverage different sources of exogenous geospatial variation—in service-task locations, weather, and road quality. Results : We find that timely after-sales service experienced by existing customers is a strong driver of adoption by first-time users. A one-week increase in average wait time for service decreases adoption by up to 32.4%. The relationship between wait times and adoptions is heterogeneous and depends on the types of pending service cases. We also find that the number of customers acquired through referrals from an existing customer depends on the referring customer’s service wait time. This provides evidence of a strong word-of-mouth channel of information sharing. Managerial implications : Our findings have direct implications for the customer-acquisition strategies of technology firms and for technology investors in emerging markets. Our results are also relevant for policy makers who aim to harness technology to improve the socioeconomic lives of people living in these regions. Importantly, we provide empirical evidence of a direct link between after-sales service and technology adoption, which is of relevance to managers outside of emerging markets as well.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Despite the widespread adoption of environmental management systems (EMS), their relationship with energy efficiency remains unclear. This study investigates whether and how EMS adoption lowers energy efficiency and, if so, how to mitigate the impact. Academic/practical relevance : Understanding the relationship between EMS and energy efficiency is important because any decrease in energy efficiency may eventually lead to undesired environmental outputs (e.g., CO 2 ), potentially contributing to climate change. This study sheds light on energy as a necessary input required for environmental management, thereby elucidating the issue of environmental trade-offs in sustainable operations. Methodology : Using novel panel data on energy efficiency and EMS standards obtained from 2,690 South Korean plants operating between 2001 and 2014, this study empirically investigates the impact of EMS on energy efficiency at the plant level. Results : We provide evidence of a trade-off relationship between environmental performance and energy efficiency in relation to EMS adoption. We find that the adoption of ISO 14001, the representative EMS standard, results in approximately 6%–12% lower energy efficiency compared with nonadoption although it effectively reduces air, water, and waste pollution. More importantly, our results show that the trade-off, an unintended consequence of EMS implementation, can be moderated through quality management capability. Managerial implications : We suggest that sustainability managers take balancing actions to reduce trade-offs between environmental performance and energy efficiency. Specifically, when implementing EMS, managers are advised to (1) actively incorporate energy management activities, (2) employ more comprehensive measurements for energy efficiency, and (3) redesign incentive schemes to facilitate improvements in energy efficiency.},

By leveraging drone speed, job sequencing, and admission control, the system operator strives to achieve two managerial objectives: (i) to minimize energy- and congestion-related costs and (ii) to maximize the use of the battery energy between consecutive battery replacements. Academic/practical relevance : E-commerce and shipping companies worldwide are testing and launching commercial drone delivery services to residences. According to a recent study, such services are expected to grow to $100 billion market by the end of the next decade. Our work focuses on improving drone delivery operations, which can reduce costs and improve user satisfaction. Methodology : Focusing on the first objective, we approximate system dynamics using diffusion processes and derive an optimal control policy for the approximating system. Results : Interpreting that policy in the context of the physical system while taking into account the second objective, we devise an implementable set of speed control, job sequencing, and admission strategies. The sequencing strategy, which selects a portfolio of jobs (termed as an activity) to be accomplished within a full battery cycle, results in a win-win scenario—it allows both objectives to be approximately optimized at the same time. Managerial implications : Using the activity-based prioritization scheme provides opportunities to improve the overall performance of the system. Additionally, to achieve the intended job prioritization, the system operator can rely on a small set of activities that are of equal size to the number of job classes.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition: A fast fashion system allows firms to react quickly to changing consumer demand by replenishing inventory (via quick response) and introducing more fashion styles. In this paper, we study the environmental impact of the fast fashion business model by analyzing its implications for product quality, variety, and inventory decisions. Relevance: Our work establishes a much-needed understanding of the link between the fast fashion business model and its environmental consequences. Methodology: We consider a two-period model in which a firm sells to fashion-sensitive consumers whose preferences are influenced by a random fashion trend. We analyze the effect of fast fashion capabilities (quick response and design flexibility) on the firm’s quality decision, leftover inventory and total environmental impact. Results: We find that a key driver of low product quality in the fast fashion industry is the firm’s incentive to offer variety to hedge against uncertain fashion trends. When variety is endogenous, quality decreases as consumers become more sensitive to fashion or as the cost of introducing new styles decreases. We identify the conditions under which increasing fast fashion capabilities leads to higher environmental impact. Managerial implications: We assess the effectiveness of three environmental initiatives (waste disposal regulations, consumer education, and production tax schemes) in countering the environmental impact of fast fashion. We show that waste disposal policies and production taxes are effective in reducing the firm’s leftover inventory—but may have the unintended consequence of lowering product quality, which may worsen the firm’s environmental impact. We also find that education campaigns that increase consumers’ sensitivity to quality strictly benefit the environment in the long run.},

Academic/Practical Relevance : Sports teams face challenges in maintaining or increasing ticket sales levels. With the growth of analytics, they aim to implement data-driven pricing techniques to improve gate revenues; however, they do not have state-of-the-art demand estimation and price optimization tools that take into account the range of valuations across different seat sections and opponent match-ups. Methodology : Partnering with a college football team, we develop a data-driven pricing tool which (1) segments customers in two sales channels, using transaction-level data and anonymous customer profiles; (2) explores the decision-making process of different customers within these segments using the Multinomial Logit and Mixed Multinomial Logit frameworks; and (3) computes optimal or near-optimal prices subject to some business constraints enforced by the team management. In addition, our method takes the sequential arrivals of customers and the capacity constraints of seat categories into account. Results : Our estimation results show that customers differ significantly in their sensitivities to price and distance to the field within each segment, in addition to the differences across segments. We also observe that customers become less likely to choose a seat category as its remaining inventory falls below a certain point. Managerial Implications : By analyzing different policies, we show that price optimization could increase revenue by as much as 7.6%. In addition, better categorization of games and further refinement of seat category differentiation and related pricing may help further boost this figure up to 11.9%.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider the assortment optimization problem of a retailer that operates a physical store and an online store. The products that can be offered are described by their features. Customers purchase among the products that are offered in their preferred store. However, customers who purchase from the online store can first test out products offered in the physical store. These customers revise their preferences for online products based on the features that are shared with the in-store products. The full assortment is offered online, and the goal is to select an assortment for the physical store to maximize the retailer’s total expected revenue. Academic/practical relevance : The physical store’s assortment affects preferences for online products. Unlike traditional assortment optimization, the physical store’s assortment influences revenue from both stores. Methodology : We introduce a features tree to organize products by features. The nonleaf vertices on the tree correspond to features, and the leaf vertices correspond to products. The ancestors of a leaf correspond to features of the product. Customers choose among the products within their store’s assortment according to the multinomial logit model. We consider two settings; either all customers purchase online after viewing products in the physical store, or we have a mix of customers purchasing from each store. Results : When all customers purchase online, we give an efficient algorithm to find the optimal assortment to display in the physical store. With a mix of customers, the problem becomes NP-hard, and we give a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme. We numerically demonstrate that we can closely approximate the case where products have arbitrary combinations of features without a tree structure and that our fully polynomial-time approximation scheme performs remarkably well. Managerial implications : We characterize conditions under which it is optimal to display expensive products with underrated features and expose inexpensive products with overrated features.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition: We study the problem of managing uncertain capacities for revenue optimization over a network of resources. The uncertainty could be due to (i) the need to reallocate initial capacities among resources or (ii) the random availability of physical capacities by the time of service execution. Academic/practical relevance: The analyzed control policy is aligned with the current industry practice, with a virtual capacity and a bid price associated with each network resource. The seller collects revenues from an arriving stream of customers. Admitted requests that cannot be accommodated within the final, effective capacities incur a penalty cost. The objective is to maximize the total cumulative net revenue (sales revenue minus penalty cost). The problem arises in practice, for instance, when airlines are subject to last-minute change of aircrafts and in cargo revenue management where the capacity left by the passengers’ load is used for freight. Methodology: We present a stochastic dynamic programming formulation for this problem and propose a stochastic gradient algorithm to approximately solve it. All limit points of our algorithm are stationary points of the approximate expected net revenue function. Results: Through an exhaustive numerical study, we show that our controls are computed efficiently and deliver revenues that are almost consistently higher than the ones obtained from benchmarks based on the widely adopted deterministic linear programming model. Managerial implications: We obtain managerial insights about the impact of the timing of the capacity uncertainty clearance, the capacity heterogeneity, the network congestion, and the penalty for not being able to accommodate the previously accepted demand. Our approach tends to offer the best performance across different parameterizations of the problem.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study a two-stage supply chain, where the supplier procures a key component to manufacture a product and the buyer orders from the supplier to meet a price-sensitive demand. As the input price is volatile, the two parties enter into either a standard contract, where the buyer orders just before the supplier starts production, or a time-flexible contract, where the buyer can lock a wholesale price in advance. Moreover, we consider three selling-price schemes: Market Driven, Cost Plus, and Profit Max. Academic/practical relevanc e: This problem is motivated by real practices in the cloud industry. Our model and optimization approach can address similar problems in other industries as well. Methodology : We assume that the input price follows a geometric Brownian motion. To determine the optimal ordering time, we propose an optimization approach that is different from the classic approach by Dixit et al. ( 1994 ) and Li and Kouvelis ( 1999 ). Our approach leads to deeper analytical results and more transparent ordering policy. Through a numerical experimentation, we compare profitability of different parties under different contracts, pricing schemes, and market conditions. Results : The buyer’s ordering policy is determined by a threshold policy based on the current time and input price; the optimal threshold depends on not only the drift and volatility of the input price but also, their relative magnitude. The supplier’s optimal procurement time should be determined by analyzing a trade-off between the holding cost of storing the components and the future input-price movement. Managerial implications : Under the Profit-Max and the Cost-Plus pricing schemes, the time-flexible contract is a Pareto improvement compared with the standard contract, whereas under the Market-Driven pricing scheme, the supplier may be better off under the standard contract. Moreover, although the most favorable scenario for the buyer is under the Profit-Max pricing scheme, the most favorable scenario for the supplier oftentimes is under the Cost-Plus pricing scheme. Furthermore, this study provides valuable insights into impacts of various characteristics of the component market, such as the trend and volatility of the input price, on the expected profit of the supply chain and its split between the two parties.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider the problem of joint learning and optimization of cyclic pricing policies in the presence of patient customers. In our problem, some customers are patient, and they are willing to wait in the system for several periods to make a purchase until the price is lower than their valuation. The seller does not know the joint distribution of customers’ valuation and patience level a priori and can only learn this from the realized total sales in every period. Academic/practical relevance : The revenue management problem with patient customers has been studied in the literature as an optimization problem, and cyclic policy has been shown to be optimal in some cases. We contribute to the literature by studying this problem from the joint learning and optimization perspective. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first work that studies online learning and optimization for multiperiod pricing with patient customers. Methodology : We introduce new dynamic programming formulations for this problem, and we develop two nontrivial upper confidence bound–based learning algorithms. Results : We analyze both decreasing cyclic policies and so-called threshold-regulated policies, which contain both the decreasing cyclic policies and the nested decreasing cyclic policies. We show that our learning algorithms for these policies converge to the optimal clairvoyant decreasing cyclic policy and threshold-regulated policy at a near-optimal rate. Managerial implications : Our proposed algorithms perform significantly better than benchmark algorithms that either ignore the patient customer characteristic or simply use the standard estimate-then-optimize framework, which does not encourage enough exploration; this highlights the importance of “smart learning” in the context of data-driven decision making. In addition, our numerical results also show that combining our algorithms with smart estimation methods, such as linear interpolation or least square estimation, can significantly improve their empirical performance; this highlights the benefit of combining smart learning with smart estimation, which further increases the practical viability of the algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : An increased incidence of quality issues, resulting in defective product returns (DPRs), is a concern for firms bringing innovative products to market. Although a firm can recover value from DPRs through refurbishing, consumers are known to act strategically in anticipation of the future availability of refurbished units. We study a firm’s strategy for offering a new product and refurbished DPRs to strategic consumers across time. Academic/practical relevance : Aided by emerging shopping tools, an increasing number of consumers consider buying refurbished versions of products rather than their new counterparts. A novel contribution of our work is the recognition of the refurbishing of DPRs as a possible solution to the time inconsistency problem that arises when a firm offers products to strategic consumers across time. We characterize how the product line decisions and profit of the firm are influenced by the defect rate, the perceived quality of refurbished DPRs, and consumers’ hassle cost of returns. Methodology : We develop a two-period game-theoretic model to characterize the firm offering the new product and refurbished DPRs to strategic consumers across time. Results : The refurbishing of DPRs helps the firm implicitly commit to limiting the quantity of the new product offered in the future, allowing the firm to charge a premium for the new product today. As a result, firm profit may even increase with the defect rate. These results persist across various model extensions. Managerial implications : Whereas the firm’s profit is the highest when there are no defects, opportunities to achieve marginal reductions in defect rates may not be worth the investment and may even be counterproductive. Also, efforts toward enhancing the perceived quality of the refurbished product or decreasing the hassle cost for consumers may better serve the firm than efforts toward marginally improving defect rates.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study the coordination of an E-commerce supply chain between online sellers and third party shippers to meet random demand surges, induced by, for instance, online shopping holidays. Academic/practical relevance : Motivated by the challenge of meeting the unpredictable demand surges in E-commerce, we study shipping contracts and supply chain coordination between online sellers and third party shippers in a novel model taking into account the unique features of the shipping industry. Methodology : We compare two shipping contracts: the risk penalty (proposed by UPS) and the flat rate (used by FedEx), and analyze their impact on the seller, the shipper, and the supply chain. Results : Under information symmetry, the sophisticated risk penalty contract is no better than the simple flat rate contract for the shipper, against common belief. Although both the risk penalty and the flat rate can coordinate the supply chain, the risk penalty does so only if the shipper makes zero profit, but the flat rate can provide a positive profit for both. These results represent a new form of double marginalization and risk-sharing, in sharp contrast to the well-known literature on the classic supplier-retailer supply chain, where risk-sharing contracts (similar to the risk penalty) can bring benefits to all parties, but the single wholesale price contract (similar to the flat rate) can achieve supply chain coordination only when the supplier makes zero profit. We also find that only the online seller, but not the shipper, has the motivation to vertically integrate the seller-shipper supply chain. Under information asymmetry, however, the risk penalty brings more benefit to the shipper than the flat rate, but hurts the seller and the supply chain. Managerial implications : Our results imply that information plays an important role in the shipper’s choices of shipping contracts. Under information symmetry, the risk penalty is unnecessarily complex because the simple flat rate is as good as the risk penalty for the shipper; moreover, it is better for the seller-shipper coordination. However, under information asymmetry, the shipper faces additional shipping risk that can be offset by the extra flexibility of the risk penalty. Our study also explains and supports the recent practice of online sellers (e.g., Amazon.com and JD.com), but not shippers, to vertically integrate the supply chain by consistently expanding their shipping capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Congestion pricing offers an appealing solution to urban parking problems—charging varying rates across time and space as a function of congestion may shift demand and improve allocation of limited resources. It aims to increase the accessibility of highly desired public goods and to reduce traffic caused by drivers who search for available parking spaces. At the same time, complex policies make it harder for consumers to make search-based decisions. We investigate the effect of congestion pricing on consumer and social welfare. Academic/practical relevance : This paper contributes to the theory and practice of the management of scarce resources in the public sector, where welfare is of particular interest. Methodologically, we contribute to the literature on structural estimation of dynamic spatial search models. Methodology : Using data from the City of San Francisco, both before and after the implementation of a congestion-pricing parking program, SF park , we estimate the welfare implications of the policy. We use a dynamic spatial search model to structurally estimate consumers’ search costs, distance disutilities, price sensitivities, and trip valuations. Results : We find that congestion pricing increases consumer and social welfare by more than 4% and reduces search traffic by more than 10% in congested regions compared with fixed pricing. However, congestion pricing may hurt welfare in uncongested regions, in which the focus should be on increasing utilization. Moreover, an unnecessarily complex congestion-pricing scheme makes it difficult for consumers to make search-based decisions. We find that a simpler pricing policy may yield higher welfare than a complex one. Lastly, compared with a policy that imposes limits on parking durations, congestion pricing increases social welfare by allocating the scarce resource to consumers who value it most. Managerial implications : The insights from SF park offer important implications for local governments that consider alternatives for managing parking and congestion and for public-sector managers who evaluate the tradeoffs between approaches to manage public resources.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Few papers have explored the impact of price matching negotiation (PM), in which a channel matches its price with the resulting wholesale price bargained by another channel, on firms’ performances, consumer welfare, and social welfare, with and without supply chain coordination. Academic/practical relevance : Negotiation has been widely seen in determining both uniform and discriminatory wholesale prices, which affect outcomes of competitive supply chain practices. Methodology : To characterize the PM mechanism, we use game theory and Nash bargaining theory to compare PM with simultaneous negotiation (SN) through a common-seller two-buyer differentiated Bertrand competition model. Results : Our analysis reveals that PM can benefit the seller but hurt all buyers, which is at odds with some fair wholesale pricing clauses intending to protect buyers. Under coordination with side payments, however, all firms can conditionally benefit more from PM than from SN. Despite firms’ gains, PM leads to less consumer utility and social welfare compared with SN, unless the second buyer in PM is considerably less powerful than the first buyer. Coordination further worsens PM’s negative impact on consumer utility and social welfare. Moreover, the existence of a spot market can increase the wholesale price in PM, hurting buyers, consumers, and society. Furthermore, the qualitative results about PM remain robust under an alternative disagreement point for PM, multiple buyers, and other extensions. Managerial implications : This paper delivers insights on when price matching in supply chain wholesale price negotiation can benefit a seller, buyers, consumers, and society in a variety of scenarios. It advocates how managers can use PM to their own advantages and provides rationale to decision makers for policy regulations regarding wholesale pricing.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Most industrial innovations consist of multiple interacting components that must be combined into a final product to form an integrated system. When procuring such complex innovations from their suppliers, buyers face a substantial challenge: Should they tender the integrated system as a whole or, instead, procure the system’s components individually from (possibly) different suppliers? Academic/practical relevance : Suppliers have become a major source of innovation for many firms, so buyers ponder how best to structure their procurement efforts. This paper offers guidance on how complex industrial products can be optimally sourced when the buyer’s primary goal is to identify and incentivize innovation. In contrast, most previous research on procurement has concentrated on cost-reduction efforts. Methodology : We use a game-theoretic model to design and compare different procurement mechanisms that allow a buying firm to tap into the innovation potential of its supplier base. Results : Three factors largely determine whether a buyer should procure an integrated system or individual components—namely, the novelty of the innovation to be sourced, the size of the supplier base, and the extent and distribution of component integration costs. We demonstrate how buyers can improve the effectiveness of procurement mechanisms via active supplier management. Managerial implications : Our study provides clear guidelines for managers seeking to source complex industrial innovation. The recommendations presented here reveal how the optimal procurement mechanism changes with the characteristics of the desired product and of the buyer’s supplier base.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider opportunities for cooperation at the supply level between two firms that are rivals in the end-product market. One of our firms is vertically integrated (VI), has in-house production capabilities, and may also supply its rival. The other is a downstream outsourcing (DO) firm that has better market information. The DO is willing to consider a supply partnership with the VI, but it also has the option to use the outside supply market. Academic/practical relevance : Such co-opetitive practices are common in industrial supply chains, but firms’ co-opetitive strategic sourcing with the potential of information leakage has not been examined in the literature. Methodology : We build a game-theoretic model to capture the firms’ strategic interactions under the co-opetitive supply partnership with the potential information leakage. Results : The DO exploits its information advantage to obtain a better wholesale price from the VI and may use dual sourcing to protect its private information. Anticipating that, the VI may offer wholesale price concessions as an information rent to obtain the DO’s information. Our work identifies demand uncertainty and efficiency of outside supply market as the factors affecting the VI’s pricing decision and the resulting equilibrium. Pooling equilibrium arises often, but in a few cases, the equilibrium is separating. At the separating equilibrium, the DO always single sources, either from the VI or the independent supplier depending on the demand state. The VI benefits from ancillary revenue-generating opportunity, and from information acquisition in a separating equilibrium. On the other hand, the DO’s benefit is a cheaper price in exchange for market information in a separating equilibrium. In the pooling case, the DO uses dual sourcing to hide demand information, especially in the high demand case, and to better supply the end-market through his accurate demand information. Managerial implications : Our work provides useful insights into firms’ strategic sourcing behaviors to efficiently deal with the potential of information leakage in the co-opetitive supply environment and for the rationale behind such relationships often observed in industries.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Giving out a symbolic “supplier of the year” or “outstanding supplier” award can be beneficial for a buyer as it may incentivize a supplier to exert higher efforts. However, when a good supplier is scarce, the award announces which supplier is particularly good and may increase the cost of building and maintaining the relationship. This paper studies both positive and negative effects of a symbolic award and offers explanations on underlying behavioral mechanisms. Academic/practical relevance : We show that symbolic awards can effectively incentivize suppliers to provide high effort, improving a buyer’s bottom line. This is particularly relevant in cases in which certain aspects of a buyer–supplier relationship are not contractible and suppliers have discretion over the quality provided. The award format significantly influences the award’s effectiveness. Methodology : We develop a game-theoretical model that captures a supplier’s utility for the award in a competitive setting and test the predictions of the model with laboratory experiments. Results : Our experimental results confirm that private symbolic awards have motivating effects and lead to higher buyer profits. When the awards are public, this profit premium diminishes as buyers pay higher prices to get the good suppliers. When the buyer is given the option to make the award public or private, buyers prefer that awards are public over private, anticipating a negative supplier response to their choice of the private award format. Managerial implications : Expressing praise or gratitude for a supplier’s efforts can be highly beneficial for a buyer. However, when there is scarcity of good suppliers, buyers should expect increased competition and accompany the award with efforts to preserve the relationship. Finally, if buyers choose to offer a distinctive award format, private recognitions may be perceived as greedy or self-interested and backfire.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Customers are likely to initiate retrial calls when their previous contact with a call center fails to deliver a satisfactory resolution. According to industry reports, retrials are listed as a top annoying issue for customers and hurt call centers’ profits. Though recognizing this problem, call centers find it challenging to reduce retrials without overshooting their operating expenses. Our research aims to empirically understand the mechanism of customer retrials and then provide economically feasible solutions to reduce retrials. Academic/practical relevance : Little empirical research has been done to understand customers’ strategic retrials, and theoretical research studies retrials by assuming the degree to which pickup speed and service quality impact retrials. Our research empirically investigates the mechanism of customer retrials by studying whether speed and quality truly matter and, if so, how strong the impact is from each of them and whether the impacts are different across various customer segments. The quantified mechanism can then guide service providers to reduce retrials cost-effectively. Methodology : We use a random-coefficient dynamic structural model to characterize customer decisions in pursuing a satisfactory resolution and estimate the parameters from call-by-call records of a uniquely designed call center. Our model tracks customer decisions in the online waiting stage, in which customers are waiting for an agent but weighing whether to abandon, and in the off-line waiting stage, in which customers are not directly connected but are actively debating whether to retry. Utilizing the hybrid system that sequentially places customers into queues for three distinct quality service groups, we disentangle the effects of pickup speed and service quality on customers’ abandonment and retrial decisions. Results : Our estimations confirm that high service quality and quick pickup speed reduce retrials. Moreover, we discover that private customers are more sensitive to quality but less sensitive to speed compared with business customers. We suggest two service designs to reduce retrials cost-effectively by tailoring services to customer preferences. One reallocates the service groups for different customer segments without expanding the system, and the other adjusts the staffing ratios by hiring low-cost, ordinary-quality agents. Under the two tailoring designs, business customer surplus increases by up to 14.4% and private customer surplus by up to 14.9%. Managerial implications : First, our research highlights the importance of recognizing customers’ off-line decisions, which are impacted by online service offerings and, in turn, affect future online service operations. Neglecting customer retrials leads to suboptimal service designs. Second, by understanding the mechanism of customer retrials empirically, our research guides call centers to reduce retrials cost-effectively with speed–quality balance. Third, our research develops a practical analysis framework for service providers to quantify customer preferences and design tailoring services.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Putting customer experience at the heart of service design has become a governing principle of today’s “experience economy.” Echoing this principle, our paper addresses a service designer’s problem of how to select and sequence activities in designing a service package. Academic/practical relevance: Empirical literature shows an ideal sequence often entails an interior peak ; that is, the peak (i.e., highest-utility) activity is placed neither at the beginning nor the end of the package. Theoretic literature, by contrast, advocates placing the peak activity either at the beginning or at the end. Our paper bridges this gap by developing a theory accounting for interior peaks. It also provides managerial implications for activity sequencing and selection. Methodology : We model the activity sequencing and selection problem as a nonlinear optimization problem and reformulate its objective as an additive function to generate structural insights. Results : We show that heterogeneity in memory decay explains the phenomenon of interior peaks. The optimal sequence is in either an “IU” or “UI” shape. An interior peak is optimal when the memory decay rate of the peak activity is neither too high nor too low. Managerial implications : Our research sheds light on service sequencing by weighing the phenomenon of interior peaks. In the presence of an interior peak, we show it is optimal to schedule a low point immediately before or after the peak activity, creating a contrast in customer experience. In addition, interior peaks arise partly because the peak activity is more memorable than others. Guided by this logic, as the peak activity becomes even more memorable, one might be tempted to move it to an earlier slot; we show that, counterintuitively, moving it to a later slot can be optimal. Our research also provides implications for activity selection by showing the optimal portfolio may consist of activities with the highest- and lowest-utility values but not those with medium values.},

Academic and Practical Relevance : Sharing-economy companies have been providing monetary rewards to incentivize self-scheduled drivers to work longer. We study the effectiveness of the monetary bonus scheme in the context of the ridesharing industry, where the drivers are highly heterogeneous and set income targets. Methodology : We model a driver’s decision-making processes and the platform’s optimization problem as a Stackelberg game. Then, utilizing comprehensive datasets obtained from a leading ridesharing platform, we develop a novel empirical strategy to provide evidence on the existence of drivers’ income-targeting behavior through a reduced-form and structural analysis. Furthermore, we perform a counterfactual analysis to calculate the optimal bonus rates for different scenarios by using the characteristics of heterogeneous drivers derived from the estimation outcomes. Results : Our theoretical model suggests that the drivers’ working hours do not increase monotonically with the bonus rate under the target effect and that the platform may not use all its budget on bonuses to maximize capacity or profit. We empirically demonstrate that the drivers engage in income-targeting behavior, and furthermore, we estimate the income targets for heterogeneous drivers. Through counterfactual analysis, we illustrate how the optimal bonus scheme varies when the platform faces different driver compositions and market conditions. We also find that, compared with the platform’s previous bonus setting, the optimal bonus strategy improves the capacity level during peak hours by as much as 26%, boosting the total profit by $4.3 million per month. Managerial implications : It is challenging to develop a flexible self-scheduled supply of drivers that can match the ever-changing demand and maintain the market share of the ridesharing platform. When offering monetary bonuses to incentivize drivers to work longer, the drivers’ income-targeting behavior can undermine the effectiveness of such bonus schemes. The platform needs to understand the heterogeneity of drivers’ behavioral preferences regarding monetary rewards to design an effective bonus strategy.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Because of a prolonged decline in public transit ridership over the last decade, transit agencies across the United States are in financial crisis. To entice commuters to travel by public transit instead of driving personal vehicles, municipal governments must address the “last-mile” problem by providing convenient and affordable transportation between a commuter’s home and a transit station. This challenge raises an important question: Is there a cost-effective mechanism that can improve public transit adoption by solving the last-mile problem? Academic/practical relevance : In this paper, we present and analyze two incentive mechanisms for increasing commuter adoption of public transit. In a direct mechanism, the government provides a subsidy to commuters who adopt a “mixed mode,” which involves combining public transit with hailing rides to/from a transit station. The government funds the subsidy by imposing congestion fees on personal vehicles entering the city center. In an indirect mechanism, instead of levying congestion fees, the government secures funding for the subsidy from the private sector. We examine the implications of both mechanisms on relevant stakeholders. These two mechanisms are especially relevant because several jurisdictions in the United States have begun piloting incentive programs, in which commuters receive subsidies for ride-hailing trips that begin or end at a transit station. Methodology : We present a game-theoretic model to capture the strategic interactions among five self-interested stakeholders (commuters, public transit agency, ride-hailing platform, municipal government, and local private enterprises). Results : By examining equilibrium outcomes, we obtain three key findings. First, we characterize how the optimal interventions associated with the direct or the indirect mechanism depend on: (a) the coverage level of the public transit network; (b) the public transit adoption target; and (c) the relative strength of commuter preferences between driving and taking public transit. Second, we show that the direct mechanism cannot be budget-neutral without undermining commuter welfare. However, when the public transit adoption target is not too aggressive, we find that the indirect mechanism can increase both commuter welfare and sales to the private-sector partner while remaining budget-neutral. Finally, we show that, although the indirect mechanism restricts the scope of government intervention (by eliminating the congestion fee), it can dominate the direct mechanism by leaving all stakeholders better off, especially when the adoption target is modest. Managerial implications : Our findings offer cost-effective prescriptions for improving urban mobility and public transit ridership.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This work focuses on the hotel housekeeping process. In a field study, a possible channel of disease transmission between consecutive guests in hotel rooms is revealed. In order to prevent the transmission, an innovative assembly-line housekeeping method is developed. Academic/practical relevance : The transmission of infectious diseases during hotel stays (e.g., by touching unclean towels or bed linens) has been reported globally. Under the current COVID-19 pandemic, having contact with saliva or mucus left by an infected person could cause infection. The standard housekeeping process used by the majority of hotels leaves a channel for new towels and bed linens in refreshed rooms to be contaminated by bacteria or viruses from used towels and bed linens. Eliminating the contamination channel and preventing disease transmission are crucial for protecting the health and safety of hotel guests, especially under a disease outbreak such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology : The research was conducted during a field study at a hotel. To design the assembly-line process, the service time distribution of each housekeeping operational step is characterized using data collected from the practice at hundreds of hotel rooms. An optimization model is proposed to optimize the operation. Through a pilot test, the performance of the assembly-line and the traditional housekeeping methods is compared. Results : The pilot test results show that the assembly-line housekeeping method has the potential to improve not only hygienic standards but also, labor efficiency and service quality (error rate). Managerial implications : The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic draws tremendous public attention on disease transmission and public hygiene. The principle of the assembly-line method (i.e., eliminating contamination channels through teamwork operational design) can be applied to not only hotel housekeeping practices but also, many other service settings. It leads to hygienic, efficient, and reliable operations, at no additional cost.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition: The traditional payment system between an insurer and providers does not incentivize providers to limit their prices, nor patients to choose less expensive providers, hence contributing to high insurer expenditures. Reference pricing has been proposed as a way to better align incentives and control the rising costs of healthcare. In this payment system, the insurer determines the maximum amount that can be reimbursed for a procedure (reference price). If a patient selects a provider charging more than the reference price, the patient is responsible for the entire portion above it. Our goal is to understand how reference pricing performs relative to more traditional payment systems. Academic/practical relevance: Our results can help healthcare leaders understand when reference pricing has the potential to be a successful alternative payment mechanism, what its impact on the different stakeholders is, and how to best design it. Methodology: We propose a game-theoretical model to analyze the reference pricing payment scheme. Our model incorporates an insurer that chooses the reference price, multiple competing price-setting providers, and heterogeneous patients who select a provider based on a multinomial logit choice model. Results: We find that the highest-priced providers reduce their prices under reference pricing. Moreover, reference pricing often outperforms the fixed and the variable payment systems both in terms of expected patient utility and insurer cost but incurs a loss in the highest-priced providers’ profit. Furthermore, we show that in general the insurer utility is often higher under reference pricing unless the insurer is a public nonprofit insurer that weighs the providers’ utility as much as its own cost. Managerial implications: Overall, our findings indicate that reference pricing constitutes a promising payment system for “shoppable” healthcare services as long as the insurer does not act similar to a public nonprofit insurer.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : To manage supplier social responsibility (SR), some firms have adopted a self-assessment strategy whereby they ask suppliers to self-report SR capabilities. Self-reported information is difficult to verify, and this leads to an important credibility question: can a buyer expect truthful reporting? We examine whether a supplier’s SR capability can be credibly communicated through free and unverifiable self-reporting. Academic/practical relevance : SR is a strategic focus for firms because consumers care about ethical production. Some firms rely on supplier self-assessment as part of their SR strategy. It is important to understand the value and challenges of this approach. Methodology : We develop a cheap talk model of a supplier and a buyer. The supplier is endowed with a given SR level (privately known to the supplier) that represents the probability of no violation. The buyer sells in a market that is sensitive to publicized SR violations. The supplier first communicates its SR level to the buyer, and then the buyer chooses between two audit stringency levels to conduct on the supplier and also chooses how much to order. Results : Influential truthful communication may emerge in equilibrium if (i) the buyer orders a larger quantity from the high-type supplier but imposes a more stringent audit than the buyer would for the low type and (ii) the high-type supplier opts for this larger order, whereas the low-type, fearing audit failure, does not. The buyer can benefit as the audit becomes more expensive. Managerial implications : Supplier SR self-assessments can be a valuable strategy for buyers but only if the buyer has access to auditing capabilities of different levels and does not precommit to a particular level. It is valuable for firms to engage in an up-front auditing step to ensure a minimum SR capability of approved suppliers because very low-performing suppliers never truthfully report. Implementing supplier self-assessments may or may not help reduce the social damage resulting from potential SR violations; we identify situations when it helps and when it does not.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Many nonprofit organizations (NPOs) serve distressed individuals who seek relief from hardships such as domestic abuse or homelessness. These NPOs aim to maximize social impact by allocating their limited amount of resources to various activities. Academic/practical relevance : NPOs that serve distressed individuals face a complex task because their clients are often unable to articulate their specific needs. As a result, NPOs are driven to not only offer a variety of services to fulfill different needs, but also engage in advisory activities to minimize mismatches between services clients receive and their true needs. Methodology : We develop a model to study an NPO’s service portfolio and effort allocation decisions under resource constraint. Clients’ progress from distress to resolution is stochastic and depends on the NPO’s efforts in different stages of the service offering. Results : We show that it is optimal for resource-constrained NPOs to offer fewer services and invest more in advisory activities when different types of clients are not evenly mixed in the population, when delays in achieving resolution can significantly blunt the social impact created, when the loss of impact due to not serving a fraction of clients is low, or when there is a limited amount of earmarked funds. Otherwise, it is optimal for NPOs to diversify their service offerings and invest less in advisory activities. Managerial implications : Many NPOs are drawn to maximize the number of clients they serve by increasing the number of services they offer. However, we show that, depending on the characteristics of clients and services, NPOs might be able to generate higher social impact by prioritizing the speed of resolution rather than focusing on the number of clients who achieve resolution.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Among the most vexing issues in the U.S. healthcare ecosystem is inappropriate use of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures, also known as overstenting. A key driver of overstenting is physician subjectivity in eyeballing a coronary angiogram. Advanced tests such as fractional flow reserve (FFR) provide more precise and objective measures of PCI appropriateness, yet the decision to perform these tests is endogenous and not immune to clinical ambiguity associated with eyeballing. Additionally, conflicts of interest, arising from revenue-generating incentives, play a role in overstenting. Academic/practical relevance : Conventional wisdom suggests more precise diagnostic testing will help reduce overtreatment. However, the literature rarely recognizes that the testing decision is itself endogenous. Our research highlights the role of endogeneity surrounding interventional cardiology decision making. Methodology : This study uses stochastic modeling and simulation. Results : Under a low conflict-of-interest level, the physician performs the advanced test for intermediate lesions. Under a high conflict-of-interest level, however, the physician would perform the advanced test only for high-grade lesions, because of a financial disincentive : Performing the advanced test may lower PCI revenue if the test results argue against the procedure. Surprisingly, despite this disincentive, a more revenue-driven physician can be more inclined to perform the advanced test. Managerial implications : Our model leads to implications for various efforts aimed at tackling overstenting: (1) Attention should be paid not only to the sheer quantity of FFR procedures but to which patients receive FFR procedures; (2) reducing the risk of the advanced test has a behavior-inducing effect, yet a modest risk reduction may lower patient welfare; and (3) offering a bonus to the physician for performing FFR procedures equal to a third of its reimbursement rate will cause only a 5% increase in average physician payment while inducing a 26% decline in overstenting. In addition, we show implementing a bundled payment scheme may discourage the use of FFR procedures and lead to more salient overstenting.},

Our paper provides the first rigorous and large-scale empirical evidence relating the use of different supply chain strategies to the ability of a supply chain to recover from supply interruptions. Methodology: We develop a compound estimator of a supply chain’s recovery rate that can be constructed using limited available data (only the time series of firms’ actual sourcing behavior). Using more than two and half million import manifests, we extract firms’ maritime sourcing transactions and use this data to estimate recovery rates of different firm-category supply chains of publicly traded U.S. firms. Results: We find that supplier diversification is associated with slower recovery from sourcing interruptions, whereas the use of long-term relationships is associated with faster recovery. A one standard deviation decrease in the former is associated with a 16% faster recovery, and a like increase in the latter is associated with a 20% faster recovery. Managerial implications: Our paper brings important empirical evidence to the hitherto theoretical debate on the impact of sourcing strategies on faster recovery in supply chains. We therefore provide actionable advice on supply chain design for faster recovery.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Health information technology (HIT) interoperability refers to the ability of different electronic health record systems and software applications to communicate, exchange data, and use the information that has been exchanged. The U.S. Government has invested heavily to promote HIT interoperability in recent years in an attempt to improve patient outcomes and control healthcare expenditure. This study empirically assesses the value of HIT interoperability in the interhospital transfer process of heart attack patients. Academic/practical relevance : HIT interoperability is supposed to enable health information exchange between disparate providers. However, there exists little evidence about how it affects care delivery processes across providers. Methodology : Using transfer records of heart attack patients and HIT interoperability adoption records of hospitals in New York State between 2013 and 2015, we estimate the effect of HIT interoperability on care delivery process measures and patient outcome measures. We demonstrate the robustness of the results with alternative samples and model specifications, including the instrumental variable method, the propensity score matching method, the difference-in-differences method, and a falsification test. Results : We show that HIT interoperability shortens the throughput time of interhospital transfer by 45.6 minutes on average or 12.0%. Surprisingly, we find that HIT interoperability has little effect in reducing duplicate electrocardiogram (EKG) testing for transferred patients at receiving hospitals. When HIT interoperability is enabled through a common software vendor, it yields 15.6% more reduction in the throughput time than when it is enabled through different vendors, but it still has no significant effect on duplicate EKG testing. Furthermore, we find that HIT interoperability leads to a 3.0-percentage point decrease in the 30-day readmission rate of transferred patients, which can be explained by the reduction in the throughput time. Managerial implications : Our findings demonstrate the value of incentivizing HIT adoption and promoting widespread exchange of health information because HIT interoperability indeed improves the efficiency of healthcare delivery across providers, which ultimately translates to improved patient outcomes. Given the lack of reduction in duplicate testing in our study, we call for more provider effort toward realizing the full potential of HIT interoperability by minimizing the gap between technology adoption and utilization.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition: The eco-toxicity arising from unused pharmaceuticals has regulators advocating the benign design concept of “green pharmacy,” but high research and development expenses can be prohibitive. We therefore examine the impacts of two regulatory mechanisms, patent extension and take-back regulation, on inducing drug manufacturers to go green. Academic/practical relevance: One incentive suggested by the European Environmental Agency is a patent extension for a company that redesigns its already patented pharmaceutical to be more environmentally friendly. This incentive can encourage both the development of degradable drugs and the disclosure of technical information. Yet, it is unclear how effective the extension would be in inducing green pharmacy and in maximizing social welfare. Methodology: We develop a game-theoretic model in which an innovative company collects monopoly profits for a patented pharmaceutical but faces competition from a generic rival after the patent expires. A social-welfare-maximizing regulator is the Stackelberg leader. The regulator leads by offering a patent extension to the innovative company while also imposing take-back regulation on the pharmaceutical industry. Then the two-profit maximizing companies respond by setting drug prices and choosing whether to invest in green pharmacy. Results: The regulator’s optimal patent extension offer can induce green pharmacy but only if the offer exceeds a threshold length that depends on the degree of product differentiation present in the pharmaceutical industry. The regulator’s correspondingly optimal take-back regulation generally prescribes a required collection rate that decreases as its optimal patent extension offer increases, and vice versa. Managerial implications: By isolating green pharmacy as a potential target to address pharmaceutical eco-toxicity at its source, the regulatory policy that we consider, which combines the incentive inherent in earning a patent extension on the one hand with the penalty inherent in complying with take-back regulation on the other hand, serves as a useful starting point for policymakers to optimally balance economic welfare considerations with environmental stewardship considerations.},

However, many retailers find it challenging to efficiently provide fast and on-time delivery services to their customers. Academic/practical relevance : Amazon and Walmart are among the retailers that are relying on independent crowd drivers to cope with on-demand delivery expectations. Methodology : We propose a novel robust crowdsourcing optimization model to study labor planning and pricing for crowdsourced last-mile delivery systems that are utilized for satisfying on-demand orders with guaranteed delivery time windows. We develop our model by combining crowdsourcing, robust queueing, and robust routing theories. We show the value of the robust optimization approach by analytically studying how to provide fast and guaranteed delivery services utilizing independent crowd drivers under uncertainties in customer demands, crowd availability, service times, and traffic patterns; we also allow for trend and seasonality in these uncertainties. Results : For a given delivery time window and an on-time delivery guarantee level, our model allows us to analytically derive the optimal delivery assignments to available independent crowd drivers and their optimal hourly wage. Our results show that crowdsourcing can help firms decrease their delivery costs significantly while keeping the promise of on-time delivery to their customers. Managerial implications : We provide extensive managerial insights and guidelines for how such a system should be implemented in practice.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study the problem faced by the Philippine Department of Social Welfare (DSWD) in prepositioning relief items before landfall of an oncoming typhoon whose future outcome (trajectory and wind speed) is uncertain. Academic/practical relevance : The importance of prepositioning was a hard lesson learned from Super Typhoon Haiyan that devastated the Philippines in 2013, when many affected by the typhoon did not have immediate access to food and water. In a typhoon-prone country, it is important to build resilience through an effective prepositioning model. Methodology : By engaging with DSWD, we developed a practically relevant stochastic prepositioning model. The probability models of municipality-level demand and of supply damage are both dependent on the typhoon outcome. A linear mixed effects model is used to estimate the dependence of demand on the typhoon outcome using a large data set that includes the municipality-level impact of West Pacific typhoons during 2008–2019. The model has two objectives motivated from the practical realities of the Philippine network: prioritizing regions with high demand and prepositioning in all affected regions proportional to their total demand. Results : We find that the choice of the demand model significantly impacts the distributed relief items in the Philippine setting where it is challenging to adjust region-level supply after a typhoon. By using the historical data on past typhoons, we show that in this setting, our stochastic demand model provides the best distribution to date of any existing demand models. Managerial implications : There currently exists a gap between theory and practice in the management of relief inventories. We contribute toward bridging this gap by engaging with DSWD to develop a practically relevant relief distribution model. Our work is an effective example of collaboration with government and nongovernment agencies in developing a relief distribution model.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Price surge of essential commodities despite inventory availability, due to artificial shortage , presents a serious threat to food security in many countries. To protect consumers’ welfare, governments intervene reactively with either (i) cash subsidy, to increase consumers’ purchasing power by directly transferring cash; or (ii) supply allocation, to increase product availability by importing the commodity from foreign markets and selling it at subsidized rates. Academic/practical relevance : This paper develops a new behavioral game-theoretic model to examine the supply chain and market dynamics that engender artificial shortage as well as to analyze the effectiveness of various government interventions in improving consumer welfare. Methodology : We analyze a three-stage dynamic game between the government and the trader. We fully characterize the market equilibrium and the resulting consumer welfare under the base scenario of no government intervention as well as under each of the interventions being studied. Results : The analysis demonstrates the disparate effects of different interventions on artificial shortage; whereas supply allocation schemes often mitigate shortage, cash subsidy can inadvertently aggravate shortage in the market. Furthermore, empirical analysis with actual data on onion prices in India shows that the proposed model explains the data well and provides specific estimates on the implied artificial shortage. A counterfactual analysis quantifies the potential impacts of government interventions on market outcomes. Managerial implications : The analysis shows that reactive government interventions with supply allocation schemes can have a preemptive effect to reduce the trader’s incentive to create artificial shortage. Although cash subsidy schemes have recently gained wide popularity in many countries, we caution governments to carefully consider the strategic responses of different stakeholders in the supply chain when implementing cash subsidy schemes.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Physical distancing requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic have dramatically reduced the effective capacity of university campuses. Under these conditions, we examine how to make the most of newly scarce resources in the related problems of curriculum planning and course timetabling. Academic/practical relevance : We propose a unified model for university course scheduling problems under a two-stage framework and draw parallels between component problems while showing how to accommodate individual specifics. During the pandemic, our models were critical to measuring the impact of several innovative proposals, including expanding the academic calendar, teaching across multiple rooms, and rotating student attendance through the week and school year. Methodology : We use integer optimization combined with enrollment data from thousands of past students. Our models scale to thousands of individual students enrolled in hundreds of courses. Results : We projected that if Massachusetts Institute of Technology moved from its usual two-semester calendar to a three-semester calendar, with each student attending two semesters in person, more than 90% of student course demand could be satisfied on campus without increasing faculty workloads. For the Sloan School of Management, we produced a new schedule that was implemented in fall 2020. The schedule allowed half of Sloan courses to include an in-person component while adhering to safety guidelines. Despite a fourfold reduction in classroom capacity, it afforded two thirds of Sloan students the opportunity for in-person learning in at least half their courses. Managerial implications : Integer optimization can enable decision making at a large scale in a domain that is usually managed manually by university administrators. Our models, although inspired by the pandemic, are generic and could apply to any scheduling problem under severe capacity constraints.},

Specifically, we study the impact of automation—that is, the buyer uses a chatbot to automatically inquire about prices instead of asking in person—and the impact of smartness—that is, the buyer signals the use of a smart AI algorithm in selecting the supplier. Academic/practical relevance : In a world advancing toward AI, we explore how AI creates and delivers value in procurement. AI has two unique abilities: automation and smartness, which are associated with physical machines or software that enable us to operate more efficiently and effectively. Methodology : We collaborate with a trading company to run a field experiment on an online platform in which we compare suppliers’ wholesale price quotes across female, male, and chatbot buyer types under AI and no recommendation conditions. Results : We find that, when not equipped with a smart control, there is price discrimination against chatbot buyers who receive a higher wholesale price quote than human buyers. In fact, without smartness, automation alone receives the highest quoted wholesale price. However, signaling the use of a smart recommendation system can effectively reduce suppliers’ price quote for chatbot buyers. We also show that AI delivers the most value when buyers adopt automation and smartness simultaneously in procurement. Managerial implications : Our results imply that automation is not very valuable when implemented without smartness, which in turn suggests that building smartness is necessary before considering high levels of autonomy. Our study unlocks the optimal steps that buyers could adopt to develop AI in procurement processes.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Firms providing products and services to low-income base of the pyramid (BOP) customers are increasingly utilizing independent contractor agents rather than employees in their distribution models. We empirically investigate the best way to help agents perform better. Academic/practical relevance : BOP customers represent one-third of the world’s economy but make five United States dollars or less daily. Providing goods and services to these customers is difficult for traditional firms because most retail activity occurs at small-scale independent outlets. Improving agent performance can help firms reach customers in this environment. We enhance the literature on agent-based models in BOP settings, decision making, technology in developing economies, and field experiments. Methodology : In partnership with a Tanzanian mobile money operator, we perform a randomized, controlled trial with 4,771 agents to examine how differing types of guidance, and whether in-person training is offered, impact agents’ inventory management. Mobile money is a platform whereby firms in developing economies provide financial services to customers via cell phones. Mobile money agents service customer withdrawals and deposits as branchless banking outlets. Every day, they decide how much money to stock to service customers’ transactions, from which they earn commissions. Results : We find that those agents given only explicit recommendations (as opposed to summary statistics or both) who were invited to in-person training (as opposed to simply received an automated notification) improve their performance. Agents in other treatments showed no statistically significant change. The effect is concentrated in agents who never replenished their money at a bank and whose money inventory levels were low in the pretreatment period. Managerial implications : We show empirically how firms can better manage agents, thereby improving the value proposition of serving BOP customers. We show the utility of segmentation based on agent heterogeneity. This can improve firm performance, agent profits, and customer service.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider capacity sharing through demand allocation among firms with multiple demand sources and multiple service facilities. Firms decide on the allocation of demand from different sources to different facilities to minimize delay costs and service-fulfillment costs possibly subject to service-level requirements. If firms decide to operate collectively as a coalition, they must also decide on a scheme for sharing the total cost. Academic/practical relevance : We study capacity sharing through demand allocation in service systems in the presence of service-fulfillment costs. Our problem is motivated by service collaboration in healthcare involving public–private partnerships. Methodology : We formulate the problem as a cooperative game and identify a cost allocation that is in the core. Results : The cost-allocation scheme we identify is price-directed, and the cost of each firm consists of three components: (1) the delay cost incurred within the firm; (2) a cost paid for the capacity used by the firm at facilities owned by other firms; and (3) a payment received for fulfilling demand of other firms at facilities owned by the firm. Interestingly, we show that the cost-allocation scheme is equivalent to a market equilibrium—that is, it can be implemented in a decentralized fashion. We extend our analysis to settings where the capacity of each facility is endogenously determined and to settings where a service-priority policy is deployed. Our results are robust to a variety of generalizations: partial sharing, partial transfer, facilities modeled as general queueing systems, and convex delay costs. Managerial implications : Our findings provide guidelines for and insights into how to carry out demand allocation and cost sharing among different firms in the presence of service-fulfillment costs to foster service collaboration. In particular, the equilibrium market prices can be viewed as the prices/subsidies for service collaboration in a public–private partnership.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The theoretical investigation of the effectiveness of limited flexibility has mainly focused on a performance metric that is based on the maximum sales in units. However, this could lead to substantial profit losses when the maximum sales metric is used to guide flexibility designs while the products have considerably large profit margin differences. Academic/practical relevance : We address this issue by introducing margin differentials into the analysis of process flexibility designs, and our results can provide useful guidelines for the evaluation and design of flexibility configurations when the products have heterogeneous margins. Methodology : We adopt a robust optimization framework and study process flexibility designs from the worst-case perspective by introducing the dual margin group index (DMGI). Results and managerial implications : We show that a general class of worst-case performance measures can be expressed as functions of a design’s DMGIs and the given uncertainty set. Moreover, the DMGIs lead to a partial ordering that enables us to compare the worst-case performance of different designs. Applying these results, we prove that under the so-called partwise independently symmetric uncertainty sets and a broad class of worst-case performance measures, the alternate long-chain design is optimal among all long-chain designs with equal numbers of high-profit products and low-profit products. Finally, we develop a heuristic based on the DMGIs to generate effective flexibility designs when products exhibit margin differentials.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Successful outcomes of total joint replacement (TJR) depend not only on the surgery but also on the patients’ postsurgical behaviors; inadequate postsurgical performance can lead to complications and/or readmissions. To prevent such events, patients go through postoperative intervention processes in which they receive physical therapy and/or some form of rehabilitative services. Although the costs of providing such interventions and readmission penalties are substantial, no methods exist that enable healthcare professionals to determine the optimal timing and target group of the interventions. Academic/practical relevance : To address these gaps, this paper investigates the decision problem faced by healthcare professionals: When should we provide interventions to which group of patients to minimize the total expense? We formulate the postdischarge intervention process as a finite-horizon discrete-time Markov decision process. Methodology : We dynamically model the post-TJR intervention process by (1) directly incorporating the readmission risk and penalty, and (2) considering the varying effectiveness of interventions depending on where the patient is located (care facility type). Results : Through a case study at a community hospital, the applicability of the model is illustrated and a number of structural properties, including the existence of a control-limit type policy, are proved. Based on the data obtained from the collaborating hospital, the optimal policy suggests to start intervening skilled nursing facility (SNF) patients after the postacute recovery period. Managerial implications : The optimal policy of the model shows that the common practice of focusing intervention resources on immediate postoperative periods needs further justification, and more attention should be focused on the presurgical or surgical phase to devise interventions that are more tailored toward preventing early readmission causes.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In many healthcare systems, general practitioners refer patients to specialists, who make treatment decisions under limited capacity. We evaluate the effectiveness of different payment schemes, both traditional ones, where the payer contracts separately with the providers, and bundled schemes, where the providers share a single bundled payment. A key feature considered is a performance-based payment component to coordinate the decisions of the general practitioner and specialist by a single payer. The providers are partially responsible for the patient outcomes and costs stemming from their treatment decisions. Academic/practical relevance : We propose and analyze a model to address how referral and specialist treatment decisions in healthcare impact each other and how payment schemes impact the coordination of care between the general practitioner and specialist. Our work is valuable to policymakers in understanding the trade-offs between using bundled and unbundled payment schemes in a referral-based healthcare system. Methodology : The underlying research method is the analysis of optimization models (with congestion effects embedded) to explore the effects of different payment schemes on different entities and various operational performance measures in a healthcare system. Results : A bundled scheme has higher referral rates, lower time spent with the patient by the specialist, higher specialist utilization relative to an unbundled system in most scenarios, and higher system costs. Our conclusions are robust to various model changes. Managerial implications : Our work provides specific managerial insights into the relative performance of bundled and unbundled payment systems on operational metrics in a referral-based healthcare system. It also sheds light on how the level of attributability of service outcomes to providers interacts with payment schemes to influence referral and specialist treatment decisions and impact various quality and cost metrics.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Clinical trials are crucial to new drug development. This study investigates optimal patient enrollment in clinical trials with interim analyses, which are analyses of treatment responses from patients at intermediate points. Our model considers uncertainties in patient enrollment and drug treatment effectiveness. We consider the benefits of completing a trial early and the cost of accelerating a trial by maximizing the net present value of drug cumulative profit. Academic/practical relevance : Clinical trials frequently account for the largest cost in drug development, and patient enrollment is an important problem in trial management. Our study develops a dynamic program, accurately capturing the dynamics of the problem, to optimize patient enrollment while learning the treatment effectiveness of an investigated drug. Methodology : The model explicitly captures both the physical state (enrolled patients) and belief states about the effectiveness of the investigated drug and a standard treatment drug. Using Bayesian updates and dynamic programming, we establish monotonicity of the value function in state variables and characterize an optimal enrollment policy. We also introduce, for the first time, the use of backward approximate dynamic programming (ADP) for this problem class. We illustrate the findings using a clinical trial program from a leading firm. Our study performs sensitivity analyses of the input parameters on the optimal enrollment policy. Results : The value function is monotonic in cumulative patient enrollment and the average responses of treatment for the investigated drug and standard treatment drug. The optimal enrollment policy is nondecreasing in the average response from patients using the investigated drug and is nonincreasing in cumulative patient enrollment in periods between two successive interim analyses. The forward ADP algorithm (or backward ADP algorithm) exploiting the monotonicity of the value function reduced the run time from 1.5 months using the exact method to a day (or 20 minutes) within 4% of the exact method. Through an application to a leading firm’s clinical trial program, the study demonstrates that the firm can have a sizable gain of drug profit following the optimal policy that our model provides. Managerial implications : We developed a new model for improving the management of clinical trials. Our study provides insights of an optimal policy and insights into the sensitivity of value function to the dropout rate and prior probability distribution. A firm can have a sizable gain in the drug’s profit by managing its trials using the optimal policies and the properties of value function. We illustrated that firms can use the ADP algorithms to develop their patient enrollment strategies.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider the intraday scheduling problem in a group of orthopaedic clinics where the planner schedules appointment times, given a sequence of appointments. We consider patient re-entry—where patients may be required to go for an x-ray examination, returning to the same doctor they have seen—and variability in patient behaviours such as walk-ins, earliness, and no-shows, which leads to inefficiency such as long patient waiting time and physician overtime. Academic/practical relevance : In our data set, 25% of the patients are required to go for x-ray examination. We also found significant variability in patient behaviours. Hence, patient re-entry and variability in behaviours are common, but we found little in the literature that could handle them. Methodology : We formulate the problem as a two-stage optimization problem, where scheduling decisions are made in the first stage. Queue dynamics in the second stage are modeled under a P-Queue paradigm, which minimizes a risk index representing the chance of violating performance targets, such as patient waiting times. The model reduces to a sequence of mixed-integer linear-optimization problems. Results : Our model achieves significant reductions, in comparative studies against a sample average approximation (SAA) model, on patient waiting times, while keeping server overtime constant. Our simulations further characterize the types of uncertainties under which SAA performs poorly. Managerial insights : We present an optimization model that is easy to implement in practice and tractable to compute. Our simulations indicate that not accounting for patient re-entry or variability in patient behaviours will lead to suboptimal policies, especially when they have specific structure that should be considered.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : To approve a novel drug therapy, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires clinical trial evidence demonstrating efficacy with 2.5% statistical significance, although the agency often uses regulatory discretion when interpreting these standards. Factors including disease severity, prevalence, and availability of existing therapies are qualitatively considered; yet, current guidelines fail to systematically consider such characteristics in approval decisions. Academic/practical relevance : In making approval decisions, the FDA weighs the health benefits of introducing life-saving therapies against the potential risks of approving ineffective or harmful drugs. Tailoring approval standards to individual diseases could improve treatment options for patients with few alternatives and further incentivize pharmaceutical companies to invest in neglected diseases. Methodology : Using a novel queueing framework, we analyze the FDA’s drug approval process to incorporate disease-specific factors and obsolescence—newer drugs replacing older formulas—through a set of pre-emptive M / M /1/1 queues. Based on public data encompassing all registered U.S. clinical trials and FDA-approved drugs, we estimate model parameters for three high-burden diseases (breast cancer, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hypertension) and solve for the optimal policy to maximize net life-years gained following FDA approval. Results : The optimal policy relaxes approval standards for diseases with long trial duration, high attrition, or low research and development intensity. Results indicate that a more lenient policy is warranted for drugs targeting breast cancer or hypertension, and a more stringent policy is recommended for HIV, relative to the FDA’s existing policy. If pharmaceutical firms respond to the new standards by submitting more drugs for approval—leading to an endogenous clinical trial initiation rate—the FDA’s optimal policy modestly decreases for breast cancer and hypertension, with minimal change for HIV. Managerial implications : Our study offers a transparent, quantitative framework that could help the FDA develop disease-specific approval guidelines based on underlying disease-related severity, prevalence, and characteristics of the drug development process and existing market.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We investigate the effectiveness of different extended producer responsibility (EPR) implementation models for pharmaceuticals. In particular, we study two viable and prevalent models: (1) source reduction (SR), where a form of fee on sale is imposed on producers, and (2) end-of-pipe control (EC), where producers are made responsible for the collection of unused pharmaceuticals. Academic/practical relevance : The existing literature on EPR implementation models has focused primarily on nonconsumable products (e.g., electronics), whereas there is limited research on the effectiveness of different EPR implementation models for pharmaceuticals used in practice. We aim to fill this gap in this study. Methodology : We develop a game-theoretic model to characterize the equilibrium strategies of different stakeholders under both the SR and EC models and compare the resulting producer profit, environmental/social impact, and total welfare. Results : In contrast to the nonconsumable contexts where the SR model is shown to maximize total welfare, the EC model leads to a higher total welfare for certain categories of pharmaceuticals because of its effectiveness in eliminating overprescription. Moreover, we characterize conditions under which stakeholder (e.g., producer, environmental/social advocacy groups) preferences toward EPR implementation model choices are (mis-)aligned. We further show that limiting the social planner’s budget surplus under SR can eliminate the preference misalignment but leads to a loss of total welfare. Managerial implications : (1) Policymakers should be cautious about directly applying preferred EPR models from other product categories to the pharmaceutical setting. (2) The EC model maximizes the objectives of all stakeholders for a salient category of pharmaceuticals with high health benefits, high collection costs, and high environmental/social costs. (3) Policymakers should give thought to differentiating EPR implementation models across pharmaceutical categories. (4) It is important to carefully quantify the health impact of the pharmaceuticals and the operational cost parameters to inform policymaking.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition: For the standard newsvendor problem with an unknown demand distribution, we develop an approach that uses data input to construct a distribution ambiguity set with the nonparametric characteristics of the true distribution, and we use it to make robust decisions. Academic/practical relevance : Empirical approach relies on historical data to estimate the true distribution. Although the estimated distribution converges to the true distribution, its performance with limited data is not guaranteed. Our approach generates robust decisions from a distribution ambiguity set that is constructed by data-driven estimators for nonparametric characteristics and includes the true distribution with the desired probability. It fits situations where data size is small. Methodology : We apply a robust optimization approach with nonparametric information. Results : Under a fixed method to partition the support of the demand, we construct a distribution ambiguity set, build a protection curve as a proxy for the worst-case distribution in the set, and use it to obtain a robust stocking quantity in closed form. Implementation-wise, we develop an adaptive method to continuously feed data to update partitions with a prespecified confidence level in their unbiasedness and adjust the protection curve to obtain robust decisions. We theoretically and experimentally compare the proposed approach with existing approaches. Managerial implications : Our nonparametric approach under adaptive partitioning guarantees that the realized average profit exceeds the worst-case expected profit with a high probability. Using real data sets from Kaggle.com, it can outperform existing approaches in yielding profit rate and stabilizing the generated profits, and the advantages are more prominent as the service ratio decreases. Nonparametric information is more valuable than parametric information in profit generation provided that the service requirement is not too high. Moreover, our proposed approach provides a means of combining nonparametric and parametric information in a robust optimization framework.},

Academic/practical relevance : The literature often assumes that the random utility components follow some independent and identically distributed distribution. This assumption is too restrictive in some real-world scenarios, because, for example, consumers may have known well about the attribute values for the product that they have repeatedly purchased. Methodology : We adopt the random utility maximization framework and characterize the choice probabilities when the utility of some alternative is deterministic. The log-likelihood function is jointly concave in the attribute coefficients under the linear utility-attribute assumption; an expectation-maximization algorithm is developed to overcome the missing data issue in estimation. Results : Surprisingly, if the utility of a particular product is deterministic, the assortment problem is still polynomial-time solvable, whereas if the utility of the no-purchase option is deterministic, the decision problem corresponding to the assortment optimization is NP-complete. We show that the price minus the reciprocal of price sensitivity is product invariant at optimality, which helps to simplify the multiproduct pricing problems. Managerial implications : Empirical study on real data shows that incorporating nonrandomness into random choice models can increase model fitting and prediction accuracy.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We explore the impacts of store-brand (SB) introduction on multilateral contracting in vertical supply relationships that involve two upstream national-brand manufacturers (NBMs) selling through a common retailer. Two different information structures are scrutinized: simultaneous (secret offers) versus sequential contracting (public offers), essentially different timing by which the NBMs contract with the retailer. Academic/practical relevance : SB products are prevalent nowadays; however, the market shares in different categories vary substantially, from negligible sales (e.g., alcoholic beverages) to more than half of the total sales (e.g., milk). As retailers encroach on the NBMs’ product market, their relationships are reshaped accordingly. Thus, investigating whether SB introduction would overturn the conventional wisdom about multilateral contracting is pertinent. Methodology : The methodology is noncooperative game theory. Results : We identify a boundary equilibrium where the sale of the SB is negligible, but its presence enables the retailer to intensify the upstream competition and elicits better wholesale contracts. We show that this equilibrium tends to occur in a wider region under sequential contracting than under simultaneous contracting. In the boundary equilibrium of sequential contracting, the NBM could entail a first-mover advantage, a stark contrast to the second-mover advantage in the nonboundary equilibrium. Further, as opposed to the uniqueness of sequential contracting, we characterize a continuum of boundary equilibria under simultaneous contracting such that symmetric NBMs may even set asymmetric wholesale prices so as to drive the SB out of the market. Managerial implications : We provide a rationale for the observed negligible sales of certain SBs and further shed light on the choice between public and secret offers. Public offers could perform better for the retailer who, in turn, benefits from information leakage. With public offers, the NBMs’ preference for the leadership could also be reversed for SBs with negligible sales. Because of the intricate impact of SBs on contracting sequence, these two instruments should be jointly analyzed.},

Academic/practical relevance: In the class of random utility maximization choice models, consumers choose the alternative with the largest utility after resolving utility uncertainties for all options. However, in practice, consumers may not inspect all available alternatives due to bounded rationality or search cost. Methodology: This paper incorporates bounded rationality into consumer choice behavior: in the first stage, a representative consumer forms her consideration set by removing alternatives whose nominal utility is lower than the largest by a threshold; in the second stage, she examines all alternatives in her consideration set and chooses the one with the highest realized utility. Results: For the Gumbel-distributed random utilities, we derive the two-stage threshold multinomial logit model with a consideration set. For the pricing problem, we show the quasi-same-markup/same-utility policy is optimal: high-cost products charge the prices such that their profit markups are the same, and low-cost products charge prices such that their nominal utilities are the same. For the price competition, there may exist zero, one, two, or infinite Nash equilibria, depending on the magnitude of the threshold effects. Managerial implications: Our analysis shows that the consideration set and bounded rationality play an important role in consumer choice behavior, so they should be taken into account in firms’ decision making.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In this paper, we develop an integrated framework to study a firm’s joint decisions on product price, quality, and service duration in a variety of monopolistic and competitive scenarios. Academic/practical relevance : Product price, quality, and ancillary service (such as maintenance and factory warranty) are arguably among the most important factors consumers consider when making a purchase decision. Meanwhile, they are also seen as effective instruments for firms to achieve market segmentation. We consider a cost structure for a firm in which the service cost depends on the product quality level. In particular, if quality is associated with product reliability (respectively, complexity), the service cost would decrease (increase) in the quality level. Methodology : We adopt the widely used multinomial logit model and the nested logit model to study consumers’ choice behavior and employ mixed-integer optimization and game theory to conduct analyses. Results : We find that with multiple substitutable products being offered, it is sufficient for a firm to provide only two maximally differentiated service durations at optimality. The quality of each product should be set at a level such that the marginal utility to consumers equals the marginal cost to the firm, independent of the decisions on other products, whereas the pricing decision should take into account all products. In addition, consumer surplus increases when the firm can make more decisions. Managerial implications : Regardless of product substitution and market competition, the optimal quality level and service duration for each product can be determined independently of other products. Moreover, service differentiation can benefit consumers and improve the firm’s profitability at the same time.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Operational disruptions can impact a firm’s risk, which manifests in a host of operational issues, including a higher holding cost for inventory, a higher financing cost for capacity expansion, and a higher perception of the firm’s risk among its supply chain partners. Academic/practical relevance : Although disruptions have been studied extensively in the operations management literature, the emphasis has been on mitigating the deleterious impact on the firm’s production potential rather than its risk. We examine whether implementing and credibly attesting to having effective internal control systems will meaningfully influence the impact of operational disruptions on the firm’s risk and market valuation. Methodology : We exploit a 2004 regulatory change that required certain firms to attest to having control systems in place. Our triple-difference regression specification takes advantage of a regulatory anomaly that excluded a well-defined set of firms from complying with the control system requirement. Results : We find that firms that were obligated to comply with this regulatory requirement experienced a materially smaller increase in their risk and a smaller decrease in their market value in the aftermath of an operational disruption. Firms that were not obligated to comply with this requirement did not experience such benefits in the aftermath of a disruption and instead, experienced a larger increase in their risk. Managerial implications : Fostering a better understanding of whether credible control systems can reduce the impact of disruptions on the firm’s risk and value is important as it identifies a broader set of mitigation strategies available to operations managers. This can help managers achieve a better fit between their risk mitigation initiatives and their objectives and budget constraints.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Product recalls have serious consequences for firms and consumers. Little is known, however, about how firms manage the timing of recalls and how this timing influences the financial consequences of recalls. In this study, we provide evidence for a previously unknown phenomenon: recall clustering, a collection of recalls within close temporal proximity in which a leading recall (the first recall in a cluster) excites following recalls (subsequent recalls in a cluster). We also investigate how the stock market penalizes firms differently depending upon their position within the recall cluster. Academic/practical relevance : By demonstrating that auto firms cluster their recalls and that the market penalizes firms differently based on the position of a recall within a cluster, we contribute to the literature that investigates recall timing and stock market event studies and provide guidance for regulators who oversee auto recalls and managers who make recall decisions. Methodology : We first develop analytical predictions using a dynamic game theoretic model to motivate our hypotheses. We then examine empirical support for our hypotheses by analyzing 3,117 auto recalls across 48 years using a Hawkes process model. Hawkes process models are designed to examine self-excitation of events across time and can be used to investigate recall clustering, while categorizing recalls as leading or following within a cluster. Finally, we use the leading and following recall designations obtained from the Hawkes process model in an event study to examine how the stock market effects of a recall vary depending on its position within a cluster. Results : We find that 73% of recalls occur in clusters, and they form after a 16-day gap in recall announcements. On average, clusters last for 34 days and are comprised of 7.6 following recalls announced after the leading recall. Leading recalls are associated with as high as a 67% larger stock market penalty than following recalls. Further, we find that the stock market benefit realized by a following recall weakens as the time since the leading recall increases and that the stock market penalty faced by a leading recall grows as the time since the end of the last cluster increases. Managerial Implications : Our findings lead to a key implication for regulators who oversee auto recalls by demonstrating evidence of recall clustering and the underlying stock market effects that are attributable to it. We provide a cost-neutral policy recommendation for the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration that should limit recall clustering.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The U.S. federal government makes significant investments in technology programs to deliver essential services to the public. The execution of a program is monitored against a baseline—an aggregate plan representing the program’s planned budget, schedule and scope. Recent reports suggest that federal technology programs are re-baselined multiple times, resulting in additional spending of taxpayer money. Although a program’s scope has often been considered a driver of baseline changes, we have a limited understanding of the execution factors that may affect this relationship. Academic/Practical Relevance : With increasing bipartisan scrutiny of federal spending in technology programs and continuing debate in the media about their execution, a nuanced understanding of the drivers of baseline changes in federal technology programs is a critical and contemporary line of inquiry relevant to both policymakers and managers. Our study also responds to recent calls in the operations management literature for research on public sector operations. Methodology : The study sample comprises detailed archival data on 240 U.S. federal government technology programs across 24 federal agencies. We estimate a negative binomial regression specification that accounts for agency fixed effects and several program-specific characteristics to test four hypotheses on the interrelationships between a program’s scope, granularity, management competency, execution methodology and baseline changes.. Results : The results indicate that program scope is positively associated with the number of baseline changes. However, increasing levels of program granularity and program management competency attenuate this positive relationship. Additional analysis highlights the significant savings in taxpayer contributions that can occur by reducing baseline changes in programs of greater scope through an increase in the levels of program granularity and program management competency. Managerial Implications : The study results emphasize the need for federal agencies to invest greater efforts in granularizing a program and in identifying managers with high levels of program management competency when program scope is high, as such efforts can translate into a reduction in the number of baseline changes. The results also highlight the role of number of baseline changes as a valuable in-process metric for program managers and federal agencies to monitor the execution of federal technology programs and identify programs with greater potential. for experiencing cost overruns.},

There is currently no consensus on whether their presence will have a positive impact on users and society. The skeptics of automation foresee increased congestion, whereas the advocates envision smoother traffic with shorter travel times. We study the automation controversy and advise policymakers on how and when to promote AVs. Academic/practical relevance : The AV technology is advancing rapidly and there is a need to study its impact on social welfare and the likelihood of its adoption by the public. Methodology : We use supply-demand theory to find the equilibrium number of trips for autonomous and regular households. We develop a simulation model of peer-to-peer AV sharing. We compare the socially optimal level of automation with the selfish adoption patterns where households independently choose their vehicle type. Results : We establish that the optimal social welfare is influenced by: (i) the network connectivity, that is, the ability of the infrastructure to serve AVs, (ii) the additional comfort provided by AVs that allows passengers to engage in other productive activities instead of driving, and (iii) the AV sharing patterns that reduce ownership costs, but create empty vehicle trips that increase congestion. Managerial implications : We investigate the impact of AVs in a case study of Toronto and show that partial automation maximizes social welfare. We show that the comfort of AVs may add traffic that compromises social welfare. Moreover, although traffic increases with automation, travel times may decrease because of significant improvements in traffic flow caused by AV connectivity in the network.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Autonomous sensors connected through the internet of things (IoT) are deployed by different firms in the same environment. The sensors measure an important operating-condition state variable, but their measurements are noisy, so estimates are imperfect. Sensors can improve their own estimates by soliciting estimates from other sensors. The choice of which sensors to communicate with (target) is challenging because sensors (1) are constrained in the number of sensors they can target and (2) only have partial knowledge of how other sensors operate—that is, they do not know others’ underlying inference algorithms/models. We study the targeting problem, examine the evolution of interfirm sensor communication patterns, and explore what drives the patterns. Academic/practical relevance : Many industries are increasingly using sensors to drive improvements in key performance metrics (e.g., asset uptime) through better information on operating conditions. Sensors will communicate among themselves to improve estimation. This IoT vision will have a major impact on operations management (OM), and OM scholars need to develop and examine models and frameworks to better understand sensor interactions. Methodology : Analytic modeling combining decision-making, estimation, optimization, and learning is used. Results : We show that when selecting its target(s), each sensor needs to consider both the measurement quality of the other sensors and its level of familiarity with their inference models. We establish that the state of the environment plays a key role in mediating quality and familiarity. When sensor qualities are public, we show that each sensor eventually settles on a constant target set, but this long-run target set is sample-path dependent (i.e., dependent on past states) and varies by sensor. The long-run network, however, can be fully defined at time zero as a random directed graph, and hence, one can probabilistically predict it. This prediction can be made perfect (i.e., the network can be identified in a deterministic way) after observing the state values for a limited number of periods. When sensor qualities are private, our results reveal that sensors may not settle on a constant target set but the subset among which it cycles can still be stochastically predicted. Managerial implications : Our work allows managers to predict (and influence) the set of other firms with which their sensors will form information links. Analogous to a manufacturer mapping its supplier base to help manage supply continuity, our work enables a firm to map its sensor-based-information suppliers to help manage information continuity.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Considering a mix of prepositioning and local purchasing, common to cover humanitarian demands in the aftermath of a rapid-onset disaster, we propose policies to determine preposition stock. These formulations are developed in the presence of demand, budget, and local supply uncertainties and for single-items delivery. Academic/practical relevance : The immediate period aftermath of a disaster is the most crucial period during which humanitarian organizations must supply relief items to beneficiaries. Yet, because of many unknowns such as time, place, and magnitude of a disaster, supply management is a significant challenge, and these decisions are made intuitively. The features and complexities we examine have not been studied in the literature. Methodology : We derive properties of the optimal solution, identify exact solution methods, and determine approximate methods that are easy to implement. Results : We (i) characterize the interplay of supply, demand, and budget uncertainties, as well as the impact of product characteristics on optimal prepo stock levels; (ii) show in what conditions the prepo stock is a simple newsvendor solution; and (iii) discuss the value of emergency funds. Managerial implications : We show that budget level is a key determinant of the optimal policy. When it is above a threshold, inventory increases in disaster frequency and severity, but the reverse is true otherwise. When budget is limited, the rate of savings from improved forecasts is amplified (attenuated) for critical (noncritical) items, reflecting opposing directional effects of mismatch cost and cost of insufficient funding. Our model can also be used to estimate the value of initiatives to mitigate constraints on local spend (e.g., a line of credit underwritten by large donors that is available during the immediate relief period).},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : To improve the poor performance of supply chains caused by misaligned incentives under the wholesale price contract, theory proposes coordinating contracts. However, a common finding of experimental studies testing such contracts is that they tend to yield only a marginal, if any, performance improvement over wholesale pricing. These studies identify several behavioral factors that are at play but none accounted for by the theory proposing coordinating contracts. Among them, identified as the single most detrimental for the supply chain performance, is incomplete information about preferences for fairness causing contract rejections. Can the supply chain performance be improved with a contract designed allowing for this type of information asymmetry? What does this contract (mechanism) look like? Academic/practical relevance : The extant research characterized the optimal contracting mechanisms for such important practical cases as the suppliers’ private information about production cost or the retailers’ private information about the end customer demand. The present study addresses the gap in another important practical case: when the source of information asymmetry is the private information about preferences for fairness. Methodology : The underlying research method is mechanism design. Results : We prove that the optimal mechanism consists of a single contract positioned on the Pareto frontier and characterize the optimal profit split between the supplier and the retailer. We show that, under a wide range of preferences for fairness, the efficiency loss because of private information is strictly positive, but exceptions are possible. We also show that the optimal mechanism can be implemented with a variety of commonly used in practice and widely studied in academic literature contracts, including the minimum order quantity and the two-part tariff ones. Managerial implications : We establish a direct link between a large volume of theoretical and empirical literature on social preferences with the research on supply chain contracts. Because rejections that are because of incomplete information are an important cause of contract inefficiency observed in the laboratory, managers should avoid take it or leave it offers when they negotiate contracts. Instead, the bargaining process should be geared toward discovering the extent of the fairness preferences of the contracting parties.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The beer game is widely used in supply chain management classes to demonstrate the bullwhip effect and the importance of supply chain coordination. The game is a decentralized, multiagent, cooperative problem that can be modeled as a serial supply chain network in which agents choose order quantities while cooperatively attempting to minimize the network’s total cost, although each agent only observes local information. Academic/practical relevance : Under some conditions, a base-stock replenishment policy is optimal. However, in a decentralized supply chain in which some agents act irrationally, there is no known optimal policy for an agent wishing to act optimally. Methodology : We propose a deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to play the beer game. Our algorithm makes no assumptions about costs or other settings. As with any deep RL algorithm, training is computationally intensive, but once trained, the algorithm executes in real time. We propose a transfer-learning approach so that training performed for one agent can be adapted quickly for other agents and settings. Results : When playing with teammates who follow a base-stock policy, our algorithm obtains near-optimal order quantities. More important, it performs significantly better than a base-stock policy when other agents use a more realistic model of human ordering behavior. We observe similar results using a real-world data set. Sensitivity analysis shows that a trained model is robust to changes in the cost coefficients. Finally, applying transfer learning reduces the training time by one order of magnitude. Managerial implications : This paper shows how artificial intelligence can be applied to inventory optimization. Our approach can be extended to other supply chain optimization problems, especially those in which supply chain partners act in irrational or unpredictable ways. Our RL agent has been integrated into a new online beer game, which has been played more than 17,000 times by more than 4,000 people.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Games are the fastest-growing sector of the entertainment industry. Freemium games are the fastest-growing segment within games. The concept behind freemium is to attract large pools of players, many of whom will never spend money on the game. When game publishers cannot earn directly from the pockets of consumers, they employ other revenue-generating content, such as advertising. Players can become irritated by revenue-generating content. A recent innovation is to offer incentives for players to interact with such content, such as clicking an ad or watching a video. These are termed incentivized (incented) actions. We study the optimal deployment of incented actions. Academic/practical relevance : Removing or adding incented actions can essentially be done in real-time. Accordingly, the deployment of incented actions is a tactical, operational question for game designers. Methodology : We model the deployment problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). We study the performance of simple policies, as well as the structure of optimal policies. We use a proprietary data set to calibrate our MDP and derive insights. Results : Cannibalization—the degree to which incented actions distract players from making in-app purchases—is the key parameter for determining how to deploy incented actions. If cannibalization is sufficiently high, it is never optimal to offer incented actions. If cannibalization is sufficiently low, it is always optimal to offer. We find sufficient conditions for the optimality of threshold strategies that offer incented actions to low-engagement users and later remove them once a player is sufficiently engaged. Managerial implications : This research introduces operations management academics to a new class of operational issues in the games industry. Managers in the games industry can gain insights into when incentivized actions can be more or less effective. Game designers can use our MDP model to make data-driven decisions for deploying incented actions.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The U.S. influenza (flu) vaccine supply chain is decentralized and experiences frequent supply and demand mismatches caused by two key factors: (1) the vaccine production process (yield) is highly uncertain; and (2) individuals are self-interested and do not completely take into account positive and negative externalities that they impose on others. To improve matching of supply and demand, we counteract these factors by developing an ex ante budget-neutral incentive program. Academic/practical relevance : We establish the sources of inefficiency in the flu vaccine supply chain. To eliminate the inefficiency, we develop a two-sided incentive program that policymakers can implement to finance vaccines under an ex ante balanced budget. Methodology : We model the flu vaccine supply chain as a decentralized system consisting of self-interested individuals on the demand side, and a profit-maximizing manufacturer with uncertain yield on the supply side. We use backward induction to characterize the subgame-perfect equilibrium of the sequential game that models the interactions between individuals and the manufacturer. Results : We develop a two-sided incentive program that proposes “vaccination incentives” to be given to individuals on the demand side, and “a menu of transfer payments” between the social planner and manufacturer on the supply side. When the realized vaccine supply is high (or low), our incentive program provides positive (negative) vaccination incentives for individuals to stimulate (or curb) the demand and eliminate positive (or negative) externalities by making vaccination more affordable (or costly). When social benefits from vaccination are significantly high, our incentive program uses a menu of transfer payments to penalize (or subsidize) the manufacturer for low (or high) yield realizations so that it produces the socially optimal quantity. We show that our incentive program can attain the social optimum, maintain an ex ante balanced budget (i.e., budget-neutral in expectation), and distribute the maximum social welfare between individuals and the manufacturer arbitrarily. Managerial implications : Vaccination incentives to individuals can ensure their access to the vaccine, but they are not enough to entice the manufacturer to ensure vaccine availability. A menu of contracts contingent on realized yield provides necessary incentives to the manufacturer and assures the availability.},

  abstract     = {Problem Definition : This study examines whether and how the relationship between technology licensing and productivity growth in the short run is affected by the challenges and constraints inherent in the contexts in which developing economy firms operate. We do so by investigating the moderating role of formal workforce training program in a firm and the corruption level and the infrastructural constraint level in the firm&#39;s external environment. Academic/Practical Relevance : Although the adoption of foreign technology by developing economy manufacturing firms is often driven by the goal to strengthen their capabilities in the long run, prior research provides a limited understanding of the performance consequences of technology licensing in the short run, which is an important business reality. Our study serves to address this important gap in research and practice. Methodology : The empirical analyses are conducted using matching and fixed-effects regression on a multi-industry dataset from the World Bank. We analyze detailed firm-level information from over 16,000 manufacturing firms across 25 developing economies in South Asia and East Asia. To strengthen causal inference, our analyses address selection bias and unobserved heterogeneity. Results : Our results indicate that the adoption of foreign technology by developing economy manufacturing firms has a substantial short-run disruptive effect on firm operations with productivity growth declining by 4.5 percentage points in these firms relative to comparable firms that do not use foreign technology licensing. We find that formal workforce training programs attenuate the negative relationship between technology licensing and productivity growth. However, infrastructural constraints in the external business environment amplify this negative relationship. Intriguingly, our results suggest that corruption in the firm&#39;s external environment acts as an “efficient grease,” attenuating the negative impact of technology licensing on productivity growth. Managerial Implications : Our results provide compelling evidence regarding the disruptive effects of technology licensing on productivity growth in the short run. Furthermore, these results offer insights for manufacturing firms and policymakers in developing economies on how to mitigate these negative effects.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study a problem of a retailer that orders from competing strategic suppliers subject to independent or correlated disruptions and responds by setting the retail price on delivery, called responsive pricing. The suppliers set their wholesale prices in a Nash game. Academic/practical relevance : Supplier disruption correlation exists for reasons such as product and service designs, geographic proximity, and common tier 2 suppliers. In practice, many retailers are able to set the product price after knowing the delivered quantity. Methodology : We model this problem as a Stackelberg–Nash game with the suppliers as the leaders and the retailer as the follower and obtain its equilibrium explicitly. We perform sensitivity analyses with respect to suppliers’ production costs, reliabilities, and their correlation. Results : We find, surprisingly, that an increase in the reliability of a supplier may, counter to our intuition, hurt it because of the competition between the suppliers selling to a responsive-pricing retailer. Furthermore, in contrast to the literature, we find that under responsive pricing, a high disruption correlation may benefit a supplier that has a cost advantage, and the total order quantity may increase in that correlation because of supplier competition. Managerial implications : This paper has important implications for unreliable suppliers because the way reliability and correlation influence their profits depends on the retailer’s pricing power and the competition intensity between the suppliers. With a responsive-pricing retailer, a supplier may not benefit from higher reliability but may benefit from a higher correlation. This suggests that a low-cost supplier serving a responsive-pricing retailer could add to its decision-making tools a new incentive of creating a positively correlated supply network by building plants in the geographic location of its competitor or sourcing from the same tier 2 supplier to obtain an increased correlation strategically.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper studies the sourcing of a monopoly firm that procures from multiple unreliable suppliers to meet its deterministic/price-dependent demand. The suppliers’ production processes are unreliable and are modeled by correlated proportional random yields. Academic/practical relevance : As a proactive risk-mitigation tool, supply diversification has been widely studied in the literature, with the primary focus on independent supply risks. However, supply risks in practice may be correlated in nature for various reasons. By accounting for yield correlation among suppliers’ production processes, our work aims to help firms better manage their supply base and fully exploit the benefit of risk pooling through diversification. Methodology : Stochastic optimization serves as our main tool for analysis. Results : We formulate the firm’s problem in a general n -supplier setting and prove its structural properties. For a two-supplier case, we fully characterize the firm’s optimal sourcing decision and provide a unified measurement to quantify how yield correlation and characteristics jointly affect the supply base selection. Specifically, we show that when the two suppliers are highly positively correlated, the firm may sole-source from the supplier with higher effective procurement cost (the procurement cost per expected delivered unit) and also higher reliability. In addition, as the production yields become more positively correlated, supply diversification becomes less likely, and the firm’s profit decreases. Moreover, assuming multivariate normally distributed yields, we generalize those results and relevant insights to the multiple-supplier case. We uncover the critical role played by yield correlation and illustrate the insufficiency of using effective procurement cost alone to qualify a supplier. Finally, we incorporate demand uncertainty to confirm the robustness of our findings. Managerial implications : Our results urge caution in selecting the optimal supply base when the yield risks are correlated. Particularly, yield correlation, effective procurement costs, and supplier reliability should be jointly taken into account; otherwise, ignoring any one of these factors may lead to suboptimal outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper investigates how counterfeits influence a global supply chain and how the supply chain should effectively take anticounterfeit actions. Academic/practical relevance : The impacts of counterfeiting have been increasingly profound on global supply chains. It is critical to understand how counterfeiting impacts supply chains when supply chain members act in their own interests, and how supply chains can effectively combat counterfeiting when all the members can contribute to it. This is the first paper that offers insights into these important questions. In particular, we examine who among the supply chain members is in the best position to perform counteracting activities, how these members can cooperate in anticounterfeiting, and what economic implications the anticounterfeit actions have to the supply chain, individual firms, consumer surplus, and social welfare. Methodology : We consider a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer, and analyze a game-theoretical framework to derive the equilibrium. Results : The manufacturer prefers to induce the retailer to combat counterfeits rather than to combat itself. Contrary to conventional wisdom, counterfeits can increase the supply chain’s profit even in the absence of network externality effects. The crux is that the manufacturer lowers wholesale price to incentivize the retailer’s counteraction and, consequently, the threat of counterfeits can mitigate double marginalization and benefit the supply chain. Managerial implications : Our results demonstrate that a sustainability risk can trigger collaborative endeavors of supply chain members and thus be advantageous to the supply chain. The findings also underscore the important role that retailers should play in anticounterfeiting. Particularly, it can be in the supply chain’s interest that the manufacturer does not execute the counteraction, either jointly with the retailer or by itself.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study supply chain coordination in a setting with transshipment. We use centralized and decentralized transfer prices as a way to increase supply chain coordination. Academic/practical relevance : The ability to transship can improve channel efficiency by improving the match between supply and demand. We study how human decision makers behave in this setting and provide clear insights to improve coordination. Methodology : We use controlled laboratory experiments with financially incentivized human subjects. We study a broad set of critical ratios under both decentralized and centralized transfer-price settings. In the decentralized transfer-price setting, retailers negotiate a transfer price. In the centralized transfer-price setting, we use two different approaches: theoretical and behavioral transfer price. Both approaches suggest opposite recommendations. Results : Analytically, the optimal transfer price should depend on the critical ratio; but results from the decentralized setting show that participants set prices as if they ignore the critical ratio and instead focus on splitting potential profit from transshipped units in half. However, there is a positive relationship between transfer prices and ordering decisions. Moreover, generalizing the pull-to-center effect, we find that subjects do not place orders that coordinate the supply chain. For the centralized setting, we find that using the theoretical approach does not coordinate ordering decisions and does not improve decisions compared with the decentralized setting. The behavioral approach suggests a transfer price close to product selling price for a high critical ratio and a transfer price below product cost for a low critical ratio. These recommendations lead to coordinating ordering decisions. Managerial implications : We draw two practical conclusions from our research. First, transshipments are unambiguously beneficial, resulting in higher profitability, and, when feasible, should be encouraged. Second, when possible, transfer prices should be set centrally but taking into account subjects’ behavior. Otherwise, price negotiation might lead to better performance.},

Specifically, there are two disjoint sets of demand and supply types, and a reward for each possible matching of a demand type and a supply type. In each period, demand and supply of various types arrive in random quantities. The platform decides on the optimal matching policy to maximize the expected total discounted rewards, given that unmatched demand and supply may incur waiting or holding costs, and will be fully or partially carried over to the next period. Academic/practical relevance : The problem is crucial to many intermediaries who manage matchings centrally in a sharing economy. Methodology : We formulate the problem as a dynamic program. We explore the structural properties of the optimal policy and propose heuristic policies. Results : We provide sufficient conditions on matching rewards such that the optimal matching policy follows a priority hierarchy among possible matching pairs. We show that those conditions are satisfied by vertically and unidirectionally horizontally differentiated types, for which quality and distance determine priority, respectively. Managerial implications : The priority property simplifies the matching decision within a period, and the trade-off reduces to a choice between matching in the current period and that in the future. Then the optimal matching policy has a match-down-to structure when considering a specific pair of demand and supply types in the priority hierarchy.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : An on-demand service platform relies on independent workers (agents) who decide how much time, if any, to devote to the platform. Some labor advocates have argued that an expansion of the labor pool hurts agents—by reducing the wage and agent utilization (i.e., the fraction of time an agent is busy serving customers). Motivated by concern for agent welfare, regulators are considering measures that reduce the labor pool size or that impose a floor on the nominal wage or effective wage (i.e., the product of the nominal wage and agent utilization). Are agents indeed hurt by an expansion in the labor pool size? Which type of wage-floor regulation is preferable? Are consumers hurt by the imposition of a wage floor? Academic/practical relevance : Because independent agents work without the traditional protections intended to ensure the welfare of employees, the welfare of those agents is an important concern. Methodology : We employ an equilibrium model that accounts for the interaction among price, wage, labor supply, customer delay, and demand. Results : Average labor welfare increases and then decreases in the labor pool size; that is, agents are harmed by an expansion in the labor pool size if and only if the labor pool size is sufficiently large. The effective wage floor is superior to the nominal wage floor in terms of labor welfare maximization. More generally, the two types of wage floors have structurally different effects on labor welfare, with a floor on the nominal wage only beneficial to agents if it is sufficiently small. Contrary to the conventional view that consumers are hurt by an effective wage floor (because they face a higher price, due to upward pressure on the wage, and longer delay, due to upward pressure on agent utilization), consumers actually benefit. Managerial implications : Regulators, labor advocates, platform managers, and agents benefit from understanding the forces that create and destroy labor welfare.},

However, no studies consider the role of SI under chain-to-chain competition. Methodology : We build a two-period model consisting of two competing supply chains, each with an upstream manufacturer and an exclusive retailer. The retailers compete on either price or quantity. We characterize the firms’ strategies under the concept of perfect Bayesian equilibrium. We consider cases where contracts are either observable or unobservable across supply chains. Results : (1) SI still exists under chain-to-chain competition. Retailers may carry more inventory when the competition becomes fiercer, which further intensifies the supply chain competition. (2) Different from the existing findings, SI may backfire and hurt all firms. Interestingly, firms may benefit from a higher inventory holding cost. (3) Under supply chain competition, the prisoner’s dilemma can arise if competition intensity is intermediate; in other words, manufacturers are better off without strategic inventory, and yet they cannot help allowing strategic inventory, which is the unique equilibrium. Managerial implications : Despite its appeal among firms of a single supply chain, the role of SI is altered or even reversed by chain-to-chain competition.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Utility regulators are grappling to devise compensation schemes for customers who sell rooftop solar generation back to the grid, balancing environmental interests and the financial interests of utilities, solar system installers, and retail customers. This is difficult: Regulatory changes made in Nevada in 2015 to protect Nevada’s utility induced SolarCity, the market leader in solar systems, to suspend local operations. We show that the choice of utility tariff structure is crucial to achieving socially desirable objectives. Academic/practical relevance : It is important for regulators to understand how tariff structure interacts with social objectives. This has implications for consumers, regulators, and industry. Methodology : We use a sequential game to analyze the regulator’s social welfare maximization problem in a market with a regulated utility; an unregulated, price-setting, profit-maximizing solar system installer; and customers who endogenously determine whether to adopt solar or not, based on utility tariffs, solar prices, and their heterogeneous usage profiles and generation potentials. Results : We illustrate that the effectiveness of tariff structures is not governed simply by the number of free tariff parameters, but by the functions these parameters serve. In particular, an effective tariff must discriminate among customer usage tiers and between customers with and without rooftop solar to achieve socially desirable outcomes. We present a tariff structure with these two characteristics and show how it can be implemented as a simple buy-all, sell-all tariff while retaining its favorable properties. We illustrate our findings numerically using data from Nevada and New Mexico, two states grappling with this issue.

  abstract     = {We reviewed research papers related to pandemics/epidemics (disease outbreaks of a global/regional scope) published in major operations management, operations research, and management science journals through the end of 2019. We evaluate and categorize these papers. We study research trends, explore research gaps, and provide directions for more efficient and effective research in the future. In addition, our recommendations include the lessons learned from the ongoing pandemic, COVID-19. We discuss papers in the following categories: (a) warning signals/surveillance, (b) disease propagation leading to pandemic conditions, (c) mitigation, (d) vaccines and therapeutics development, (e) resource management, (f) supply chain configuration, (g) decision support systems for managing pandemics/epidemics, and (h) risk assessment.},
