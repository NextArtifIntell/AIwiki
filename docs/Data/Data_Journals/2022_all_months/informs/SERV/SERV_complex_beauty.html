  abstract     = {A key and challenging step toward personalized/precision medicine is the ability to redesign dose-finding clinical trials. This work studies a problem of fully response-adaptive Bayesian design of phase II dose-finding clinical trials with patient information, where the decision maker seeks to identify the right dose for each patient type (often defined as an effective target dose for each group of patients) by minimizing the expected (over patient types) variance of the right dose. We formulate this problem by a stochastic dynamic program and exploit a few properties of this class of learning problems. Because the optimal solution is intractable, we propose an approximate policy by an adaptation of a one-step look-ahead framework. We show the optimality of the proposed policy for a setting with homogeneous patients and two doses and find its asymptotic rate of sampling. We adapt a number of commonly applied allocation policies in dose-finding clinical trials, such as posterior adaptive sampling, and test their performance against our proposed policy via extensive simulations with synthetic and real data. Our numerical analyses provide insights regarding the connection between the structure of the dose-response curve for each patient type and the performance of allocation policies. This paper provides a practical framework for the Food and Drug Administration and pharmaceutical companies to transition from the current phase II procedures to the era of personalized dose-finding clinical trials.

We build a stylized model where the seller decides the level of add-on provision to enhance its core service, and consumers make discrete choices between the seller and an outside option. When the seller supplies its service through a single channel, we show that the optimal add-on provision is unimodal in the difference between the seller’s service quality and the outside option, comparable with the existing literature. When the service is supplied through multiple channels, we show that the seller may make nonidentical add-on provisions among channels. If the cost of add-on provision is low, the seller should adopt a differentiation strategy. If the cost is high, the seller should adopt a homogenization strategy. Various extensions are considered to establish the robustness of our results. Funding: P.

This study fills this gap. With a focus on retail brand experience, this study demonstrates that cross-channel integration impacts customer experience and further results in changes in perception and behavioral intention. A conceptual model that illustrates the customers’ psychological mechanism responding to cross-channel integration was developed. To test the model, a scenario-based online experiment was conducted. The results show that perceived channel integration impacts retail brand experience, which in turn impacts perceived service convenience, satisfaction, and patronage intention. Creating a better experience is a key challenge for retailers to ensure customer satisfaction and brand loyalty. Our results show that cross-channel integration services can play a pivotal role in the shaping of retail brand experience in today’s competitive retail environment that continuously evolves, owing to digital technology.

  abstract     = {In recent years, the diffusion of digital technologies in the service sector offers great potential for growth and success. Today, many companies are trying to launch new digital services on the market to realize this potential. Prior research concludes that the success of such services depends crucially on whether a consumer adopts or rejects them. Hence, by using the methodology of a systematic literature review, this paper identifies key factors that drive a consumer to adopt digital services. As a result of a subsequent classification, the present work distinguishes among three main categories. First are consumer-specific factors relating to individual predispositions, demographics, and awareness factors that can be attributed to the consumer. Second are situation-specific factors, representing the smallest category found, concerning the service environment, the context of service delivery, and situations in which consumers may find themselves before or during the use of digital services. Third are service-specific factors that are mainly determined by individual characteristics and features of these services, such as ease of use, usability, compatibility, and enjoyment. Hence, this study provides a comprehensive overview of determinants affecting consumer’s adoption behavior and suggests several opportunities for future research. Whereas the rich set of identified factors serves as a foundation, it further proposes to what responsible service executives should pay particular attention in order to succeed with digital services.},

  abstract     = {Surgical procedures require a large number of consumable supplies that need to be kept in hospital inventory and transported to the operating rooms (OR) before the surgery. A surgical preference card (SPC) provides a list of items to be prepared for each surgery. For each item, a SPC also specifies how many should be taken to the OR ( fill quantity). As the usage of most consumables in the OR is subject to uncertainty, the cards also specify how many of the filled items should be opened at the beginning of the surgery ( open quantity). The fill and open quantities control the flow of consumables between the hospital inventory and the ORs and directly affect the wastage in ORs. In this work, we formulate the problem of determining the fill and open quantities on the preference cards as a stochastic optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize a weighted sum of the expected wastage and operational costs. We show that, as in the newsvendor problem, the optimal solution for the fill and open quantities takes the form of critical quantiles of the item usage distribution in the OR. The solution form together with historical usage data provide a data-driven approach to design of SPCs, as well as insights on the value of including an open decision. We demonstrate our approach using extensive numerical experiments and real usage data from a Canadian hospital. The results suggest a potential for significant reduction of wastage and operational costs in the ORs.},

  abstract     = {We consider a service that provides different quality levels to customers who are served in groups (referred to as “group service” (GS)). We consider stochastic customer patience and build a multitype service model to maximize service profit. First, we consider a fixed number of service personnel and decompose the model into several subproblems. We then transform the model into a service personnel allocation problem that can be efficiently solved. Furthermore, we use the water-filling theory, together with a dichotomy approach, to design the numerical algorithm to conduct a numerical test based on actual data. The main contributions of this study are as follows. First, we provide the service provider with a service capacity allocation mechanism that can determine the optimal choice of service quality levels, number of service groups of different quality levels, time length of the service registration period, and service prices. Second, we find that under scarce service capacity, the single-type service can be more profitable than the multitype service, and low-quality services have higher marginal profits than high-quality services. However, when service capacity increases to a certain level, the multitype service can be more profitable than the single-type service. Third, we construct a service capacity decision mechanism and demonstrate the influence of service quality on the total number of service personnel and service groups. The conclusions are potentially useful to GS service providers to effectively make better managerial decisions and improve service profits.},

The first study explores whether context-specific resources contribute to cocreation more than general resources. This hypothesis is found to be valid only for certain service contexts. In-depth interviews are conducted in the second study to understand the phenomenon more deeply. The qualitative study reveals three distinct types of resources: general, context-specific, and interpersonal resources. In the third study, a scenario-based experimental study is conducted to test the hypotheses, which are confirmed. We conclude that context-specific resources more directly shape cocreation, moderated by perceived level of cocreation potential.

The design of services in the context of a pandemic requires balancing between two objectives: (i) special measures must be implemented to maintain physical separation among people to reduce the risk of infection, and (ii) these sanitary measures also reduce process capacity, thereby increasing the waiting times of users. We study this problem in the context of election processes, in which balancing waiting time with public safety is of first order relevance to ensuring voter turnout, using as a real-world application the Chilean 2020 national referendum. Analyzing this problem requires a multidisciplinary approach that consists of integrating randomized experiments to measure how voters weigh infection risk relative to waiting time and stochastic modeling/discrete event simulation to prescribe recommendations for the service design—specifically setting capacity limits to trade off between overcrowding and process efficiency. Overall, our results shows that infection risk is an important factor affecting voter turnout during a pandemic and that capacity limits can be a useful design tool to balance these risks with other service quality measures. Some of these findings were considered in the guidelines that Servel provided to manage capacity and voter arrival patterns at voting centers.},

  abstract     = {Coronaviruses have caused multiple global pandemics. As an emerging epidemic, the coronavirus disease relies on nonpharmacological interventions to control its spread. However, the specific effects of these interventions are unknown. To evaluate their effects, we extend the susceptible–latent–infectious–recovered model to include suspected cases, confirmed cases, and their contacts and to embed isolation, close contact tracing, and quarantine into transmission dynamics. The model simplifies the population into two parts: the undiscovered part (where the virus spreads freely—the extent of freedom is determined by the strength of social distancing policy) and the discovered part (where the cases are incompletely isolated or quarantined). Through the isolation of the index case (suspected or confirmed case) and the subsequent tracing and quarantine of its close contacts, the infections flow from the undiscovered part to the discovered part. In our case study, multisource data of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) in Wuhan were collected to validate the model, the parameters were calibrated based on the prediction of the actual number of infections, and then the time-varying effective reproduction number was obtained to measure the transmissibility of COVID-19 in Wuhan, revealing the timeliness and lag effect of the nonpharmacological interventions adopted there. Finally, we simulated the situation in the absence of a strict social distancing policy. Results show that the current efforts of isolation, close contact tracing, and quarantine can take the epidemic curve to the turning point, but the epidemic could be far from over; there were still 4,035 infected people, and 1,584 latent people in the undiscovered part on March 11, 2020, when the epidemic was actually over with a strict social distancing policy.},

Surprisingly, the analysis shows that partnering with third-party app delivery services before COVID improved firms’ resilience, whereas during the pandemic, these partnerships have a negative impact on restaurant survival.

As a result, they need to make tactical planning decisions such as whether to partner with online platforms, to form their own delivery team, or both. In this paper, we develop an integrated prediction-decision model to analyze the profit of combining the two approaches and to decide the needed number of drivers under stochastic demand. We first use the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model to forecast future infected cases in a given region and then construct an autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA) regression model to predict food-ordering demand. Using predicted demand samples, we formulate a stochastic integer program to optimize food delivery plans. We conduct numerical studies using COVID-19 data and food-ordering demand data collected from local restaurants in Nuevo Leon, Mexico, from April to October 2020, to show results for helping restaurants build contingency plans under rapid market changes. Our method can be used under unexpected demand surges, various infection/vaccination status, and demand patterns. Our results show that a restaurant can benefit from partnering with third-party delivery platforms when (i) the subscription fee is low, (ii) customers can flexibly decide whether to order from platforms or from restaurants directly, (iii) customers require more efficient delivery, (iv) average delivery distance is long, or (v) demand variance is high.},

The disruption brought by the pandemic has highlighted the relevance of responsiveness and agility in service chains in particular. The unprecedented nature of the pandemic, however, has made design of agile and responsive supply chains difficult, especially for services that draw on intangible, unique resources. In this paper, we develop relevant—and thus far largely absent—theory for the design of service supply chains through a model of service supply chain fit that will guide service firms to prepare better for COVID and future threats. Our model guides the identification of the right supply chain (responsive, efficient, or agile) for services based on their operant resources, which are the intangible resources that act on other resources. Using a qualitative study, we first draw on service-dominant logic and supply chain fit framework to develop the concept of service supply chain fit; that is, the strategic consistency between a service firm’s operant resources and its supply chain. We then validate our model using survey data. The results indicate that service supply chain acts as both moderator and mediator for the relationship between operant resources and firm performance. Our findings indicate that, unless managers view service supply chain fit strategically and invest in developing operant resources for the right supply chain, future COVID-like disruptions may continue to severely impact firm performance.},

  abstract     = {The fashion industry is adapting to the new situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic by changing the structure of its supply chain, much like other industries that experience exogenous shocks. The pandemic affected conditions of apparel retailers: downstream among consumers and upstream among suppliers. It induced retailers to accelerate the adoption of technologies to make their supply chains more flexible and resilient. Before COVID-19, the apparel industry had gradually adopted virtual dressing room (VDR) technologies and crowd wisdom software, both of which reduce the risk associated with online purchases. Apparel retailers also altered the structure of their supply chains by outsourcing product turns via third-party logistics providers. This article analyzes how changes in market demand and supply conditions following the outbreak of COVID-19 accelerated the adoption of VDR technologies. The analysis is based on a conceptual microeconomic model of adopting technologies and changes in the supply chain. We support our theoretical findings with business cases. Understanding the nonlinear relationships among changes in demand, supply chains, and retail technology adoption triggered by exogenous shocks is essential for managers and affects the quality of service.},

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally changed professional service firm (PSF) operations, most visible perhaps in the transition to a work from home economy. This study is a deep dive into management consulting (a common type of PSF) and describes the impact of the pandemic on short- and long-term operations. It uses a mixed-method approach to data collection (primary/secondary and quantitative/qualitative) to explain the operational adaptations that consulting firms made in response to the pandemic and the service innovations that resulted. During the pandemic, disruptions to client mix, customer experience, customer acquisition, and employee lifestyle triggered new organizational challenges in strategic planning, marketing, employee relations, and cost control. Firms responded by modifying operational characteristics (e.g., customer engagement, customization, knowledge intensity, and capital intensity). Successful operational adaptations led to service innovation (most commonly in product, strategy, delivery, and marketing). The study finishes with an exploration of how the lessons learned in management consulting may provide a road map for other PSFs and more generalized services in a post-pandemic world.},

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the instrumental role of supply chains in delivering economic, human, and societal value. At the same time, the pandemic has intensified interest among businesses, governments, and academics to examine environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. In today’s hyper-globalized economy, ESG measures are futile unless they explicitly incorporate a firm’s end-to-end operations throughout its entire supply chain. On the other hand, well-calibrated ESG measures should play a central role in guiding a firms’ day-to-day supply chain management practices. To illustrate the value of unifying ESG and end-to-end supply chain thinking, we present three supply chain cases that arose amid the COVID-19 pandemic, involving online platforms; public health supply chains; and vaccine development, manufacturing, and distribution, respectively. Drawn from these three cases, we spotlight some new research opportunities in both ESG and supply chain management.},

  abstract     = {Human breast milk provides nutritional and medicinal benefits that are important to infants, particularly those who are premature or ill. Donor human milk, collected, processed, and dispensed via milk banks, is the standard of care for infants in need whose mothers cannot provide an adequate supply of milk. In this paper, we focus on streamlining donor human milk processing at nonprofit milk banks. On days that milk is processed, milk banks thaw frozen deposits, pool together milk from multiple donors to meet nutritional specifications of predefined milk types, bottle and divide the pools into batches, and pasteurize the batches using equipment with various degrees of labor requirements. Limitations in staffing and equipment and the need to follow strict healthcare protocols require productive, expedient, and frugal pooling strategies. We formulate integer programs that optimize the batching-pasteurizing decisions and the integrated pooling-batching-pasteurizing decisions by minimizing labor and meeting target production goals. We further strengthen these formulations by establishing valid inequalities for the integrated model. Numerical results demonstrate a reduction in the optimality gap through the strengthened formulation versus the basic integer programming formulation. A case study at Mothers’ Milk Bank of North Texas demonstrates significant improvement in meeting milk type production targets and a modest reduction in labor compared with former practice. The model is in use at Mothers’ Milk Bank of North Texas and has effectively improved their production balance across different milk types.},

  abstract     = {In populous metropolitan areas, the free-floating bicycle-sharing system (FFBSS) acts as an innovative urban mobility as a service, which provides an ease-of-use feature and extra flexibility in contrast to the traditional shared bicycles with docks. In consideration of customer behaviors, such as abandonment and retrial, which occur in FFBSS, a redistribution strategy for shared bicycles among different user-density locations is presented with an aim to diminish the total operational cost while enhancing the overall service level. To formulate the user and multitype shared bicycle–arrival patterns as nonhomogeneous queues, our results provide a tractable analytical paradigm for a time-varying balancing strategy for FFBSS. The bicycle variation at each virtual zone after each redistribution is determined via a nonstationary queueing model, in which the service time, patience time, and research delay are all subject to general distribution. Then, the bicycle-deployment strategy is evaluated with respect to average queueing length and abandonment rate during a normal workday based on a tailored nonhomogeneous probabilistic matching queue. To verify the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the proposed bicycle-redistribution strategy, multiple simulation runs are conducted with respect to various times of the day. It shows that the resulting optimal rebalancing strategy is batch-based in synchrony with the time heterogeneity in the traffic demand. Furthermore, several managerial insights are provided to shed light on the rule of thumb in practical FFBSS redistribution coordination.},
