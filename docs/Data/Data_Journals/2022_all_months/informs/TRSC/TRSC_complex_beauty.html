  abstract     = {We study an integrated airline schedule design and fleet assignment model for constructing schedules by simultaneously selecting from a pool of optional flights and assigning fleet types to these scheduled flights. This is a crucial tactical decision that greatly influences airline profits. As passenger demand is often substitutable among available fare products (defined as a combination of an itinerary and a fare class) between the same origin–destination pair, we present an optimization approach that includes a passenger choice model for fare product selections. To tackle the formidable computational challenge of solving this large-scale network design problem, we propose a decomposition approach based on partitioning the flight network into smaller subnetworks by exploiting weak dependencies in network structure. The decomposition relies on a series of approximation analyses and a novel fare split problem to allocate optimally the fares of products that are shared by flights in different subnetworks. We present several reformulations that represent fleet assignment and schedule decisions and formally characterize their relative strengths. This gives rise to a new reformulation that is able to trade off strength and size flexibly. We conduct detailed computational experiments using two realistically sized airline instances to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Under a simulated passenger booking environment with both perfect and imperfect forecasts, we show that the fleeting and scheduling decisions informed by our approach deliver significant and robust profit improvement over all benchmark implementations and previous models in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Route choice models in public transport have been discussed for a long time. The main reason why a passenger chooses a specific path is usually based on its length or travel time. However, also the ticket price that passengers have to pay may influence their decision because passengers prefer cheaper paths over more expensive ones. In this paper, we deal with the cheapest ticket problem , which asks for a cheapest ticket to travel between a pair of stations. The complexity and the algorithmic approach to solve this problem depend crucially on the underlying fare structure ; for example, it is easy if the ticket price is proportional to the distance traveled (as in distance tariff fare structures), but may become NP-complete in zone tariff fare structures. We hence discuss the cheapest ticket problem for different variations of distance- and zone-based fare structures. We start by modeling the respective fare structure mathematically, then identify its main properties, and finally provide a polynomial algorithm, or prove NP-completeness of the cheapest ticket problem. We also provide general results on the combination of two fare structures, which is often observed in practice.},

  abstract     = {In many European metropolitan areas, the urban transit system is a mixture of schedule- and frequency-based services. This study proposes an integrated transit frequency and schedule design problem (ITFSDP), where frequencies and schedules are simultaneously determined, and develops a biobjective model for the ITFSDP to minimize operation costs and total passenger-perceived generalized travel cost. Meanwhile, the passengers’ route choice behavior is described by the bounded stochastic user equilibrium (BSUE). The in-vehicle congestion effect is represented using a set of constraints that differ in terms of the sitting and standing costs as sitting and standing passengers perceive crowding differently. This set of constraints captures the realistic behavioral feature that having occupied a seat, users remain seated at subsequent stops in the same vehicle. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, which is subsequently linearized to a mixed integer linear programming problem and solved using a branch and bound algorithm. A column generation and reduction phase is embedded in the solution algorithm to obtain the bounded choice set according to the BSUE constraints. Experiments are conducted to illustrate the model’s properties and the performance of the solution method. In particular, we demonstrate a Braess-like paradoxical phenomenon in the context of transit scheduling and highlight that well-synchronized transit services can deteriorate the network performance in terms of the total passengers’ generalized travel cost when considering passenger congestion costs because of crowding.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow predictions are central to a wealth of problems in transportation. Path choice models can be used for this purpose, and in state-of-the-art models—so-called recursive path choice (RPC) models—the choice of a path is formulated as a sequential arc choice process using undiscounted Markov decision process (MDP) with an absorbing state. The MDP has a utility maximization objective with unknown parameters that are estimated based on data. The estimation and prediction using RPC models require repeatedly solving value functions that are solutions to the Bellman equation. Although there are several examples of successful applications of RPC models in the literature, the convergence of the value iteration method has not been studied. We aim to address this gap. For the two closed-form models in the literature—recursive logit (RL) and nested recursive logit (NRL)—we study the convergence properties of the value iteration method. In the case of the RL model, we show that the operator associated with the Bellman equation is a contraction under certain assumptions on the parameter values. On the contrary, the operator in the NRL case is not a contraction. Focusing on the latter, we study two algorithms designed to improve upon the basic value iteration method. Extensive numerical results based on two real data sets show that the least squares approach we propose outperforms two value iteration methods.},

  abstract     = {Departure time choice models play a crucial role in determining the traffic load in transportation systems. Most studies that consider departure time user equilibrium (DTUE) problems make assumptions on the user characteristics (e.g., distribution of desired arrival time and trip length) or dynamic traffic model (e.g., classic bathtub or point queue models) in order to analyze the problem. This paper relaxes these assumptions and introduces a new framework to model and analyze the DTUE problem based on the so-called mean field games (MFGs) theory. MFGs allow us to define players at the microscopic level similar to classical game theory models, translating the effect of players’ decisions to macroscopic models. In this paper, we first present a continuous departure time choice model and investigate the equilibria of the system. Specifically, we demonstrate the existence of the equilibrium and characterize the DTUE. Then, a discrete approximation of the system is provided based on deterministic differential game models to numerically obtain the equilibrium of the system. To examine the efficiency of the proposed model, we compare it with the departure time choice models in the literature. We apply our framework to a standard test case and observe that the solutions obtained based on our model are 5.6\% better in terms of relative cost compared with the solutions determined based on previous studies. Moreover, our proposed model converges with fewer iterations than the reference solution method in the literature. Finally, the model is scaled up to the real test case corresponding to the whole Lyon metropolis with a real demand pattern. The results show that the proposed framework is able to tackle a much larger test case than usual to include multiple preferred travel times and heterogeneous trip lengths more accurately than existing models.},

This paper considers the cases of smooth and strictly concave travel utility functions and of α – β – γ tastes. For each it develops a customized solution algorithm, which it applies to several examples, and for α – β – γ tastes, it derives analytical properties as well. Departures may occur continuously, in departure masses, or a mix of the two. Additionally, hypercongestion may occur in the social optimum.

  abstract     = {We seek to determine in what geographies autonomous vehicle assisted delivery is most valuable for last-mile delivery. To build insights across urban-to-rural settings, we conduct a case study by generating test instances that reflect real-world geographies. We integrate real-world data for these instances, including driving and walking times, as well as obstacles, such as one-way streets, and their impact on last-mile delivery. We model the capacitated autonomous vehicle assisted delivery problem as an integer program on a general graph. To solve this model on realistically sized instances, we exploit the structure of the optimal solution to develop a number of preprocessing techniques to reduce the large number of variables present in the generic problem. We also introduce valid inequalities that raise the lower bound and reduce the size of the branch-and-bound tree. Autonomous vehicle assisted delivery reduces the completion time of the delivery tour and provides the most cost-effective business model in all customer geographies. In particular, a delivery person saves more time in urban environments than in rural environments. These savings are the result of both a reduction in the time to park but also in the amount of walking that the delivery person does. This increased productivity could reduce fleet size and ultimately the number of vehicles on the road. These conclusions support businesses with urban deliveries considering investment in this technology. However, higher savings in rural environments may be achieved by reducing the loading time.},

  abstract     = {The advent of automated and semiautomated driving technologies is prompting a reevaluation of the benefits of truck platooning. Whereas the effect of truck platooning on fuel costs is relatively well studied, automated driving enables further cost reductions in the form of labor savings that has, heretofore, been sparingly investigated. The degree to which such savings can be realized depends upon myriad factors. Foremost among them are driver payment policies and platoon formation procedures. Automated driving technology reduces the demands on a platoon’s follower vehicles, which, in turn, justifies modified driver compensation structures. However, reductions in labor expenditures are often limited by load characteristics that inhibit platoon formation. Therefore, this research sets forth a suite of related truck platooning problems that correspond to alternative assumptions about unloaded-truck compensation and shipment temporal flexibility. The computational complexities of these problem variants are examined, N P -hardness is proved for the suite, and other useful mathematical properties are derived. Extensive empirical testing using the U.S. highway system explores the effect of network topology, commerce flow, and platooning labor savings on each problem’s optimal solution, tractability, and other related metrics. Multiple heuristics are also designed and tested for larger-scale instances. In so doing, this research not only explores the effects of varied factors on platooning labor costs but it also provides practical means to identify high-quality, labor-cost-reducing routes.},

After designing a comprehensive set of experiments, we employ both models using a dynamic implementation mechanism to assess the benefits of using IALI. Our statistical analysis reveals that (1) utilizing IALI can significantly improve a single-truck company’s profits, by as much as almost 30\% on average, and (2) the impact of using IALI can be affected by other factors (e.g., network size). In another set of experiments, we examine the benefits of IALI in a new environment where there are two classes of shippers, high risk and low risk. The results suggest that the potential benefits can be even larger with two classes of shippers. Last, we collect data over two three-week periods for a single-truck company that operates in Ontario, Canada, and we apply our methods for evaluating the benefits of IALI.},

We consider the variant of the problem with precedence constraints for unloading and loading freight at satellites. In this variant allows for storage and consolidation of freight at satellites. Thus, the total transportation cost may decrease in comparison with the alternative variant with exact freight synchronization at satellites. We suggest a mixed integer programming formulation for the problem with an exponential number of route variables and an exponential number of precedence constraints that link first-echelon and second-echelon routes. Routes at the second echelon connecting satellites and clients may consist of multiple trips and visit several satellites. A branch-cut-and-price algorithm is proposed to solve efficiently the problem. This is the first exact algorithm in the literature for the multi-trip variant of the problem. We also present a postprocessing procedure to check whether the solution can be transformed to avoid freight consolidation and storage without increasing its transportation cost. It is shown that all single-trip literature instances solved to optimality admit optimal solutions of the same cost for both variants of the problem either with precedence constraints or with exact synchronization constraints. Experimental results reveal that our algorithm can be used to solve these instances significantly faster than another recent approach proposed in the literature.},

  abstract     = {The multi-trip vehicle routing problem (MTVRP) extends the well-known VRP by allowing vehicles to perform several trips in a workday. The motivation arises from the new challenges in city logistics that push companies to use smaller and cleaner vehicles such as cargo bikes. With the integration of small vehicles into the fleet, many companies start to operate with a heterogeneous fleet and use multiple depots located in the city centers to reload the small vehicles. Inspired by these new challenges the companies face, we study the heterogeneous fleet multi-depot MTVRP with time windows under shared depot resources where small and large vehicles have different travel times in certain areas. We formulate this problem using workday variables and propose a branch and price algorithm that exhibits an enhanced performance by a new heuristic algorithm based on the reduction in the graph size. The proposed algorithm introduces a new way to compute the completion bounds using the iterative structure of the state-space augmenting algorithm and eliminates the need for solving a separate relaxation. We conduct experiments on modified small- and medium-size instances from Solomon’s benchmark set. The results of our computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm is very effective and can solve instances with up to 40 customers, three depots, and two types of vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Warehouses are becoming increasingly robotized. Autonomous rack-climbing robots have recently been introduced in e-commerce fulfillment centers. The robots not only retrieve loads from any level in a rack but also, roam the warehouse and bring the loads to order picking stations without using conveyors or lifts. This paper models and analyzes this system under both single and dual commands with different robot assignment (dedicated versus shared) and storage location assignment (class-based and random) policies. We study these policies in the presence of robot congestion. We evaluate the impact of two blocking protocols, a wait-outside-aisle policy and a block-and-recirculate policy, on the order throughput time. The system is modeled using semiopen queuing networks (SOQNs) for the different operating policies. The analytical models are validated using simulation. We also use this model to compare this system with a shuttle-based system. The results show that (1) the choice of the wait-outside-aisle policy or the block-and-recirculate policy mainly depends on the number of the robots in the system and the throughput requirement and that (2) the dedicated robot assignment policy can be an attractive policy, especially for a large system.},

Such an integrated production-distribution problem is complicated, and the current commercial mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) solvers cannot obtain favorable solutions for the medium- and large-sized problem instances. Therefore, we propose an unsupervised learning-driven matheuristic that uses easily obtainable solution values (e.g., solutions associated with the linear programming relaxation) to build clustering models and integrates the clustering information with a genetic algorithm to progressively improve feasible solutions. Then we verify the performance of the proposed matheuristic by comparing its computational results with those of the rolling horizon algorithm, a non-cluster-driven matheuristic, and a commercial MILP solver. The computational results show that, under the same computing resources, the proposed matheuristic can deliver better production-distribution decisions. Specifically, it reduces the total system costs by 15\% for the tested instances when compared with the ones found by the commercial MILP solver. Additionally, we apply the proposed matheuristic to a related production-distribution problem in the literature and obtain 152 equivalent or new best-known solutions out of 200 benchmark test instances.},

The concavity arises from the economies of scale in production, inventory, or handling at the facilities and from the consolidation of flows for transportation and transshipment on the links connecting the facilities. Given the discrete nature of the problem, it is naturally formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program that uses binary variables for locational decisions and continuous variables for routing flows. We present an alternative formulation that only uses continuous variables and discontinuous functions, resulting in a nonlinear program with a concave objective function. Our main goal is to computationally compare these two modeling approaches under the same solution framework. In particular, we present an exact branch-and-bound algorithm that uses (integer) linear relaxations of the proposed formulations to optimally solve large-scale instances. The algorithm is enhanced with a cost-dependent spatial branching strategy and preprocessing step to improve its convergence. Extensive computational experiments are performed to assess the performance of the exact algorithm. Based on real location data from 3,109 counties in the contiguous United States, we also present a sensitivity analysis to showcase the impact of considering concave costs in location and assignment decisions.},

A traveler’s choice of housing location is modeled by a logit-type demand distribution function based on air quality, housing rent, and perceived travel costs. Air quality, or air pollutants, within the modeling region are governed by the vehicle-emission model and the advection-diffusion equation for dispersion. In this study, the housing-location problem is formulated as a fixed-point problem and the predictive continuum dynamic user-optimal model with departure-time consideration is formulated as a variational inequality problem. The Lax-Friedrichs scheme, the fast-sweeping method, the Goldstein-Levitin-Polyak projection algorithm, and self-adaptive successive averages are adopted to discretize and solve these problems. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the characteristics of the proposed housing-location choice problem with consideration of air quality and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution algorithms.},

We show that introducing context-specific features, common in many school districts, can lead to a new time-indexed integer linear programming (ILP) formulation. Based on a strengthened version of the linear relaxation of the ILP, we develop a dependent randomized rounding algorithm that yields near-optimal solutions for large-scale problem instances. The efficient formulation and solution approach enable quick generation of multiple solutions to facilitate strategic planning, which we demonstrate with data from two public school districts in the United States.

This is normally modelled by segmenting the network and forbidding two vehicles to occupy the same segment at the same time. This approximation is often insufficient or too restraining. This study develops and systematises the use of conflict regions to model spatial proximity constraints. By extending the classical disjunctive programming approach to job-shop scheduling problems, we demonstrate how conflict regions can be exploited to efficiently schedule the collective movements of a set of vehicles, in this case aircraft moving on an airport ground network. We also show how conflict regions can be used in the short-term control of vehicle speeds to avoid collisions and deadlocks. The overall approach was implemented in a software system for air traffic management at airports and successfully evaluated for scheduling and guiding airplanes during an extensive human in the loop simulation exercise for the Budapest airport. Through simulations, we also provide numerical results to assess the computational efficiency of our scheduling algorithm.},

Planning the loading process consists of setting the start times for the loading process and depletion of the baggage storage as well as assigning handling facilities and workers. Flight delays and uncertain arrival times of passengers at the check-in counters require plans that are adjusted dynamically every few minutes and, hence, an efficient planning procedure. We propose a model formulation and a solution procedure that utilize historical flight data to generate reliable plans in a rolling planning fashion, allowing problem parameters to be updated in each reoptimization. To increase the tractability of the problem, we employ a column generation–based heuristic in which new schedules and work profiles are generated in subproblems, which are solved as dynamic programs. In a computational study, we demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed procedure based on real-world data from a major European airport. The results show that (i) the procedure outperforms both a constructive heuristic that mimics human decision making and a meta heuristic (tabu search) and (ii) being able to dynamically (re)allocate baggage handlers leads to improved solutions with considerably fewer left bags.},

Although minimizing boarding time therefore is the most important goal from an economic perspective, previous efforts to design efficient boarding strategies apparently never tackled this task directly. In this paper, we first rigorously define the problem and prove its NP-hardness. Although this generally justifies the development of inexact solution methods, we show that all commonly discussed boarding strategies may in fact give solutions that are far from optimal. We complement these theoretical findings by a simple time-aware boarding strategy with guaranteed approximation quality (under reasonable assumptions) as well as a local improvement heuristic and an exact mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation. Our numerical experiments with simulation data show that for several airplane cabin layouts, provably high-quality or even optimal solutions can be obtained within reasonable time in practice by means of our MIP approach. We also empirically assess the sensitivity of boarding strategies with respect to disruptions of the prescribed boarding sequences and identify robustness against such disruptions as a bottleneck for further improvements.},

These include dynamic charging of EVs while driving, speed-dependent energy consumption, and nonlinear charging functions that depend on the battery’s state of charge and the charging time. A generic way of dealing with these aspects is introduced through the concept of an energy-indexed graph, which is used to derive an integer linear programming formulation and a solution framework based on branch and cut. Efficient construction heuristics and a local search for approximately solving large-scale instances are proposed. A computational study is performed on realistic problem instances.

These platforms must decide which vehicle should pick up which type of customer based on the vehicle’s battery level and customer’s travel distance. We design dynamic vehicle allocation policies for matching appropriate vehicles to customers using a Markov decision process model. To obtain the model parameters, we first model the system as a semi-open queuing network (SOQN) with multiple synchronization stations. At these stations, customers with varied battery demands are matched with semi-shared vehicles that hold sufficient remaining battery levels. If a vehicle’s battery level drops below a threshold, it is routed probabilistically to a nearby charging station for charging. We solve the analytical model of the SOQN and obtain approximate system performance measures, which are validated using simulation. With inputs from the SOQN model, the Markov decision process minimizes both customer waiting cost and lost demand and finds a good heuristic vehicle allocation policy. The experiments show that the heuristic policy is near optimal in small-scale networks and outperforms benchmark policies in large-scale realistic scenarios. An interesting finding is that reserving idle vehicles to wait for future short-distance customer arrivals can be beneficial even when long-distance customers are waiting.},

  abstract     = {Over the last decades, shared mobility systems have become an integral part of inner-city mobility. Modern systems allow one-way rentals, that is, customers can drop off the vehicle at a different location to where they began their trip. A prominent example is car sharing. Indeed, this work was motivated by the insight we gained in collaborating closely with Europe’s largest car sharing provider, Share Now. In car sharing, as well as in shared mobility systems in general, pricing optimization has turned out to be a promising means of increasing profit while challenged by limited vehicle supply and asymmetric demand across time and space. Thus, in practice, providers increasingly use minute pricing that is differentiated according to where a rental originates, that is, considering its location and the time of day. In research, however, such approaches have not been considered yet. In this paper, we therefore introduce the corresponding origin-based differentiated, profit-maximizing pricing problem for shared mobility systems. The problem is to determine spatially and temporally differentiated minute prices, taking network effects on the supply side and several practice relevant aspects into account. Based on a deterministic network flow model, we formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program and prove that it is NP-hard. For its solution, we propose a temporal decomposition approach based on approximate dynamic programming. The approach integrates a value function approximation to incorporate future profits and account for network effects. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate the benefits of capturing such effects in pricing generally, as well as showing our value function approximation’s ability to anticipate them precisely. Furthermore, in a case study based on Share Now data from Florence in Italy, we observe profit increases of around 9\% compared with constant uniform minute prices, which are still the de facto industry standard.},

Thus, the platform cannot be certain that a supplier will accept an offered request. To mitigate this selection uncertainty, a platform can offer each supplier a menu of requests to choose from. Such menus need to be created carefully because there is a trade-off between selection probability and duplicate selections. In addition to a complex decision space, supplier selection decisions are vast and have systematic implications, impacting the platform’s revenue, other suppliers’ experiences (in the form of duplicate selections), and the request waiting times. Thus, we present a multiple scenario approach, repeatedly sampling potential supplier selections, solving the corresponding two-stage decision problems, and combining the multiple different solutions through a consensus algorithm. Extensive computational results using the Chicago Region as a case study illustrate that our method outperforms a set of benchmark policies. We quantify the value of anticipating supplier selection, offering menus to suppliers, offering requests to multiple suppliers at once, and holistically generating menus with the entire system in mind. Our method leads to more balanced assignments by sacrificing some “easy wins” toward better system performance over time and for all stakeholders involved, including increased revenue for the platform, and decreased match waiting times for suppliers and requests.},

  abstract     = {We study the linked tactical design problems of fleet sizing and partitioning a service region into vehicle routing zones for same-day delivery (SDD) systems. Existing SDD studies focus primarily on operational dispatch problems and do not consider system design questions. Prior work on SDD system design has not considered the fleet sizing decision when a service region may be partitioned into zones dedicated to individual vehicles; such designs have been shown to improve system efficiency in related vehicle routing settings. Using continuous approximations to capture average-case operational behavior, we consider first the problem of independently maximizing the area of a single-vehicle delivery zone. We characterize area-maximizing dispatching policies and leverage these results to develop a procedure for calculating optimal areas as a function of a zone’s distance from the depot, given a maximum number of daily dispatches per vehicle. We then demonstrate how to derive fleet sizes from optimal area functions and propose an associated Voronoi approach to partition the service region into single-vehicle zones. We test the fleet sizing and partitioning approach in a computational study that considers two different service regions and demonstrate its pragmatism and effectiveness via an operational simulation. Using minimal computation, the approach specifies fleet sizes and builds vehicle delivery zones that meet operational requirements, verified by simulation results.},

  abstract     = {In the daily dispatching of last-mile urban delivery, a delivery manager has to consider workload balance among couriers to maintain workforce morale. We consider two types of workload: incentive workload, which relates to the delivery quantity and affects a courier’s income, and effort workload, which relates to the delivery time and affects a courier’s health. Incentive workload has to be balanced over a relatively long period of time (a payroll cycle—a week or a month), whereas effort workload has to be balanced over a relatively short period of time (a shift or a day). We introduce a multi-period workload balancing problem under stochastic demand and dynamic daily dispatching, formulate it as a Markov decision process (MDP), and derive a lower bound on the optimal value of the MDP model. We propose a balanced penalty policy based on cost function approximation and use a hybrid algorithm combining the modified nested partitions method and the KN++ procedure to search for an optimal policy parameter. A comprehensive numerical study demonstrates that the proposed balanced penalty policy performs close to optimal on small instances and outperforms four benchmark policies on large instances, and provides insight into the impact of demand variation and a manager’s importance weighting of operating cost and workload balance.},

Customer satisfaction can be strongly increased by offering narrow delivery time windows. However, there is a tradeoff for the logistics provider because user-friendly delivery time windows might decrease operational flexibility. Against this background, we study the vehicle routing problem with multiple time windows (VRPMTW) that determines a set of optimal routes such that each customer is visited once within one out of several time windows. We present a large neighborhood search–based metaheuristic for the VRPMTW that contains a dynamic programming component to optimally select a time window for each customer on a route, and we present computationally efficient move descriptors for all search operators. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on the Belhaiza instance set for the objectives of minimizing traveled distance and duration. For the former objective, we provide new best-known solutions for 9 of 48 instances, and for the latter, we provide new best-known solutions for 13 of 48 instances. Overall, our algorithm provides the best average solution quality over the full benchmark set among all available algorithms. Furthermore, we design new benchmark instances that reflect planning tasks in user-centered last-mile logistics. Based on these, we present managerial studies that show the benefit of our algorithm for practitioners and allow to derive insights on how to offer time windows to customers. We show that offering multiple time windows can be economically beneficial for the logistics service providers and increases customer flexibility simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {We consider the vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands (VRPSD), a problem in which customer demands are known in distribution at the route planning stage and revealed during route execution upon arrival at each customer. A long-standing open question in the VRPSD concerns the benefits of allowing, during route execution, partial reordering of the planned customer visits. Given the practical importance of this question and the growing interest on the VRPSD under optimal restocking, we study the VRPSD under a recourse policy known as the switch policy. The switch policy is a canonical reoptimization policy that permits only pairs of successive customers to be reordered. We consider this policy jointly with optimal preventive restocking and introduce a branch-cut-and-price algorithm to compute optimal a priori routing plans in this context. At its core, this algorithm features pricing routines where value functions represent the expected cost-to-go along planned routes for all possible states and reordering decisions. To ensure pricing tractability, we adopt a strategy that combines elementary pricing with completion bounds of varying complexity, and we solve the pricing problem without relying on dominance rules. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm for solving instances with up to 50 customers. Notably, they also give us new insights into the value of reoptimization. The switch policy enables significant cost savings over optimal restocking when the planned routes come from an algorithm built on a deterministic approximation of the data, an important scenario given the difficulty of finding optimal VRPSD solutions. The benefits are smaller when comparing optimal a priori VRPSD solutions obtained for both recourse policies. As it appears, further cost savings may require joint reordering and reassignment of customer visits among vehicles when the context permits.},

In this paper, we study the dynamic intra-cell repositioning of bikes by a single mover in free-floating bike-sharing systems. Considering that users can drop off bikes almost anywhere in free-floating systems, we study the simultaneous reposition of bikes among gathering points and collection of bikes scattered along the paths between gathering points under stochastic demands at both the gathering points and along the paths. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), design a policy function approximation (PFA) algorithm, and apply the optimal computing budget allocation method (OCBA) to search for the optimal policy parameters. We perform a comprehensive numerical study using test instances constructed based on the real data set of a major free-floating bike-sharing company in China, which demonstrates the outperformance of the proposed PFA policy against the benchmark policies and the practical implications on the value of repositioning and the impact of bike scatteredness.},

  abstract     = {Traffic congestion has become a serious issue around the globe, partly owing to single-occupancy commuter trips. Ridesharing can present a suitable alternative for serving commuter trips. However, there are several important obstacles that impede ridesharing systems from becoming a viable mode of transportation, including the lack of a guarantee for a ride back home as well as the difficulty of obtaining a critical mass of participants. This paper addresses these obstacles by introducing a traveler incentive program (TIP) to promote community-based ridesharing with a ride back home guarantee among commuters. The TIP program allocates incentives to (1) directly subsidize a select set of ridesharing rides and (2) encourage a small, carefully selected set of travelers to change their travel behavior (i.e., departure or arrival times). We formulate the underlying ride-matching problem as a budget-constrained min-cost flow problem and present a Lagrangian relaxation-based algorithm with a worst-case optimality bound to solve large-scale instances of this problem in polynomial time. We further propose a polynomial-time, budget-balanced version of the problem. Numerical experiments suggest that allocating subsidies to change travel behavior is significantly more beneficial than directly subsidizing rides. Furthermore, using a flat tax rate as low as 1\% can double the system’s social welfare in the budget-balanced variant of the incentive program.},

The household parents daily pass through an upstream bottleneck with a limited capacity before a school and drop off their children. Then, they traverse the downstream bottleneck common to both household and individual commuters and arrive at the workplace. We explore the effects of staggering policy, that is, staggering work and school start times, on the distribution of traffic congestion and social welfare. We analytically solve all the equilibrium cases and reveal all the traffic congestion patterns. The results reveal that the staggering policy may be harmful in certain cases. When the demand of individuals is relatively low, the staggering policy may not improve social welfare. When the demand of individuals is high, social welfare can be significantly improved if the schedule gap between the work start time and school start time is optimized. The effects of the staggering policy on system performance are examined. We derive a Pareto frontier, which provides a good candidate set for policymakers when the two system performance measures, that is, the total system cost and the total congestion cost, are considered. Our results show that the optimal staggering policy on system performance depends on the demand distribution of the two groups. When the demand of individuals is high, there exists a unique optimal staggering policy that optimizes system performance. However, when the demand of individuals is low, the optimal staggering policy should be selected from the Pareto frontier. Furthermore, we re-examine the capacity expansion paradox under the staggering policy. Our study shows the capacity expansion at the downstream bottleneck can always reduce the total system cost. However, the paradoxical phenomenon may arise when the capacity of the upstream bottleneck is expanded, but it can be eliminated if the schedule gap is properly designed.},

  abstract     = {Strategy-based equilibrium traffic assignment (SETA) problems define travel choice broadly as a strategy rather than a simple path. Travelers navigating through a network based on a strategy end up following a hyperpath. SETA is well suited to represent a rich set of travel choices that take place en route at nodes, such as transit passengers’ transfer decisions, truckers’ bidding decisions, and taxi drivers’ reposition decisions. This paper recognizes and highlights the commonalities among classical and emerging SETA problems and proposes to unify them within the same modeling framework, built on the concept of a hypergraph. A generic hyperbush algorithm (HBA) is developed by decomposing a hypergraph into destination-based hyperbushes. By constructing hyperbushes and limiting traffic assignments to them, HBA promises to obtain more precise solutions to larger instances of SETA problems at a lower computational cost, both in terms of CPU time and memory consumption. To demonstrate its generality and efficiency, we tailor HBA to solve two SETA problems. The results confirm that HBA consistently outperforms the benchmark algorithms in the literature, including two state-of-the-art hyperpath-based algorithms. To obtain high-quality equilibrium solutions for SETA instances of practical size, HBA runs up to five times faster than the best competitor with a fraction of its memory consumption.},

  abstract     = {Forecasting short-term ridership of different origin-destination pairs (i.e., OD matrix) is crucial to the real-time operation of a metro system. However, this problem is notoriously difficult due to the large-scale, high-dimensional, noisy, and highly skewed nature of OD matrices. In this paper, we address the short-term OD matrix forecasting problem by estimating a low-rank high-order vector autoregression (VAR) model. We reconstruct this problem as a data-driven reduced-order regression model and estimate it using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). The VAR coefficients estimated by DMD are the best-fit (in terms of Frobenius norm) linear operator for the rank-reduced full-size data. To address the practical issue that metro OD matrices cannot be observed in real time, we use the boarding demand to replace the unavailable OD matrices. Moreover, we consider the time-evolving feature of metro systems and improve the forecast by exponentially reducing the weights for historical data. A tailored online update algorithm is then developed for the high-order weighted DMD model (HW-DMD) to update the model coefficients at a daily level, without storing historical data or retraining. Experiments on data from two large-scale metro systems show that the proposed HW-DMD is robust to noisy and sparse data, and significantly outperforms baseline models in forecasting both OD matrices and boarding flow. The online update algorithm also shows consistent accuracy over a long time, allowing us to maintain an HW-DMD model at much low costs.},

In doing so, we avoid imposing any predetermined structure to the timetable, and instead control the trains individually to best match passenger demand. We consider that trains may short turn, that is, trains that are not required to serve the line from terminal to terminal, but instead may reverse direction before reaching the terminal. We present a mixed integer linear programming formulation for the demand-driven timetabling problem of a two-directional metro corridor with short turning. Furthermore, we develop an efficient exact algorithm using cut generation for an alternative formulation with an exponential number of constraints, and derive two classes of valid inequalities. We evaluate the proposed formulation and algorithm considering seven possible cut generation strategies on a number of test instances from artificially generated lines and on two test beds derived from real-world lines. Through the computational experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed algorithm and the added value of the proposed strategy in terms of passengers’ waiting time.},

Identifying critical platforms and tracks is a fundamental and significant step to improving a metro system&#39;s safety and passenger satisfaction, which has never been examined in the literature. Typical critical link analysis for road networks cannot be applied to metro network systems because of the different characteristics of these two transportation modes, such as vehicle operation. In addition, the existing studies on critical stations for metro networks cannot reveal the different importance of platforms involved in one station. This study proposes a novel framework to identify critical platforms and tracks for a metro system with consideration of its spatial characteristics and temporal dynamics using smart card data. We first develop an entirely directed model to describe a metro system where nodes and arcs represent platforms and tracks, respectively. Critical platforms and tracks are then defined and assessed based on dynamic waiting time and onboard crowdedness. The proposed approach is validated by historical smart card data of the Shenzhen Metro system, and the results show time-variant rankings of critical platforms and tracks over the time of the day and the day of the week.},

As changing these times can lead to customer service and operational issues, we presume a carrier seeks to do so for a limited number of shipments. We propose a new variant of the SSNDP, the flexible scheduled service network design problem, that identifies the shipments for which these times should be changed to minimize total transportation and handling costs. We present a solution approach for this problem that outperforms a commercial optimization solver on instances derived from the operations of a U.S. less-than-truckload freight transportation carrier. With an extensive computational study, we study the savings potential of leveraging flexibility and the operational settings that are fertile ground for doing so.},

  abstract     = {Split delivery routing problems are concerned with serving the demand of a set of customers with a fleet of capacitated vehicles at minimum cost, where a customer can be served by more than one vehicle if beneficial. They generalize traditional variants of routing problems and have applications in commercial and humanitarian logistics. Previously, formulations involving only commonly used arc-based variables have provided only relaxations for split delivery variants, as the possibility of visiting customers more than once introduces modeling challenges. The only known compact formulations are based on variables indexed by vehicle or by visit number and perform poorly when using general-purpose integer programming software. We present compact formulations that avoid the use of these types of variables and that can model split delivery routing problems with and without time windows. Computational experiments demonstrate their superior performance over existing compact formulations. We also develop a branch-and-cut algorithm that balances the efficiency derived from a relaxed formulation with the strength derived from one of the proposed formulations and demonstrate its efficacy on a large set of benchmark instances. The algorithm solves 95 instances to proven optimality for the first time and improves the best known lower and/or upper bound for many other instances.},

Our online-offline method pairs online simulations with an offline approximation of the delivery vehicles’ routing policy, again achieved via supervised learning. Our computational study shows that both methods perform comparably to a full near-optimal online simulation at a fraction of the computational time. We present an extensive analysis on how arrival time estimation changes the experience for customers, restaurants, and the platform.

Battery swap stations are one alternative to reduce these concerns that allow the swap of depleted for full batteries in minutes. We consider the problem of deriving actions at a battery swap station when explicitly considering the uncertain arrival of swap demand, battery degradation, and replacement. We model the operations at a battery swap station using a finite horizon Markov decision process model for the stochastic scheduling, allocation, and inventory replenishment problem (SAIRP), which determines when and how many batteries are charged, discharged, and replaced over time. We present theoretical proofs for the monotonicity of the value function and monotone structure of an optimal policy for special SAIRP cases. Because of the curses of dimensionality, we develop a new monotone approximate dynamic programming (ADP) method, which intelligently initializes a value function approximation using regression. In computational tests, we demonstrate the superior performance of the new regression-based monotone ADP method compared with exact methods and other monotone ADP methods.

  abstract     = {Traditionally, individuals and firms have bought and owned resources. For instance, owning a car was a status symbol for people. In recent years, this focus has changed. Young people just want to have some convenient means of transportation available. Sharing cars, bikes, or rides is also acceptable and has the advantage of increased sustainability compared with everyone owning such a device. A similar development can also be observed in industry. Already for decades, smaller farmers in rural areas have shared some expensive harvesting machines, via cooperatives. In recent years, cost pressures have incentivized all firms to use their equipment more efficiently and to avoid idle capacities. This has led, among other things, to the exchange of transportation requests between smaller carriers, when one of them faces an overload situation and another has idle resources. Similarly, some production firms share storage space and logistics service providers operate this storage jointly with greater efficiency than each firm could do separately. All these tendencies have led to the development of a new paradigm, the “Sharing Economy.” In transportation, these resources are the vehicles used to deliver goods or move passengers. Given an increasing pressure to act economically and ecologically sustainable, efficient mechanisms that help to benefit from idle capacities are on the rise. They are typically organized through digital platforms that facilitate the efficient exchange of goods or services and help cope with data privacy issues. Both transportation companies and heavy users of transportation services need to learn how to play in a world of shared idle capacities. “Transportation in the Sharing Economy” was the theme of the 2019 Transportation Science and Logistics Workshop held in Vienna, and it is therefore also the focus of this associated special issue. The papers included cover several forms of shared resources in transportation, where the first part deals with freight, whereas in the second part, the focus lies on passenger transportation. Each study highlights the benefits of sharing resources. We received 40 submissions, of which 10 papers were accepted for this special issue after the reviewing process.},

In this paper, we design a truthful acyclic mechanism to solve the cost-sharing problem in a freight consolidation system with one consolidation center and one common destination. Applying the acyclic mechanism, the consolidation center decides which suppliers’ demands ship via the consolidation center and their corresponding cost shares based on their willingness to pay for the service. The proposed acyclic mechanism is designed based on bin packing solutions that are also strong Nash equilibria for a related noncooperative game. We study the budget-balance of the mechanism both theoretically and numerically. We prove a 2-budget-balance guarantee for the mechanism in general and better budget-balance guarantees under specific problem settings. Empirical tests on budget-balance show that our mechanism performs much better than the guaranteed budget-balance ratio. We also study the economic efficiency of our mechanism numerically to investigate its impact on social welfare under different conditions.},

  abstract     = {We study the problem of collaborative less-than-truckload (LTL) transportation in the form of a shipper consortium, which is operated by a third-party logistics provider (3PL) through a cross-dock/pooling network. The 3PL has responsibility for planning the combined loads prior to actual shipments, hiring and routing carriers to execute shipping, and allocating the cost to the shippers in the consortium. Shippers receive substantial cost savings from combined truckload shipments. However, achieving consolidation and realizing this benefit requires addressing two essential issues: (i) how to find an approximately optimal consolidation solution in a large network with many freights and (ii) how to determine a fair cost allocation rule among the shippers’ consolidated freights that ensures budget balance while minimally violating coalitional stability. Our work resolves these two issues. We formulate a time-space network flow model of the problem under both incremental and all-unit discount structures of LTL rates and propose a computationally efficient algorithm based on local search heuristics. We model the problem of allocating cost to the shippers as a cooperative game. We decompose and linearize the Lagrangian dual problem by using total unimodularity and concavity. We propose an efficiently computable cost allocation rule from the linearized dual models. The dual rule ensures stable cooperation but may have underallocation equal to a duality gap. To cover the underallocation, we further develop a budget covering procedure and define an ϵ -core allocation with desirable properties. Through extensive computational experiments, we find that the shipper consortium reduces total shipping costs by more than 40\% in most cases; meanwhile, the ϵ -core allocation is typically in the core for small-scale networks while violating stability by at most 5\% for large-scale networks and provides consolidated freights with more than 50\% individual cost savings on average.},

Uncertainty in crowd-shipper availability is incorporated by modeling the problem as a two-stage stochastic integer program. Enhanced decomposition solution algorithms including branch-and-cut and cut-and-project frameworks are developed. A risk-averse approach is compared against a risk-neutral approach by assessing conditional-value-at-risk. A detailed computational study based on the City of Toronto is conducted. The deterministic version of the model outperforms a capacitated vehicle routing problem on average by 20\%. For the stochastic model, decomposition algorithms usually discover near-optimal solutions within two hours for instances up to a size of 30 mobile depot locations, 40 customers, and 120 crowd-shippers. The cut-and-project approach outperforms the branch-and-cut approach by up to 85\% in the risk-averse setting in certain instances. The stochastic model provides solutions that are 3.35\%–6.08\% better than the deterministic model, and the improvements are magnified with increased uncertainty in crowd-shipper availability. A risk-averse approach leads the operator to send more mobile depots or postpone customer deliveries to reduce the risk of high penalties for nondelivery.},

  abstract     = {The growth of e-commerce has increased demand for last-mile deliveries, increasing the level of congestion in the existing transportation infrastructure in urban areas. Crowdsourcing deliveries can provide the additional capacity needed to meet the growing demand in a cost-effective way. We introduce a setting where a crowd-shipping platform sells heterogeneous products of different sizes from a central depot. Items sold vary from groceries to electronics. Some items must be delivered within a time window, whereas others need a customer signature. Furthermore, customer presence is not guaranteed, and some deliveries may need to be returned to the depot. Delivery requests are fulfilled by a fleet of professional drivers and a pool of crowd drivers. We present a crowd-shipping platform that standardizes crowd drivers’ capacities and compensates them to return undelivered packages back to the depot. We formulate a two-stage stochastic model, and we propose a branch and price algorithm to solve the problem exactly and a column generation heuristic to solve larger problems quickly. We further develop an analytical method to calculate upper bounds on the supply of vehicles and an innovative cohesive pricing problem to generate columns for the pool of crowd drivers. Computational experiments are carried out on modified Solomon instances with a pool of 100 crowd vehicles. The branch and price algorithm is able to solve instances of up to 100 customers. We show that the value of the stochastic solution can be as high as 18\% when compared with the solution obtained from a deterministic simplification of the model. Significant cost reductions of up to 28\% are achieved by implementing crowd drivers with low compensations or higher capacities. Finally, we evaluate what happens when crowd drivers are given the autonomy to select routes based on rational and irrational behavior. There is no cost increase when crowd drivers are rational and select routes that have a higher compensation first. However, when crowd drivers are irrational and select routes randomly, the cost can increase up to 4.2\% for some instances.},

The cost function is NP complete, so a heuristic is proposed that ensures feasible solutions that can be solved in an online system. The algorithm is validated in a case study of electric carshare in Brooklyn, New York, with demand data shared from BMW ReachNow operations in September 2017 (262 vehicle fleet, 231 pickups per day, and 303 traffic analysis zones) and charging station location data (18 charging stations with four-port capacities).

  abstract     = {Current mobility services cannot compete on equal terms with self-owned mobility products concerning service quality. Because of supply and demand imbalances, ridesharing users invariably experience delays, price surges, and rejections. Traditional approaches often fail to respond to demand fluctuations adequately because service levels are, to some extent, bounded by fleet size. With the emergence of autonomous vehicles, however, the characteristics of mobility services change and new opportunities to overcome the prevailing limitations arise. In this paper, we consider an autonomous ridesharing problem in which idle vehicles are hired on-demand in order to meet the service-level requirements of a heterogeneous user base. In the face of uncertain demand and idle vehicle supply, we propose a learning-based optimization approach that uses the dual variables of the underlying assignment problem to iteratively approximate the marginal value of vehicles at each time and location under different availability settings. These approximations are used in the objective function of the optimization problem to dispatch, rebalance, and occasionally hire idle third-party vehicles in a high-resolution transportation network of Manhattan, New York City. The results show that the proposed policy outperforms a reactive optimization approach in a variety of vehicle availability scenarios while hiring fewer vehicles. Moreover, we demonstrate that mobility services can offer strict service-level contracts to different user groups featuring both delay and rejection penalties.},

We propose a family of models for on-demand public transit that combine a continuous approximation methodology with a Markov process. Our goal is to develop a tractable method to evaluate and predict system performance, specifically focusing on obtaining the probability distribution of performance metrics. This information can then be used in capital planning, such as fleet sizing, contracting, and driver scheduling, among other things. We present the analytical solution for a stylized single-vehicle model of first-mile operation.

We use computational experiments to illustrate the effects of the inputs on the performance metrics and to compare different modes of transit. Finally, we include a case study, using data collected from a real-world pilot on-demand public transit project in a major U.S. metropolitan area, to showcase how the proposed model can be used to predict system performance and support decision making.},

  abstract     = {With the soaring popularity of ride-hailing, the interdependence between transit ridership, ride-hailing ridership, and urban congestion motivates the following question: can public transit and ride-hailing coexist and thrive in a way that enhances the urban transportation ecosystem as a whole? To answer this question, we develop a mathematical and computational framework that optimizes transit schedules while explicitly accounting for their impacts on road congestion and passengers’ mode choice between transit and ride-hailing. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear program and solved using a bilevel decomposition algorithm. Based on computational case study experiments in New York City, our optimized transit schedules consistently lead to 0.4\%–3\% system-wide cost reduction. This amounts to rush-hour savings of millions of dollars per day while simultaneously reducing the costs to passengers and transportation service providers. These benefits are driven by a better alignment of available transportation options with passengers’ preferences—by redistributing public transit resources to where they provide the strongest societal benefits. These results are robust to underlying assumptions about passenger demand, transit level of service, the dynamics of ride-hailing operations, and transit fare structures. Ultimately, by explicitly accounting for ride-hailing competition, passenger preferences, and traffic congestion, transit agencies can develop schedules that lower costs for passengers, operators, and the system as a whole: a rare win–win–win outcome.},

  abstract     = {Despite their promise, popularity, and rapid growth, the transit implications of ride-hailing platforms (e.g., Uber, Lyft) are not altogether clear. On the one hand, ride-hailing services can provide pooling (i.e., traffic reductions) advantages by efficiently matching customer demand (i.e., trips) with resources (i.e., cars) or by facilitating car-sharing. On the other hand, ride-hailing may also induce extra travel because of increased convenience and travel mode substitution, which may create crowding (i.e., traffic increases). We seek to reconcile these divergent perspectives here, exploring the heterogeneous determinants of ride-hailing’s effects. Taking advantage of Uber’s staggered entry into various geographic markets in California, we execute a regression-based difference-in-differences analysis to estimate the impact of ride-hailing services on traffic volumes. Using monthly micro data from more than 9,000 vehicle detector station units deployed across California, we show that Uber’s effect (either pooling or crowding) on traffic depends on various contextual factors. We find some evidence of pooling effects on weekdays; however, Uber’s entry leads to significant crowding effects on weekends. Furthermore, the crowding effect is amplified on interior roads and in areas characterized by high population density. Although ride-hailing seems to have a substitution effect on public transportation, we find ride-hailing services may have a complementary effect for carpooling users. Finally, we show that premium ride-hailing services (e.g., Uber Black) almost exclusively lead to a crowding effect. We conduct a battery of robustness tests (e.g., propensity score matching, alternative treatment approaches, placebo tests) to ensure the consistency of our findings.},

The operator, seeking to maximize profit, must assign vehicles to requests as they arise as well as recharge and reposition vehicles in anticipation of future requests. To solve this problem, we employ deep reinforcement learning, developing policies whose decision making uses Q -value approximations learned by deep neural networks. We compare these policies against a reoptimization-based policy and against dual bounds on the value of an optimal policy, including the value of an optimal policy with perfect information, which we establish using a Benders-based decomposition. We assess performance on instances derived from real data for the island of Manhattan in New York City. We find that, across instances of varying size, our best policy trained with deep reinforcement learning outperforms the reoptimization approach. We also provide evidence that this policy may be effectively scaled and deployed on larger instances without retraining.},

  abstract     = {Ground delay programs (GDPs) comprise the main interventions to optimize flight operations in congested air traffic networks. The core GDP objective is to minimize flight delays, but this may not result in optimal outcomes for passengers—especially with connecting itineraries. This paper proposes a novel passenger-centric optimization approach to GDPs by balancing flight and passenger delays in large-scale networks. For tractability, we decompose the problem using a rolling procedure, enabling the model’s implementation in manageable runtimes. Computational results based on real-world data suggest that our modeling and computational framework can reduce passenger delays significantly at small increases in flight delay costs through two main mechanisms: (i) delay allocation (delaying versus prioritizing flights) and (ii) delay introduction (holding flights to avoid passenger misconnections). In practice, however, passenger itineraries are unknown to air traffic managers; accordingly, we propose statistical learning models to predict passenger itineraries and optimize GDP operations accordingly. Results show that the proposed passenger-centric approach is highly robust to imperfect knowledge of passenger itineraries and can provide significant benefits even in the current decentralized environment based on collaborative decision making.},

  abstract     = {Despite various planning efforts, airspace capacity can sometimes be exceeded, typically because of disruptive events. Air traffic flow management (ATFM) is the process of managing flights in this situation. In this paper, we present an ATFM model that accounts for different rerouting options (path rerouting and diversion) and preexisting en route flights. The model proposes having a central authority to control all decisions, which is then compared with current practice. We also consider interflight and interairline fairness measures in the network. We use an exact approach to solve small- to medium-sized instances, and we propose a modified fix-and-relax heuristic to solve large-sized instances. Allowing a central authority to control all decisions increases network efficiency compared with the case where the ATFM authority and airlines control decisions independently. Our experiments show that including different rerouting options in ATFM can help reduce delays by up to 8\% and cancellations by up to 23\%. Moreover, ground delay cost has much more impact on network decisions than air delay cost, and network decisions are insensitive to changes in diversion cost. Furthermore, the analysis of the tradeoff between total network cost and overtaking cost shows that adding costs for overtaking can significantly improve fairness at only a small increase in total system cost. A balanced total cost per flight among airlines can be achieved at a small increase in the network cost (0.2\%–3.0\%) when imposing airline fairness. In conclusion, the comprehensiveness of the model makes it useful for analyzing a wide range of alternatives for efficient ATFM.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel quantity-based demand management system that aims to promote ridesharing. The system sells a time-dependent permit to access a road facility (conceptualized as a bottleneck) by auction but encourages commuters to share permits with each other. The commuters may be assigned one of three roles: solo driver, ridesharing driver, or rider. At the core of this auction-based permit allocation and sharing system (A-PASS) is a trilateral matching problem (TMP) that matches permits, drivers, and riders. Formulated as an integer program, TMP is first shown to be tightly bounded by its linear relaxation. A pricing policy based on the classical Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) mechanism is then devised to determine the payment of each commuter. We prove that, under the VCG policy, different commuters pay exactly the same price as long as their role and access time are the same. Importantly, by controlling the number of shared rides, any deficit that may arise from the VCG policy can be eliminated. This may be achieved with a relatively small loss to system efficiency, thanks to the revenue generated from selling permits. Results of a numerical experiment suggest A-PASS strongly promotes ridesharing. As sharing increases, all stakeholders are better off: the ridesharing platform receives greater profits, the commuters enjoy higher utility, and society benefits from more efficient utilization of the road infrastructure.},

We analytically analyze how the pricing strategy of the platform (price charged on users and rent paid to parking owners or sharers) would affect the parking choice equilibrium and several system efficiency metrics. It is shown that the platform is profitable when some parking owners have a relatively small inconvenience cost from sharing their spaces, but its profit is always negative at minimum social cost.

  abstract     = {Several works published over the last two decades have shown for a stylized set-up with homogeneous users that metering-based priority (MBP) schemes may generate Pareto improving departure time adjustments similar to those induced by congestion pricing, but without any financial transaction. We investigate whether MBP (i) still generates significant savings and (ii) remains Pareto-improving, with various sources of heterogeneity (in schedule flexibility, desired arrival time, and capacity usage). We consider two types of schemes: one where the priority status is allocated randomly (R-MBP) and another (HOV-MBP), which only prioritizes users with small capacity usage (e.g., carpoolers). We find that the relative total cost savings of R-MBP decrease with heterogeneity in flexibility, but may increase with heterogeneity in desired arrival time. It fails however to be Pareto-improving, as nonprioritized users are almost systematically worse-off. HOV-MBP circumvents this issue by generating an ordering effect and a modal shift, which both contribute to a better distribution of benefits among users. Under favorable circumstances, they may even restore a Pareto improvement. Overall, MBP appears as a realistic way to alleviate congestion, scoring well both in terms of efficiency and social acceptability.},

Various distributed optimization or control schemes have been developed for CAV platooning. However, most existing distributed schemes for platoon centered CAV control require either centralized data processing or centralized computation in at least one step of their schemes, referred to as partially distributed schemes. In this paper, we develop fully distributed optimization based, platoon centered CAV platooning control under the linear vehicle dynamics via the model predictive control approach with a general prediction horizon. These fully distributed schemes do not require centralized data processing or centralized computation through the entire schemes. To develop these schemes, we propose a new formulation of an objective function and a decomposition method that decomposes a densely coupled central objective function into the sum of multiple locally coupled functions whose coupling satisfies the network topology constraint. We then exploit locally coupled optimization and operator splitting methods to develop fully distributed schemes. Control design and stability analysis is carried out to achieve desired traffic transient performance and asymptotic stability. Numerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fully distributed schemes and CAV platooning control.},

Nonetheless, current solutions still lack performance to efficiently handle interactive queries under realistic network conditions where traffic jams, public transit cancelations, or delays often occur. We present a multimodal separators–based algorithm (MUSE), a new multimodal algorithm based on graph separators to compute shortest travel time paths. It partitions the network into independent, smaller regions, enabling fast and scalable preprocessing. The partition is common to all modes and independent of traffic conditions so that the preprocessing is only executed once. MUSE relies on a state automaton that describes the sequence of modes to constrain the shortest path during the preprocessing and the online phase. The support of new sequences of mobility modes only requires the preprocessing of the cliques, independently for each partition. We also augment our algorithm with heuristics during the query phase to achieve further speedups with minimal effect on correctness.

  abstract     = {Electric vehicle routing problems (E-VRPs) deal with routing a fleet of electric vehicles (EVs) to serve a set of customers while minimizing an operational criterion, for example, cost or time. The feasibility of the routes is constrained by the autonomy of the EVs, which may be recharged along the route. Much of the E-VRP research neglects the capacity of charging stations (CSs) and thus implicitly assumes that an unlimited number of EVs can be simultaneously charged at a CS. In this paper, we model and solve E-VRPs considering these capacity restrictions. In particular, we study an E-VRP with nonlinear charging functions, multiple charging technologies, en route charging, and variable charging quantities while explicitly accounting for the number of chargers available at privately managed CSs. We refer to this problem as the E-VRP with nonlinear charging functions and capacitated stations (E-VRP-NL-C). We introduce a continuous-time model formulation for the problem. We then introduce an algorithmic framework that iterates between two main components: (1) the route generator, which uses an iterated local search algorithm to build a pool of high-quality routes, and (2) the solution assembler, which applies a branch-and-cut algorithm to combine a subset of routes from the pool into a solution satisfying the capacity constraints. We compare four assembly strategies on a set of instances. We show that our algorithm effectively deals with the E-VRP-NL-C. Furthermore, considering the uncapacitated version of the E-VRP-NL-C, our solution method identifies new best-known solutions for 80 of 120 instances.},

One reason for this slow adoption is the drivers’ perceived range anxiety, especially for individually owned vehicles. Here, bad user experiences (e.g., conventional cars blocking charging stations or inconsistent real-time availability data) manifest the drivers’ range anxiety. Against this background, we study stochastic search algorithms that can be readily deployed in today’s navigation systems in order to minimize detours to reach an available charging station. We model such a search as a finite-horizon Markov decision process and present a comprehensive framework that considers different problem variants, speedup techniques, and three solution algorithms: an exact labeling algorithm, a heuristic labeling algorithm, and a rollout algorithm. Extensive numerical studies show that our algorithms significantly decrease the expected time to find a free charging station while increasing the solution-quality robustness and the likelihood that a search is successful compared with myopic approaches.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on designing a facility network, taking into account that the system may be congested. The objective is to minimize the overall fixed and service capacity costs, subject to the constraints that for any demand the disutility from travel and waiting times (measured as the weighted sum of the travel time from a demand to the facility serving that demand and the average waiting time at the facility) cannot exceed a predefined maximum allowed level (measured in units of time). We develop an analytical framework for the problem that determines the optimal set of facilities and assigns each facility a service rate (service capacity). In our setting, the consumers would like to maximize their utility (minimize their disutility) when choosing which facility to patronize. Therefore, the eventual choice of facilities is a user-equilibrium problem, where at equilibrium, consumers do not have any incentive to change their choices. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear mixed-integer program. We show how to linearize the nonlinear constraints and solve instead a mixed-integer linear problem, which can be solved efficiently.},

  abstract     = {Our study provides an experimental benchmark for state-of-the-art solution algorithms with hub location problems. Such problems are fundamental optimization problems in location science with widespread application areas, such as transportation, telecommunications, economics, and geography. Given they combine aspects of facility location and quadratic assignment problems, the majority of hub location problems are NP-hard and, accordingly, several solution techniques have been proposed for solving these problems. In this study, we report on the results of a large benchmark and reproduction effort to investigate 12 fundamental hub location problems that combine single or multiple allocation, a p-hub median objective or fixed hub set-up costs, capacitated or uncapacitated hubs, and complete or incomplete networks. We implemented four standard exact algorithms on these 12 problems as proposed in the literature. Algorithms are evaluated on subsets of three standard data sets in the field (CAB, TR, and AP); we computed more than 5,000 optimal solutions for these data sets. We report comparisons of solution techniques regarding wall clock time, convergence speed, memory use, and the impact of data features. In addition, we identify patterns in optimal solutions across these 12 problems, extracting insights regarding solution similarity, hub set candidates, and economies of scale. All results and programs are being made available to the public for free academic use.},

  abstract     = {The “asymmetry” between spatiotemporally varying passenger demand and fixed-capacity transportation supply has been a long-standing problem in urban mass transportation (UMT) systems around the world. The emerging modular autonomous vehicle (MAV) technology offers us an opportunity to close the substantial gap between passenger demand and vehicle capacity through station-wise docking and undocking operations. However, there still lacks an appropriate approach that can solve the operational design problem for UMT corridor systems with MAVs efficiently. To bridge this methodological gap, this paper proposes a continuum approximation (CA) model that can offer near-optimal solutions to the operational design for MAV-based transit corridors very efficiently. We investigate the theoretical properties of the optimal solutions to the investigated problem in a certain (yet not uncommon) case. These theoretical properties allow us to estimate the seat demand of each time neighborhood with the arrival demand curves, which recover the “local impact” property of the investigated problem. With the property, a CA model is properly formulated to decompose the original problem into a finite number of subproblems that can be analytically solved. A discretization heuristic is then proposed to convert the analytical solution from the CA model to feasible solutions to the original problem. With two sets of numerical experiments, we show that the proposed CA model can achieve near-optimal solutions (with gaps less than 4\% for most cases) to the investigated problem in almost no time (less than 10 ms) for large-scale instances with a wide range of parameter settings (a commercial solver may even not obtain a feasible solution in several hours). The theoretical properties are verified, and managerial insights regarding how input parameters affect system performance are provided through these numerical results. Additionally, results also reveal that, although the CA model does not incorporate vehicle repositioning decisions, the timetabling decisions obtained by solving the CA model can be easily applied to obtain near-optimal repositioning decisions (with gaps less than 5\% in most instances) very efficiently (within 10 ms). Thus, the proposed CA model provides a foundation for developing solution approaches for other problems (e.g., MAV repositioning) with more complex system operation constraints whose exact optimal solution can hardly be found with discrete modeling methods.},

  abstract     = {The unreliable service and the unstable operation of a high-frequency bus line are shown as bus bunching and the uneven distribution of headways along the bus line. Although many control strategies, such as the static and dynamic holding strategies, have been proposed to solve the above problems, many of them take on some oversimplified assumptions about the real bus line operation. So it is hard for them to continuously adapt to the evolving complex system. In view of this dynamic setting, we present an adaptive holding method that combines the classic approximate dynamic programming (ADP) with the multistage look-ahead mechanism. The holding time, the only control means used in this study, will be determined by estimating its impact on the operation stability of the bus line system in the remaining observation period. The multistage look-ahead mechanism introduced into the classic Q-learning algorithm of the ADP model makes it easy that the algorithm gets through its earlier unstable phase more quickly and easily. During the implementation of the new holding approach, the past experiences of holding operations can be cumulated effectively into an artificial neural network used to approximate the unavailable Q-factor. The use of a detailed simulation system in the new approach makes it possible to take into account most of the possible causes of instability. The numerical experiments show that the new holding approach can stabilize the system by producing evenly distributed headway and removing bus bunching thoroughly. Compared with the terminal station holding strategies, the new method brings a more reliable bus line with shorter waiting times for passengers.},

Specifically, we focus on predicting sensor states in high-resolution (second-by-second). This contrasts with traditional traffic forecasting problems, which have focused on predicting aggregated traffic variables, typically over intervals that are no shorter than five minutes. Our contributions can be summarized as offering three insights: first, we show how the prediction problem can be modeled as a matrix completion problem. Second, we use a block-coordinate descent algorithm and demonstrate that the algorithm converges in sublinear time to a block coordinate-wise optimizer. This allows us to capitalize on the “bigness” of high-resolution data in a computationally feasible way. Third, we develop an ensemble learning (or adaptive boosting) approach to reduce the training error to within any arbitrary error threshold. The latter uses past days so that the boosting can be interpreted as capturing periodic patterns in the data. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed theoretically and tested empirically using both simulated data and a real-world high-resolution traffic data set from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

The user equilibrium principle in terms of mean trip cost is adopted to formulate commuters’ departure time choice in the stochastic bottleneck. We find that there exist five possible equilibrium departure patterns, which depend on both commuters’ unit costs of travel time, schedule delay early and late, and the uncertainty of the stochastic capacity of the bottleneck. All possible equilibrium departure patterns are analytically derived. Both the analytical and numerical results show that increasing the uncertainty of the capacity of the bottleneck leads to an increase of commuters’ individual mean trip cost. In addition, both a time-varying toll scheme and a single-step coarse toll scheme are designed within the proposed stochastic bottleneck model. We provide an analytical method to determine the detailed toll-charging schemes for both toll strategies. The numerical results show that the proposed toll schemes can indeed improve the efficiency of the stochastic bottleneck in terms of decreasing mean total social cost, and the time-varying toll scheme is more efficient than the single-step coarse toll scheme. However, as the uncertainty of the capacity of the bottleneck increases, the efficiency of the time-varying toll scheme decreases, whereas the efficiency of the single-step coarse toll scheme fluctuates slightly.},

  abstract     = {Researchers have proposed many different concepts and models to study day-to-day dynamics. Some models explicitly model travelers’ perceiving and learning on travel costs, and some other models do not explicitly consider the travel cost perception but instead formulate the dynamics of flows as the functions of flows and measured travel costs (which are determined by flows). This paper investigates the interconnection between these two types of day-to-day models, in particular, those models whose fixed points are a stochastic user equilibrium. Specifically, a widely used day-to-day model that combines exponential-smoothing learning and logit stochastic network loading (called the logit-ESL model in this paper) is proved to be equivalent to a model based purely on flows, which is the logit-based extension of the first-in-first-out dynamic of Jin [Jin W (2007) A dynamical system model of the traffic assignment problem. Transportation Res. Part B Methodological 41(1):32–48]. Via this equivalent form, the logit-ESL model is proved to be globally stable under nonseparable and monotone travel cost functions. Moreover, the model of Cantarella and Cascetta is shown to be equivalent to a second-order dynamic incorporating purely flows and is proved to be globally stable under separable link cost functions [Cantarella GE, Cascetta E (1995) Dynamic processes and equilibrium in transportation networks: Towards a unifying theory. Transportation Sci . 29(4):305–329]. Further, other discrete choice models, such as C-logit, path-size logit, and weibit, are introduced into the logit-ESL model, leading to several new day-to-day models, which are also proved to be globally stable under different conditions.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we consider the train unit shunting problem extended with service task scheduling. This problem originates from Dutch Railways, which is the main railway operator in the Netherlands. Its urgency stems from the upcoming expansion of the rolling stock fleet needed to handle the ever-increasing number of passengers. The problem consists of matching train units arriving on a shunting yard to departing trains, scheduling service tasks such as cleaning and maintenance on the available resources, and parking the trains on the available tracks such that the shunting yard can operate conflict-free. These different aspects lead to a computationally extremely difficult problem, which combines several well-known NP-hard problems. In this paper, we present the first solution method covering all aspects of the shunting and scheduling problem. We describe a partial order schedule representation that captures the full problem, and we present a local search algorithm that utilizes the partial ordering. The proposed solution method is compared with an existing mixed integer linear program in a computational study on realistic instances provided by Dutch Railways. We show that our local search algorithm is the first method to solve real-world problem instances of the complete shunting and scheduling problem. It even outperforms current algorithms when the train unit shunting problem is considered in isolation, that is, without service tasks. Although our method was developed for the case of the Dutch Railways, it is applicable to any shunting yard or service location, irrespective of its layout, that uses self-propelling train units and that does not have to handle passing trains.},

When opportunities for infrastructure expansions are not available, seaport congestion mitigation may require effective scheduling of the vessel traffic in the port waters. Although existing works on vessel traffic scheduling focus on minimizing vessel delays, this paper studies a novel vessel traffic scheduling problem that aims to address the inter-shipping line equity issue. We develop a lexicographic optimization model that accounts for two conflicting performance measures: efficiency, which favors minimizing total vessel delay; and equity, which favors balancing the impacts of delays fairly among shipping lines. Our model allows the port operator to quantify the efficiency-equity tradeoff and make the best vessel traffic scheduling decisions. For solving the model, we develop an effective two-stage solution method in which the first stage solves two single-objective models to obtain the maximum system efficiency and equity, whereas the second stage trades between efficiency and equity and seeks the best compromise between the two conflicting objectives. We apply our model and solution method on instances generated from the operational data of the Port of Shanghai. Our computational results show that an efficiency-oriented model can lead to highly inequitable traffic plans, whereas inter-shipping line equity can be achieved at only mild losses in efficiency, indicating that the consideration of inter-shipping line equity can lead to satisfactory service at both the vessel level and the shipping line level.},

  abstract     = {Online and omnichannel retailers are proposing increasingly tight delivery deadlines, moving toward instant on-demand delivery. To operate last-mile distribution systems with such tight delivery deadlines efficiently, defining the right strategic distribution network design is of paramount importance. However, this problem exceeds the complexity of the strategic design of traditional last-mile distribution networks for two main reasons: (1) the reduced time available for order handling and delivery and (2) the absence of a delivery cut-off time that clearly separates order collection and delivery periods. This renders state-of-the-art last-mile distribution network design models inappropriate, as they assume periodic order fulfillment based on a delivery cutoff. In this study, we propose a metamodel simulation-based optimization (SO) approach to strategically design last-mile distribution networks with tight delivery deadlines. Our methodology integrates an in-depth simulator with traditional optimization techniques by extending a traditional black-box SO algorithm with an analytical model that captures the underlying structure of the decision problem. Based on a numerical study inspired by the efforts of a global fashion company to introduce on-demand distribution with tight delivery deadlines in Manhattan, we show that our approach outperforms contemporary SO approaches as well as deterministic and stochastic programming methods. In particular, our method systematically yields network designs with superior expected cost performance. Furthermore, it converges to good solutions with a lower computational budget and is more consistent in finding high-quality solutions. We show how congestion effects in the processing of orders at facilities negatively impact the network performance through late delivery of orders and reduced potential for consolidation. In addition, we show that the sensitivity of the optimal network design to congestion effects in order processing at the facilities increases as delivery deadlines become increasingly tight.},

  abstract     = {The consistent vehicle routing problem (ConVRP) aims to design synchronized routes on multiple days to serve a group of customers while minimizing the total travel cost. It stipulates that customers should be visited at roughly the same time (time consistency) by several familiar drivers (driver consistency). This paper generalizes the ConVRP for any level of driver consistency and additionally addresses route consistency, which means that each driver can traverse at most a certain proportion of different arcs of routes on planning days, which guarantees route familiarity. To solve this problem, we develop two set partitioning-based formulations, one based on routes and the other based on schedules. We investigate valid lower bounds on the linear relaxations of both of the formulations that are used to derive a subset of columns (routes and schedules); within the subset are columns of an optimal solution for each formulation. We then solve the reduced problem of either one of the formulations to achieve an optimal solution. Numerical results show that our exact method can effectively solve most of the medium-sized ConVRP instances in the literature and can also solve some newly generated instances involving up to 50 customers. Our exact solutions explore some managerial findings with respect to the adoption of consistency measures in practice. First, maintaining reasonably high levels of consistency requirements does not necessarily always lead to a substantial increase in cost. Second, a high level of time consistency can potentially be guaranteed by adopting a high level of driver consistency. Third, maintaining high levels of time consistency and driver consistency may lead to lower levels of route consistency.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an exact branch-price-and-cut (BPC) algorithm for the two-echelon vehicle routing problem with time windows. This problem arises in city logistics when high-capacity and low-capacity vehicles are used to transport items from depots to satellites (first echelon) and from satellites to customers (second echelon), respectively. The aim is to determine a set of least-cost first- and second-echelon routes such that the load on the routes respect the capacity of the vehicles, each second-echelon route is supplied by exactly one first-echelon route, and each customer is visited by exactly one second-echelon route within its time window. We model the problem with a route-based formulation where first-echelon routes are enumerated a priori, and second-echelon routes are generated using column generation. The problem is solved using BPC. To generate second-echelon routes, one pricing problem per satellite is solved using a labeling algorithm which keeps track of the first-echelon route associated with each (partial) second-echelon route considered. Furthermore, to speed up the solution process, we introduce effective deep dual-optimal inequalities and apply known valid inequalities. We perform extensive computational experiments on benchmark instances and show that our method outperforms a state-of-the-art algorithm. We also conduct sensitivity analyses on the different components of our algorithm and derive managerial insights related to the structure of the first-echelon routes.},
