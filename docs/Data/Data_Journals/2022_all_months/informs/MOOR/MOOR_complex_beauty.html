  abstract     = {We develop techniques to convexify a set that is invariant under permutation and/or change of sign of variables and discuss applications of these results. First, we convexify the intersection of the unit ball of a permutation and sign-invariant norm with a cardinality constraint. This gives a nonlinear formulation for the feasible set of sparse principal component analysis (PCA) and an alternative proof of the K -support norm. Second, we characterize the convex hull of sets of matrices defined by constraining their singular values. As a consequence, we generalize an earlier result that characterizes the convex hull of rank-constrained matrices whose spectral norm is below a given threshold. Third, we derive convex and concave envelopes of various permutation-invariant nonlinear functions and their level sets over hypercubes, with congruent bounds on all variables. Finally, we develop new relaxations for the exterior product of sparse vectors. Using these relaxations for sparse PCA, we show that our relaxation closes 98\% of the gap left by a classical semidefinite programming relaxation for instances where the covariance matrices are of dimension up to 50 × 50.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with constrained convex problems, where the objective function is smooth and strongly convex, and the feasible set is described by a large number of closed convex (possibly nonpolyhedral) sets. In order to deal efficiently with the complicated constraints, we consider a dual formulation of this problem. We prove that the corresponding dual function satisfies a quadratic growth property on any sublevel set, provided that the primal objective function is smooth and strongly convex and the feasible set verifies Slater’s condition. We propose (accelerated) random coordinate descent algorithms that use the special composite structure of the dual problem. However, with the existing theory, one can prove only that such methods converge sublinearly. Based on our new quadratic growth property derived for the dual problem, we show that such methods have faster convergence, that is, the dual (accelerated) random coordinate descent algorithms converge linearly. Besides providing a general dual framework for the analysis of random dual coordinate descent schemes, our results resolve an open problem in the literature related to the convergence of the Dykstra algorithm on the best feasibility problem for a collection of convex sets. That is, we establish linear convergence rate for the random Dykstra algorithm when the convex sets just satisfy Slater’s condition and derive also a new accelerated variant for the Dykstra algorithm.},

At the end of the stream, our algorithm postprocesses its data structure using any off-line algorithm for submodular maximization and obtains a solution whose approximation guarantee is α / ( 1 + α ) − ε , where α is the approximation of the off-line algorithm. If we use an exact (exponential time) postprocessing algorithm, this leads to 1 / 2 − ε approximation (which is nearly optimal). If we postprocess with the state-of-the-art offline approximation algorithm, whose guarantee is α = 0.385 , we obtain a 0.2779-approximation in polynomial time, improving over the previously best polynomial-time approximation of 0.1715.

The bounds are linear in the number of critically loaded links in the network, and they hold for a class of phase-type file-size distributions; that is, the bounds are heavy-traffic insensitive to the distributions in this class. Our approach is Lyapunov drift based, which is different from the widely used diffusion approximation approach. A key technique we develop is to construct a novel inner product in the state space, which then allows us to obtain a multiplicative type of state-space collapse in steady state. Furthermore, this state-space collapse result implies the interchange of limits as a byproduct for the diffusion approximation of the unweighted proportionally fair sharing policy under phase-type file-size distributions, demonstrating the heavy-traffic insensitivity of the stationary distribution .},

Then, the choice of a norm or a divergence function on the latter algebra produces a theory of decision making and inference. Examples include models from the Choquet expected utility class, models from robust statistics, the smooth model, maxmin and maxmax (as limiting cases) as well as a novel theory.

An affirmative answer was given by a classic result published in 1995 for one-hidden-layer wide neural nets with a sigmoid activation function, but this result has not been extended to the multilayer case. Recently, it was shown that, with piecewise linear activations, suboptimal local minima exist even for wide nets. Given the classic positive result on smooth activation and the negative result on nonsmooth activations, an interesting open question is: Does a large width eliminate all suboptimal local minima for deep neural nets with smooth activation? In this paper, we give a largely negative answer to this question. Specifically, we prove that, for neural networks with generic input data and smooth nonlinear activation functions, suboptimal local minima can exist no matter how wide the network is (as long as the last hidden layer has at least two neurons). Therefore, the classic result of no suboptimal local minimum for a one-hidden-layer network does not hold. Whereas this classic result assumes sigmoid activation, our counterexample covers a large set of activation functions (dense in the set of continuous functions), indicating that the limitation is not a result of the specific activation. Together with recent progress on piecewise linear activations, our result indicates that suboptimal local minima are common for wide neural nets.},

One shortcoming is that this orientation does not account for time sensitivity, which can play a crucial role when learning an optimal action requires much more information than near-optimal ones. Indeed, popular approaches, such as upper-confidence-bound methods and Thompson sampling, can fare poorly in such situations. We consider instead learning a satisficing action , which is near-optimal while requiring less information, and propose satisficing Thompson sampling , an algorithm that serves this purpose. We establish a general bound on expected discounted regret and study the application of satisficing Thompson sampling to linear and infinite-armed bandits, demonstrating arbitrarily large benefits over Thompson sampling. We also discuss the relation between the notion of satisficing and the theory of rate distortion, which offers guidance on the selection of satisficing actions.},

  abstract     = {Forcing finite state mean field games by a relevant form of common noise is a subtle issue, which has been addressed only recently. Among others, one possible way is to subject the simplex valued dynamics of an equilibrium by a so-called Wright–Fisher noise, very much in the spirit of stochastic models in population genetics. A key feature is that such a random forcing preserves the structure of the simplex, which is nothing but, in this setting, the probability space over the state space of the game. The purpose of this article is, hence, to elucidate the finite-player version and, accordingly, prove that N -player equilibria indeed converge toward the solution of such a kind of Wright–Fisher mean field game. Whereas part of the analysis is made easier by the fact that the corresponding master equation has already been proved to be uniquely solvable under the presence of the common noise, it becomes however more subtle than in the standard setting because the mean field interaction between the players now occurs through a weighted empirical measure. In other words, each player carries its own weight, which, hence, may differ from 1 / N and which, most of all, evolves with the common noise.},

When the common noise is uncontrolled, our relaxed formulation is obtained by considering a suitable controlled martingale problem. As for classic optimal control problems, we prove that the set of all relaxed controls is the closure of the set of all strong controls when considered as probability measures on the canonical space. Consequently, we obtain the equivalence of the different formulations of the control problem under additional mild regularity conditions on the reward functions. This is also a crucial technical step to prove the limit theory of the McKean–Vlasov control problem, that is, proving that it consists in the limit of a large population control problem with common noise.},

Several groups of uncertainty sets are considered: uncertainty sets with first two order moments information; uncertainty sets with known first order or first two order moments information under nonnegative support; uncertainty sets constrained by the Kullback–Leibler divergence with a normal or discrete reference distribution; uncertainty sets constrained by the Wasserstein distance under discrete, full, or nonnegative real-space support; and joint uncertainty sets for the product of random variables. Under each group of uncertainty sets, we find deterministic reformulations of the distributionally robust geometric programs with individual or joint chance constraints.

We review the notions of invariancy set, nonlinearity interval, and transition point of the optimal partition, and we investigate their characterizations. We show that the set of transition points is finite and the continuity of the optimal set mapping, on the basis of Painlevé–Kuratowski set convergence, might fail on a nonlinearity interval. Under a local nonsingularity condition, we then develop a methodology, stemming from numerical algebraic geometry, to efficiently compute nonlinearity intervals and transition points of the optimal partition.

Some projects are under the control of a leader who sets prices in the first stage of the game, while in the second stage, the firms choose a feasible subset of projects of maximum value. For a single follower, the leader’s problem of finding revenue-maximizing prices can be solved in strongly polynomial time. In this paper, we focus on the setting with multiple followers and distinguish two situations. In the case in which only one copy of each project is available (limited supply), we show that the two-follower problem is solvable in strongly polynomial time, whereas the problem with three or more followers is NP-hard. In the case of unlimited supply, that is, when sufficient copies of each project are available, we show that the two-follower problem is already APX-hard. As a side result, we prove that Stackelberg min vertex cover on bipartite graphs with a single follower is APX-hard.},

We showcase the generality of our result by presenting various stochastic networks as corollaries, each of which is a contribution by itself. In particular, we study the input-queued switch with correlated arrivals, and we show that, if the state space collapses to a full-dimensional subspace, the correlation among the arrival processes does not matter in heavy traffic. We exemplify this last case with a parallel-server system, an N -system, and an ad hoc wireless network. Whereas these results are obtained using the drift method, we additionally present a negative result showing a limitation of the drift method. We show that it is not possible to obtain the individual queue lengths using the drift method with polynomial test functions. We do this by presenting an alternate view of the drift method in terms of a system of linear equations, and we use this system of equations to obtain bounds on arbitrary linear combinations of the queue lengths.},

We propose a new theoretical framework for the instance complexity for the RCPSP, consecutively incorporating precedence constraints, resource constraints, and activity durations. Our approach contributes to the existing knowledge base in two ways. First, it is independent from solution algorithms, which enables generalisable conclusions. Second, the theoretical perspective enables a deeper understanding of the drivers of instance complexity. We evaluate the performance of our approach with a series of computational experiments. These show that our framework is a strong discriminator between easy and hard instances and explains a large fraction of CPU times of optimal solution algorithms.},

  abstract     = {We introduce the pipeline intervention problem, defined by a layered directed acyclic graph and a set of stochastic matrices governing transitions between successive layers. The graph is a stylized model for how people from different populations are presented opportunities, eventually leading to some reward. In our model, individuals are born into an initial position (i.e., some node in the first layer of the graph) according to a fixed probability distribution and then stochastically progress through the graph according to the transition matrices until they reach a node in the final layer of the graph; each node in the final layer has a reward associated with it. The pipeline intervention problem asks how to best make costly changes to the transition matrices governing people’s stochastic transitions through the graph subject to a budget constraint. We consider two objectives: social welfare maximization and a fairness-motivated maximin objective that seeks to maximize the value to the population (starting node) with the least expected value. We consider two variants of the maximin objective that turn out to be distinct, depending on whether we demand a deterministic solution or allow randomization. For each objective, we give an efficient approximation algorithm (an additive fully polynomial-time approximation scheme) for constant-width networks. We also tightly characterize the “price of fairness” in our setting: the ratio between the highest achievable social welfare and the social welfare consistent with a maximin optimal solution. Finally, we show that, for polynomial-width networks, even approximating the maximin objective to any constant factor is NP hard even for networks with constant depth. This shows that the restriction on the width in our positive results is essential.},

Even though agents may enter the network over time for an infinite number of periods, we prove that under a mild condition, the residence time of every agent is upper bounded (by a network-dependent constant plus the total number of agents inside the network at the entry time of the agent). Applying this result to three game models of atomic dynamic routing in the recent literature, we establish that the residence times of selfish agents in a series-parallel network with a single origin-destination pair are upper bounded at equilibrium, provided the number of incoming agents at each time point does not exceed the network capacity (i.e., the smallest total capacity of edges in the network whose removal separates the origin from the destination).},

Without any assumption, it is proved that the Slater condition for the Clarke (respectively, Bouligand) tangent derivative with respect to K is always stable when the objective function F undergoes small Lipschitz (calm) perturbations. Based on this, we prove that if the Clarke (Bouligand) tangent derivative of F satisfies the Slater condition (with respect to K ) then the conic inequality determined by F has a stable metric subregularity when F undergoes small Lipschitz (calm regular) perturbations. In the composite-convexity case, the converse implication is also proved to be true. Moreover, under the Slater condition for the tangent derivative of F , it is proved that the normal cone to the sublevel set of F can be formulated by the subdifferential of F , which improves the corresponding results in either the smooth or convex case. As applications, without any qualification assumption, we improve and generalize formulas for the normal cone to a convex sublevel set by Cabot and Thibault [(2014), Sequential formulae for the normal cone to sublevel sets.

  abstract     = {Motivated by bursty bandwidth allocation and by the allocation of virtual machines to servers in the cloud, we consider the online problem of packing items with random sizes into unit-capacity bins. Items arrive sequentially, but on arrival, an item’s actual size is unknown; only its probabilistic information is available to the decision maker. Without knowing this size, the decision maker must irrevocably pack the item into an available bin or place it in a new bin. Once packed in a bin, the decision maker observes the item’s actual size, and overflowing the bin is a possibility. An overflow incurs a large penalty cost, and the corresponding bin is unusable for the rest of the process. In practical terms, this overflow models delayed services, failure of servers, and/or loss of end-user goodwill. The objective is to minimize the total expected cost given by the sum of the number of opened bins and the overflow penalty cost. We present an online algorithm with expected cost at most a constant factor times the cost incurred by the optimal packing policy when item sizes are drawn from an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sequence of unknown length. We give a similar result when item size distributions are exponential with arbitrary rates. We also study the offline model, where distributions are known in advance but must be packed sequentially. We construct a soft-capacity polynomial-time approximation scheme for this problem and show that the complexity of computing the optimal offline cost is # P -hard. Finally, we provide an empirical study of our online algorithm’s performance.},

  abstract     = {Consensus halving refers to the problem of dividing a resource into two parts so that every agent values both parts equally. Prior work shows that, when the resource is represented by an interval, a consensus halving with at most n cuts always exists but is hard to compute even for agents with simple valuation functions. In this paper, we study consensus halving in a natural setting in which the resource consists of a set of items without a linear ordering. For agents with linear and additively separable utilities, we present a polynomial-time algorithm that computes a consensus halving with at most n cuts and show that n cuts are almost surely necessary when the agents’ utilities are randomly generated. On the other hand, we show that, for a simple class of monotonic utilities, the problem already becomes polynomial parity argument, directed version–hard. Furthermore, we compare and contrast consensus halving with the more general problem of consensus k -splitting, with which we wish to divide the resource into k parts in possibly unequal ratios and provide some consequences of our results on the problem of computing small agreeable sets.},

  abstract     = {We consider the H ypergraph - k -C ut problem. The input consists of a hypergraph G = ( V , E ) with nonnegative hyperedge-costs c : E → R + and a positive integer k . The objective is to find a minimum cost subset F ⊆ E such that the number of connected components in G – F is at least k . An alternative formulation of the objective is to find a partition of V into k nonempty sets V 1 , V 2 , … , V k so as to minimize the cost of the hyperedges that cross the partition. G raph- k - C ut , the special case of H ypergraph - k -C ut obtained by restricting to graph inputs, has received considerable attention. Several different approaches lead to a polynomial-time algorithm for G raph- k - C ut when k is fixed, starting with the work of Goldschmidt and Hochbaum (Math of OR, 1994). In contrast, it is only recently that a randomized polynomial time algorithm for H ypergraph - k -C ut was developed (Chandrasekaran, Xu, Yu, Math Programming, 2019) via a subtle generalization of Karger’s random contraction approach for graphs. In this work, we develop the first deterministic algorithm for H ypergraph - k -C ut that runs in polynomial time for any fixed k . We describe two algorithms both of which are based on a divide and conquer approach. The first algorithm is simpler and runs in n O ( k 2 ) m time while the second one runs in n O ( k ) m time, where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of hyperedges in the input hypergraph. Our proof relies on new structural results that allow for efficient recovery of the parts of an optimum k -partition by solving minimum ( S , T )-terminal cuts. Our techniques give new insights even for G raph- k - C ut .},

Initially, nature chooses one player according to some fixed distribution and gives the player a buck. This player passes the buck to one of the player’s out-neighbors in the graph. The procedure is repeated indefinitely. In one class of games, each player wants to minimize the asymptotic expected frequency of times that the player receives the buck. In the other class of games, the player wants to maximize it. The PageRank game is a particular case of these maximizing games. We consider deterministic and stochastic versions of the game, depending on how players select the neighbor to which to pass the buck. In both cases, we prove the existence of pure equilibria that do not depend on the initial distribution; this is achieved by showing the existence of a generalized ordinal potential. If the graph on which the game is played admits a Hamiltonian cycle, then this is the outcome of prior-free Nash equilibrium in the minimizing game. For the minimizing game, we then use the price of anarchy and stability to measure fairness of these equilibria.},

Moreover, we show the existence of deterministic optimal policies for both players. This is in contrast to classical zero-sum games. In case the state space is the real line, we show under some convexity assumptions that the interchange of supremum and infimum is possible with the help of Sion’s minimax theorem. Further, we consider the problem with special ambiguity sets. In particular, we are able to derive some cases where the robust optimization problem coincides with the minimization of a coherent risk measure.

The considered model extends one originally proposed to study systemic risk in networks of financial institutions interconnected by mutual obligations. It is one of the simplest continuous models accounting for shock propagation phenomena and cascading failure effects. This model also characterizes Nash equilibria of constrained quadratic network games with strategic complementarities. We first derive explicit expressions for network equilibria and prove necessary and sufficient conditions for their uniqueness, encompassing and generalizing results available in the literature. Then, we study jump discontinuities of the network equilibria when the exogenous flows cross certain regions of measure 0 representable as graphs of continuous functions. Finally, we discuss some implications of our results in the two main motivating applications. In financial networks, this bifurcation phenomenon is responsible for how small shocks in the assets of a few nodes can trigger major aggregate losses to the system and cause the default of several agents. In constrained quadratic network games, it induces a blow-up behavior of the sensitivity of Nash equilibria with respect to the individual benefits.},

We link the dual problem to American option pricing with stochastic volatility and prove that the duality gap is closed. We then apply our theory to a hidden Markov model for regime-switching mean return with Bayesian learning. We fully characterize the existence and uniqueness of variational inequality in the dual optimal stopping problem, as well as the free boundary of the problem.

Although multiple hardness results exist in this setup for finding fair/efficient cake divisions, we show that, if the value densities of the agents satisfy the monotone likelihood ratio property (MLRP), then strong algorithmic results hold for various notions of fairness and economic efficiency. Addressing cake-cutting instances with MLRP, first we develop an algorithm that finds cake divisions (with connected pieces) that are envy free, up to an arbitrary precision. The time complexity of our algorithm is polynomial in the number of agents and the bit complexity of an underlying Lipschitz constant. We obtain similar positive results for maximizing social, egalitarian, and Nash social welfare. Many distribution families bear MLRP. In particular, this property holds if all the value densities belong to any one of the following families: Gaussian (with the same variance), linear, Poisson, and exponential distributions, linear translations of any log-concave function. Hence, through MLRP, the current work obtains novel cake-cutting algorithms for multiple distribution families.},

  abstract     = {We analyze a firm’s optimal pricing of a new service when consumers interact in a network and impose positive externality on one another. The firm initially provides its service for free, leveraging network externality to promote rapid service consumption growth. The firm raises the price and starts earning revenue only when a sufficient level of consumer interactions is established. Incorporating the local network effects in a nonstationary dynamic model, we study the impact of network structure on the firm’s revenue and optimal pricing decision. We find that the firm delays the timing of service monetization when it faces a more strongly connected network despite the fact that such a network allows the firm to monetize the service sooner by resulting in faster consumption growth. We also find that the firm benefits from network imbalance; that is, the firm prefers a network of consumers with varying degrees of connections to that with similar degrees of connections. We also study the value of knowing the network structure and discuss how such knowledge impacts the firm’s profitability. Our analyses rely on the techniques from algebraic graph theory, which enable us to solve the firm’s high-dimensional dynamic pricing problem by relating it to the network’s spectral characteristics.},

  abstract     = {This paper has two main goals: (a) establish several statistical properties—consistency, asymptotic distributions, and convergence rates—of stationary solutions and values of a class of coupled nonconvex and nonsmooth empirical risk-minimization problems and (b) validate these properties by a noisy amplitude-based phase-retrieval problem, the latter being of much topical interest. Derived from available data via sampling, these empirical risk-minimization problems are the computational workhorse of a population risk model that involves the minimization of an expected value of a random functional. When these minimization problems are nonconvex, the computation of their globally optimal solutions is elusive. Together with the fact that the expectation operator cannot be evaluated for general probability distributions, it becomes necessary to justify whether the stationary solutions of the empirical problems are practical approximations of the stationary solution of the population problem. When these two features, general distribution and nonconvexity, are coupled with nondifferentiability that often renders the problems “non-Clarke regular,” the task of the justification becomes challenging. Our work aims to address such a challenge within an algorithm-free setting. The resulting analysis is, therefore, different from much of the analysis in the recent literature that is based on local search algorithms. Furthermore, supplementing the classical global minimizer-centric analysis, our results offer a promising step to close the gap between computational optimization and asymptotic analysis of coupled, nonconvex, nonsmooth statistical estimation problems, expanding the former with statistical properties of the practically obtained solution and providing the latter with a more practical focus pertaining to computational tractability.},

  abstract     = {The recent surge of breakthroughs in machine learning and artificial intelligence has sparked renewed interest in large-scale stochastic optimization problems that are universally considered hard. One of the most widely used methods for solving such problems is distributed asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (DASGD), a family of algorithms that result from parallelizing stochastic gradient descent on distributed computing architectures (possibly) asychronously. However, a key obstacle in the efficient implementation of DASGD is the issue of delays : when a computing node contributes a gradient update, the global model parameter may have already been updated by other nodes several times over, thereby rendering this gradient information stale. These delays can quickly add up if the computational throughput of a node is saturated, so the convergence of DASGD may be compromised in the presence of large delays. Our first contribution is that, by carefully tuning the algorithm’s step size, convergence to the critical set is still achieved in mean square, even if the delays grow unbounded at a polynomial rate. We also establish finer results in a broad class of structured optimization problems (called variationally coherent), where we show that DASGD converges to a global optimum with a probability of one under the same delay assumptions. Together, these results contribute to the broad landscape of large-scale nonconvex stochastic optimization by offering state-of-the-art theoretical guarantees and providing insights for algorithm design.},

  abstract     = {Demand response programs in retail electricity markets are very popular. However, despite their success in reducing average consumption, the random responsiveness of consumers to price events makes their efficiency questionable to achieve the flexibility needed for electric systems with a large share of renewable energy. This paper aims at designing demand response contracts that allow to act on both the average consumption and its variance. The interaction between a risk-averse producer and a risk-averse consumer is modelled as a principal–agent problem, thus accounting for the moral hazard underlying demand response contracts. The producer, facing the limited flexibility of production, pays an appropriate incentive compensation to encourage the consumer to reduce his average consumption and to enhance his responsiveness. We provide a closed-form solution for the optimal contract in the linear case. We show that the optimal contract has a rebate form where the initial condition of the consumption serves as a baseline and where the consumer is charged a price for energy and a price for volatility. The first-best price for energy is a convex combination of the marginal cost and the marginal value of energy, where the weights are given by the risk-aversion ratios, and the first-best price for volatility is the risk-aversion ratio times the marginal cost of volatility. The second-best price, for energy and volatility, is a decreasing nonlinear function of time inducing decreasing effort. The price for energy is lower (respectively, higher) than the marginal cost of energy during peak-load (respectively, off-peak) periods. We illustrate the potential benefits issued from the implementation of an incentive mechanism on the responsiveness of the consumer by calibrating our model with publicly available data.},

We call this counterpart the approximate value iteration (AVI) scheme. Neural networks are often used as function approximators, in order to counter Bellman’s curse of dimensionality. In this paper, they are used to approximate the Bellman operator. Because neural networks are typically trained using sample data, errors and biases may be introduced. The design of AVI accounts for implementations with biased approximations of the Bellman operator and sampling errors. We present verifiable sufficient conditions under which AVI is stable (almost surely bounded) and converges to a fixed point of the approximate Bellman operator. To ensure the stability of AVI, we present three different yet related sets of sufficient conditions that are based on the existence of an appropriate Lyapunov function. These Lyapunov function–based conditions are easily verifiable and new to the literature. The verifiability is enhanced by the fact that a recipe for the construction of the necessary Lyapunov function is also provided. We also show that the stability analysis of AVI can be readily extended to the general case of set-valued stochastic approximations. Finally, we show that AVI can also be used in more general circumstances, that is, for finding fixed points of contractive set-valued maps.},

We develop a black-box approach for such problems in which the learner observes as feedback only losses of a subset of the actions that includes the selected action. When losses of actions are nonnegative, under the graph-based feedback model introduced by Mannor and Shamir, we offer algorithms that attain the so called “small-loss” o ( α L ⋆ ) regret bounds with high probability, where α is the independence number of the graph and L ⋆ is the loss of the best action. Prior to our work, there was no data-dependent guarantee for general feedback graphs even for pseudo-regret (without dependence on the number of actions, i.e., utilizing the increased information feedback). Taking advantage of the black-box nature of our technique, we extend our results to many other applications, such as combinatorial semi-bandits (including routing in networks), contextual bandits (even with an infinite comparator class), and learning with slowly changing (shifting) comparators. In the special case of multi-armed bandit and combinatorial semi-bandit problems, we provide optimal small-loss, high-probability regret guarantees of O ˜ ( d L ⋆ ) , where d is the number of actions, answering open questions of Neu. Previous bounds for multi-armed bandits and semi-bandits were known only for pseudo-regret and only in expectation.

  abstract     = {The doubly nonnegative (DNN) cone, being the set of all positive semidefinite matrices whose elements are nonnegative, is a popular approximation of the computationally intractable completely positive cone. The major difficulty for implementing a Newton-type method to compute the projection of a given large-scale matrix onto the DNN cone lies in the possible failure of the constraint nondegeneracy, a generalization of the linear independence constraint qualification for nonlinear programming. Such a failure results in the singularity of the Jacobian of the nonsmooth equation representing the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker optimality condition that prevents the semismooth Newton–conjugate gradient method from solving it with a desirable convergence rate. In this paper, we overcome the aforementioned difficulty by solving a sequence of better conditioned nonsmooth equations generated by the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) instead of solving one aforementioned singular equation. By leveraging the metric subregularity of the normal cone associated with the positive semidefinite cone, we derive sufficient conditions to ensure the dual quadratic growth condition of the underlying problem, which further leads to the asymptotically superlinear convergence of the proposed ALM. Numerical results on difficult randomly generated instances and from the semidefinite programming library are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm for computing the DNN projection to a very high accuracy.},

The existing methods for this problem usually have a weak convergence guarantee or require a feasible initial point. Inspired by the recent work by Pang et al.

We show that any feasible accumulation point of the solution sequence generated by such a penalty method is a B-stationary point of the problem under a weakest possible assumption that it satisfies a pointwise Slater constraint qualification (PSCQ). The second one is an augmented Lagrangian (AL) method that consists of finding an approximate D-stationary point of a sequence of AL subproblems. Under the same PSCQ condition as for the penalty method, we show that any feasible accumulation point of the solution sequence generated by such an AL method is a B-stationary point of the problem, and moreover, it satisfies a Karush–Kuhn–Tucker type of optimality condition for the problem, together with any accumulation point of the sequence of a set of auxiliary Lagrangian multipliers.

We study the problem of designing truthful mechanisms that have good approximation guarantees and never pay the participating agents (sellers) more than the budget. We focus on the case of general (non-monotone) submodular valuation functions and derive the first truthful, budget-feasible, and O (1)-approximation mechanisms that run in polynomial time in the value query model, for both offline and online auctions. Prior to our work, the only O (1)-approximation mechanism known for non-monotone submodular objectives required an exponential number of value queries. At the heart of our approach lies a novel greedy algorithm for non-monotone submodular maximization under a knapsack constraint. Our algorithm builds two candidate solutions simultaneously (to achieve a good approximation), yet ensures that agents cannot jump from one solution to the other (to implicitly enforce truthfulness). The fact that in our mechanism the agents are not ordered according to their marginal value per cost allows us to appropriately adapt these ideas to the online setting as well. To further illustrate the applicability of our approach, we also consider the case where additional feasibility constraints are present, for example, at most k agents can be selected. We obtain O ( p )-approximation mechanisms for both monotone and non-monotone submodular objectives, when the feasible solutions are independent sets of a p -system. With the exception of additive valuation functions, no mechanisms were known for this setting prior to our work. Finally, we provide lower bounds suggesting that, when one cares about nontrivial approximation guarantees in polynomial time, our results are, asymptotically, the best possible.},

The decision maker needs to choose a pair of items for comparison in each step, decide when to stop data collection, and make a final decision after stopping based on a sequential flow of information. Because of the complex ranking structure, existing sequential analysis methods are not suitable. In this paper, we formulate the problem under a Bayesian decision framework and propose sequential procedures that are asymptotically optimal. These procedures achieve asymptotic optimality by seeking a balance between exploration (i.e., finding the most indistinguishable pair of items) and exploitation (i.e., comparing the most indistinguishable pair based on the current information). New analytical tools are developed for proving the asymptotic results, combining advanced change of measure techniques for handling the level crossing of likelihood ratios and classic large deviation results for martingales, which are of separate theoretical interest in solving complex sequential design problems. A mirror-descent algorithm is developed for the computation of the proposed sequential procedures.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study second-order optimality conditions for nonconvex set-constrained optimization problems. For a convex set-constrained optimization problem, it is well known that second-order optimality conditions involve the support function of the second-order tangent set. In this paper, we propose two approaches for establishing second-order optimality conditions for the nonconvex case. In the first approach, we extend the concept of the support function so that it is applicable to general nonconvex set-constrained problems, whereas in the second approach, we introduce the notion of the directional regular tangent cone and apply classical results of convex duality theory. Besides the second-order optimality conditions, the novelty of our approach lies in the systematic introduction and use, respectively, of directional versions of well-known concepts from variational analysis.},

  abstract     = {We study statistical estimators computed using iterative optimization methods that are not run until completion. Classical results on maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) assert that a one-step estimator (OSE), in which a single Newton-Raphson iteration is performed from a starting point with certain properties, is asymptotically equivalent to the MLE. We further develop these early-stopping results by deriving properties of one-step estimators defined by a single iteration of scaled proximal methods. Our main results show the asymptotic equivalence of the likelihood-based estimator and various one-step estimators defined by scaled proximal methods. By interpreting OSEs as the last of a sequence of iterates, our results provide insight on scaling numerical tolerance with sample size. Our setting contains scaled proximal gradient descent applied to certain composite models as a special case, making our results applicable to many problems of practical interest. Additionally, our results provide support for the utility of the scaled Moreau envelope as a statistical smoother by interpreting scaled proximal descent as a quasi-Newton method applied to the scaled Moreau envelope.},

  abstract     = {Demand forecasting plays an important role in many inventory control problems. To mitigate the potential harms of model misspecification in this context, various forms of distributionally robust optimization have been applied. Although many of these methodologies suffer from the problem of time inconsistency, the work of Klabjan et al. established a general time-consistent framework for such problems by connecting to the literature on robust Markov decision processes. Motivated by the fact that many forecasting models exhibit very special structure as well as a desire to understand the impact of positing different dependency structures in distributionally robust multistage optimization, we formulate and solve a time-consistent distributionally robust multistage newsvendor model, which naturally robustifies some of the simplest inventory models with demand forecasting. In particular, in some of the simplest such models, demand evolves as a martingale (i.e., expected demand tomorrow equals realized demand today). We consider a robust variant of such models in which the sequence of future demands may be any martingale with given mean and support. Under such a model, past realizations of demand are naturally incorporated into the structure of the uncertainty set going forward. We explicitly compute the minimax optimal policy (and worst-case distribution) in closed form by combining ideas from convex analysis, probability, and dynamic programming. We prove that, at optimality, the worst-case demand distribution corresponds to the setting in which inventory may become obsolete at a random time. To gain further insight, we prove weak convergence (as the time horizon grows large) to a simple and intuitive process. We also compare with the analogous setting in which demand is independent across periods (analyzed previously by Shapiro) and identify several differences between these models in the spirit of the price of correlations studied by Agrawal et al. Finally, we complement our results by providing both numerical experiments that illustrate the potential benefits and limitations of our approach as well as additional theoretical analyses exploring what happens when our modeling assumptions do not hold.},

We propose a proximal subgradient algorithm with extrapolations for solving this optimization model and show that the iterated sequence generated by the algorithm is bounded and that any one of its limit points is a stationary point of the model problem. The choice of our extrapolation parameter is flexible and includes the popular extrapolation parameter adopted in the restarted fast iterative shrinking-threshold algorithm (FISTA). By providing a unified analysis framework of descent methods, we establish the convergence of the full sequence under the assumption that a suitable merit function satisfies the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz property. Our algorithm exhibits linear convergence for the scale-invariant sparse signal reconstruction problem and the Rayleigh quotient problem over spherical constraint. When the denominator is the maximum of finitely many continuously differentiable weakly convex functions, we also propose another extrapolated proximal subgradient algorithm with guaranteed convergence to a stronger notion of stationary points of the model problem. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methods by both analytical and simulated numerical examples.},

Here we introduce an alternative notion of self-concordance that is linked to the projective structure. A function on a set X in an affine space is projectively self-concordant if and only if it can be extended to an affinely self-concordant logarithmically homogeneous function on the conic extension of X . The feasible sets in conic programs, notably linear and semidefinite programs, are naturally equipped with projectively self-concordant barriers. However, the interior-point methods used to solve these programs use only affine self-concordance. We show that estimates used in the analysis of interior-point methods are tighter for projective self-concordance, in particular inner and outer approximations of the set. This opens the way to a better tuning of parameters in interior-points algorithms to allow larger steps and hence faster convergence. Projective self-concordance is also a useful tool in the theoretical analysis of logarithmically homogeneous barriers on cones.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of estimating the discrete clustering structures under the sub-Gaussian mixture model. Our main results establish a hidden integrality property of a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation for this problem: while the optimal solution to the SDP is not integer-valued in general, its estimation error can be upper bounded by that of an idealized integer program. The error of the integer program, and hence that of the SDP, are further shown to decay exponentially in the signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, we show that the SDP relaxation is robust under the semirandom setting in which an adversary can modify the data generated from the mixture model. In particular, we generalize the hidden integrality property to the semirandom model and thereby show that SDP achieves the optimal error bound in this setting. These results together highlight the “global-to-local” mechanism that drives the performance of the SDP relaxation. To the best of our knowledge, our result is the first exponentially decaying error bound for convex relaxations of mixture models. A corollary of our results shows that in certain regimes, the SDP solutions are in fact integral and exact. More generally, our results establish sufficient conditions for the SDP to correctly recover the cluster memberships of ( 1 − δ ) fraction of the points for any δ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) . As a special case, we show that under the d -dimensional stochastic ball model, SDP achieves nontrivial (sometimes exact) recovery when the center separation is as small as 1 / d , which improves upon previous exact recovery results that require constant separation.},

Explicit formulas of the inf-convolution and Pareto-optimal allocations are obtained in the case of a mixed collection of left and right VaRs, and in that of a VaR and another tail risk measure. The inf-convolution of tail risk measures is shown to be a tail risk measure with an aggregated tail parameter, a phenomenon very similar to the cases of VaR, ES, and RVaR. Optimal allocations are obtained in the settings of elliptical models and model uncertainty. In particular, several results are established for tail risk measures in the presence of model uncertainty, which may be of independent interest outside the framework of risk sharing. The technical conclusions are quite general without assuming any form of convexity of the tail risk measures. Our analysis generalizes in several directions the recent literature on quantile-based risk sharing.},

  abstract     = {The Bayesian persuasion paradigm of strategic communication models interaction between a privately informed sender and an ignorant but rational receiver . The goal is typically to design a (near-)optimal communication (or signaling ) scheme for the sender. It enables the sender to disclose information to the receiver in a way as to incentivize her to take an action that is preferred by the sender. Finding the optimal signaling scheme is known to be computationally difficult in general. This hardness is further exacerbated when the message space is constrained, leading to NP-hardness of approximating the optimal sender utility within any constant factor. In this paper, we show that in several natural and prominent cases the optimization problem is tractable even when the message space is limited. In particular, we study signaling under a symmetry or an independence assumption on the distribution of utility values for the actions. For symmetric distributions, we provide a novel characterization of the optimal signaling scheme. It results in a polynomial-time algorithm to compute an optimal scheme for many compactly represented symmetric distributions. In the independent case, we design a constant-factor approximation algorithm, which stands in marked contrast to the hardness of approximation in the general case.},

Under vertex arrival, the weights of all edges from the newly arriving vertex to all previously arrived vertices are revealed, and the algorithm decides which of these edges, if any, to include in the matching. To study these settings, we introduce a novel unified framework of batched-prophet inequalities that captures online settings where elements arrive in batches. Our algorithms rely on the construction of suitable online contention resolution scheme (OCRS). We first extend the framework of OCRS to batched-OCRS, we then establish a reduction from batched-prophet inequality to batched-OCRS, and finally we construct batched-OCRSs with selectable ratios of 0.337 and 0.5 for edge and vertex arrival models, respectively. Both results improve the state of the art for the corresponding settings. For vertex arrival, our result is tight.

  abstract     = {We study strategic games on weighted directed graphs, where each player’s payoff is defined as the sum of the weights on the edges from players who chose the same strategy, augmented by a fixed nonnegative integer bonus for picking a given strategy. These games capture the idea of coordination in the absence of globally common strategies. We identify natural classes of graphs for which finite improvement or coalition-improvement paths of polynomial length always exist, and consequently a (pure) Nash equilibrium or a strong equilibrium can be found in polynomial time. The considered classes of graphs are typical in network topologies: simple cycles correspond to the token ring local area networks, whereas open chains of simple cycles correspond to multiple independent rings topology from the recommendation G.8032v2 on Ethernet ring protection switching. For simple cycles, these results are optimal in the sense that without the imposed conditions on the weights and bonuses, a Nash equilibrium may not even exist. Finally, we prove that determining the existence of a Nash equilibrium or of a strong equilibrium is NP-complete already for unweighted graphs, with no bonuses assumed. This implies that the same problems for polymatrix games are strongly NP-hard.},

Under investigation is a highly structured multivariate monotone inclusion problem involving a mix of set-valued, cocoercive, and Lipschitzian monotone operators, as well as various monotonicity-preserving operations among them. This model encompasses most formulations found in the literature. A limitation of existing primal-dual algorithms is that they operate in a product space that is too small to achieve full splitting of our problem in the sense that each operator is used individually. To circumvent this difficulty, we recast the problem as that of finding a zero of a saddle operator that acts on a bigger space. This leads to an algorithm of unprecedented flexibility, which achieves full splitting, exploits the specific attributes of each operator, is asynchronous, and requires to activate only blocks of operators at each iteration, as opposed to activating all of them. The latter feature is of critical importance in large-scale problems. The weak convergence of the main algorithm is established, as well as the strong convergence of a variant. Various applications are discussed, and instantiations of the proposed framework in the context of variational inequalities and minimization problems are presented.},

The separation algorithm takes O ( d n log d ) time, where d is the number of inner functions and n is the number of estimators for each inner function. Consequently, we derive large classes of inequalities that tighten prevalent factorable programming relaxations. We also generalize a decomposition result and devise techniques to simultaneously separate hypographs of various supermodular, concave-extendable functions using facet-defining inequalities. Assuming that the outer function is convex in each argument, we characterize the limiting relaxation obtained with infinitely many estimators as the solution of an optimal transport problem. When the outer function is also supermodular, we obtain an explicit integral formula for this relaxation.},

It is well known that the value function reformulation provides an equivalent single-level optimization problem, but it results in a nonsmooth optimization problem that never satisfies the usual constraint qualification, such as the Mangasarian–Fromovitz constraint qualification (MFCQ). In this paper, we show that even the first order sufficient condition for metric subregularity (which is, in general, weaker than MFCQ) fails at each feasible point of the bilevel program. We introduce the concept of a directional calmness condition and show that, under the directional calmness condition, the directional necessary optimality condition holds. Although the directional optimality condition is, in general, sharper than the nondirectional one, the directional calmness condition is, in general, weaker than the classical calmness condition and, hence, is more likely to hold. We perform the directional sensitivity analysis of the value function and propose the directional quasi-normality as a sufficient condition for the directional calmness. An example is given to show that the directional quasi-normality condition may hold for the bilevel program.},

The class of admissible control policies are those that are head-of-the-line (HL) and nonanticipating. For a sequence of many-server queues operating under admissible HL control policies and satisfying some mild asymptotic conditions, we establish a tightness result for the sequence of fluid scaled queue state descriptors and associated processes and show that limit points of such sequences are fluid model solutions almost surely. The tightness result together with the characterization of distributional limit points as fluid model solutions almost surely provides a foundation for the analysis of particular HL control policies of interest. We leverage these results to analyze a set of admissible HL control policies that we introduce, called weighted random buffer selection (WRBS), and an associated WRBS fluid model that allows multiple classes to be partially served in the fluid limit (which is in contrast to previously analyzed static priority policies).},

The former property helps us show that the proposed method converges globally to an M-stationary (better than C-stationary) point under MPCC relaxed constant positive linear dependence condition. Theoretical comparison with existing AL methods demonstrates that the proposed method is superior in terms of the quality of accumulation points and the strength of assumptions. Numerical comparison, based on problems in MacMPEC, validates the theoretical results.},

This equality of marginal distributions implies that the values of major objective criteria, including expected discounted total costs and average rewards per unit time, are equal for these two policies. This paper investigates the validity of the similar fact for continuous-time jump Markov decision processes (CTJMDPs). It is shown in this paper that the equality of marginal distributions takes place for a CTJMDP if the corresponding Markov policy defines a nonexplosive jump Markov process. If this Markov process is explosive, then at each time instance, the marginal probability, that a state-action pair belongs to a measurable set of state-action pairs, is not greater for the described Markov policy than the same probability for the original policy. These results are applied in this paper to CTJMDPs with expected discounted total costs and average costs per unit time. It is shown for these criteria that, if the initial state distribution is fixed, then for every policy, there exists a Markov policy with the same or better value of the objective function.},

What makes this problem challenging is that the decision whether τ = t may only depend on the values of the random variables X 1 , … , X t and on the distribution F . For a long time, the best known bound for the problem had been α ≥ 1 − 1 / e ≈ 0.632 , but recently a tight bound of α ≈ 0.745 was obtained. The case where F is unknown, such that the decision whether τ = t may depend only on the values of the random variables X 1 , … , X t , is equally well motivated but has received much less attention. A straightforward guarantee for this case of α ≥ 1 / e ≈ 0.368 can be derived from the well-known optimal solution to the secretary problem, where an arbitrary set of values arrive in random order and the goal is to maximize the probability of selecting the largest value. We show that this bound is in fact tight. We then investigate the case where the stopping time may additionally depend on a limited number of samples from F , and we show that, even with o ( n ) samples, α ≤ 1 / e . On the other hand, n samples allow for a significant improvement, whereas O ( n 2 ) samples are equivalent to knowledge of the distribution: specifically, with n samples, α ≥ 1 − 1 / e ≈ 0.632 and α ≤ ln ( 2 ) ≈ 0.693 , and with O ( n 2 ) samples, α ≥ 0.745 − ε for any ε &gt; 0 .},

The idea is simple: independently sample elements from the ground set and use simple combinatorial techniques (such as greedy or local search) on these sampled elements. We show that this approach leads to optimal/state-of-the-art results despite being much simpler than existing methods.

The approximation ratio improves to p + 1 and p for monotone submodular and linear objectives, respectively. In the streaming setting, we present S ample- S treaming , which obtains a ( 4 p + 2 − o ( 1 ) ) -approximation for maximizing a submodular function subject to a p -matchoid using O ( k ) memory and O ( k m / p ) evaluation and feasibility queries per element, and m is the number of matroids defining the p -matchoid. The approximation ratio improves to 4 p for monotone submodular objectives. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on video summarization, location summarization, and movie recommendation tasks.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic network flows, or network flows over time, constitute an important model for real-world situations in which steady states are unusual, such as urban traffic and the internet. These applications immediately raise the issue of analyzing dynamic network flows from a game-theoretic perspective. In this paper, we study dynamic equilibria in the deterministic fluid queuing model in single-source, single-sink networks—arguably the most basic model for flows over time. In the last decade, we have witnessed significant developments in the theoretical understanding of the model. However, several fundamental questions remain open. One of the most prominent ones concerns the price of anarchy, measured as the worst-case ratio between the minimum time required to route a given amount of flow from the source to the sink and the time a dynamic equilibrium takes to perform the same task. Our main result states that, if we could reduce the inflow of the network in a dynamic equilibrium, then the price of anarchy is bounded by a factor, parameterized by the longest path length that converges to e / ( e − 1 ) , and this is tight. This significantly extends a result by Bhaskar et al. (SODA 2011). Furthermore, our methods allow us to determine that the price of anarchy in parallel-link and parallel-path networks is exactly 4/3. Finally, we argue that, if a certain, very natural, monotonicity conjecture holds, the price of anarchy in the general case is exactly e / ( e − 1 ) .},

Choosing the configuration model as underlying graph, we prove fluid limits for the baseline model, as well as extensions to the directed case, state-dependent interarrival times and the case of growth driven by upward jumps. We obtain explicit ruin probabilities for the nodes according to their characteristics: initial threshold and in- (and out-) degree. We then allow nodes to choose their connectivity by trading off link benefits and contagion risk. We define a rational equilibrium concept in which nodes choose their connectivity according to an expected failure probability of any given link and then impose condition that the expected failure probability coincides with the actual failure probability under the optimal connectivity. We show existence of an asymptotic equilibrium and convergence of the sequence of equilibria on the finite networks. In particular, our results show that systems with higher overall growth may have higher failure probability in equilibrium.},

This facilitates large-population asymptotics for various graph sequences, with several sparse and dense examples discussed in detail. In particular, the mean field game is the correct limit only in the dense graph case, that is, when the degrees diverge in a suitable sense. Although equilibrium strategies are nonlocal, depending on the behavior of all players, we use a correlation decay estimate to prove a propagation of chaos result in both the dense and sparse regimes, with the sparse case owing to the large distances between typical vertices. Without assuming the graphs are transitive, we show also that the mean field game solution can be used to construct decentralized approximate equilibria on any sufficiently dense graph sequence.},

(2017). The main aim of this paper is to better understand the combinatorial structure of the dock reallocation problem through the connection with M-convexity and show its polynomial-time solvability using this connection. For this, we first show that the dock reallocation problem and its generalizations can be reformulated in the form of (MML1). We then present a pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm for (MML1) based on the steepest descent approach. We also propose two polynomial-time algorithms for (MML1) by replacing the L1-distance constraint with a simple linear constraint. Finally, we apply the results for (MML1) to the dock reallocation problem to obtain a pseudo-polynomial-time steepest descent algorithm and also polynomial-time algorithms for this problem. For this purpose, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm for a relaxation of the dock reallocation problem by using a proximity-scaling approach, which is of interest in its own right.},

Our main result is a simple quasi-polynomial time O ( log k log log k ) -approximation algorithm for this problem, in which k ≤ | V | is the number of vertices in an optimal solution. As a consequence, we obtain an O ( log 2 k log log k ) -approximation algorithm for directed (polymatroid) Steiner tree in quasi-polynomial time. We also extend our main result to a setting with additional length bounds at vertices, which leads to improved O ( log 2 k log log k ) -approximation algorithms for the single-source buy-at-bulk and priority Steiner tree problems. For the usual directed Steiner tree problem, our result matches the best previous approximation ratio but improves significantly on the running time. For polymatroid Steiner tree and single-source buy-at-bulk, our result improves prior approximation ratios by a logarithmic factor. For directed priority Steiner tree, our result seems to be the first nontrivial approximation ratio. Under certain complexity assumptions, our approximation ratios are the best possible (up to constant factors).},

Two types of folk theorems are proven without the public randomization assumption: the asymptotic one, that is, the equilibrium payoff set converges to the feasible and individual rational set as players become patient, and the uniform one, that is, any payoff in the feasible and individual rational set is sustained by a single strategy profile that is an approximate subgame perfect Nash equilibrium in all games with sufficiently patient discount factors. We use two methods for the study of asymptotic folk theorem: the self-generating approach and the constructive proof. We present the constructive proof in the perfect-monitoring case and show that it can be extended to time-inconsistent preferences. The self-generating approach applies to the public-monitoring case but may not extend to time-inconsistent preferences because of a nonmonotonicity result.},

We find that, under nonstrategic bidding, double auction clears with zero trades precisely when the agents’ current holdings are on the Pareto frontier. More interestingly, the double auctions implement Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” in the sense that, when starting from disequilibrium, repeated double auctions lead to a sequence of allocations that converges to individually rational Pareto allocations.},

Specifically, for stochastic programming (SP) models with latently decision-dependent uncertainty, without any parametric assumption of the latent dependency, we develop a coupled learning enabled optimization (CLEO) algorithm in which the learning step of predicting the local dependency and the optimization step of computing a candidate decision are conducted interactively. The CLEO algorithm automatically balances the exploration and exploitation via the trust region method with active sampling. Under certain assumptions, we show that the sequence of solutions provided by CLEO converges to a directional stationary point of the original nonconvex and nonsmooth SP problem with probability 1.

Several semidefinite programming relaxations have been proposed recently that exploit a variety of mathematical structures including, for example, algebraic connectivity, permutation matrices, and association schemes. The main results of this paper are twofold. First, de Klerk and Sotirov [de Klerk E, Sotirov R (2012) Improved semidefinite programming bounds for quadratic assignment problems with suitable symmetry. Math. Programming 133(1):75–91.] present a semidefinite program (SDP) based on permutation matrices and symmetry reduction; they show that it is incomparable to the subtour elimination linear program but generally dominates it on small instances. We provide a family of simplicial TSP instances that shows that the integrality gap of this SDP is unbounded. Second, we show that these simplicial TSP instances imply the unbounded integrality gap of every SDP relaxation of the TSP mentioned in the survey on SDP relaxations of the TSP in section 2 of Sotirov [Sotirov R (2012) SDP relaxations for some combinatorial optimization problems. Anjos MF, Lasserre JB, eds., Handbook on Semidefinite, Conic and Polynomial Optimization (Springer, New York), 795–819.]. In contrast, the subtour linear program performs perfectly on simplicial instances. The simplicial instances thus form a natural litmus test for future SDP relaxations of the TSP.},

  abstract     = {We consider dynamic equilibria for flows over time under the fluid queuing model. In this model, queues on the links of a network take care of flow propagation. Flow enters the network at a single source and leaves at a single sink. In a dynamic equilibrium, every infinitesimally small flow particle reaches the sink as early as possible given the pattern of the rest of the flow. Although this model has been examined for many decades, progress has been relatively recent. In particular, the derivatives of dynamic equilibria have been characterized as thin flows with resetting, which allows for more structural results. Our two main results are based on the formulation of thin flows with resetting as a linear complementarity problem and its analysis. We present a constructive proof of existence for dynamic equilibria if the inflow rate is right-monotone. The complexity of computing thin flows with resetting, which occurs as a subproblem in this method, is still open. We settle it for the class of two-terminal, series-parallel networks by giving a recursive algorithm that solves the problem for all flow values simultaneously in polynomial time.},

The limit satisfies a system of deterministic integro-differential equations. The proof uses methods from weak convergence and stochastic analysis.

This paradoxical statement has a simple proof. Less obvious is a large deviations analogue of this fact, stated as follows: the decay rate of the probability that the long-run reneging count per unit time is atypically large or atypically small does not depend on the individual reneging rate. In this paper, the sample path large deviations principle for the model is proved and the rate function is computed. Next, large time asymptotics for the reneging rate are studied for the case when the arrival rate exceeds the service rate. The key ingredient is a calculus of variations analysis of the variational problem associated with atypical reneging. A characterization of the aforementioned decay rate, given explicitly in terms of the arrival and service rate parameters of the model, is provided yielding a precise mathematical description of this paradoxical behavior.},

Our mechanisms are built on the polymatroidal network flow model by Lawler and Martel. Additionally, they feature nice properties such as the incentive compatibility of buyers, individual rationality, Pareto optimality, and strong budget balance. The first mechanism is a two-sided generalization of the polyhedral clinching auction by Goel et al. for one-sided markets. The second mechanism is a reduce-to-recover algorithm that reduces the market to be one-sided, applies the polyhedral clinching auction by Goel et al., and lifts the resulting allocation to the original two-sided market via the polymatroidal network flow. Both mechanisms are implemented by polymatroid algorithms. We demonstrate how our framework is applied to the Internet display advertisement auctions.},

We introduce a framework for deriving valid inequalities for the reverse convex set from basic solutions that lie outside the convex set. We first propose an extension to intersection cuts that defines a two-term disjunction for a reverse convex set, which we refer to as an intersection disjunction. Next, we generalize this analysis to a multiterm disjunction by considering the convex set’s recession directions.

We show here that higher rungs in the countable Borel equivalence relation hierarchy can also shed light on equilibrium existence.

A matching M in G is popular if M does not lose a head-to-head election against any matching. Popular matchings generalize stable matchings. Unfortunately, when there are edge costs, to find or even approximate up to any factor a popular matching of minimum cost is NP-hard. Let opt be the cost of a min-cost popular matching. Our goal is to efficiently compute a matching of cost at most opt by paying the price of mildly relaxing popularity. Our main positive results are two bicriteria algorithms that find in polynomial time a “quasi-popular” matching of cost at most opt . Moreover, one of the algorithms finds a quasi-popular matching of cost at most that of a min-cost popular fractional matching, which could be much smaller than opt . Key to the other algorithm is a polynomial-size extended formulation for an integral polytope sandwiched between the popular and quasi-popular matching polytopes.

  abstract     = {This article poses the following problem: Does there exist a probability distribution over subsets of a finite partially ordered set (poset), such that a set of constraints involving marginal probabilities of the poset’s elements and maximal chains is satisfied? We present a combinatorial algorithm to positively resolve this question. The algorithm can be implemented in polynomial time in the special case where maximal chain probabilities are affine functions of their elements. This existence problem is relevant for the equilibrium characterization of a generic strategic interdiction game on a capacitated flow network. The game involves a routing entity that sends its flow through the network while facing path transportation costs and an interdictor who simultaneously interdicts one or more edges while facing edge interdiction costs. Using our existence result on posets and strict complementary slackness in linear programming, we show that the Nash equilibria of this game can be fully described using primal and dual solutions of a minimum-cost circulation problem. Our analysis provides a new characterization of the critical components in the interdiction game. It also leads to a polynomial-time approach for equilibrium computation.},

We identify at least three subclasses of convex problems in which our approach can apply to achieve linear convergence rates. The second idea is a new primal-dual-primal framework for implementing proximal Newton methods that has attractive computational features for a subclass of nonsmooth composite convex minimization problems.

The agent can revise the expected terminal wealth target dynamically to adapt to the change of the agent’s current wealth, and we consider the following three targets: (i) the agent’s current wealth multiplied by a target expected gross return rate, (ii) the risk-free payoff of the agent’s current wealth plus a premium, and (iii) a weighted average of the risk-free payoff of the agent’s current wealth and a preset aspiration level. We derive the so-called equilibrium strategy in closed form for each of the three targets and find that the agent effectively minimizes the variance of the instantaneous change of the agent’s wealth subject to a certain constraint on the expectation of the instantaneous change of the agent’s wealth.},

Instead of focusing on the existence of individual equilibriums, we study the set of values over all equilibriums, which we call the set value of the game. The set value is unique by nature and always exists (with possible value ∅ ). Similar to the standard value function in control literature, it enjoys many nice properties, such as regularity, stability, and more importantly, the dynamic programming principle. There are two main features in order to obtain the dynamic programming principle: (i) we must use closed-loop controls (instead of open-loop controls); and (ii) we must allow for path dependent controls, even if the problem is in a state-dependent (Markovian) setting. We shall consider both discrete and continuous time models with finite time horizon. For the latter, we will also provide a duality approach through certain standard PDE (or path-dependent PDE), which is quite efficient for numerically computing the set value of the game.},

This is an exponential improvement of the approximation factor with respect to the previously best deterministic algorithm. An appealing additional feature of the algorithm is that it only uses best-improvement steps in the actual game, as opposed to the previously best algorithms, that first had to transform the game itself. Our algorithm is an adaptation of the seminal algorithm by Caragiannis at al.

ACM Trans. Econom. Comput. 3(1):2:1–2:32.], but we utilize an approximate potential function directly on the original game instead of an exact one on a modified game. A critical component of our analysis, which is of independent interest, is the derivation of a novel bound of [ d / W ( d / ρ ) ] d + 1 for the price of anarchy (PoA) of ρ -approximate equilibria in weighted congestion games, where W is the Lambert-W function. More specifically, we show that this PoA is exactly equal to Φ d , ρ d + 1 , where Φ d , ρ is the unique positive solution of the equation ρ ( x + 1 ) d = x d + 1 . Our upper bound is derived via a smoothness-like argument, and thus holds even for mixed Nash and correlated equilibria, whereas our lower bound is simple enough to apply even to singleton congestion games.},

  abstract     = {Classical theory for quasi-Newton schemes has focused on smooth, deterministic, unconstrained optimization, whereas recent forays into stochastic convex optimization have largely resided in smooth, unconstrained, and strongly convex regimes. Naturally, there is a compelling need to address nonsmoothness, the lack of strong convexity, and the presence of constraints. Accordingly, this paper presents a quasi-Newton framework that can process merely convex and possibly nonsmooth (but smoothable) stochastic convex problems. We propose a framework that combines iterative smoothing and regularization with a variance-reduced scheme reliant on using an increasing sample size of gradients. We make the following contributions. (i) We develop a regularized and smoothed variable sample-size BFGS update (rsL-BFGS) that generates a sequence of Hessian approximations and can accommodate nonsmooth convex objectives by utilizing iterative regularization and smoothing. (ii) In strongly convex regimes with state-dependent noise, the proposed variable sample-size stochastic quasi-Newton (VS-SQN) scheme admits a nonasymptotic linear rate of convergence, whereas the oracle complexity of computing an ϵ -solution is O ( κ m + 1 / ϵ ) , where κ denotes the condition number and m ≥ 1 . In nonsmooth (but smoothable) regimes, using Moreau smoothing retains the linear convergence rate for the resulting smoothed VS-SQN (or sVS-SQN) scheme. Notably, the nonsmooth regime allows for accommodating convex constraints. To contend with the possible unavailability of Lipschitzian and strong convexity parameters, we also provide sublinear rates for diminishing step-length variants that do not rely on the knowledge of such parameters. (iii) In merely convex but smooth settings, the regularized VS-SQN scheme rVS-SQN displays a rate of O ( 1 / k ( 1 − ϵ ) ) with an oracle complexity of O ( 1 / ϵ 3 ) . When the smoothness requirements are weakened, the rate for the regularized and smoothed VS-SQN scheme rsVS-SQN worsens to O ( k − 1 / 3 ) . Such statements allow for a state-dependent noise assumption under a quadratic growth property on the objective. To the best of our knowledge, the rate results are among the first available rates for QN methods in nonsmooth regimes. Preliminary numerical evidence suggests that the schemes compare well with accelerated gradient counterparts on selected problems in stochastic optimization and machine learning with significant benefits in ill-conditioned regimes.},

We use the latter to derive the first nonrepresentability results for various nonconvex sets, such as the set of rank-1 matrices and the set of prime numbers. Finally, in correspondence with the seminal work on mixed-integer linear representability by Jeroslow and Lowe, we study the representability question under rationality assumptions. Under these rationality assumptions, we establish that representable sets obey strong regularity properties, such as periodicity, and we provide a complete characterization of representable subsets of the natural numbers and of representable compact sets. Interestingly, in the case of subsets of natural numbers, our results provide a clear separation between the mathematical modeling power of mixed-integer linear and mixed-integer convex optimization. In the case of compact sets, our results imply that using unbounded integer variables is necessary only for modeling unbounded sets.},

For nonhomogeneous cost functions, the initialization requires the solution of a convex quadratic program instead. For multi-commodity networks, both the initialization and every step of the algorithm require the solution of a convex program.
