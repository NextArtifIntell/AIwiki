  abstract     = {We present a classroom role play to immerse students in the difficulties of applying value-based pricing principles to the practice of B2B price negotiations at different levels of the hotel value chain. The students assume roles as hotel chain and individual hotel management and as key business clients to the individual hotels. Through strategic and tactical preparations that rely on incremental additions of information on the goals, students prepare themselves to negotiate aspects linked with B2B pricing in a hotel revenue management context and collect points based on their success. After the negotiations, they systematically reflect on their performance vis-à-vis their set intentions. The role play is targeted to be an assignment in master’s level hotel revenue management teaching, but it could be modified to target bachelor’s students or other fields in which value-based pricing is still at its infancy. Based on our experience with running the game in a classroom as well as twice remotely because of COVID-19, it is compatible with both forms of learning and could potentially be extended to an asynchronous online learning environment.},

An animal husbandry department needs to ensure timely replenishment of liquid nitrogen to several livestock locations to preserve semen straws, which are frozen for artificial insemination. The department wishes to explore a possible route redesign for cost reduction. The description in the case, as well as the presented data, is based on a real project undertaken by the authors. The case enables students to conceptualize and design sample routes manually to meet the cost objective. However, the main objective is to make students understand and implement solution heuristics for large-scale vehicle routing problems. It also allows students to compare various designs trying not only possible vehicle capacities but also three solution heuristics. Nevertheless, students can also realize the importance of the spreadsheet as a decision support tool for evaluating several options by integrating the chosen heuristic. An important milestone of the case project was the implementation of our recommendations by the animal husbandry department.},

  abstract     = {The primary objective of the case study is to help students understand, model, and solve capacity planning problems (i) when the production yield is uncertain and (ii) if the yield of first production is low, the product can be produced a second time. The dimension of random yield emphasizes supply chain management challenges beyond the traditional newsvendor problem, which has a nice closed-form solution. The dimension of operational flexibility underscores the importance of modeling skills, such as influence diagrams, that can be used to brainstorm, model, and solve new problems. Extensive use of the case in graduate supply chain management courses shows that in the absence of a mathematical model, students systematically deviate from optimal capacity usage. Usually, the presence of backup flexibility reduces first-period production. However, students’ responses often suggest cutting first production too much. When it is available, students consistently overuse the flexibility of second-period production. Overall, students believed the case was challenging and that it provides a valuable learning experience.},

It poses two challenges: (i) given the demand locations and volume, open a certain number of warehouses to ensure customer responsiveness and (ii) given those warehouses with capacity limits, determine an optimal distribution plan that minimizes the total distribution cost. This exercise is developed with the active participation of MBA students in an introductory OR course. The participants, attending the class online from different parts of India during the COVID-19 pandemic, helped generate realistic customer locations by sharing their location data. Visualizing this spatial data (after masking) in Google My Maps helps the students decide on suitable warehouse locations by considering the proximity to customers as well as diverse socioeconomic, political, and environmental factors. Then, using these warehouse and customer data, the optimal distribution plan is obtained by employing OpenSolver. Students appreciate the exposure—starting from data set generation to deriving an optimal solution—offered by this data-driven decision-making exercise.},

In this paper, we not only present the game itself, but we perform extensive numerical analysis to develop deeper insight regarding the effect of the different options. This analysis provides instructors with tools to modify our original costs to produce different winning combinations and to potentially play the game multiple times to strengthen the managerial insights derived in this illustration of addressing the problem of dependent events and statistical fluctuations in assembly lines. Instructors of analytics or modeling courses could even ask their students to design the basic Monte Carlo simulation model themselves.

Integer linear programming (ILP) is the standard technique for solving such problems. An alternative approach that is often conceptually appealing to students is to pose the problem as one of finding the best possible subset of p facilities out of n possible candidates. I developed an Excel workbook that allows students to interactively evaluate the quality of different subsets, to run a VBA macro that finds the optimal subset, or to solve an ILP formulation that finds the optimal subset. Spreadsheets are available for five classic discrete location models: (1) the location set-covering problem, (2) the maximal covering location problem, (3) the p -median problem, (4) the p -centers problem, and (5) the simple plant location problem. The results from an assignment in a master’s-level business analytics course indicate that the workbook facilitates a better conceptual understanding of the precise nature of the discrete facility location problems by showing that they can be solved via enumeration of all possible combinations of p subsets that can be drawn from n candidate locations. More important, students directly observe the superiority of ILP as a solution approach as n increases and as p approaches n /2.},

  abstract     = {Drawing on the scholarship of writing and learning, this article motivates the use of writing assignments in analytics courses and develops a framework for instructional design that advances both writing skills and discipline-specific learning. We translate a best practices set of foundational writing concepts into a matrix of design levers for analytics instructors and propose an instructional design process that balances discipline-specific learning goals with foundational writing concepts through specific writing activities. We summarize our experience applying the framework to a particular data science course and present some early evidence for favorable outcomes. The positive effect we observe extends beyond learning course concepts and includes increased student engagement and contributions to group work.},

  abstract     = {Systems thinking is recognized as an essential skill for understanding complex problem solving and decision making associated with many of the contemporary issues faced by individuals and communities. In this article, our goal is to contribute to the knowledge of curriculum and pedagogy of formal systems thinking teaching in higher education. We believe that accumulating this knowledge can provide a better foundation for including systems thinking in higher-educational programs. To achieve this goal, the purpose of this study is to examine whether the use of a set of systems thinking concepts and methods can effectively promote systems thinking in higher-education settings. The study shows that systems thinking skills can be promoted effectively through the delivery of a combination of systems thinking methods and concepts.},
