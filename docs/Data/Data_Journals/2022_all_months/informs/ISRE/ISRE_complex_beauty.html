  abstract     = {We investigate whether revenue-maximizing auctioneers selling heterogeneous items will allow for combinatorial bidding in the presence of auctioneer competition. We compare the choice of auction format by two competing auctioneers with that of a single auctioneer. Bidders are heterogeneous in their demands, with some having synergies for items. We find that, even if a single auctioneer offers a combinatorial auction, competing auctioneers in a comparable setting will not. Instead, the competing auctioneers will segment the market by restricting allowable package bids in order to increase competition between bidders. This shows that it might not be advantageous for an online market platform to offer combinatorial auctions as a design option to competing auctioneers.

  abstract     = {Humans are increasingly interacting in and operating their daily lives through structured digital and virtual environments, mainly through apps that provide media for sharing photos, messaging, gaming, collaborating, or video watching. Most of these digital environments are offered under “freemium” pricing to facilitate adoption and network effects. In these settings, users’ early social interaction and experience often have a substantial impact on their longer term behavior. On this background, we study the impact of an algorithmic system that matches new users to existing communities in an assortative manner. We devise a machine learning–based matching system that identifies users with high expected value and provides them the option to join highly active, in terms of engagement and expenditure, teams. We deploy this mechanism experimentally in a digital social game and find that it significantly increases user engagement, spending, and socialization. This finding holds for more active communities and overall. Teams matched with low-activity new users are negatively impacted, leading to an overall more segregated social environment. We argue that social experience and social behavior in groups are likely mechanisms that drive the impact of the matching system.

We show that the rule most commonly used in practice, the Quadratic rule, can be improved on in terms of efficiency, incentives, and revenue. We present a new computational search framework for finding good mechanisms, and we apply it toward a search for good core-selecting rules. Within our framework, we use an algorithmic Bayes–Nash equilibrium solver to evaluate 366 rules across 31 settings to identify rules that outperform the Quadratic rule. Our main finding is that our best-performing rules are large -style rules—that is, they provide bidders with large values with better incentives than does the Quadratic rule. Finally, we identify two particularly well-performing rules and suggest that they may be considered for practical implementation in place of the Quadratic rule.

  abstract     = {Despite known advantages of combinatorial auctions, wide adoption of this allocation mechanism, especially in consumer-oriented marketplaces, is limited partially by the lack of effective bidder support information that can assist bidders to make bidding decisions. In this paper, we study the bidder support problem for general multi-item multi-unit (MIMU) combinatorial auctions, where multiple heterogeneous items are being auctioned and multiple homogeneous units are available for each item. Specifically, we consider continuous MIMU auctions, which impose minimal restrictions on bidding activities, thereby reducing the complexity of participation. Two prevalent bidding languages: OR bidding and XOR bidding, are discussed separately. For MIMU auctions with XOR bids, we derive theoretical results to calculate important bidder support metrics. We further demonstrate that bidder support results for MIMU auctions with OR bids can be derived directly from those with XOR bids, by viewing OR bids as XOR bids with each bid submitted by a unique bidder. Consequently, we establish MIMU auctions with XOR bids as the most general case, and unify the theoretical insights on bidder support problem for different bidding languages as well as different special cases of general MIMU auctions, namely single-item multi-unit (SIMU) auctions and multi-item single-unit (MISU) auctions. The derived theoretical results lead to algorithmic procedures that are capable of providing bidder support information efficiently in practice, and that outperform the commonly used integer programming approach. Theoretical insights of the general MIMU auctions also extend to auctions with additional bidding constraints, including batch-based combinatorial auctions, hierarchical combinatorial auctions, and combinatorial reverse auctions.

  abstract     = {Congestion is a common issue in digital platform markets, wherein users tend to focus their attention on a subset of popular peers. We examine this issue in the context of online dating, considering the potential efficacy of an informational intervention, namely, the disclosure of peers’ recent demand. In doing so, we first note that the benefits of disclosing demand information are not altogether clear in this context, a priori, because dating platforms are distinct from other platforms in several important respects. On the one hand, dating platforms facilitate social relationships, rather than trade in goods and services. Therefore, they operate on different norms and typically lack common levers that platform operators employ to balance supply and demand, such as pricing mechanisms and reputation systems. Dating app users may therefore pay greater attention to the quality implications of peer demand information, worsening congestion. On the other hand, demand information disclosure may be atypically effective at mitigating congestion in a dating context because, in addition to opportunity costs of time and effort, daters also bear fears of social rejection, leading them to shy away from in-demand peers. We evaluate our treatment’s efficacy in mitigating congestion and improving matching efficiency, conducting a randomized field experiment at a large mobile dating platform. Our results show that the intervention is particularly effective at improving matching efficiency when presented in tandem with a textual message-framing cue that highlights the capacity implications of the peer demand information. Heterogeneity analyses further indicate that these effects are driven primarily by those users who most contend with congestion in the form of competition, namely, male users and those who rely more heavily upon outbound messages for matches.

  abstract     = {Healthcare entitlement programs in the United States represent a large and growing financial outlay for taxpayers. In the pursuit of operational efficiencies, program administrators often contract with private managed care organizations (MCOs) to procure insurance for beneficiaries. This, however, encourages MCOs to attract the healthiest beneficiaries and avoid the sickest, a phenomenon known as risk selection. This paper investigates whether risk selection can be mitigated with a mechanism where MCOs bid to enroll each individual beneficiary. Although procurement auctions have been studied extensively in the literature, extant research has rarely discussed individual-level bidding. Digitization can contribute to the development and introduction of efficient market structures and mechanisms for matching beneficiaries with appropriate MCOs. We model demand- and supply-side aspects in a two-sided insurance marketplace to examine three mechanisms, risk adjustment, bidding, and a mix of prospective payment and bidding, with and without reserve prices. Analytical results show that traditional risk adjustment cannot optimally be used to eliminate risk selection, whereas the bidding mechanisms eliminate it entirely. Mixed bidding eliminates risk selection at a strictly lower cost than pure bidding. The proposed mixed bidding approach is a new type of mechanism with preauction offers that strictly dominates the second-price auction without requiring additional assumptions. Numerical analysis shows bidding dominates risk adjustment in 75.1\% of simulated parameter sets. Compared with risk adjustment, bidding secures coordinated care for 12.1\% more allocated beneficiaries while lowering program costs by 9.2\% and largely preserving MCO profits. This would amount to approximately $27.2 billion in Medicaid program savings. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the proposed bidding mechanism dominates in scenarios that closely resemble real-world healthcare entitlement environments. These results show that digital markets that enable individual-level auctions are a promising approach for achieving the dual aim of financial sustainability and expanded access to care for the most vulnerable.

  abstract     = {Online matching platforms require new approaches to market design because firms can now control many aspects of the search and interaction process through various IT-enabled features. Although choice capacity —the number of candidates a user can view and select—is a key design feature of online matching platforms, its effect on engagement and matching outcomes remains unclear. We examine the effect of different choice capacities on the number of choices and matches made on a platform by conducting a randomized field experiment in collaboration with an online dating platform. Specifically, we (1) select users who are of a similar age and live in the same geographical location, (2) design four treatment groups with different choice capacities in which users can only interact with other users in the same group, and (3) randomly assign the users to the treatment groups. We find that providing more choice capacity to male and female users has different effects on choice behaviors and matching outcomes. Although increasing the choice capacity of male users yields the highest engagement, increasing the choice capacity of female users is the most effective method to increase matching outcomes. We posit and empirically demonstrate four mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of different choice capacity designs. Furthermore, we generalize our findings to other online matching platforms and discuss how choice capacity can be designed to increase engagement and matching outcomes.

  abstract     = {Seller and product authentication problems are inherent in online markets, particularly in the time-constrained setting of online auctions. Although trust-building mechanisms such as seller feedback can mitigate these problems, they are retrospective, providing information about a transaction only after it is completed. Also, they have only indirect effects on buyers’ trust in sellers because they are not based on direct interactions between a trustor (buyer) and a trustee (seller). On the other hand, direct engagement between transacting parties during an online auction, particularly open and public engagement, reduces information asymmetry between buyers and sellers and has a direct effect on buyers’ trust. In this paper, we analyze how public buyer–seller engagement via question and answer (Q&amp;A) during online auctions impacts bidding behavior. Analyzing auction data from a large auction platform that supports public Q&amp;A between buyers and sellers, we show that the seller’s engagement with buyers during an auction can significantly impact the behavior of both buyers who ask questions and lurkers who passively observe the engagement (spillover effect). Our analysis also shows that the impact of the seller’s engagement depends on features such as product type and seller reputation. A key insight from our study is that the impact of seller engagement on bidding behavior is moderated by seller feedback ratings, which indicates that trust-building mechanisms in online markets interact in their effects on buyers’ decision making. As sellers gain positive (negative) feedback, the impact of buyer–seller engagement on bidding behavior increases (decreases). Furthermore, the cost of an additional negative feedback rating outweighs the benefit of a positive one. Overall, this study provides valuable insights for online auction platforms and their stakeholders.

  abstract     = {Motivated by the prosperity of the daily deal market, this paper investigates the interplay between a platform and sellers, wherein the platform selects a limited number of competing sellers from the seller pool to conduct daily deal campaigns under a certain organization format. We consider two prevalent seller organization formats in practice: one is the seller agglomeration strategy, under which the platform does not distinguish the sellers’ type when selecting them from the seller pool, and the other one is the seller segmentation strategy, under which the platform organizes sellers of the same type to compete in each round of the campaign. We show that different seller organization formats can significantly influence the platform’s and sellers’ pricing strategies, leading to adverse effects on the platform’s and sellers’ profitability. In comparison with the agglomeration strategy, the segmentation strategy eliminates internal information asymmetry between the sellers, which enables them to make more adequate pricing decisions and improves sales revenue. This result reversely incentivizes the platform to charge a higher percentage fee and thus obtain a higher profit. However, the increase in the percentage fee further decentralizes the vertical relationship between the platform and sellers; as a result, the sellers’ and system’s profits decrease under the segmentation strategy. We also examine alternative game settings based on heterogenous potential demand, consumer retention behavior, platform competition, percentage fee discrimination, and whether the number of competing sellers is endogenous and show that the main results are quite robust.

  abstract     = {The rise of the sharing economy has disrupted traditional industries and has had many unforeseen societal impacts. This has sparked policy debates on whether and how the sharing economy should be regulated to promote the healthy growth of such markets. In this research, we examine the impact of platform self-regulations in the context of the home-sharing market. Using policy changes that reduce the number of Airbnb listings, we deploy a difference-in-difference approach to empirically test the impact of platform self-regulations on crime rate. Our results suggest that a reduction in Airbnb listings resulting from platform self-regulations leads to a reduction in crime. We further study the impact of these policy changes on different types of crime and find that these self-regulations lead to a reduction in incidents of crimes such as assault, robbery, and burglary but an increase in theft incidents. In addition, we use geographically weighted regression to investigate the heterogeneous effects of Airbnb occupancy on different types of neighborhoods, and we show that income, housing price, and population moderate the impact of the regulations. This research contributes to our understanding of the societal impacts of the sharing economy and the impact of platform self-regulation. Our findings also provide empirical evidence to inform policy making. History: This paper has been accepted for the Information Systems Research Special Section on Market Design and Analytics.},

  abstract     = {This paper provides a novel theoretical angle and robust empirical evidence demonstrating that the auction duration and item description length are two essential auction design parameters that can function as a screening mechanism for bidder quality on online service outsourcing platforms. These outsourcing platforms use buyer-determined reverse auctions to find providers of services (primarily IT services). Using data from a major online outsourcing platform that connects buyers with bidders, we examine the effects of the auction duration and the item description length on both bidder entry (i.e., the number of bids and bidder quality) and contract outcomes (i.e., whether a project is contracted and the buyer’s expected utility from the winning bid) based upon not only project-level, but also bidder-level analyses. Our results show that auctions with longer durations and item descriptions attract more bids (i.e., higher quantity of bidders), and they also attract disproportionately more bidders with lower completion rates (i.e., lower quality of bidders), creating a double whammy of higher evaluation costs and adverse selection for buyers. This, in turn, leads to contracting inefficiency in terms of less successful contracting as well as lower buyer utility. Our research shows strong support for the screening role of the auction duration and the item description length for buyers on online outsourcing platforms for service procurement: by shortening auction durations and item descriptions, buyers can expect higher quality bidders, increase contracting probability, and enhance utility.

  abstract     = {Firms are increasingly adopting different sales channels to reach new potential buyers. Yet, extant research has mainly focused on business-to-customer (B2C) online and offline posted price channels. Business-to-business (B2B) multichannel and, especially, systems with multiple pricing mechanisms are largely underexplored. This paper investigates the strategic behaviors of B2B buyers in a unique system where an online posted price channel is incorporated into a Dutch auction market sequentially. We follow buyers’ purchasing paths and examine conditions under which B2B auction buyers will use the online posted price channel. We incorporate learning and experience and demonstrate how buyers’ behaviors evolve. We investigate an emerging group of buyers who use different price mechanisms and their surplus extraction activities. We further explore how the market flow changes when posted prices are incorporated. Our results, using an extensive data set from the world’s largest flower market, highlight the importance of quantity demand, product diversity, and experience in explaining the choice of the new posted price channel. We find a significantly higher average loss of surplus at the product level for multichannel buyers than for single channel buyers and a reduction in the number of small orders in the auction channel. Subsequently, theoretical and managerial implications for B2B multichannel markets and market design are discussed. History: Robert Day, Senior Editor; Xinxin Li, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {We study the use of platform-specific tradable cryptographic tokens to solve the coordination problem that is common in adopting new marketplaces. We show that certain characteristics of platform-specific tokens—specifically, their tradability, the ability of the platform to commit both to accept and to require these tokens in the future, and the ability to commit to a price and/or quantity schedule—can help overcome the coordination problem and can support equilibria favorable to the new marketplace. Compared with other mechanisms in the literature to address the coordination problem—such as subsidies of early users and promises of refunds or buybacks if the platform fails—platform-specific cryptographic tokens are less likely to favor established or larger firms with established reputations and financial resources. We find that tokens allow a marketplace to trade off future revenue for present revenue, which then can be used to address the coordination problem. On the other hand, the ability to trade out of the platform results in a smaller future network and lower total profit. Thus, if the new marketplace is not facing capital constraints, then the most profitable strategy is the traditional strategy to subsidize adoption. If the new marketplace is capital-constrained, however, as is often the case for new entrants and unproven technology applications, tokens can offer an alternative that is increasingly attractive as the cost of capital increases.

  abstract     = {The current information systems (IS) literature treats information technology (IT) ambidexterity as a single aggregated construct, assuming perfect balance or simultaneously strong IT exploration and exploitation. Taking a different perspective, we propose that IT ambidexterity can be achieved through a proportional balance between its two dimensions, and the optimal balance depends on the specific context. Based on matched-pair data from a field survey of business and IT executives, we find a three-way interaction among environmental dynamism, IT exploration, and IT exploitation such that IT ambidexterity matters only in dynamic environments. More important, through polynomial regression and response surface analysis, we find that the proportionally balanced, rather than the perfectly balanced, combinations of IT exploitation and exploration maximize organizational agility. We further demonstrate how the effect of proportional balance of IT ambidexterity varies in stable and dynamic environments. This study offers a novel understanding: IT exploration and IT exploitation do not need to be equally strong to improve agility, and their proportional balance associated with maximal agility varies across different levels of environmental dynamism. It improves the current knowledge of IT ambidexterity and makes a significant contribution to IS strategy research and practice.

This added effort to protect intellectual property and its impact on social media engagement have not been investigated in the literature. In this study, we attempt to bridge this important gap in the literature by first examining the impact of trademarking a hashtag on a firm’s social media audience engagement. By adopting multiple causal identification strategies to address the issues of self-selected trademarking, we find that trademarking hashtags plays a pivotal role in increasing social media audience engagement and information dissemination. More importantly, this positive effect is stronger for firms with fewer Twitter followers. Digging deeper into the underlying mechanisms, we find that trademarking hashtags makes composing tweets with certain linguistic styles more critical: It can amplify the positive effects of trademarking hashtags on social media audience engagement. Our findings highlight important managerial implications of trademarking hashtags. First of all, we examine whether trademarking a hashtag helps or hurts a firm in terms of its social media audience engagement. Further, we show, to maximize the effectiveness of trademarking hashtags, how firms should develop the right social media engagement strategies by taking specific communication and linguistic styles into account. Our results provide useful insights to firms in understanding the key benefits of signaling through trademarking hashtags on social media engagement.

  abstract     = {Existing scholarship on social media provides us with important but incomplete insights regarding how people rely upon social media as they work. Scholarship so far focuses on social media as technologies that enable and constrain people to do certain things. This study proposes a perspective on social media for work that views them not only as technologies that enable people to do certain things, but also as contexts with emerging norms and roles in which people participated. As they do so, people are confronted with opportunities and challenges that are inherent to social media polycontextuality. This study investigates the case of data scientists and how they dealt with the social media polycontextuality of their work. The study reveals that data scientists relied on strategies of enhancing, differentiating, or occasionally reducing their engagement with social media contexts. The study brings novel insights for scholarship on social media and work by unpacking the social media polycontextuality of work and the interconnections in the engagement with multiple social media contexts. It explains how these interconnections manifest in people’s deliberate participation in or temporary withdrawal from diverse and changing social media contexts. This study also contributes to scholarship by highlighting how people deal with an ensemble of social media applications rather than with a single, isolated information technology.

Building on what is already known about generalizing a theory from one setting to another and the idea of an artifact as the interface between an inner environment and outer environment put forth by Nobel Prize–winning social scientist Herbert Simon, we propose a procedure for generalizing an information systems (IS) artifact from one setting to another. We illustrate the treatment of the procedure by examining how an IS artifact (which itself consists of a technology artifact, information artifact, and social artifact) is generalized from the setting of Haiti to the setting of Nepal. The generalization procedure is a contribution to the practically oriented design science literature, which emphasizes the importance of the production of problem-solving artifacts. Specifically, our conceptualization of generalizing IS artifacts emphasizes the practical significance of design science research and the successful creation of artifacts that work in new settings in addition to the one where a research study originally created it. Design science researchers and practitioners may find the procedure and its real-world treatment and description a useful model to follow.

  abstract     = {Firms and organizations are increasingly using real-time performance feedback mechanisms to evaluate employees, where any employee (rather than just the supervisor) can rate other employees. Hence, a need arises to better understand how network positions of employees in such a system impact their performance. Analyzing nearly 4,000 feedback instances from employees at five major organizations that use such a real-time performance feedback application called DevelapMe, we explore the effects of network embeddedness—or the nature of relationships among employees—on performance rating scores according to two dimensions of embeddedness: (i) positional, the position of an individual in the emerging network of performance ratings, and (ii) structural, the extent to which a person is entrenched in a network of relationships. We visualize rating networks within organizations: Employees are nodes, and connections between nodes exist if an evaluation between the pair occurs. We find that specific aspects of network embeddedness affect performance rating scores differently. In particular, a rater’s positional embeddedness (measured by eigenvector centrality) is positively associated with the rating score he or she gives others. However, a rater’s structural embeddedness (measured by outdegree centrality) is negatively associated with the rating score he or she gives. We also uncover the moderating effects of anonymity and hierarchy on the role of network embeddedness, as well as the sentiment of the textual comments provided with feedback. Our findings have important implications for the design of performance management systems using network analysis. History: Param Singh, Senior Editor; Zhengrui Jiang, Associate Editor.

Regarding ISR specifically, our study offers a glimpse of the IS intellectual diversity found in the research topics, methods, and contributions of papers published during 2012–2021.

As prior research on default risk evaluation in online lending largely focuses on the micro listing level, we advocate a new research problem at the macro platform level, platform risk evaluation , and explore types of information and methods that are effective in predicting platform risk. We identify four types of information, that is, platform characteristic, risk management, commercial competition, and online word of mouth, by categorizing the available features based on the aspects they reflect and examine their utilities, separately and jointly, in predicting platform risk. We also propose the use of survival analysis, especially the mixture survival model, in predicting whether and when a platform will default. Considering the essential causes and characteristics of different default events, we differentiate two types of default platforms, namely, problematic and failed platforms, and accommodate them using competing risk analysis. We carry out a cross-stage analysis using data crawled from two leading web portals for online lending in China with the two stages separated by the recent dramatic policy intervention. Our results demonstrate the competitive predictive ability of survival analysis as compared with classification-based models. The results also reveal the differences among the four identified factors in terms of predictive utility, the heterogeneity between the two types of default platforms, and differences between the start-up and stable periods of platform development. Additionally, we identify some key features using Shapley values and examine the effects of these key features. Based on the results, we derive some insights and examine the cross-stage changes and commonalities. We provide both lessons learned from the past and practical implications for market managers and lenders in the current online lending market.},

In this paper, we examine PWYW pricing based on the established social preference theory where consumers may be concerned with how fairly they are being treated by firms. Utilizing a two-segment model for consumers (self-interested versus fair minded), we study PWYW pricing against traditional, posted pricing in a monopolistic digital product market. We show that under posted pricing, it is optimal to eliminate piracy when the quality development cost is sufficiently high. Interestingly, high quality of the illegal copy associated with low quality development cost makes PWYW pricing an effective alternative to posted pricing. We also examine the impact of network externalities on PWYW pricing. Counterintuitively, despite the full market penetration, PWYW pricing invariably becomes less profitable than posted pricing as network externalities become sufficiently strong. Our findings explain why PWYW pricing is rare in the established digital product marketplace with strong network externalities despite near-zero marginal costs.},

  abstract     = {Moving toward sustainable energy systems to address climate change is one of the key challenges of our generation. To that end, investments in renewable energy and balancing renewable supply and energy demand on the larger scale are crucial. One mechanism to create price signals for demand balancing, as well as for consumer engagement, is to establish trading platforms (or peer-to-peer (P2P) markets) through which households can directly buy and sell renewable energy. However, residential consumers are typically lay users with little or no previous exposure to the complexity and the dynamics involved in energy markets. More so, empirical research on consumer engagement in the energy sector indicates that individuals tend to act against their stated proenvironmental intentions and to lose interest in energy management systems particularly quickly—calling into question regulatory efforts to foster P2P markets to push the transition to renewable energy. We have implemented the first empirical study worldwide that analyzes bidding behavior in a real-world P2P energy market, in which users bid for solar energy via an auction mechanism. For the duration of an entire year, users could interact with the market using a web app. The prices settled on the P2P market directly impacted participants’ electricity bills. We provide unique empirical evidence showing that (1) participants were willing to engage in energy trading and that (2) they understood the market mechanism surprisingly well and exhibited learning effects. Still, bidding behavior did not reflect their stated intention of paying a price premium for local solar energy. The market outcomes reveal that P2P energy markets can indeed have a positive impact on balancing demand and supply, thereby addressing the fundamental challenge of distributed renewable energy systems.},

  abstract     = {The practice of using a “second screen” while concurrently watching television (TV) has become a widespread phenomenon. Whereas work on multitasking suggests that TV consumption may lead to lower online sales, research in the area of impulse buying suggests the opposite. In this paper, we study the impact of concurrent TV consumption on online shopping behavior and try to understand this conflict. Our first study analyzes the impact of TV consumption on online shopping behavior at the aggregate level using a panel of 100,000 U.S. customers over a period of 24 months. We address potential endogeneity problems with an instrumental variable approach. Our second study proposes a novel approach to realizing individual-level analysis over thousands of consumers and products. Examining massive amounts of data, we identify a sample of consumers who watched a certain TV show and who were simultaneously doing online shopping at Amazon.com. We then compare their shopping behavior on the day of the TV show to their shopping behavior one week prior. Both studies reveal that whereas TV consumption is correlated with a higher likelihood of online shopping in general, the causal effect of TV watching differs with respect to the complexity of the products purchased. If a TV program appeals to a large TV audience, then this results in fewer immediate sales of high-complexity products (1\% increase in TV consumption leads to −2.2\% sales) and more sales of low-complexity products (1\% increase in TV consumption leads to +8.8\% sales).},

Literature documents that better-informed bidders may withhold bidding until the last moment (i.e., “sniping”) to avoid competition. We argue that, because a collective effort from investors is required in P2P lending, it could be optimal for informed investors to bid early in projects with a low probability of being funded with the purpose of signaling the quality of these projects. With a unique data set from Prosper.com, we use a matching analysis to show that, for projects with low credit grades, the probability of being successfully funded is positively correlated with early bids from informed investors. For funded loans, informed investors are more likely to bid in the early stage than uninformed investors, whereas uninformed investors will follow and bid at the late stage. Finally, there are more early bids from informed investors for “good” loans than for “bad” loans, indicating that the bids are informative for the quality of those projects.

  abstract     = {Subscription-based crowdfunding (SBC) is an emerging platform for creators of digital content (e.g., music, comics, stories, and videos) to build their person brands and garner support from fans. A unique feature that sets SBC apart from other crowdfunding models is the creator-centered freemium model. That is, creators can offer free content to attract fans, who can then subscribe to financially support a creator; in return, the backers gain access to the creator’s premium content and exclusive perks. In doing so, creators receive regular (e.g., monthly) subscription payments from their backers to sustain their ongoing creative activities. The SBC context engenders unique creator-centric dynamics and mechanisms that are ill understood in crowdfunding literature. In this study, we investigate the effects of SBC creators’ two information control strategies: (1) earnings concealment and (2) private postings. From a brand management perspective, we theorize that earnings concealment improves brand authenticity, whereas private postings foster brand differentiation, cocreation, and attachment. These will lead to a positive impact on the financial ( backer base ) and nonfinancial ( fan participation ) outcomes of an SBC campaign. Furthermore, we propose a reinforcing dynamic between information control and SBC performance whereby better SBC outcomes will increase the creators’ tendencies to engage in information control. To test our hypotheses, we obtained panel data from a large SBC platform that contains monthly observations of 92,850 creators from August 2016 to December 2017. The results of our empirical analyses provide evidence for the benefits of the two information control strategies in SBC and demonstrate the reinforcing relationships between information control and SBC outcomes for creators. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.},

We distinguish between internal contributors affiliated with target firms and external contributors from the community, and examine how they respond to technological acquisitions differently. Theoretically, we examine how technological acquisition influences contributors’ uncertainty about project quality through a signaling effect and influences their uncertainty about project continuity through potential resource combination. We connect uncertainties with contributors’ motivations to theorize their responses to acquisitions. Empirically, we find that external contributors contribute more actively to both target firms’ sponsored projects and other projects in the OSS community after acquisitions, which contrast with the adverse effects of acquisitions observed in traditional corporate innovation. Although internal contributors reduce contributions to target firms’ sponsored projects after acquisitions, they increase contributions to other OSS projects in the community. We also find that the acquirer’s OSS experience and the project similarity between the acquirer and the target drive both external and internal contributors to shift their development efforts to the acquirer’s projects and other projects in the OSS community. By examining these effort shifts in OSS contributions, our study generates unique theoretical insights about the impacts of technological acquisitions in the OSS context and important practical implications for acquirers, target firms, and the general OSS community.},

  abstract     = {Research has shown that consuming ratings influences purchase decisions in e-commerce and also has modest effects on belief in news articles on social media. However, we do not know if the act of creating a rating influences belief in online news stories. Unlike e-commerce settings in which ratings typically come from those who have personally used the product or service, social media users who submit their ratings for news articles typically lack firsthand knowledge of the events reported in the news, making it difficult for most users to rate news articles accurately. We propose that one key benefit of user ratings in the context of news on social media lies in triggering users who create the ratings (as opposed to consume the ratings) to realize that they lack this firsthand knowledge, thus inducing them to become more skeptical of articles they see. We asked 68 social media users to assess the believability of 42 social media articles and measured their cognitive activity using electroencephalography. We found that asking users to rate articles using a self-referential question induced them to think more critically—as indicated by increased activation in the medial prefrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex—and made them less likely to believe the articles. The effect extended to subsequent articles; after being asked to rate an article, users were less likely to believe other articles that followed it whether they were asked to rate them or not. Overall, our findings suggest that asking users to evaluate the truthfulness of articles using self-referential rating questions may not only produce rating information that could be used by others later in time, but also has an immediate benefit of inducing users to think more critically about all articles they see.},

We extend elements of the absorptive capacity (ACAP) framework that have not previously been studied in the information systems (IS) literature to a new context. Consistent with prior results from the IS literature, we first show that IT spillovers—acquired through employees’ participation in this forum—only accrue to firms with prior related investments in enterprise software. We then demonstrate boundary conditions for ACAP based on characteristics of external knowledge affecting the ease of learning. Our results show that IT spillovers are not “free”; the ability to derive the value of IT spillovers through informal channels—such as online communities—critically depends on both prior related IT investments by the recipient firm and the novelty of external knowledge. Less intuitively, when knowledge originates from relatively novel or emergent domains, the role of prior related knowledge in absorbing spillovers becomes more important.},

  abstract     = {A growing number of online retailers have started to mesh their pricing strategies with consumers’ social networks. Specifically, they allow consumers to invite peers from social media to request a discount for their purchases. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose social pricing , a novel pricing framework under which consumers with higher social capital enjoy a better price. Conceptually, social pricing enables firms to achieve price discrimination based on a consumer’s social value. This is in sharp contrast with traditional price discrimination strategies where price differentiation typically hinges on consumers’ personal value (individual willingness to pay). Although social pricing has been popular in practice, whether it works, why it works, and how it works remain unclear because of a lack of rigorous academic research. To address this gap, we design and conduct two randomized field experiments on a leading online fresh food retailer to understand the value of social pricing. Social pricing has been commonly credited for its effectiveness in new customer acquisition. Interestingly, our study reveals that it is also highly effective on existing consumers. Our analysis shows that social pricing can increase an online retailer’s profit by 40\% solely from existing consumers, compared with regular firm-offered discounts. Exploration of the underlying mechanisms reveals that perceived engagement and social cost are the main drivers here, which not only help to increase purchasing frequency but also induce higher order value per purchase. In a follow-up experiment, we vary the rules of social interactions by requiring heterogeneity in consumers’ purchasing frequencies. The results suggest that a heterogeneity-based strategy can further amplify the benefits of social pricing. In summary, our study conceptualizes a novel pricing scheme, social pricing, and provides valuable guidance to both researchers and practitioners by offering actionable insights regarding the design of social pricing strategies.},

This study scrutinizes the rarely studied relationship between these voices and the speed of product recalls in the context of the pharmaceutical industry in which social media pharmacovigilance is becoming increasingly important for the detection of drug safety signals. Using Federal Drug Administration drug enforcement reports and social media data crawled from online forums and Twitter, we investigate whether social media can accelerate the product recall process in the context of drug recalls. Results based on discrete-time survival analyses suggest that more adverse drug reaction discussions on social media lead to a higher hazard rate of the drug being recalled and, thus, a shorter time to recall. To better understand the underlying mechanism, we propose the information effect , which captures how extracting information from social media helps detect more signals and mine signals faster to accelerate product recalls, and the publicity effect , which captures how firms and government agencies are pressured by public concerns to initiate speedy recalls. Estimation results from two mechanism tests support the existence of these conceptualized channels underlying the acceleration hypothesis of social media. This study offers new insights for firms and policymakers concerning the power of social media and its influence on product recalls.},

  abstract     = {Unverifiable messages abound on the Internet. Why do people share messages they cannot verify? This study develops an in-depth understanding of how messages containing unverifiable product information differ and why users share such messages over online social networks (OSNs). We develop a classification that identifies different types of unverifiable messages that OSN users encounter prior to the release of a new product and conduct two studies to investigate the resharing of true (information leak) and false (rumor) messages originating from unofficial channels. We contend that such differences (true vs. false) are likely to result in differentiating message characteristics. Employing a dual-processing theoretical lens, we further hypothesize that because these messages are unverifiable, recipients will take a holistic approach and rely on both content (plausibility) and noncontent (vividness, sender credibility) message characteristics when assessing the message. Specifically, when faced with an unverifiable message, the presence of content characteristics amplifies the effect of noncontent characteristics, suggesting that plausibility enhances the value of vividness and sender credibility. These characteristics jointly help recipients assess a message’s diagnosticity and novelty, which are the primary psychological factors driving the reshare decision. We employ a multimethod approach with Study 1 leveraging secondary data collected from Twitter to assess objective behavior and Study 2 employing a controlled experiment to assess psychological processes. Together, the studies offer compelling evidence in support of our model, indicating that leaks and rumors exhibit different message characteristics; that recipients employ a synergistic processing strategy when assessing unverifiable messages; and that unverifiable messages are reshared when they are perceived to be helpful or novel.

  abstract     = {Mobile application use has become an essential activity in many people’s daily lives in the mobile Internet era. Driven by its ubiquity and strong context dependence, Internet companies are in a race of cross-industry expansion to build a seamless ecosystem incorporating various contexts. Amid such trends, a better understanding of cross-app uses and the impact of contexts becomes critical and imperative. Yet, research on cross-app uses in information systems and marketing is scarce. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap. We develop a hidden Markov model to study cross-app uses (choice and duration), capturing their interdependence and the impacts of contextual factors. We calibrate it using a consumer panel that contains real-time app use information. Our key findings are as follows. (1) In addition to the utilitarian and hedonic states behind consumer decisions identified in prior literature, we uncover a novel social state behind mobile user behavior. App use behavior exhibits large differences across three states. (2) Within-state app interdependence is strongest in the hedonic state, followed by the social and utilitarian states. (3) Social state is the most transient (i.e., mostly likely to switch away), followed by the hedonic and utilitarian states. (4) Contextual factors—in particular, location and time of day—influence the state dynamic. Compared with the intrinsic state transition, being at home or on the way (versus office) and in the morning or evening (versus night) leads to higher volatility. We discuss the managerial implications for a variety of mobile digital strategies.},

In traditional financial markets, public companies are required to disclose potential risks to their investors, and such risk disclosure requirements are enforced by legal and fiduciary regulations. In the crowdfunding context, however, such information asymmetry concerns are often addressed by crowd-based platforms. In this study, we examine whether and how a regulation to increase the salience of project risks in crowdfunding affects crowdfunders’ funding decisions. Leveraging a policy change as an exogenous event, we adopt a difference-in-differences empirical strategy with a matching sample to compare funding decisions before and after the regulation was mandated and show differential effects between high- and low-risk projects. In addition, to strengthen the causality, we directly test individuals’ intention to pledge after reading project descriptions with and without risk disclosure in online experiments. We find that increasing the awareness of project risks is associated with inferior funding outcomes of crowdfunding projects, and the effect exists mainly for high-risk projects but not much for low-risk projects. In addition, high-risk projects benefit from a risk disclosure with relevant information, authentic language, and balanced tones that are not overly negative or optimistic. Despite the negative short-term effects, technology funders tend to interpret risk disclosures rationally over time, suggesting a positive long-term effect. Implications for research and insights for practitioners are discussed, particularly the fact that disclosure policies may make crowdfunding markets more sustainable by reducing information asymmetry and helping crowdfunders make more informed decisions.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent systems (IntelSys) are transforming the nature of work as humans and machines collectively perform tasks in novel ways. Although intelligent systems empower employees with algorithm-generated knowledge, they require employees to adapt how they work to enhance their job performance. We draw on the coping-adaptation framework as the overarching theoretical lens to explain how employees’ perceptions of IntelSys knowledge as an empowering external coping resource affect the mechanisms through which they adapt to IntelSys-induced changes to their work, as well as how their internal coping resources regulate their adaptation. Our coping-adaptation explanation of intelligence augmentation integrates (i) the empowering role of external coping resources, specifically IntelSys knowledge, captured as intelligent system knowledge empowerment (ISK-Emp); (ii) the benefit-maximizing adaptation mechanism (through infusion use enhancement) and the disturbance-minimizing adaptation mechanism (through role conflict reduction) that channel the impact of ISK-Emp on job performance; and (iii) the regulating role of internal resources, specifically, employees’ work experience, in influencing the importance of the adaptation mechanisms for the employee. We conduct studies in three distinct settings in which different intelligent systems were implemented to support employees’ knowledge work. Our findings show that ISK-Emp increases job performance through each of the two adaptation mechanisms. The benefit-maximization mechanism (via enhanced infusion use) plays a more important role for novice employees than for experienced employees, whereas the disturbance-minimization mechanism (via reduced role conflict) has higher importance for experienced employees than for novice employees. Our work provides insights into the critical role of adaptation mechanisms in linking ISK-Emp with performance outcomes and into the relative importance of the adaptation mechanisms through which job performance payoffs are realized by novice and experienced employees.},

  abstract     = {The successful adoption of interorganizational systems (IOSs), such as blockchains or electronic data interchanges, in interfirm networks requires timely and accurate sharing of information about these roll-outs. In reality, however, the early stages of IOS adoption are characterized by information asymmetries that can arise due to a separation between firms that select and develop the IOS, and firms that implement it. This often results in staggered and asymmetric flows of information that can engender strategic information withholding behaviors. Drawing upon resource and network-based views, we study how the technological modularity of networked firms can affect these behaviors. Interestingly, we find that high levels of technological modularity can render firms more susceptible to opportunistic information withholding by network partners. Our findings run counter to the traditional view of modularity as a capability that can improve the efficiency of IOS adoption, or as a governance mechanism that reduces risks associated with IOS adoption. We find that network density and embeddedness can mitigate the opportunistic risks of technological modularity, whereas network topology can have diverging effects. In a rapidly changing and interconnected business environment where flexibility is key, modularity is often hailed as a foundational pillar of information technology systems of the future. As optimism and investments toward modularity grow, by identifying associated risks, our work cautions managers to adopt a more qualified view of this capability during technological transitions.},

  abstract     = {High-quality online consumer reviews are valuable to e-commerce stakeholders. Extant research mainly focuses on what drives consumers to submit reviews, whereas little has been done to specifically theorize why review writers construct high-quality reviews versus post poor review content. To advance current theorizing on the behavior of writing quality reviews, we propose the concept of space norms, a distinct instantiation of social norms inferred from locally observing how others write reviews on the local digital space (i.e., the review site). Specifically, we theorize that the focal behavior is largely directed by space norms; space norms beget a sense of how one should do and induce conformity in the given social space. We tested the theory of space norms in a series of empirical studies, and the findings provide converging evidence. Study 1 used experimental methods and demonstrates—with large effect sizes—that review writers tend to act in accordance with the space norm of the local site. Post hoc text analyses rule out an alternative explanation and corroborate the findings. Study 2 used field data collected from two e-commerce websites to further triangulate the space norms proposition. Another post hoc study confirms the robustness of the results. This paper contributes to information systems research by developing and empirically validating a theory of space norms that pinpoints the role of local digital spaces in constructing the focal normative phenomenon. It also lends insights to digital platforms and the information technology practitioners. Managers looking to elicit quality reviewing behavior should devise the local digital space to nurture the space norms for the desired behavior.},

  abstract     = {Demand-side platforms (DSPs) that purchase digital ad space using real-time bidding (RTB) systems employ “black-box” performance optimizers to adjust bids at run time. Advertisers using field experiments to estimate the marginal value of display ads need to contend with the selective targeting of users by optimizers that adjust bids to target users with a greater propensity to respond favorably (i.e., click or conversion). In this paper, we propose an alternative approach for advertisers who choose to bypass their DSP’s performance optimizers for the purpose of assessing the value of their ads. We show that external frequency caps that set upper limits on the number of ad impressions outside the purview of bidding algorithms can serve as a suitable instrumental variable. Eliminating performance optimizers allows the advertiser to value ads without relying on the support services of the DSP with the added benefit of a broader customer reach and a markedly lower cost. As the focal advertiser disables performance optimizers, any overbidding or underbidding vis-à-vis competition that employs them results in a negative correlation between the numbers of ad impressions won and their underlying quality in real time. Using two large-scale randomized field experiments in different geographies (United States and Asia) and different devices (PC and mobile), we validate the proposed approach and report a positive effect of ad impression count after adjusting for net negative bias.},

This paper employs a design science approach and proposes a new composite metric, eigen attention centrality (EAC), as a proxy for information flows associated with a node that considers both attention to a node and coattention with other nodes in a network. We apply the EAC metric in the context of financial market where nodes are individual stocks and edges are based on coattention relationships among stocks. Composite information from different channels is used to measure attention and coattention. To evaluate the effectiveness of the EAC metric on predicting outcomes, we conduct an in-depth performance evaluation of the EAC metric by (1) using multiple linear and nonlinear prediction methods and (2) comparing EAC with a benchmark model without EAC and models with a set of alternative network metrics. Our analysis shows that EAC significantly outperforms other measures in predicting the direction and magnitude of abnormal returns of stocks. Besides, our EAC specification has better predictive performance than alternative specifications, and EAC outperforms direct attention in predicting abnormal returns. Using the EAC metric, we derive a stock portfolio and develop a trading strategy that provides significant and positive excess returns. Lastly, we find that composite information has significantly better predictive performance than separate information sources, and such superior performance owes to information from social media instead of traditional media.},

This study examines whether leveraging omnichannel data can lead to, statistically and economically, significantly better predictions on consumers’ online path-to-purchase journeys, given the intrinsic fluidity in and heterogeneity brought forth by the digital transformation of traditional marketing. Using an omnichannel data set that captures consumers’ online behavior in terms of their website browsing trajectories and their offline behavior in terms of physical location trajectories, we predict consumers’ future path-to-purchase journeys based on their historical omnichannel behaviors. Using a state-of-the-art deep-learning algorithm, we find that using omnichannel data can significantly improve our model’s predictive power. The lift curve analysis reveals that the omnichannel model outperforms the corresponding single-channel model by 7.38\%. This enhanced predictive power benefits various heterogeneous online firms, regardless of their size, offline presence, mobile app availability, or whether they are selling single- or multicategory products. Using an illustrative example of targeted marketing, we further quantify the economic value of the improved predictive power using a cost-revenue analysis.

We draw on the theory of information processing to hypothesize the impact of information risk on ES portfolio balance and how this impact is affected by internal controls. We construct a multisource panel data set of 697 firms and 1,993 firm-year observations from 2005 to 2008 and use econometric and multivariate procedures to test our hypotheses. We find that when faced with an increase in information risk, firms change their ES portfolio balance more toward operational modules. However, when such firms are also faced with materially weak internal controls, they change their ES portfolio balance more toward functional modules instead. These findings expand our understanding of how firms’ information processing needs drive the configuration of their ES portfolio and, more broadly, IT resources portfolio.},

Many platforms strive to obtain and implement technological innovations that allow them to understand and identify consumers’ needs, and, thereafter, monetize this capability by charging sellers to present and/or sell their products or services based on consumers’ interests. However, an interesting and relevant question arises in this context: Does the platform have an incentive to profile its buyers as accurately as possible? This paper develops and analyzes a parsimonious game-theoretic model to answer this research question. We find that, surprisingly, platforms that charge sellers for discoveries have a perverse incentive to deviate from accurate buyer profiling. However, such a perverse incentive does not exist for platforms that charge sellers for transactions. As a result, with such a perverse incentive, social welfare under discovery-based pricing is lower than that under transaction-based pricing.},

These different IS are often subject to interactions and interdependencies among them, which creates new challenges and opportunities for individuals. Yet we observe a disconnect between this “multi-IS” reality and individual-level IS research, which is shaped by a dominant single-IS paradigm—that is, a deep-rooted focus on one-to-one relationships between users and IS. Although we do not question the accomplishments made by prior research, we observe at least three problems that emerge from the traditional single-IS perspective. First, the single-IS paradigm might produce incomplete theories that do not consider interactions between multiple IS that are relevant to a phenomenon. Second, existing theories that represent a phenomenon from a single-IS perspective might misrepresent the phenomenon when considering it from a multi-IS perspective. Third, we might simply lack theories for certain phenomena that involve users’ interactions with multiple IS. To inspire future researchers to overcome the boundaries of the single-IS paradigm, we first illustrate its prevalence in existing research and then build on representation theory and general systems theory to offer a framework for theorizing about multi-IS phenomena. We also demonstrate how scholars can apply this framework to study challenges and opportunities that occur when individuals interact with multiple IS. This way, we offer a foundation for future research that helps to improve work and life in our multi-IS world.},

  abstract     = {Teleconsultations allow patients to search for, receive, and pay for medical consultations virtually. With remote diagnosis and treatment capability, teleconsultations have been proposed as a potential solution to the long-standing social problem of geographic disparity in healthcare. Although this sounds promising, unforeseen frictions could suppress the virtual flow of healthcare. It is unclear, then, whether teleconsultations actually mobilize healthcare to underserved regions. To advance our understanding, we first empirically investigate whether teleconsultations generate a virtual flow of healthcare to mitigate geographic healthcare disparity. Second, we examine whether social, information, and geography frictions are present in the virtual healthcare flow. To this end, we curate unique data capturing regional offline health resources and various regional characteristics and match them with teleconsultation instances over 10 years (2006–2015). Our exponential random graph model analysis provides encouraging empirical evidence that teleconsultations connect physicians in resourceful regions and patients in underserved areas—a desirable direction that can alleviate geographic healthcare disparity. However, we also find that various frictions are present. For instance, social and information frictions, such as cultural and linguistic differences and limited media coverage, suppress the supposedly free flow of teleconsultations across regions. Furthermore, although teleconsultation is anticipated to spark long-distance healthcare, we find that teleconsultations are less likely as the regions between patient and physician become farther apart. We examine two plausible mechanisms that contribute to the observed geography friction: (1) a low-information bandwidth of a teleconsultation channel and (2) the financial constraint of rural patients. Supplementary analyses using granular data (fees, physician ranks, and illness types) provide corroborating evidence for the proposed mechanisms.},

However, not all the firms plan on a big spend on social media marketing. Our stylized model investigates the strategic effects of social media marketing spending (SMM spending) with the presence of exogenous quality revelation through sources over which firms have no direct control. Unlike traditional advertising, social media marketing has two roles: awareness enhancement and information revelation . Consumers are heterogeneous in their awareness of the product (e.g., whether they know the existence of the product). Our analysis yields three main findings. First, our results show the existence of a separating equilibrium and a partial-pooling equilibrium where the high-/low-quality firms pool together and spend less on social media marketing than the mid-quality firm. Intuitively, the high-quality firm gets enough quality transparency from background user-generated discussions, and the cost of maintaining a social presence outweighs the benefits. The low-quality firm avoids social media marketing because quality transparency is broadly detrimental, whereas the midtier firm is just right to benefit from social media discussions they encourage. Second, we also find that in the partial-pooling equilibrium, as the fraction of aware consumers increases, the mid-quality firm spends less on social media marketing, whereas its optimal spending on social media marketing first decreases, and then increases with the precision of the external information signal. Third, by comparing these two equilibria, we show that if the partial-pooling equilibrium survives the intuitive criterion, it Pareto-dominates the separating equilibrium.},

In addition, much of our knowledge on AISDPU and its effects relies on research into the differences between developers over an extended period of time. Yet, agile ISD practices are typically used on a day-to-day basis and can thus be viewed as an inherently within-person phenomenon, pointing to the need for daily investigations that provide a closer look at the immediate, lived experiences of developers. Drawing on the holistic stress process model, we develop the idea that daily AISDPU can be a source of stressful situational demands with both energizing and depleting effects that may thus help or harm developer well-being. In an experience-sampling study of 131 developers who responded to daily surveys spread over 10 workdays, we show that AISDPU can indeed be a double-edged sword: instrumental to developers’ energy resources (by increasing work engagement) on some days yet detrimental to their energy resources (by increasing depletion) on others—two forces with opposing effects on developer well-being. Importantly, we find that the divergent effects of AISDPU critically hinge on whether developers appraise it as a challenge or a threat. As a potential antidote, we investigate the moderating role of information technology (IT) mindfulness in developers’ appraisal processes. Our results show that IT mindfulness serves as a facilitator of challenge appraisals and as a buffer against threat appraisals. More broadly, this study challenges the predominant view of AISDPU as an inherently good thing and offers meaningful insights into why and when AISDPU improves versus impairs developer well-being.},

  abstract     = {Timely and accurate prediction of human movement in urban areas offers instructive insights into transportation management, public safety, and location-based services, to name a few. Yet, modeling urban mobility is challenging and complex because of the spatiotemporal dynamics of movement behavior and the influence of exogenous factors such as weather, holidays, and local events. In this paper, we use bus transportation as a proxy to mine spatiotemporal travel patterns. We propose a deep-learning-based urban mobility prediction model that collectively forecasts passenger flows between pairs of city regions in an origin-destination (OD) matrix. We first process OD matrices in a convolutional neural network to capture spatial correlations. Intermediate results are reconstructed into three multivariate time series: hourly, daily, and weekly time series. Each time series is aggregated in a long short-term memory (LSTM) network with a novel attention mechanism to guide the aggregation. In addition, our model is context-aware by using contextual embeddings learned from exogenous factors. We dynamically merge results from LSTM components and context embeddings in a late fusion network to make a final prediction. The proposed model is implemented and evaluated using a large-scale transportation data set of more than 200 million bus trips with a suite of Big Data technologies developed for data processing. Through performance comparison, we show that our approach achieves sizable accuracy improvements in urban mobility prediction. Our work has major implications for efficient transportation system design and performance improvement. The proposed deep neural network structure is generally applicable for sequential graph data prediction.},

  abstract     = {Keyword searches with brand names occur very commonly on search engines, enabling firms to infer not only when consumers are searching for them but also when consumers are searching for their competitors. This enables firms to generate traffic from search advertising by bidding not only on their own keywords but also on competitors’ keywords. The strategy of bidding on competitors’ keywords, known as competitive poaching, presents unique opportunities for academic research. In this research, we examine the factors that influence the effectiveness of competitive poaching, specifically the role of different ad copies and the type of competitor (poached brand) from which a brand is poaching. We also examine how the presence of sponsored ads from the poached brand affects competitive poaching. We collected data from two randomized field experiments, one with a business school in the Northeastern United States and the other one with a leading automobile dealership company, where these firms bid on keywords of competing brands and randomly display different types of ad copies in the sponsored search listings. We find that, when poaching on keywords of high-quality brands, ad copies that feature vertical differentiation are more effective than the control ad copies, which do not convey any differentiation or prescriptive messages. We also find that when poaching from low-quality brands, ad copies featuring horizontal differentiation perform better than the control ad copies. Finally, we show that the presence of the poached brand’s own ad has a positive association with the ad effectiveness of the poaching brand when that poached brand is high quality and a negative association when the poached brand is low quality. The academic and managerial contributions are also discussed.},

In this study, we conduct a randomized controlled field experiment on the website of an online book retailer and explore the causal paths by employing the recently developed causal mediation approach. Not surprisingly, the results show that the presence of personalized recommendations increases consumers’ propensity to buy by 12.4\% and basket value by 1.7\%. More importantly, we find that these positive economic effects are largely mediated through affecting the consumers’ consideration sets. Specifically, the presence of personalized recommendations increases both the size of consumers’ consideration sets ( breadth ) and how intensively they are involved with each alternative in consideration ( depth ). It is the two changes that go on to increase consumers’ propensity to buy and basket value. Furthermore, we find that the proportion of the total effects mediated through the breadth of consideration set is much larger and more significant than that mediated through the depth.},

  abstract     = {This paper examines the potential economic spillover effects of a home-sharing platform—Airbnb—on the growth of a complimentary local service—restaurants. By circumventing traditional land-use regulations and providing access to underutilized inventory, Airbnb attracts visitors to locales that are not traditional tourist destinations. Although visitors generally bring significant spending power, it is unclear whether visitors use Airbnb primarily for lodging and thus do not contribute to the adjacent economy. To evaluate this, we focus on the impact of Airbnb on the restaurant employment growth across locales in New York City (NYC). Specifically, we focus on areas in NYC that did not attract a significant tourist volume prior to the emergence of a home-sharing service. Our results indicate a salient and economically significant positive spillover effect on restaurant job growth in an average NYC locality. A one-percentage-point increase in the intensity of Airbnb activity (Airbnb reviews per household) leads to approximately 1.7\% restaurant employment growth. Since home-sharing visitors are lodging in areas that are not accustomed to tourists, we also investigate the demographic and market-structure-related heterogeneity of our results. Notably, restaurants in areas with a relatively high number of White residents disproportionately benefit from the economic spillover of Airbnb activity, whereas the impact in majority Black areas is not statistically significant. We validate the underlying mechanism behind the results by evaluating the impact of Airbnb on Yelp visitor reviews, revealing that areas with increased Airbnb activity experience a surge in their share of NYC visitor reviews. This result is further validated by evaluating the impact of a unique Airbnb neighborhood-level exogenous policy recently implemented in New Orleans.},

The data we use is a large-scale customer traffic data set, collected through AI-chip-embedded sensors, across 25 malls over a two-year period, and we combine it with detailed campaign information for our analyses. We classify the campaigns into five categories based on the approach and timing of the campaigns. We then develop an innovative interpretable machine learning model, named generalized additive neural network model (GANNM), to accurately learn the response curves for different marketing campaigns. The response curves characterize the impact of campaign budget on customer traffic. We demonstrate that this new model has better predictive accuracy compared with current interpretable models and also yields additional business insights. We find that campaigns with experience incentives lead to larger increases in customer traffic than campaigns with sales incentives only, and the contrast is more significant for campaigns in off-peak periods. In addition, malls can piggyback on online promotion events and boost customer traffic with campaigns held at the same time. We further demonstrate that the optimized budget allocation based on the response curves learned by GANNM yields a 11.2\% increase in customer traffic overall, compared with 3.2\% achieved by a baseline with preassumed functional forms of response curves and 1.0\% achieved by a post hoc explanation method. Overall, our proposed model provides more accurate estimations for response curves and presents interpretable and actionable insights for managers.},

Our experimental results suggest that humans and AI who work together can outperform the AI that outperforms humans when it works on its own. However, the combined performance improves only when the AI delegates work to humans but not when humans delegate work to the AI. The AI’s delegation performance improved even when it delegated to low-performing subjects; by contrast, humans did not delegate well and did not benefit from delegation to the AI. This bad delegation performance cannot be explained with some kind of algorithm aversion. On the contrary, subjects acted rationally in an internally consistent manner by trying to follow a proven delegation strategy and appeared to appreciate the AI support. However, human performance suffered as a result of a lack of metaknowledge—that is, humans were not able to assess their own capabilities correctly, which in turn led to poor delegation decisions. Lacking metaknowledge, in contrast to reluctance to use AI, is an unconscious trait. It fundamentally limits how well human decision makers can collaborate with AI and other algorithms. The results have implications for the future of work, the design of human–AI collaborative environments, and education in the digital age.},

ACOs represent groups of healthcare providers that are responsible for coordinating patient care with the goal of improving health outcomes for their patient population. To develop a better understanding of the role of health information technology (IT) in a value-based care environment, we study (a) whether there are potential trade-offs between ACO efficiency and quality and (b) whether effective use of health IT enables ACOs to balance competing efficiency and quality objectives. We test our models with a nationwide sample of ACO data using a two-stage approach based on data envelopment analysis and econometric estimation. We observe that efficient ACOs do not make trade-offs with respect to healthcare quality, compared with inefficient ACOs. Furthermore, we observe that hospitals that participated in ACOs, and used IT effectively for care coordination with other providers, exhibited a positive association between efficiency and quality. ACOs with higher levels of meaningful use achievement of health IT demonstrate better patient health outcomes because of greater information integration with other care providers. Our findings imply that value-based incentives alone are not sufficient to resolve trade-offs between healthcare quality and efficiency, and healthcare policy needs to incorporate appropriate incentives to foster effective IT use for health information sharing and care coordination between healthcare providers.},

In this paper, using the data from a leading online weight-loss community, we study the effect of gamified challenges on the weight-loss outcome. We employ a dynamic model, using a system generalized method of moments estimator combined with an inverse probability weighting approach, to address endogeneity issues. Our findings indicate that participation in gamified challenges has a positive and significant effect on weight loss. We found that, on average, the participants achieved a weight loss of 0.742 kilograms (kg) by participating in at least one challenge a month. We demonstrate that not all gamified challenges are equally effective; effective challenges do not include a numeric weight goal (e.g., lose 5 kg), focus on exercise-only behavioral goals, and have a large active group size. Further, the results show that the absence (presence) of a numeric weight goal benefits users in exercise (diet) challenges. Moreover, a small active group size can help (hurt) users in exercise (diet) challenges. We discuss, as a potential underlying mechanism, the role of leaderboards to induce social comparison and motivate (discourage) users in exercise (diet) challenges.

Considering the pivotal role of face in social interactions in China, this research attempts to understand Chinese physicians’ dilemma of choosing between saving face or saving patients and how this dilemma makes them reluctant to follow CDSS recommendations. Drawing from the dual process theory, we postulate that physicians’ resistance to CDSS recommendations is reduced by their rational perception of the system’s usefulness and increased by their experiential belief of face loss and that these effects are contingent on two contextual factors, professional autonomy, and time pressure. Based on a longitudinal field survey with 182 physicians and follow-up interviews in a large Chinese hospital, we find support for the opposing effects of face loss and perceived usefulness. Furthermore, we show that face loss has a stronger effect on CDSS resistance at a high level of professional autonomy. In addition, when time pressure is high, perceived usefulness more strongly reduces while face loss more strongly increases CDSS resistance, thus amplifying the dilemma. This research makes a significant contribution by integrating the concept of face loss into information technology resistance research and revealing the dark side of professional autonomy and the paradoxical moderating effect of time pressure in the healthcare context.},

Drawing on theories from social psychology literature, we argue that a lender forms different credibility perceptions toward preceding peers based on their perceived anonymity state; the lender then uses such perceptions to adjust the lender’s herding momentum toward them. Using data collected from a leading debt-based crowdfunding platform, we classify an individual’s username as either anonymous or real-seeming, with the latter referring to as a user identification that seems to reveal one’s real name. The results show that successors demonstrate weaker herding momentum toward predecessors who are presented with real-seeming usernames than anonymous ones. This finding, which we attribute to a lower extent of perceived credibility derived from a nonconforming behavior, challenges the conventional wisdom that considers anonymity a negative factor for source credibility. We further show that the uncovered positive effect of perceived anonymity on herding is accentuated in the early stage of the fundraising period; nevertheless, we find no such discrepancies between listings that are assigned with high-risk and low-risk credit grades.

This is in contrast to existing studies of racial bias on digital platforms that focus on peer-to-peer marketplaces (e.g., eBay), in which both the perpetrators and the victims are individuals acting independently and on their own behalf. In particular, we present the first evidence of B2C bias in corporate social media customer service, a practice that has grown in popularity recently. Unlike traditional call centers, agents providing customer service on social media respond, on average, to fewer than half of the complaints they receive as per our analysis. We investigate the effect of a complaining customer’s racial identity, as revealed by the social media profile picture, on the chance of receiving a response. By analyzing more than 57,000 social media customer complaints to major U.S. airlines and leveraging a variety of analytics techniques, including text mining and facial recognition, we present quantitative evidence that African American customers are less likely to receive a response when they complain than otherwise similar White customers. Furthermore, our deep learning–based falsification test shows that the bias is absent without the visual cue that reveals racial identity. This study offers a practical yet powerful recommendation for companies: conceal all customer profile pictures from their employees while delivering social media customer service.},

  abstract     = {This paper examines complementarity between clinical health information technology (HIT) applications and their effects on three hospital-level performance measures: clinical quality, experiential quality, and healthcare cost. We emphasize two aspects of HIT use in hospitals. First, we focus on whether HIT applications are used to perform primary or support clinical functions. Contingent on whether the use of HIT applications is for performing only primary functions or both primary and support functions, we conceptualize symbiotic and pooled HIT complementarity, respectively. Second, we focus on whether HIT applications are implemented in the same time period or different time periods. Contingent on this temporal aspect, we conceptualize simultaneous and sequential HIT complementarity, respectively. We collected panel data on HIT implementation, clinical quality, experiential quality, and healthcare cost for 715 hospitals in the United States from four sources. Our results suggest that symbiotic, pooled, simultaneous, and sequential complementarity among HITs impact hospital quality and cost outcomes. Our results further indicate that these complementary effects differ across chronic and acute conditions. We also find that three-way complementarity has significant economic effects on quality and cost. In fact, post hoc analyses indicate that three-way sequential complementarity effects, which have not been previously examined, are particularly significant. This paper contributes to the literature by empirically examining different forms of HIT complementarity in hospitals. Our central message is that when assessing HIT value in hospitals, managers and researchers must pay attention to (1) the clinical functions to which these technologies are applied; (2) the sequence in which these HITs are implemented; and (3) the prevalence of chronic versus acute patients admitted in the hospital.},

  abstract     = {Rapid improvements in underlying technologies coupled with the diminution of contact-based interactions are resulting in commensurate increases in the supply of and demand for innovative electronic services over self-service technologies (SSTs). This situation raises critical questions regarding value creation as prior research suggests mixed effects of SSTs on customers and unclear implications of SSTs for firm customer growth. These implications are accentuated when firms offer innovative electronic services because of customers’ unfamiliarity with the services. In turn, this dynamic raises vital questions about (a) how SSTs influence firm customer growth, particularly when the firm’s electronic services are more innovative, and (b) what complementary investments help firms achieve customer growth from SSTs and innovative electronic services. In this study, we conceptualize the theoretical mechanisms underlying these relationships and empirically examine seven-year longitudinal secondary data of over 3,800 credit unions in the United States to obtain three main findings. First, consistent with prior views of SSTs, we find no significant unconditional effect of SSTs on firm customer growth. Second, we find that the innovativeness of the firm’s electronic services (IES) negatively moderates the influence of SSTs on firm customer growth, suggesting that SSTs may positively influence growth when IES is low but may deter growth when IES is high. Third, marketing intensity and human capital intensity positively moderate the influence of IES on the effect of SSTs on customer growth. In supplementary analysis, we find similar results using cross-sectional primary data from a sample of 186 U.S. credit unions and their customers matched with secondary data. Our unique theoretical contribution lies in highlighting that innovative electronic services on SSTs aimed at bringing the enterprise to the customer may not be enough for firms to achieve customer growth unless those services are accompanied by complementary investments in marketing and human capital.},

  abstract     = {How can information technology (IT) help hospitals gain and sustain reputation in the media? Combining signaling theory and technology frames, we examine if, how, and to what extent IT investments over time shape three facets of reputation: generalized favorability , being known , and being known for something . In accessing healthcare services, most patients are unable to assess a hospital’s quality of care directly. Faced with such information asymmetries, patients tend to consider a hospital’s reputation in the media when making care decisions. Indeed, journalists are well positioned to detect even the weaker quality signals—among which are state-of-the-art IT—that a hospital emits. As information intermediaries, journalists aggregate and interpret IT-related signals against the backdrop of their technology frames, which reflect their expectations of how a modern hospital IT should look. Perceived congruence between their IT-related expectations and observations on the ground is likely to translate into less critical writing about a hospital. We test our theorizing based on a comprehensive panel data set of 152 English hospital organizations spanning five consecutive years of IT investments and subsequent changes in media reputation as reflected in 175,973 articles in English newspapers. We find that investments in IT staff increase the “being known” facet of reputation as evidenced in the volume of media coverage. Investments in IT equipment , in contrast, positively affect a hospital’s general favorability as mirrored in the tenor of its media coverage. Our econometric analysis as well as our complementary content analysis of newspaper articles and follow up interviews with journalists allow us to attribute this effect primarily to more visible IT equipment investments that prompt journalists to write less negatively about a hospital. These findings suggest that investments in IT equipment can buffer hospitals from negative press, thereby helping them to gain and maintain a strong reputation in the media.},

  abstract     = {We analyze the welfare implications of consumer data sharing, and restrictions to that sharing, in the context of online targeted advertising. Targeting technologies offer firms the ability to reach desired audiences through intermediary platforms. The platforms run auctions in real time to display ads on internet sites, leveraging consumers’ personal information collected online to personalize the ads. The online advertising industry posits that targeted advertising benefits advertising firms (that is, merchants who want to target ads to the desired consumers), consumers who see ads for preferred products, and the intermediary platforms that match consumers with firms. However, the claims that targeted advertising benefits all players involved have not been fully vetted in the literature. We develop an analytical model to analyze the economic and welfare implications of targeting technologies for those three players under alternative consumer information regimes. The regimes differ in the type and amount of consumer data available to the intermediary and to the advertising firms, and reflect the presence or absence of technological or regulatory restrictions to personal information flows. We find evidence of incentive misalignment among the players, as the intermediary prefers to share only a subset of consumer information with firms, whereas advertising firms prefer having complete information about the consumers. As such, a strategic intermediary with the ability to control which information is shared during the auction can have an incentive to use only the information that maximizes its payoff, overlooking the interests of both advertising firms and consumers. The information regimes that maximize consumer welfare vastly differ depending on consumers’ heterogeneity along two dimensions: a horizontal dimension, capturing consumer’s heterogeneity in product preferences; and a vertical dimension, capturing consumers’ heterogeneity in purchase power. Consumers prefer none of their personal information to be used for targeting only in limited circumstances. Otherwise, consumers are either indifferent or prefer only specific types of information to be used for targeting.},

  abstract     = {Firms have been sharing transactional data with business partners ever since electronic data interchange was introduced to the retail industry in the 1980s. The potential benefits of data sharing notwithstanding, there has been continued reluctance on the part of data owners to share their data, for fear of sensitive information potentially making its way to competitors. Approaches that can help hide sensitive information could alleviate such concerns and increase the number of firms that are willing to share. Sensitive information in transactional databases often manifests itself in the form of association rules. Association rules can be concealed by altering transactions such that these sensitive rules stay hidden when the data are mined. The problem of hiding sensitive association rules is NP-hard, and to date, it has only been addressed via heuristic approaches. In this paper, we introduce a nonlinear integer formulation to hide sensitive association rules while maximizing the accuracy of the altered database. We then separate it into two problems: the sanitization problem , which hides sensitive association rules from a specific transaction while altering the transaction as minimally as possible, and the accuracy maximization problem , which maximizes the accuracy of the altered database, given a solution to the sanitization problem. We show how the sanitization problem can be represented as an integer program and propose a heuristic based on intuition from this formulation to solve it. Next, we formulate the accuracy maximization problem as a nonlinear integer program, show how it can be linearized, and derive various results that help reduce the size of the problem to be solved. Computational experiments are conducted on real and synthetic data sets, the largest of which has 100 million transactions. Our results show that although the nonlinear integer formulations are not practical, the linearizations and problem-reduction steps make a significant impact on solvability and solution time. We also find that there are substantial gains to be realized vis-à-vis existing approaches in terms of both solution quality and solution time and that hiding the rules directly (rather than by hiding the associated itemsets) can result in significantly fewer transactions being sanitized.},

Among other things, we demonstrate that such type of information tends to appear at the beginning of the review, in longer sentences, in the sentences written in the past tense or using gerund form, and in the sentences referring to some points in time. Second, we propose a novel context parsing method for systematically extracting contextual information from user-generated reviews that relies on the insights obtained in our study. We apply the proposed method to three different Yelp applications (restaurants, hotels, and beauty &amp; spas) and demonstrate that it works well and leads to better recommendation performance than the baseline approaches. Our method systematically extracts more comprehensive sets of relevant contextual variables and corresponding phrases than the baselines. Our analysis also shows the importance of the newly discovered contextual information for recommendation purposes.

Justice-driven privacy protection outlines a method to manage this trade-off. We built on the theoretical lens of justice theory to integrate justice provision with key privacy protection features and conceptualized the extent to which these features affect privacy concerns and information disclosure behavior. Notably, we proposed an information technology (IT) solution to balance the trade-off between privacy protection and consumer data collection. In the context of mobile banking applications, we prototyped a theory-driven IT solution, referred to as negotiation , active - recommendation privacy policy application, which enables customer service agents to interact with and actively recommend personalized privacy policies to consumers. We benchmarked our solution through a field experiment relative to two conventional applications: a non-negotiation privacy policy application (only a nonnegotiable privacy statement is posted) as a base method and a negotiation , non-active-recommendation privacy policy application (only a negotiation feature is integrated with the privacy policy). The results showed that the proposed negotiation , active - recommendation privacy policy application decreased privacy concerns and increased consumers’ information disclosure intentions and actual disclosure behavior. A post hoc analysis corroborated these findings, indicating that our design enhanced perceived procedural justice, interactional justice, and distributive justice among consumers and made them feel comfortable to disclose their personal information. Likewise, companies would be able to collect additional personal information from consumers, thereby contributing to a privacy-friendly environment. We discuss contributions and the implications of our proposed IT solution for consumers, companies, developers, and public policy officials.},

  abstract     = {Strategic sellers on some online selling platforms have recently been using a conditional-rebate strategy to manipulate product reviews under which only purchasing consumers who post positive reviews online are eligible to redeem the rebate. A key concern for the conditional rebate is that it can easily induce fake reviews, which might be harmful to consumers and society. We develop a microbehavioral model capturing consumers’ review-sharing benefit, review-posting cost, and moral cost of lying to examine the seller’s optimal pricing and rebate decisions. We derive three equilibria: the no-rebate, organic-review equilibrium; the low-rebate, boosted-authentic-review equilibrium; and the high-rebate, partially-fake-review equilibrium. We find that the seller’s optimal price and rebate decisions critically depend on both the review-posting and moral costs. The seller adopts the no-rebate strategy when the review-posting cost is low but the moral cost is high, the low-rebate strategy when the review-posting cost is high or when the review-posting cost is intermediate and the moral cost is high, and the high-rebate strategy when the review-posting cost is not too high and the moral cost is low. Our results suggest that it is not always profitable for strategic sellers to adopt the conditional-rebate strategy. Even if the conditional-rebate strategy is adopted, it does not always result in fake reviews. Furthermore, we find that, compared with the benchmark of no rebate, conditional rebates do not always hurt consumer surplus or social welfare. When a low (high) rebate is offered, if the review-posting cost is not too low (not very high), the conditional-rebate strategy can even lead to higher consumer surplus and social welfare. Our findings shed new light on the platform-policy debate about the fake-review phenomenon induced by conditional rebates.},

  abstract     = {An increasing number of companies have started to implement corporate knowledge-sharing communities. Consistent with the observation in the offline setting, employees are less likely to share knowledge with individuals who have higher job ranks (i.e., higher-ups) in corporate communities such as online wikis and discussion groups. Given the importance of managers’ engagements in the community and the needs for knowledge sharing across the hierarchy, we examine whether such observation persists in the corporate question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) community, another popular type of corporate knowledge-sharing community. On the one hand, as in the offline setting and other types of communities, employees can still be reluctant to share knowledge with the higher-ranked individuals in the Q&amp;A community. On the other hand, a Q&amp;A community has some unique attributes that can potentially motivate employees to engage more with the higher-ups. Using a unique data set from a large corporate Q&amp;A community and a potential-dyads approach, we find that a user is inclined to respond to a knowledge seeker whose job rank is higher than (versus lower than or the same as) the user’s rank in the corporate Q&amp;A community. We further show the causality of the result with a quasi experiment that leverages the promotions announced in our study period. Because these promotions are based on employees’ performances before the existence of the community, the promotion announcements are largely exogenous to our research interest. We also find that knowledge providers exert greater effort when answering questions from the higher-ups. Finally, our analyses show that knowledge providers who post more answers to higher-ranked seekers and who display greater effort in those answers are more likely to get promoted in subsequent years. Given the critical role of knowledge sharing and the increasing prevalence of online communities, our study offers a better understanding of the knowledge-sharing pattern in the corporate Q&amp;A community of the hierarchical organizations and delivers useful managerial implications.},

In this study, we delve into solvers’ ideation process and examine how seeker exemplars affect the quantitative outcomes in solvers’ scanning, shortlisting, and selection of ideas; these ideation activities relate to the search and evaluate stage of a previously published knowledge reuse for innovation model. We theorize that solvers’ use of local (problem-related) and/or distant (problem-unrelated) seeker exemplars in the respective search and evaluation activities is affected by their belief and emphasis in contests as well as the influences of processing fluency and confirmation bias during idea generation. Consequently, local and distant seeker exemplars have different effects in different ideation activities. Consistent with our theorizing, the results from an ideation contest experiment show that, compared with not showing any seeker exemplars, providing these exemplars either does not affect or could even hurt the quantitative outcomes in the respective ideation activities. We find that solvers generally search for, shortlist, and/or submit fewer ideas when shown certain seeker exemplars. Moreover, solvers who submit fewer ideas tend to submit lower quality ideas on average. Thus, showing seeker exemplars, which contest platforms encourage and seekers often do, could negatively affect quantitative ideation outcomes and thereby impair idea quality.

However, we know little about the process by which digital ventures draw on their digital core to extend current operations. To this end, we use Penrose’s work to analyze a two-year in-depth case study of a Chinese digital venture’s extension of its initial operations based on its credit rating technology. Our findings suggest that digital venture extension is facilitated by templating, which is a digitally enabled process of generating and using generic solutions across business areas. Through our grounded analysis, we unpack templating by tracing three processes contributing to digital venture extension: concepting, generalizing, and porting. Synthesizing our findings, we contribute to the emerging digital innovation and entrepreneurship literature by developing a process model of digital venture extension.},

This digital undertow, a corollary effect of waves of digitalization, profoundly influences how firms operate by transforming the industry standards that coordinate and regulate their core business activities. Using a genealogical approach, we draw on findings from a longitudinal field study in book publishing to theorize the tensions and processes that constitute the digital undertow. We explain that, when waves of digitalization transform firms’ core activities, they unwittingly affect how industry standards correspond with materializations of the phenomena they structure, thus influencing how standards perform in practice. A significant outcome of recent waves of digitalization in the book industry is the loss in correspondence between industry standards and novel digital materializations of the book. This is producing what we refer to as digital displacement, a process that is engendering an existential challenge to the capacity of standards to effectively coordinate and regulate industry operations in the digital age.},

In this research, the focus is on client firms’ perceived legitimacy of vendors, termed “vendor legitimacy.” Specifically, building on institutional theory, vendor legitimacy is conceptualized as consisting of three dimensions—pragmatic, moral, and cognitive—and is examined through their respective impacts on IT outsourcing performance. The role of key governance strategies for managing vendor legitimacy, namely, contractual governance and relational governance, are likewise explored. Results from a multiple-sourced, matched-pair, cross-industry sample of executives and managers of 185 client firms reveal that these various governance strategies exert differential impacts on the aforementioned dimensions of vendor legitimacy, which, in turn, drive performance.},

  abstract     = {With the upcoming next-generation 5G networks, mobile network operators (MNOs, such as AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon) are investigating new business models that encourage content providers (such as Netflix and Spotify) to sponsor data for consumers. Sponsored data allow customers to browse, stream, and enjoy content from their data sponsors without impacting their monthly data plan allowance. We analyze this recent phenomenon using an incomplete information game-theoretical model, where the MNO does not observe consumers’ types (personal valuation of mobile data) and provides multiple data plans to consumers. We find that the impact of sponsored data on consumer surplus crucially depends on whether the MNO has complete information over consumer types: Under complete information, sponsored data do not improve consumer surplus. However, under incomplete information, sponsored data increase consumer surplus. Our analysis also shows that under incomplete information, the MNO should allow sponsored data in a wider range of market conditions than those under complete information. Our study suggests that prior literature tends to underestimate both the long-run detrimental effect of sponsored data on content diversity and the short-run beneficial effect on consumer surplus. Our findings offer important managerial implications for the MNO, who is interested in optimizing the data plans, and for policymakers who regulate the wireless internet market.},
