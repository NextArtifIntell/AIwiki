  abstract     = {We scrutinize the direct and moderated impact of brands’ support for Black Lives Matter (BLM) on consumer responses. Our empirical strategy exploits Blackout Tuesday as a natural experiment in which BLM support occurred on Instagram (treated platform) but not on Twitter (control platform) to perform a within-brand crossplatform difference-in-differences (DID) analysis. We also combine econometric models with machine learning techniques to analyze the unstructured data of the social media content. Based on a unique multiindustry, multiyear, and multiplatform data set of 435 major brands and 396,988 social media posts, we find a negative impact of BLM support on consumer responses, such as followers and likes. Furthermore, our analyses uncover a multifaceted set of heterogeneous DID effects across brands. (1) Although lone-wolf BLM support leads to negligible effects, large-scale BLM support from many brands can lead to strong negative effects (i.e., the bandwagon effect). (2) Posting self-promotional content exacerbates the negative effects of BLM support. (3) Historical prosocial posting on social media attenuates the negative effects. (4) Brands with socially oriented missions suffer less from the negative effects. (5) Customers’ political affiliation also matters; the negative effects of BLM support are amplified/attenuated for brands with mostly Republican/Democratic customers. Additionally, (6) slacktivism (showing BLM support in words but without financial donations) can mitigate the negative effects for brands with mostly Republican consumers but amplify the negative effects for brands with mostly Democratic consumers.

  abstract     = {In this commentary, we focus on the racial justice movement popularly known as BlackLivesMatter (BLM). We begin our comments by briefly noting the history that led to the formation of the BLM organization and movement. This sets the stage for our comments on “How Support for Black Lives Matter Impacts Consumer Responses on Social Media”—an issue important for marketers who must evolve with an increasingly socially inspired economy. As BLM is a polarizing issue that is often misunderstood, we first note a potential internal validity issue with research on this topic. We then discuss issues specific to Blackout Tuesday, the intervention of interest in the paper. These include the comparability of the treatment and control platforms; the need for a clear baseline during this turbulent period; the possibility that the followers in the control condition were also treated; the parallel trends assumption; and the analysis and interpretation of the authors’ headline finding that firms supporting Blackout Tuesday faced a backlash in terms of a reduction in follower growth. Throughout this comment, we offer suggestions for future research that tackles the response to social-political issues like BLM. History: K. Sudir served as the senior editor for this article.},

  abstract     = {We discuss three main lines of comments on our paper: internal validity of the research given consumers’ potential misunderstanding of Black Lives Matter (BLM), challenges to the causal inference strategy, and interpretations of our results. We address them with additional robustness checks and reaffirm our view of the original findings as offering a panel of evidence with a consistent storyline: brands’ support for BLM on social media induces, on average, a sizable negative effect on consumer responses. Whereas the commentary focuses on the average effect of BLM treatment, we highlight that the negative effect is highly heterogenous and can be mitigated when brands’ BLM support is directed at Democratic consumers and delivered in a context where their BLM support can be interpreted as more authentic (e.g., no bandwagon, self-promotion, or cheap talk; consistent history of prosociality; and aligned brand prosocial mission). Furthermore, we want to emphasize the nascent nature of research on BLM and social justice movements for marketing, and our work represents a first empirical deep dive into the nature of consumer responses to the branded support of the BLM movement on social media. It is our hope that this research and the accompanying commentaries can inspire a wealth of new marketing perspectives on this critically important topic. History: K.

  abstract     = {The literature has documented that price frictions limit the frequency of price changes. We show that they are also associated with the failure of new products. Using the IRI academic data set, we identify new products that have low initial sales. When price frictions are high, retailers are less likely to adjust the price, and instead are more likely to discontinue the new product. We replicate the results by investigating retailer price and product line adjustments following the opening of a new store. We investigate three settings in which retailers may be reluctant to adjust prices on a new product: (a) when there are no price changes on related products, (b) when state-level pricing laws require price stickers on each package, and (c) when the initial prices end in 99¢. The sources of variation are very different across these settings, ranging from the timing of wholesale price changes to variation in state consumer protection laws to kinks in the demand curve associated with 99¢ price endings. Despite this diversity, our findings are consistent, suggesting that larger price frictions coincide with a higher probability that new items are discontinued when initial sales are low. This consistency leads us to conclude that it is more plausible that the effect is causal, rather than an artifact of endogeneity.

  abstract     = {Does the adoption of descriptive analytics impact online retailer performance, and if so, how? We use the synthetic difference-in-differences method to analyze the staggered adoption of a retail analytics dashboard by more than 1,500 e-commerce websites, and we find an increase of 4\%–10\% in average weekly revenues postadoption. We demonstrate that only retailers that adopt and use the dashboard reap these benefits. The increase in revenue is not explained by price changes or advertising optimization. Instead, it is consistent with the addition of customer relationship management, personalization, and prospecting technologies to retailer websites. The adoption and usage of descriptive analytics also increases the diversity of products sold, the number of transactions, the numbers of website visitors and unique customers, and the revenue from repeat customers. In contrast, there is no change in basket size. These findings are consistent with a complementary effect of descriptive analytics that serve as a monitoring device that helps retailers control additional martech tools and amplify their value. Without using the descriptive dashboard, retailers are unable to reap the benefits associated with these technologies.

  abstract     = {Firms in many industries obtain superior knowledge of customer preferences through industry experience or data analytics, whereas customers often need costly efforts to learn their match values. In this paper, we examine the situations under which a customer chooses whether to inspect upon observing her personalized price from a firm with superior knowledge. On the surface, it seems that the firm can use personalized prices to directly communicate the customers’ match value, and thus there is no need for customers to expend inspection efforts. However, we find that in equilibrium the firm may trick low-preference customers into overpaying more than their match value, even when the inspection cost is low. The opportunistic incentives induce customer suspicions, which may lead to excessive customer inspection that would be avoided if the firm were not capable of price discrimination. Therefore, personalized pricing cannot obviate customer inspection. Since inspection cost raises a deadweight loss in social welfare, public policies that prevent firms from price-discriminating against customers may benefit both firms and customers.

  abstract     = {This paper studies strategic consumer shopping behavior in response to a macroeconomic policy and quantifies its unintended consequences for retailers vis-à-vis the policy goal. Using transaction-level data from a large retail chain in India, we document consumer strategies that leverage retailers to avoid costs associated with the country’s currency reform policy. We observe both an increase in returns of cash-purchased items that were bought before demonetization ( strategic returns ) and a spike in final (unreturned) cash purchases with soon-to-be-illegal notes ( strategic purchases ). Both practices serve consumer incentives either to receive legal notes from the retailer or to avoid depositing cash in formal bank accounts. Our analysis suggests that strategic consumers hindered the intended policy effect while partly benefiting the retail chain, leaving 20 million Indian rupees (INR) ($0.3 million) of demonetized notes outside the formal tax network through this retail chain only; when we scale up the estimates to the country’s market size, the estimated total impact reaches 100 billion INR ($1.5 billion). Our findings offer implications for policy makers by quantifying a wide spillover effect of government interventions that goes beyond the target group and document a new role of the retail industry: of absorbing and facilitating a response to macroshocks.

  abstract     = {We consider a manufacturer’s optimal contract design in the presence of asymmetric retailers. We first solve for the case in which the manufacturer can overtly discriminate between its retailers by offering each a different two-part tariff contract. We then compare it to the case in which overt discrimination is not feasible and the manufacturer must instead induce self-selection. We find that whereas there is no role for slotting fees when overt discrimination is possible, slotting fees can arise as part of the equilibrium menu of contracts offered to both retailers in the absence of such discrimination. It is found that the large retailer always prefers the contract with the lower wholesale price, even if it means not accepting a slotting fee, whereas the small retailer always accepts the largest slotting fee offered, even though it means taking on the contract with the higher wholesale price. Our results also suggest that the wholesale prices (and hence retail prices) of both retailers will be uniformly higher when overt discrimination is infeasible.

We use data on product placement from TV shows and data on retail sales of cigarettes to estimate a demand model that incorporates the level of product placement exposure for each cigarette brand. We find that product placement has a small yet positive and statistically significant effect on both own-brand sales and competitor-brand sales: Both these elasticities are roughly 0.02. These results indicate that cigarette product placement affects demand for individual cigarette brands and that it also leads to greater overall cigarette use. This issue is of particular importance to policymakers because product placement is one of the few remaining ways that cigarette brands can reach a mass audience. To illustrate how these results could be used by policymakers, we use our model estimates to evaluate how cigarette sales would be affected by two hypothetical kinds of regulations. Limiting brands’ ability to be displayed on TV and forcing TV networks to instead use generic, unbranded cigarettes on screen would reduce total retail cigarette sales by only about 2\%, whereas forcing TV networks to eliminate all on-screen smoking activity would reduce it by about 7\%.

Buying fake reviews on Facebook is associated with a significant but short-term increase in average rating and number of reviews. We exploit a sharp but temporary policy shift by Amazon to show that rating manipulation has a large causal effect on sales. Finally, we examine whether rating manipulation harms consumers or whether it is mainly used by high-quality products in a manner like advertising or by new products trying to solve the cold-start problem. We find that after firms stop buying fake reviews, their average ratings fall and the share of one-star reviews increases significantly, particularly for young products, indicating rating manipulation is mostly used by low-quality products.},

  abstract     = {Sellers may display unreasonably high prices (in high-cost oriented contexts) that are never accepted or would surely be discounted through bilateral bargaining. Conversely, general or vague prices with incredible appeals may be advertised (in low-cost oriented settings) as a range or for a category but not tied to specific items. Nevertheless, these seemingly irrelevant or unbinding prices can affect buyer behavior and bargaining outcome. This paper presents a new explanation for these puzzling phenomena. We propose that advertised reference prices can be a strategic tool to communicate privately known seller costs to influence optimal buyer strategy to search value information. We show that cheap-talk communication via uncommitted prices can be endogenously credible, because optimal buyer search strategy can be imperfectly aligned with seller preference. In particular, a high-cost seller may prefer the buyer to acquire information in a more cautious manner (i.e., less willing to stop at good news but more eager to quit at bad news) than a low-cost seller, which may coincide with the buyer’s optimal search strategy. We demonstrate that endogenous buyer search can serve as a two-way discipline to regulate both high-cost and low-cost sellers’ incentives for deception, which thus can sustain credible communication for high-cost and/or low-cost oriented settings.},

  abstract     = {We present a deep learning algorithm to provide personalized feedback on creative appeals, written content intended to persuade readers to undertake some action. Such appeals are widespread in marketing, including advertising copy, RFP responses, call center scripts, product descriptions, and many others. Although marketing research has produced several tools to help managers glean insights from online word-of-mouth, less attention has been paid to creating tools to assist the innumerable marketers responsible for crafting effective marketing messages. Our approach leverages the hierarchical structure of written works, associating words with sentences and sentences with documents, and the linguistic relationships developed therein. We score each sentence in an appeal by its expected contribution to success accounting for its substance and persuasive impact. The sentences with the lowest scores make the appeal less compelling and are the most effective points to focus a revision. The approach has proved effective in a randomized control trial, with subjects rating essays revised with the aid of algorithmic feedback as being 4.5\% more likely to achieve their objectives. In addition to providing automated feedback to authors, we leverage the model’s output to derive substantive insights into what makes an appeal compelling.},

Warning labels decrease demand and purchase probabilities in the cereal category, and this effect is larger on medium-low socioeconomic groups.

We first show people express more interest in donating and volunteering (Studies 1a and 1b), are more likely to donate (Study 2), and put more effort into helping a charitable cause (Study 3) when these choices occur on paper (versus tablet)—a pattern of decision making we label the good-on-paper effect . Study 4 extends these findings to book choices (highbrow versus lowbrow) and to a device interaction that closely mimics writing on paper (i.e., tablet with digital pen). In the context of volunteering decisions, we then provide evidence for the sequential mediating roles of perceptions of realness and self-diagnosticity in the good-on-paper effect (Study 5 and Studies 6a and 6b). Finally, we show that chronic (Study 7) and situational (Study 8) perceptions of self-diagnosticity moderate this effect in the contexts of environmental protection and food choices (healthy versus indulgent), respectively.

The instrumental component comes from the consumer’s anticipated economic loss from revealing his private information to the firm and arises endogenously from a firm’s usage of consumer data. Combining an experiment and a structural model, I measure the revealed preferences separately for each component. Intrinsic preferences have seemingly small mean values, ranging from $0.14 to $2.37 per demographic variable. Meanwhile, they are highly heterogeneous across consumers and categories of data: The valuations of consumers at the right tail often exceed the firm’s valuation of consumer data. Consumers’ self-selection into data sharing depends on the respective magnitudes and correlation between the two preference components and often deviates from the “low types are more willing to hide” argument. Through counterfactual analysis, I show how this more nuanced selection pattern changes a firm’s inference from consumers’ privacy decisions and its data-buying strategy.},

In the face of limited bandwidth, firms are forced to make a tradeoff between disclosing their own positive information and their rival’s negative information. A negative-communication equilibrium, in which firms disclose rival’s negative information whenever possible, exists when consumers have poor outside options or when firms are better informed. Bandwidth limitations make competitive firms more likely to disclose information compared with when they have no limitations. When firms strictly prefer consumers to choose the outside option over the rival (as in political contests), there is a greater prevalence of the negative-communication equilibrium while the incidence of positive communication is lowered. Competition in information disclosure leads to greater consumer surplus compared with the unilateral disclosure case, whereas bandwidth limitations reduce consumer surplus. Finally, when firms are asymmetric in their ex ante quality valuations, the higher quality firm is less likely to engage in negative communication.},

We document a generational share gap : millennials buy more craft beer than earlier generations. We test between two competing mechanisms: (i) persistent generational differences in tastes and (ii) differences in past experiences or consumption capital . Our test exploits a novel database tracking the geographic differences in the diffusion of craft breweries across the United States. Using a structural model of demand with endogenous consumption capital stock formation, we find that heterogeneous consumption capital accounts for 86\% of the generational share gap between millennials and baby boomers with the remainder explained by intrinsic generational differences in preferences. We predict the beer market structure will continue to fragment over the next decade, overturning a nearly century-old structure dominated by a small number of national brands. The attribution of the share gap to consumption capital shaped through availability on the supply side of the market highlights how barriers to entry, such as regulation and high traditional marketing costs, sustained a concentrated market structure.},

As visitors browse various web pages, they may take rapid steps toward the action or may bounce away. Websites that can adapt to match such consumer dynamics perform better. However, assessing visitors’ changing distance to the action, at each click, and adapting to it in real time is challenging because of the sheer number of design elements that are found in websites, that combine exponentially. We solve this problem by matching latent states to web page designs, combining recent advances in multiarmed bandit (MAB), website morphing, and hidden Markov models (HMM) literature. We develop a novel dynamic program to explicitly model the trade-off firms face between nudging a visitor to later states along the funnel, and maximizing immediate reward given current estimates of purchase probabilities. We use an HMM to assess visitors’ states in real time, and couple it with an MAB model to learn the effectiveness of each design × state combination. We provide a proof of concept in two applications. First, we conduct a field study on the Master of Business Administration website of a major university.

Using a difference-in-differences approach, we analyze the changes in applicants’ loan outcomes after their employers join Equifax’s digital verification system, which provides lenders with an efficient way of accessing the (employer-) verified employment data in auto loan applications. Holding the employment status constant, we find that the availability of digitally verified data significantly expands credit access: the loan origination rate increases by 35.5\% on average, and is more significant among deep subprime (146\%) and subprime consumers (44\%). The interest rates charged on these loans rise only slightly. The expanded credit access also benefits lenders, with an estimated 19.6\% increase in profit. This is because the benefit of the market expansion effect dominates the cost of a higher delinquency risk among the expanded loan portfolio. Our results suggest that, besides seeking new data sources, managers and policy makers should also consider ways to extract more value from existing data.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops a theoretical model to study the economic incentives for a social media platform to moderate user-generated content. We show that a self-interested platform can use content moderation as an effective marketing tool to expand its installed user base, to increase the utility of its users, and to achieve its positioning as a moderate or extreme content platform. For the purpose of maximizing its own profit, a platform balances pruning some extreme content, thus losing some users, with gaining new users because of more moderate content on the platform. This balancing act plays out differently depending on whether users have to pay to join (subscription versus advertising revenue models) and on whether the technology for content moderation is perfect. We show that, when conducting content moderation optimally, a platform under advertising is more likely to moderate its content than one under subscription but does it less aggressively compared with the latter when it does. This is because a platform under advertising is more concerned about expanding its user base, whereas a platform under subscription is also concerned with users’ willingness to pay. We also show a platform’s optimal content moderation strategy depends on its technical sophistication. Because of imperfect technology, a platform may optimally throw away the moderate content more than the extreme content. Therefore, one cannot judge how extreme a platform is by just looking at its content moderation strategy. Furthermore, we show that a platform under advertising does not necessarily benefit from a better technology for content moderation, but one under subscription does as the latter can always internalize the benefits of a better technology. This means that platforms under different revenue models can have different incentives to improve their content moderation technology. Finally, we draw managerial and policy implications from our insights.},

  abstract     = {Firms employ temporal data for predicting sales and making managerial decisions accordingly. To use such data appropriately, managers need to make two major analysis decisions: (a) the temporal granularity (e.g., weekly, monthly) and (b) an accompanying demand model. In most empirical contexts, however, model selection, sales forecasts, and managerial decisions are vulnerable to both of these choices. Whereas extant literature has proposed methods that can select the best-fitted model (e.g., Bayesian information criterion) or provide predictions robust to model misspecification (e.g., weighted likelihood), most methods assume that the granularity is either correctly specified or prespecify it. Our research fills this gap by proposing a method, the scaled power likelihood with multiple weights (SPLM), that not only identifies the best-fitted granularity-model combination jointly, but also conducts doubly (granularity and model) robust prediction against their potentially incorrect selection. An extensive set of simulations shows that SPLM has higher statistical power than extant approaches for selecting the best-fitted granularity-model combination and provides doubly robust prediction in a wide variety of misspecified conditions.

The failure to correctly match different identities leads to a fragmented view of exposures and behaviors. This paper studies the identity fragmentation bias , referring to the estimation bias resulted from using fragmented data. Using a formal framework, we decompose the contributing factors of the estimation bias caused by data fragmentation and discuss the direction of bias. Contrary to conventional wisdom, this bias cannot be signed or bounded under standard assumptions. Instead, upward biases and sign reversals can occur even in experimental settings. We compare several corrective measures and discuss their advantages and caveats.},

Traditional SEO projects rely on hand-crafted content that is both time consuming and costly to produce. To address the costs associated with producing SEO content, we propose a semiautomated methodology using state-of-the-art NLG and demonstrate that the content-writing machine can create unique, human-like SEO content. As part of our research, we demonstrate that although the machine-generated content is designed to perform well in search engines, the role of the human editor remains essential. Comparing the resulting content with human refinement to traditional human-written SEO texts, we find that the revised, machine-generated texts are virtually indistinguishable from those created by SEO experts along a number of human perceptual dimensions. We conduct field experiments in two industries to demonstrate our approach and show that the resulting SEO content outperforms that created by human writers (including SEO experts) in search engine rankings. Additionally, we illustrate how our approach can substantially reduce the production costs associated with content marketing, increasing their return on investment.},

We exploit the plausibly exogenous location and orientation of peers’ rooftop solar panels relative to proximate roadways and visual obstructions, such as vegetation, in order to determine whether geographically proximate peer installations increase a household’s probability of solar adoption more if they are visible from the road. We find that the total angle of visibility of peer installations on the same street positively affects solar adoption decisions at distances of at least 500 meters (m). In contrast, we only find a positive effect of nonvisible solar arrays within 100 m, which may be due to causal peer influence via other channels, such as word of mouth, or very localized unobservable effects. The effect of peer visibility is moderated by the economic value that the peers receive from installing solar, providing suggestive evidence of social learning through visual information.},

We study the impact of network effects on price personalization in terms of price, demand, profit, and consumer surplus. One belief commonly held by companies is that price personalization increases their profit by providing means for capturing heterogeneity in consumers’ willingness to pay and enticing demand from heterogeneous consumer segments. Using a game-theoretical model, we find conditions under which price personalization not only shrinks demand, but also decreases the profit of the firm and reduces surplus of all consumers. Specifically, our model shows, in markets with network effects, unless when the impact of expected consumer heterogeneity is higher than the impact of network effects, personalized pricing reduces demand, lowers profit, reduces surplus of all consumers, and thus causes a deficiency in the market.},

It also enables these platforms to charge advertisers only when viewers attend to the entire ad. We develop a dynamic model of a viewer receiving incremental information from the advertiser and embed it in a two-sided market setting with an advertising market. Our results show that skippable ads can be less effective overall in converting existing viewers to advertisers. However, skippable ads bring more viewers to the platform and, in turn, induce more advertisers.

Using data from a leading U.S. airline, we empirically test the theoretical prediction that travelers’ switching costs vary dynamically with their progress toward attaining status. We show evidence for increased switching costs as the consumer approaches the target pace of point accumulation required to attain status. These switching costs reflect changes in booking behavior with the airline: Travelers become more likely to choose the airline even when it is less appealing than its competitors, and to pay higher prices than they otherwise would. These responses are reduced when travelers accumulate points at a rate substantially ahead of the target pace. The increase in switching costs is more pronounced for consumers at a hub of the airline and for business travelers. Moreover, we document a stronger willingness-to-pay response when consumers are less likely to shoulder the ticket costs themselves because they are traveling for business. This response suggests that asymmetric incentives induced by business travel explain much of the heterogeneity between business and leisure travelers, and moral hazard may be responsible for a large part of the profitability of frequent-flyer status incentives.},

We find that jackpot events increase gambling expenditures (average slot machine bet amount) and frequency of plays by jackpot winners. The average impact on the jackpot winner is a $39 increase in bet amount per play and a 33\% increase in the number of plays for the two-hour period after the jackpot event, whereas the impact on peers is a 21\% increase in number of plays in the same period. For bystanders, effects are weaker and dissipate about an hour after the jackpot. Our study of jackpot return on investment shows that 49\% of jackpots are profitable for the casino.

We ask the following research questions. First, what is the optimal level of affiliation (if any) from the firm’s perspective? Affiliation introduces positive bias to the influencer’s review but also decreases the persuasiveness of the review. Second, because affiliated reviews are often biased in favor of the firm, what is the impact of affiliation on consumer welfare? We find that the affiliation decision depends on the cost of information acquisition, the consumer’s prior and awareness, and the disclosure regime. When the consumer’s prior belief is low, the firm needs to affiliate less closely or not at all in order to preserve the influencer’s persuasiveness, the change in the consumer’s belief following the influencer’s review. In contrast, when the consumer’s prior belief is high, the firm fully affiliates with the influencer to both maximize awareness and prevent a negative review. We also show that the firm’s involvement can be Pareto improving if the information acquisition cost is relatively high, and a partial disclosure rule may increase consumer welfare.},

A third of consumers consistently chose to pay by chapter, even though a monthly subscription would significantly reduce the monetary cost. We propose a dynamic structural model that incorporates time-inconsistent preferences and strategic self-control behaviors to rationalize such behavior. We first analytically demonstrate the existence of a unique equilibrium and show how, under steady states, overpaying for reading can be optimal for consumers. We then estimate the model from the data. The results show that there is a large segment of price-sensitive consumers who are willing to overpay to curb future consumption. Our counterfactuals show that eliminating the pay-per-chapter option would hurt consumer welfare and the platform’s profit. Eliminating the monthly subscription plan, however, would increase the platform’s profit but reduce consumer welfare. We introduce a novel nonlinear pricing plan with a volume surcharge and illustrate how it can benefit both consumers and the platform.},

Whereas plausible causality is harder to establish in aggregate time series analyses, such analyses suggest large effect sizes. An individual-level perspective greatly facilitates plausibly causal estimates but poses measurement challenges. We overcome these challenges by linking household scanner data to administrative data. We analyze individual-level private-label shares measured in household scanner data as a function of income and wealth, both from a linked administrative database in the Netherlands in the period from 2011 to 2018 and aggregated over all household members (rather than only from the main earner). We find that relying on within-household variation in surveyed income data significantly attenuates income effects relative to using that from administrative data. Yet, we still find an economically small effect. In addition, changes in wealth have at most an economically small effect on private-label shares.},

Using a large debit cards database, we analyze consumer expenditures following the stimulus payments. We observe zip code level daily transactions (approximately 12 million cards) before and immediately following the disbursements of stimulus checks. Empirical analysis exploits geographical variation in timing of federal deposits to identify marginal propensity to consume (MPC) for stimulus payments. We estimate between 0.29 (excluding banking) and 0.51 (all spend) of the rebate is spent within a few days of receipt. We find large cross-sectional heterogeneity with MPC estimates that are three times higher in magnitude in the most densely populated urban areas with higher cost-of-living. In areas with more restricted movement during the pandemic (as measured by Google workplace mobility), MPC estimates are approximately 60\% higher. We reanalyze data from previous fiscal initiatives (2001 tax rebates and the 2008 fiscal stimulus) and find similar geographical differences. Collectively our results highlight an important shortcoming in fiscal policies that ignore local environment, particularly cross-sectional differences in cost-of-living across the United States.},

  abstract     = {To what extent do mass media outlets influence viewers’ trust in scientific evidence and compliance with behavior recommended by scientific experts? Exploiting the U.S. lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, we analyze a large longitudinal database that combines daily stay-at-home behavior from approximately 8 million mobile phones and local viewership of cable news networks. Early in the pandemic, several of Fox News’ hosts downplayed the severity of the pandemic and the risks associated with the transmission of the virus. A combination of regression analysis and a natural experiment finds that a 10\% increase in viewership of Fox News in a zip code causes a 0.76-percentage-point reduction in compliance with stay-at-home behavior. The results imply a media persuasion rate that is larger than typical advertising persuasion rates on consumer behavior. Similar analyses using viewership of MSNBC and CNN, which supported lockdown measures, were inconclusive but suggested a smaller, positive effect on compliance with social distancing regulations.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the effect of nutrition warning labels and advertising restrictions on the breakfast cereal market in Chile. In June 2016, the Ministry of Health required food products that exceed thresholds for sugar (22.5 g) and calories (350 kcal) to carry conspicuous front-of-package warning labels. Furthermore, these products were barred from advertising on television programs with high child viewership. Early evidence suggests that the regulation induces consumers to switch to products without warning labels; we show that this change in demand elicits a supply response. In particular, we present evidence of bunching just below the cutoffs. Using a structural model of cereal demand, we find that reformulation tends to reinforce the intent of the reform, in particular, by lowering the calorie content of cereal purchases.},

  abstract     = {In 2014, Washington State used a lottery system to allocate licenses to firms in the newly legalized retail cannabis industry, generating random variation in how many stores entrepreneurs were able to own. We observe highly detailed data on all subsequent industry transactions, including prices, wholesale costs, markups, and product assortments. We find that entrepreneurs who are randomly allocated more store licenses ultimately earn substantially higher per store profits than do single-store firms, suggesting that the returns to scale in the mom-and-pop retail sector are quite large. Despite these firms having less local competition, this increase in profits does not come at the expense of consumers. Rather, retailers in multistore chains ultimately charge significantly lower prices and margins and offer greater product variety. This gap in prices is not initially present but grows substantially over time, as does the difference in assortment size and profits between stores in multistore chains and stores operating alone, consistent with firm learning. Using the full history of outcomes, we track the evolution of firms in this new market and show that multistore retailers use an initial advantage in offering larger assortments to position themselves as the low-price, large-assortment retail option and attract a larger but more price-sensitive set of customers. These results have implications for the study of retail concentration and mergers, countervailing buyer power, and consumer search. Our results suggest that policies to help entrepreneurs expand in retail may have large benefits to both firms and consumers.},

I explain this phenomenon by proposing that price-sensitive consumers are less likely to search in low-demand periods, changing consumer composition and decreasing aggregate price elasticity. Simultaneously, consumer searches allow the firm to use price promotions to attract price-sensitive consumers while maintaining high average prices. I test this and other explanations using a seasonal dynamic structural inventory model where consumers make decisions on whether to search, which reveals price promotions and allows consumers to purchase. I find that price-sensitive consumers make up 14.9\% of searching consumers in the low-demand season versus 29\% in the high-demand season, resulting in increased price elasticity. The results suggest that consumer composition is changing due to the different search incentives of different segments.},

Despite high cost-effectiveness for marketing research, such endogenously selected samples must be carefully analyzed to avoid selection bias. We introduce a unified and efficient approach based on semiparametric odds ratio (SOR) models applicable for categorical, continuous and count response data collected using selective sampling. Unlike extant sampling-adjusting methods and Heckman-type selection models, the proposed approach requires neither modeling selection mechanisms nor imposing parametric distributional assumptions on the response variables, eliminating both sources of mis-specification bias. Using this approach, one can quantify and test for the relationships among variables as if samples had been collected via random sampling, simplifying bias correction of endogenously selected samples. We evaluate and illustrate the method using extensive simulation studies and two real data examples: endogenously stratified sampling for linear/nonlinear regressions to identify drivers of the share-of-wallet outcome for cigarettes smokers and using truncated and on-site samples for count data models of store shopping demand. The evaluation shows that selective sampling followed by applying the SOR approach reduces required sample size by more than 70\% compared with random sampling and that in a wide range of selective sampling scenarios SOR offers novel solutions outperforming extant methods for selective samples with opportunities to make better managerial decisions.},

  abstract     = {Many e-commerce platforms provide marketing tools to help their sellers attract customers and enhance user experience. However, there is virtually no theoretical framework or systematic evidence that provides insights to platforms on how their business customers use these marketing tools. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework and apply it to an empirical setting to understand how business customers choose between two service offerings (paid search and hot shop) provided by an e-commerce platform. A unique aspect of our modeling framework is that we incorporate two types of heterogeneous strategic considerations in sellers’ choice decisions of marketing tools: competitor and consumer reactions. To capture seller consideration of competition, we adapt the cognitive hierarchy framework by modeling sellers’ differing abilities to predict how competition affects their decisions. To capture seller consideration of consumer response, we first specify a sales-response model in which sales are affected by the marketing tools used and then incorporate the response parameters in sellers’ payoff functions. Our empirical analysis indicates that these two types of strategic considerations are both important. Our estimation results show that, in making decisions on which marketing tool(s) to use, sellers tend to differentiate themselves from the competition. We also find that sellers with a higher rating tend to be more strategic. This finding provides a useful metric associated with firms’ strategic ability, which is often difficult to quantify, and helps researchers to test theoretical predictions related to firms’ strategic thinking using field data. We perform two comparative statics exercises to derive managerial insights. The first exercise offers a benchmark analysis to help platforms evaluate which targeted promotion strategies are most effective. The second exercise indicates that an increase in seller strategic ability would reduce the overall seller usage of marketing tools, and we offer specific suggestions to help platform managers increase the use of their marketing tools.},

We consider the following features: (i) events may differ in their popularity; (ii) the more popular event is offered first or later; (iii) consumers may be uncertain about their valuation of the later event; (iv) the seller may be unable to commit to the price of a future event; and (v) consumer valuations of events are independently distributed or positively correlated. We show how these market features determine the benefit of segmenting consumers with offers of bundle and individual events, the gains from the unconstrained optimization of the second-period event, and its cannibalization effect on first-period offerings. We demonstrate circumstances where the seller’s optimal strategy is selling only individual events, only the bundle of events, the bundle of events with only the less popular event offered outside the bundle, or the bundle of events and both events offered outside the bundle. We also show that the seller prefers to offer the more popular event later in all these market settings.},

Yet, because of the difficulty of using unstructured image data, prior research on logo design has largely been limited to nonquantitative studies. In this work, we explore the interplay between logo design and brand identity creation from a data-driven perspective. We develop both a novel logo feature extraction algorithm that uses modern image processing tools to decompose pixel-level image data into meaningful features and a multiview representation learning framework that links these visual features to textual descriptions, consumer ratings of brand personality, and other high-level tags describing firms. We apply this framework to a unique data set of brands to understand which brands use which logo features and how consumers evaluate these brands’ personalities. Moreover, we show that manipulating the model’s learned representations through what we term “brand arithmetic” yields new brand identities and can help with ideation. Finally, through an application to fast-food branding, we show how our model can be used as a decision support tool for suggesting typical logo features for a brand and for predicting consumers’ reactions to new brands or rebranding efforts.},

A significant and increasing fraction of internet users has indeed already started employing ad-blockers. However, surprisingly little is known yet about the effects of ad-blockers on consumers. This paper investigates the impact of ad-blockers on online search and purchasing behaviors by empirically analyzing a consumer-level panel data set. Interestingly, the analyses reveal that ad-blockers have a significant effect on online purchasing behavior: online consumer spending decreases due to ad-blockers by approximately $14.2 billion per year in total. In examining the underlying mechanism of the ad-blocker effects, I find that ad-blockers significantly decrease spending for brands that consumers have not experienced before, partially shifting spending toward brands that they have experienced in the past. I also find that ad-blockers spur additional unintended consequences, as they reduce consumers’ search activities across information channels. The findings remain robust to different identifying assumptions and robustness checks. The analyses draw timely managerial and policy implications for the digital advertising industry, as well as additional insights into the role of online advertising.},

However, this assumption has not been closely examined for music streaming services, the consumption patterns of which can be different from video streaming services. To provide insights into this question, we analyze Spotify’s streaming data for the weekly top 200 songs for two years in 60 countries between June 2018 and May 2020, along with varying lockdown policies and detailed daily mobility information from Google. Empirical evidence shows that the COVID-19 outbreak significantly reduced music streaming consumption in many countries. We also find that countries with larger mobility decreases saw more notable downturns in streaming during the pandemic. Further, we reveal that the mobility effect was attributable to the complementarity of music consumption to other activities and likely to be transient rather than irreversible. Alternative mechanisms, such as unobservable Spotify-specific factors, a demand shift from top-selling songs to niche music, and supply-side effects, did not explain the decline in music consumption.},

Specifically, under what circumstances do individuals avoid information about their credit, and how does avoiding this information affect their future credit scores? Using data from a consumer finance platform, we find that a decline in credit score decreases the likelihood that an individual views her credit report in the future. We then measure the impact of receiving information on future credit scores, especially for those likely to avoid information. To obtain a causal local average treatment effect, we use variation in whether an individual views her credit report induced by email campaign A/B tests on a subsample of users who do not opt out of email communication. We find heterogeneous effects of information on credit scores. For individuals who were more likely to avoid information (users whose credit scores were decreasing), viewing their credit reports further decreases credit scores, whereas information increases credit scores for individuals less likely to avoid information. This finding suggests that encouraging individuals to access information when they are more likely to avoid information may worsen their financial health. We discuss the implications for firms’ targeting strategies in retention efforts.},

  abstract     = {We study the dynamic information design problem of a firm seeking to influence consumer checking behavior by designing push notifications. Firm payoffs are increasing in the frequency of consumer checking. The consumer is uncertain about the arrival of information as well as its valuation. In addition to direct consumption utility, the consumer also has preferences over realized uncertainty: she experiences disutility (anxiety) from the variance of the unchecked information stock. We show that push notifications can lead to more frequent checking compared with no-push, even though it reduces the information variance. Whereas push notifications resolve the information arrival uncertainty, they also create an endogenous impulse to check the information immediately. They can allow the firm to create a more efficient spread in the consumer’s beliefs/anxiety between zero or a level enough to induce checking. We generalize push strategies in two directions: a noisy push strategy that allows the firm to add phantom notifications and a partial push strategy in which the firm can mute information arrivals. Despite consumers having rational expectations, we establish conditions under which both these strategies increase checking. We also extend the model to account for consumer self-control as well as the possibility of endogenous prices.},

  abstract     = {We examine the effect of user’s popularity information on their demand in a mobile dating platform. Knowing that a potential partner is popular can increase their appeal. However, popular people may be less likely to reciprocate. Hence, users may strategically shade down or lower their revealed preferences for popular people to avoid rejection. In our setting, users play a game where they rank-order members of the opposite sex and are then matched based on a stable matching algorithm. Users can message and chat with their matches after the game. We quantify the causal effect of a user’s popularity (star rating) on the rankings received during the game and the likelihood of receiving messages after the game. To overcome the endogeneity between a user’s star rating and her unobserved attractiveness, we employ nonlinear fixed-effects models. We find that popular users receive worse rankings during the game, but receive more messages after the game. We link the heterogeneity across outcomes to the perceived severity of rejection concerns and provide support for the strategic shading hypothesis. We find that popularity information can lead to strategic behavior even in centralized matching markets if users have postmatch rejection concerns.},

  abstract     = {What are the implications of adopting a proprietary standard in a durable goods market? This paper shows that proprietary lens mounts tie digital cameras and lenses to the same brand, creating high consumer brand-switching costs and hurting firm profits and consumer surplus. I estimate a structural model of dynamic consumer demand and forward-looking firms setting committed long-run equilibrium prices, using detailed individual-level product-adoption data. I find that lens investments create consumer switching costs on the same order of magnitude as a new camera’s price. These switching costs result in significant friction in consumer brand choice, give rise to market power in the secondary (lens) market, but lead to intense competition in the primary (camera) market. Introducing compatibility—a universal standard across firms—will benefit consumers and firms: firm profit increases by 13\%–49\%, favoring the smaller firm, and average consumer surplus increases by 12\%.},

  abstract     = {E-commerce platforms, such as Amazon and Alibaba, enable hundreds of millions of consumers to search and purchase products offered by millions of independent sellers who can advertise their products on the platforms. In this paper, we study how to design such a marketplace when there are two types of asymmetric information—sellers have some private information about their products that the platform does not have, whereas the platform has private information about consumers that the sellers do not have. Using a game theory model, we formulate the marketplace design problem as maximizing marketplace profit (comprising ad revenues and sales commissions) by jointly considering the following elements: ensuring sellers join the platform, specifying the auction that enables sellers to advertise in the sponsored list, leveraging the information revealed in the ad auction to refine the organic list, and setting the commission rate on sales to consumers who are rational and heterogeneous in their preferences. We show that sellers’ bids in ad auctions, through which sponsored slots are allocated, can reveal the sellers’ private information to the platform (“information effect”), which it can optimally combine with information that it has about consumers to improve the placement of organic results, a practice we call “strategic listing.” However, by introducing an externality between the sponsored and organic sides, strategic listing also leads to more competition in the ad auction (“competition effect”), thus reducing the incentive of sellers to join the platform. The platform can incentivize sellers to join by reducing the commission rate on sales; however, under certain conditions, the platform must also reduce the degree of strategic listing (i.e., commit to limiting the influence of the sponsored ad auction outcomes on the placement of organic results). If the sellers’ participation is sufficiently difficult to induce, the platform obtains a larger proportion (under some conditions, all) of its revenue from advertising than from sales commissions. Our results shed light on the variation in practices across different platforms and provide timely guidance for platforms to refine their marketplace design.},

  abstract     = {Managers frequently explore new strategies, and exploit familiar ones, when making decisions on new product development, pricing, or advertising. Exploring for too long, or exploiting too soon, will generate inferior financial returns. Our research describes decision makers’ exploration/exploitation trade-offs and their link to psychometric traits. We conduct an incentive-aligned study in which subjects play a multiarmed bandit experiment and evaluate how subjects balance exploration and exploitation, linked to psychometric traits. To formally describe exploration/exploitation trade-offs, we develop a behavioral model that captures latent dynamics in learning behavior. Subjects transition between three unobserved states—exploration, exploitation, and inertia—updating their beliefs about expected payoffs. Our analysis suggests that decision makers overexplore low-performing options, forgoing over 30\% of potential revenue. They heavily rely on recent experiences. Risk-averse decision makers spend more time exploring. Maximizers are more sensitive to payoffs than satisficers. Our research builds the groundwork needed to devise remedial actions aimed at helping managers find an optimal balance between exploration and exploitation. One way to achieve this goal is by carefully designing the learning environment. In two additional studies, we analyze the evolution of exploration/exploitation trade-offs across different learning environments. Offering decision makers repeated opportunities to learn and increasing the planning horizon appears beneficial.},

  abstract     = {The advance of ad-blocking technology is expected to have profound implications on the advertising industry. This paper makes the first attempt to understand the impacts of ad blocking on consumer’s ad avoidance and optimal reactions by advertiser and ad platform while advertising signals quality. We extend the standard models on ad signaling to the context of ad blocking. Our model incorporates both ad-production cost and ad-distribution cost, and allows ad quality (ad production) to impact consumers’ nuisance costs. We find that, counterintuitively, a lower ad-blocking cost may result in fewer consumers blocking ads and higher profit for the advertiser. This is driven by the signaling function of advertising. In particular, the ad platform reacts to lower ad-blocking cost by lowering the unit ad-distribution cost it charges, forcing the advertiser to spend more on ad production because ad-distribution cost alone is insufficient to signal product quality. The high ad-production cost may offset consumers’ disutility of ad viewing and result in fewer consumers blocking ads when ad blocking becomes less costly. We also confirm the robustness of this insight with various model extensions and discuss the implications of our findings.},

  abstract     = {The success, if not survival, of service businesses depends on their ability to satisfy their customers. Yet, businesses often recognize slumping customer satisfaction too late and ultimately fail. To prevent this, marketers require early warning tools. In this paper, we build upon online ratings as a direct measure of customer satisfaction and, based on this, predict business failures. Specifically, we develop a variable-duration hidden Markov model; it models the rating sequence of a service business in order to predict the likelihood of failure. Using 64,887 ratings from 921 restaurants, we find that our model detects business failures with a balanced accuracy of 78.02\%, and this prediction is even possible several months in advance. In comparison, simple metrics from practice have limited ability in predicting business failures; for instance, the mean rating yields a balanced accuracy of only around 50\%. Furthermore, our model recovers a latent state (“at risk”) with an elevated failure rate. Avoiding the at-risk state is associated with a reduction in the failure rate of more than 41.41\%. Our research thus entails direct managerial implications: we assist marketers in monitoring customer satisfaction and, for this purpose, offer a data-driven tool that provides early warnings of impending business failures.},
