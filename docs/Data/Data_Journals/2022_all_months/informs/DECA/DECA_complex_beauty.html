  abstract     = {This paper derives analytic expressions for the expected value of sample information (EVSI), the expected value of distribution information, and the optimal sample size when data consists of independent draws from a bounded sequence of integers. Because of the challenges of creating tractable EVSI expressions, most existing work valuing data does so in one of three ways: (1) analytically through closed-form expressions on the upper bound of the value of data, (2) calculating the expected value of data using numerical comparisons of decisions made using simulated data to optimal decisions for which the underlying data distribution is known, or (3) using variance reduction as proxy for the uncertainty reduction that accompanies more data. For the very flexible case of modeling integer-valued observations using a multinomial data-generating process with Dirichlet prior, this paper develops expressions that (1) generalize existing beta-binomial computations, (2) do not require prior knowledge of some underlying “true” distribution, and (3) can be computed prior to the collection of any sample data.},

We explore empirically how well eight different methods perform based on a large sample of real-world elicited weights. We use the Euclidean distance from the elicited weights to judge the quality of the surrogate weights as well as three other metrics. The sum reciprocal method gives results, on average, statistically closest to the elicited weights for all metrics used. The equal ratio method using a fixed ratio of 0.716 performs just as well on three of the metrics. The rank sum method, the simplest and one of the oldest methods, performs generally next best. The rank order centroid method, which does well in simulation studies, performs relatively poorly in this evaluation using real-world data.},

  abstract     = {For media or digital products with quality uncertainty like online games, movies, theater plays, software, and smartphone applications, online customers may strategically delay their purchase waiting for online reviews and their peers’ purchase decisions. Thus, a firm needs to consider both social learning and positive network externality to anticipate the customers’ purchasing decisions and set a good pricing strategy over time. This paper investigates how these dual concerns affect the strategic interaction between a firm using preannounced pricing or responsive pricing and strategic customers in a two-period game-theoretic model. Deviating from conventional wisdom suggesting that social learning and externality work in a similar way, our results highlight their differences and provide valuable managerial insights. Although social learning and externality play a similar role in expanding the increasing-price-optimal region, they are different in other aspects: The firm will be worse off with learning if the externality gets stronger, whereas it will be worse off or better off with learning if learning gets stronger. In addition, we characterize the condition under which responsive pricing may outperform preannounced pricing. We further find that the firm’s discount factor has an influence on the firm’s pricing strategy selection.},

  abstract     = {In an increasingly competitive environment, defense organizations are met with more difficult decisions than in years past. This problem is especially apparent in security cooperation, that is, defense diplomacy, conducted by the United States. Both the United States and its competitors offer military assistance to third-party nations who, in turn, select an offer based on their own self-interest. Unfortunately, current security cooperation planning practices adopt an ad hoc approach to such problems. Therefore, we set forth herein a decision-analytic-planning framework by (1) provisioning a generic utility model for security cooperation planning applicable to myriad stakeholders and (2) developing a Bayesian solution that allows the stakeholder to select an action that maximizes their expected utility. This combination of value-focused thinking and adversarial risk analysis improves upon standard U.S. defense practices; it tractably encodes planning assumptions and more comprehensively considers the relevant uncertainties. The efficacy of this planning approach is illustrated on a notional U.S. Air Force case study in which a host nation must choose between security assistance from the United States or a competing nation.},

In this paper, we analyze the performance of models that submitted COVID-19 forecasts to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and evaluate them against a simple two-equation model that is specified using simple linear regression. We find that our simple model was comparable in accuracy to highly publicized models and had among the best-calibrated forecasts. This result may be surprising given the complexity of many COVID-19 models and their support by large forecasting teams. However, our result is consistent with the body of research that suggests that simple models perform very well in a variety of settings.},

  abstract     = {Pharmaceutical companies have frequent portfolio reviews to monitor development progress and prioritize development assets. The earliest assets are drug candidates whose efficacy is unknown and whose effects on the human body have yet to be fully investigated. These assets are characterized by a high degree of uncertainty in reaching the market and in being used in clinical practice. In addition, not all potential applications are foreseen and can often be very different. In the absence of satisfactory methods for making decisions on resource allocation among early development assets, decision makers focus almost exclusively on assessments of an asset’s probability of technical success. This study proposes a more holistic methodology to support early-stage pharmaceutical development decisions using value-focused thinking and multicriteria decision making. The methodology operates within the decision quality framework and provides a consistent evaluation of various early development assets across a diverse set of disease areas. This combination of concepts and methodologies has been implemented and proven valuable at Bayer Pharmaceuticals, which needed a new, more robust decision-making process for early development. Thus, this study discusses how to enable concrete trade-offs at the level of corporate objectives to align, communicate, and translate corporate strategy into portfolio strategy. In addition, this study presents learnings for decision analysts and decision makers in the pharmaceutical industry on how to develop a set of fundamental objectives, how to create scales to operationalize these objectives, and how to take steps to debias an organizational decision-making process.},

  abstract     = {In the backdrop of the opioid epidemic, opioid prescribing has distinct medical and social challenges. Overprescribing contributes to the ongoing opioid epidemic, whereas underprescribing yields inadequate pain relief. Moreover, opioids have serious adverse effects including tolerance and increased sensitivity to pain, paradoxically inducing more pain. Prescribing trade-offs are recognized but not modeled in the literature. We study the prescribing decisions for chronic, acute, and persistent pain types to minimize the cumulative pain that incorporates opioid adverse effects (discomfort and dependence) and the risk of tolerance or hypersensitivity (THS) developed with opioid use. After finding closed-form solutions for each pain type, we analytically investigate the sensitivity of acute pain prescriptions and examine policies on incorporation of THS, patient handover, and adaptive treatments. Our analyses show that the role of adverse effects in prescribing decisions is as critical as that of the pain level. Interestingly, we find that the optimal prescription duration is not necessarily increasing with the recovery time. We show that not incorporating THS or information curtailment at patient handovers leads to overprescribing that can be mitigated by adaptive treatments. Last, using real-life pain and opioid use data from two sources, we estimate THS parameters and discuss the proximity of our model to clinical practice. This paper has a pain management framework that leads to tractable models. These models can potentially support balanced opioid prescribing after their validation in a clinical setting. Then, they can be helpful to policy makers in assessment of prescription policies and of the controversy around over- and underprescribing.},

We leverage electronic health record (EHR) data with clinical expertise to develop a continuous-time Markov decision process (MDP) optimal stopping model that identifies the optimal first intervention action (anti-infective, fluid, or wait). To study the impact of initial treatment of patients at risk for developing sepsis, we define the delayed treatment population who received delayed treatment upon admission or during hospitalization and serves as an approximation of the natural history of sepsis. We apply the optimal first treatment policy to sample patient visits from the nondelayed treatment population. This analysis indicates the average risk of death could be reduced by approximately 2.2\%, the average time until treatment could be reduced by 106 minutes, and the average severity of the treatment state could be reduced by 15.5\% compared with the treatment they received in the hospital. We study the properties of the optimal policy to define an easily interpretable initial treatment heuristic that considers a patient’s organ dysfunction, location, and septic shock status. This generalizable framework can inform personalized treatment of patients at risk for sepsis.},

We manipulate two sources of cognitive stress. First, we vary individuals’ participation in a 6-digit mixed number and letter memorization task involving their personal identification numbers. This exogenously increases cognitive load. Second, we introduce an intervention to reduce cognitive stress by only allowing participants to order when inventory is depleted. This restricts the order choice set. Increases in cognitive load negatively impact earnings with and without the intervention, with these impacts largely occurring in the first attempt of the task. With repetition, participants’ choices in all treatments trend to near-optimal policy adoption. However, only in the intervention and low cognitive load treatment do the majority of choices reach the optimal policy. We estimate the learning dynamics of order decisions using a Markov learning model. Estimates suggest increased cognitive load reduces the probability of switching to more profitable policies. Choice set complexity increases biases for smaller order size adjustments, leading to greater policy lock-in.},

  abstract     = {From corporate budgeting to public planning, we hear that commodity prices are uncertain and that, when they vary, key investment measures sway with them. However, claiming that commodity prices are outside a firm’s domain of control, corporate decision makers tend to disregard this uncertainty or at best reflect it in naïve sensitivity analyses. Yet, firms should take in the understanding about key uncertain factors to avoid inferior decisions and loss of value. In this paper, we show that the customary practice of analysis with arbitrary “high” and “low” forecasts of prices is inconsistent with the general understanding about commodity price dynamics and the financial theory. To alleviate this, we develop consistent and project-specific forecast of prices that support valuations and decision making.},

  abstract     = {Eliciting informative prior distributions for Bayesian inference can often be complex and challenging. Although popular methods rely on asking experts probability-based questions to quantify uncertainty, these methods are not without their drawbacks, and many alternative elicitation methods exist. This paper explores methods for eliciting informative priors categorized by type and briefly discusses their strengths and limitations. Most of the review literature in this field focuses on a particular type of elicitation approach. The primary aim of this work, however, is to provide a more complete yet macro view of the state of the art by highlighting new (and old) approaches in one clear easy-to-read article. Two representative applications are used throughout to explore the suitability, or lack thereof, of the existing methods, one of which highlights a challenge that has not been addressed in the literature yet. We identify some of the gaps in the present work and discuss directions for future research.},

  abstract     = {The construction of a representative multiattribute utility function is important in decision analysis. Existing methods focus mainly on constructions of utility functions on the whole domain of attributes. In some cases, decision makers may provide partial information on their local utility assessments. Therefore, it is a challenging and interesting task to construct utility functions that are compatible with local assessments provided by decision makers. This paper proposes the patchwork construction to accomplish this task. We first define a special local preference structure, the local utility independence and then discuss the patchwork construction that unifies local utility independence on different local domains. The utility function elicited by the patchwork approach under the local utility independence condition is named as the local-utility-independent utility function. Three types of local-utility-independent utility functions on three typical partitions are proposed. These local-utility-independent utility functions have concise and tractable functional forms and indicate intuitive preference structures while matching prior known local utility assessments. Furthermore, the preference structures implied by these three types of local-utility-independent utility functions have a close relationship with the n-switch independence. Sufficient and necessary conditions guaranteeing these local-utility-independent utility functions to indicate n-switch independence are provided, respectively. All three types of local-utility-independent utility functions also have an important application in the approximations of arbitrary utility functions when only some local assessments are provided. As approximations, they are robust and have high accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Assessing the quality of a forecasting model crucially depends on a proper scoring rule or suitable loss function. As for point forecasts, the existence of a strictly consistent loss function that allows for a fair comparison of competing forecast models has to be guaranteed, which means that the corresponding statistical functional has to be elicitable. We consider instance and object ranking problems that intend to correctly predict the ordering of instances in a data set. A ranking prediction is naturally identified with a point forecast in the respective symmetric group, that is, the forecaster predicts one single permutation of the row indices. We show that, in the presence of ties, this strategy does not allow for strictly consistent scoring functions because of multiple true permutations. Those multiple optima cannot be entirely covered by a single point forecast, which causes all corresponding optima to be minimizers of standard scoring functions that operate on symmetric groups, so these scoring functions are not strictly consistent. As a remedy, we consider accurately accounting for ties. This is done by treating each configuration of clear orderings and ties as an additional category, which induces extended decision spaces with a clearly defined single optimum. Because these decision spaces are still finite, each type of instance ranking problem that we consider in this work and corresponding ranking functional, mapping into a symmetric group, can be identified with a certain classification problem and corresponding classification functional, mapping into one of our extended decision spaces, which is elicitable.},

  abstract     = {Information resources have been shared to promote the business operations of firms. However, the connection of business information sharing interfaces between firms has increased the attack surface and created opportunities for the hacker. We examine the benefits and risks of business information sharing for firms who exert security efforts against a strategic hacker that launches attacks subjectively. We show that two kinds of security efforts, security investment and security knowledge sharing, act as strategic substitutes when the business-sharing degree is low and act as strategic complements otherwise. Besides, the strategic hacker is not always aggressive, who will give up launching attack activities when the business-sharing degree is relatively low. Moreover, as a specific characteristic in the security domain, the risk interdependency first enhances and then suppresses both firms’ security investments and the hacker’s attack effort, which causes a free-riding problem for two firms. Then, two coordination mechanisms, an investment-based mechanism and liability-based mechanism, are proposed to help firms coordinate their strategies to reach socially optimal security levels. Last, we extend the main model to three cases to make our model more general. This paper provides the first evidence to assess the security risks exacerbated by business information sharing while considering a strategic hacker. Some management insights to managers for making security decisions are provided.},

  abstract     = {We present a novel multiple volatility real options approach (MVR) to value investment projects with embedded flexibility and affected by multiple uncertainties. A core innovation is the MVR decision tree composed of MVR synthetic tree components, each reflecting a unique binomial process that approximates a geometric Brownian motion of project value induced by one uncertainty source. MVR uses Monte Carlo simulation to generate volatility of project value log-returns arising from each uncertainty source. MVR produces a multidimensional surface, which is hidden in other approaches, representing enhanced net present value (ENPV) as a function of each uncertainty. It allows the impact of each uncertainty’s volatility on ENPV to be measured through three MVR sensitivity analysis levers. To illustrate MVR, it is applied to a real-world investment project, revealing that MVR provides a more accurate valuation than alternative approaches that do not account for separate impacts of each uncertainty. MVR with its greater veracity, provides robust investment decisions through MVR decision rules.},
