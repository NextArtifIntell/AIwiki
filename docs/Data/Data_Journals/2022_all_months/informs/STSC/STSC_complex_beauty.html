  abstract     = {Many markets are characterized by the rapid coming and going of successive products, each lasting in the market for only a short period of time before it is replaced by another. Such markets confront firms with the strategic challenge of trying to enhance the success and longevity of their products. We develop a model to understand such time-based competition among products and how it is shaped by different organizational strategies. We estimate the model using data on Korean popular music. The results highlight the importance of social exposure to a transitory product’s chances of becoming and remaining popular. They also show that efforts by large organizations to manufacture popularity in that context have triggered a self-defeating dynamic. These efforts not only improve the competitiveness of songs trying to become popular but also increase competition from rival songs, thereby intensifying the brevity of success.

  abstract     = {When formulating strategic problems, managers and executives routinely overlook relevant causes. This oversight, in turn, compromises the effectiveness of solutions and strategies. To illuminate the factors determining the success of problem formulation, we develop a model of the individual-level drivers of problem formulation comprehensiveness—the number of nonredundant and relevant causes to a problem that individuals identify. Specifically, we theorize that epistemic motivation—the desire to learn and hold well-informed views of the world—is an important driver of comprehensiveness. Furthermore, we suggest that high construal levels—an abstract thinking style—enhance the benefits of epistemic motivation because they direct individual information processing away from the symptoms of a problem toward its underlying causes. We test this interaction model in two experimental studies involving Chinese top executives and university students in the United States. The results of our two studies are consistent with our theoretical model. High construal levels strengthen the effect of epistemic motivation, resulting in greater comprehensiveness of problem formulation. We discuss the implications of our work for theory and practice.

  abstract     = {The tentative pursuit of parallel projects in an innovation funnel helps firms improve selection under uncertainty. Yet a risk of premature project termination may make employees more hesitant to innovate. Rewards to innovation, if at risk, become less attractive. My laboratory experiment indeed shows that employees who believe they have low task efficacy and, thus, face a high risk of termination often forego innovation. But funnels also attract: employees with high efficacy beliefs choose innovation more often although they, too, face an additional, albeit smaller, termination risk. Their innovation choices reveal a preference for allocation regimes that are more likely to spot and reward the ultimately most deserving innovators. Such meritocracy increases alongside project-selection accuracy. The uncertainty of innovation, thus, proves a rare context in which employees view a lack of organizational commitment positively. The meritorious self-sorting I document has implications for motivating risk-taking and organizing innovation within firms.

  abstract     = {By analogy with portfolio diversification by stock market investors, managers and researchers have often expected that firms that spread operations across product or geographic markets reduce risk. However, numerous exploratory studies in corporate strategy and in international business have not been able to robustly confirm this expectation. This study develops a formal model to scrutinize implications of corporate diversification for corporate risk. The model incorporates the key distinction of corporate diversification, economies of scope, that qualifies the analogy between corporate and portfolio diversification. The presence of a particular type of economies of scope, resource redeployability, not only inherently increases risk but it can also raise risk over the level in undiversified firms. The model uses determinants of resource redeployability from previous research to derive conditions with which corporate diversification enhances risk. The developed elaborate operationalization of corporate risk should facilitate future research and help corporate managers.

  abstract     = {Forming beliefs or expectations about others’ behavior is fundamental to strategy as it codetermines the outcomes of interactions in and across organizations. In the game-theoretic conception of rationality, agents reason iteratively about each other to form expectations about behavior. According to prior scholarship, actual strategists fall short of this ideal, and attempts to understand the underlying cognitive processes of forming expectations about others are in their infancy. We propose that emotions help regulate iterative reasoning, that is, their tendency to not only reflect on what others think, but also on what others think about their thinking. Drawing on a controlled experiment, we find that a negative emotion (fear) deepens the tendency to engage in iterative reasoning compared with a positive emotion (amusement). Moreover, neutral emotions yield even deeper levels of iterative reasoning. We tentatively interpret these early findings and speculate about the broader link of emotions and expectations in the context of strategic management. Extending the view of emotional regulation as a capability, emotions may be building blocks of rational heuristics for strategic interaction and enable interactive decision making when strategists have little experience with the environment.

We test this hypothesis by treating announcements of funding for startups as an information shock to investors evaluating incumbent financial service providers between 2010 and 2017—a period marked by atypical category combinations at FinTech startups. We find that announcements by startups that embodied unusual combinations of categories resulted in lower cumulative average returns for incumbents, both in absolute terms and in comparison with typical startups.

Building on status theory and performance feedback theory, we theorized that status distance between new CEOs and their predecessors explains the empire-building behavior of new CEOs early in their tenure. Because of the uncertainty surrounding a CEO’s quality early in the individual’s tenure, status serves as a signal of quality for the new CEO. Hence, CEOs had to rely on status signals to maintain or close the status gap between them and their predecessors. Drawing on performance feedback theory, we theorized that new CEOs’ status contrast relative to their predecessor influences their acquisitive behavior. Our examination of the acquisition behavior of 429 new CEOs of S&amp;P 500 firms in the United States revealed that relatively low-status CEOs engaged in risk-taking to improve their status, but relatively high-status new CEOs engaged in risk-taking to maintain their lead. It also revealed that new CEOs changed their risk-taking behavior when direct evidence of their quality or that of their predecessors deviated from the underlying quality expectations indicated by their relative status position.},

  abstract     = {A central strategic imperative for surviving technological change requires firms to attenuate the inertia and rigidity imposed by its legacy technology orientation (defined as the relative emphasis placed on technological knowledge and products aligned to an incumbent technology) and successfully transition to a new technology. We theorize that resource reconfiguration through corporate scope decisions—alliances, acquisitions, divestitures, and different postacquisition integration approaches—enables firms to achieve the twin requirements of attenuation and transition. Initially, a legacy technology orientation exerts inertia due to legacy reinforcement—decreasing the likelihood of firms making new technology acquisitions and legacy technology divestitures. New technology alliances mitigate this inertia via legacy attenuation—increasing the likelihood of acquisitions and legacy divestitures. Finally, when firms make new technology acquisitions, we theorize that acquirers choosing partial acquisition integration approaches (partial integration and partial autonomy) are more likely to achieve a successful transition to the new technology-legacy transition and, thus, more likely to survive technological change relative to firms choosing full integration or full autonomy. Using a sample of firms from the digital camera product market over 1991–2006, we found strong empirical support for our predictions. We contribute to research on technological change by demonstrating that firms may overcome the inertia of a legacy technology orientation and adapt to an emerging new technology by employing corporate scope decisions and postacquisition integration as resource reconfiguration mechanisms. Specifically, we advance the novel finding that postacquisition integration is an important survival-enhancing mechanism that facilitates adaptation to technological change.},

He and other leading strategy scholars explore the intricacies of developing and sustaining a dynamic competitive advantage. Yet, economists argues that most firms eventually fail to maintain competitiveness. Functionally efficient financial markets, by capitalizing innovative entrants and culling uncompetitive firms, sustain economy-level prosperity. Ghemawat (1991) highlights this tension: firm-level competitiveness can give investors high returns for years, while returns regress towards the mean. Applying this insight to well-documented historical episodes of rapid innovation in various industries, we show that leading U.S. firms in 1920s acquired durable competitive advantages, as did many in the 1960s, but that later entrants often felled early leaders in the 1990s IT boom, consistent with intensified creative destruction. Still, even these shorter-term winners paid well above average cumulative returns. Strategy research that could predict the durability of leading firms’ competitive advantages through an era of rapid innovation would have tremendous value to practitioners in finance.},

  abstract     = {In several celebrated examples, incumbents with significant resources have been beaten, in their own core businesses, by young start-ups. We identify a general mechanism that explains how these entrants can succeed against seemingly impossible odds. Specifically, we argue that they circumvent the entry barriers by using new business models that do not depend on the hard-to-imitate resources protecting the incumbent. While the entrants are gaining experience with their business models, they develop their own hard-to-imitate resources, and these eventually allow them to expand into the incumbents’ core markets. We formalize the argument in a model, derive several comparative static predictions, and illustrate it with a number of examples. The mechanism does not work if the incumbents react immediately, but we will draw on the literature on corporate inertia to argue that three of the mechanism’s properties make it especially likely that incumbents will be slow to adopt new business models.},

  abstract     = {Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has become a strategic decision for organizations. The capacity to invest in several distinct CSR categories at varying levels (e.g., environmental innovation, diversity, community) leaves firms with a multitude of patterns from which to choose. However, the question of whether market returns to CSR are defined by individual-level positioning choices or by industry-level conditions––particularly the materiality of distinct categories of CSR––remains unresolved. Drawing on the literature arguing that stakeholders are crucial enablers of value creation and capture, we theorize that unique CSR strategies more effectively promote stakeholder engagement by helping firms develop differentiated and unrivaled positions with key stakeholders. Thus, we argue that CSR uniqueness is positively associated with market value. Yet we also argue that uniqueness can be constrained by materiality: in industries in which a higher number of CSR categories are considered material, firms have fewer degrees of freedom to successfully differentiate from competitors; hence, the market returns to unique CSR positioning are negatively associated with the number of CSR categories deemed material to the industry. Using a novel measure of uniqueness of CSR strategies and a database containing environmental, social, and financial information of 2,093 firms between 2002 and 2017, we find strong support for our hypotheses. To shed further light on the mechanisms driving the role of materiality, we examine the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill.},

  abstract     = {We examine how entrepreneurs might build a viable, values-driven niche. Extant templates for niche creation typically employed in moral markets depend on instrumentally rational logics that privilege economic ends such as profitability and efficiency. Entrepreneurs seeking to construct a nascent niche whose purpose and objectives include the amelioration of social ills, however, may find such templates inadequate. Using the emergence of the U.S. bean-to-bar chocolate niche, through which entrepreneurs attempt to address the social and environmental shortcomings of conventional chocolate production, we demonstrate that constructing an alternative model for niche creation is feasible. Most bean-to-bar entrepreneurs deliberately opted out of extant private regulation initiatives, developing instead alternative encompassing, values-driven sourcing and cooperative relationships, which we term collaborative governance. This is enacted throughout the niche by promoting shared values, best practices, and transparency and is supported by strategic meaning-making work to cultivate customers. Together, these three values-driven strategies form a novel template of niche creation based not on cognitive repositioning or exploiting exogenous change within existing structures and institutions, but on a reconceptualization of how markets might work to support the implementation of nonmarket goals. Based on our mixed-methods analysis, we find that, instead of hoping to accomplish nonmarket goals through established market structures, entrepreneurs built a niche centered on the achievement of specific social goals. Our findings suggest that to understand the strategies supporting emergent socially oriented markets, researchers must explore the intersections of values, entrepreneurial motivations, and operational complexities.},

  abstract     = {Alliance research emphasizes that firms can access research and development (R&amp;D) collaboration opportunities when they enjoy relational or geographic embeddedness with potential partners. However, how can firms that are not embedded with prospective partners establish alliances? We emphasize the microfoundations of R&amp;D alliance formation and propose that scientist mobility is an important substitutive mechanism that helps foster collaboration opportunities between firms that are poorly embedded. Specifically, we posit and show that in high-tech industries, scientist mobility is more facilitative for R&amp;D alliance formation when potential partners lack relational ties between them or are not geographically colocated. Our findings demonstrate how incorporation of the competitive labor market context and its interplay with the cooperative context significantly changes the insights of a fundamental research stream emphasizing the importance of the cooperative context for alliance formation.},
