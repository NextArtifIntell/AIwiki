The resulting cohomology theory specializes to (and often refines) most known integral $p$-adic cohomology theories. As applications, we prove an improved version of the almost purity theorem allowing ramification along arbitrary closed subsets (without using adic spaces), give a co-ordinate free description of $q$-de Rham cohomology as conjectured by the second author, and settle a vanishing conjecture for the $p$-adic Tate twists $\mathbf {Z}_p(n)$ introduced in our previous joint work with Morrow.},

  abstract     = {We prove that the $E_8$ root lattice and the Leech lattice are universally optimal among point configurations in Euclidean spaces of dimensions eight and twenty-four, respectively. In other words, they minimize energy for every potential function that is a completely monotonic function of squared distance (for example, inverse power laws or Gaussians), which is a strong form of robustness not previously known for any configuration in more than one dimension. This theorem implies their recently shown optimality as sphere packings, and broadly generalizes it to allow for long-range interactions. The proof uses sharp linear programming bounds for energy. To construct the optimal auxiliary functions used to attain these bounds, we prove a new interpolation theorem, which is of independent interest. It reconstructs a radial Schwartz function $f$ from the values and radial derivatives of $f$ and its Fourier transform $\hat f$ at the radii $\sqrt{2n}$ for integers $n\ge 1$ in $\mathbb{R}^8$ and $n \ge 2$ in $\mathbb{R}^{24}$. To prove this theorem, we construct an interpolation basis using integral transforms of quasimodular forms, generalizing Viazovska’s work on sphere packing and placing it in the context of a more conceptual theory.

For example, if $\Gamma$ is a cocompact lattice in $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{R})$, $M$ is a compact manifold, and $\omega$ a volume form on $M$, we show that any homomorphism $\alpha : \Gamma \rightarrow \mathrm{Diff}(M)$ has finite image if the dimension of $M$ is less than $n-1$ and that any homomorphism $\alpha : \Gamma \rightarrow \mathrm{Diff}(M,\omega)$ has finite image if the dimension of $M$ is less than $n$. The key step in the proof is to show that any such action has uniform subexponential growth of derivatives. This is established using ideas from the smooth ergodic theory of higher-rank abelian groups, structure theory of semisimple groups, and results from homogeneous dynamics. Having established uniform subexponential growth of derivatives, we apply Lafforgue’s strong property \rm (T) to establish the existence of an invariant Riemannian metric.},

This paper is concerned with existence of smooth self-similar profiles for the barotropic Euler equations in dimension $d\ge 2$ with decaying density at spatial infinity. The phase portrait of the nonlinear ODE governing the equation for spherically symmetric self-similar solutions has been introduced in the pioneering work of Guderley. It allows us to construct global profiles of the self-similar problem, which however turn out to be generically non-smooth across the associated acoustic cone. In a suitable range of barotropic laws and for a sequence of quantized speeds accumulating to a critical value, we prove the existence of non-generic $\mathcal C^\infty $ self-similar solutions with suitable decay at infinity. The $\mathcal C^\infty $ regularity is used in a fundamental way in our companion paper (part II) in the analysis of the associated linearized operator and leads, in turn, to the construction of finite energy blow up solutions of the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations in dimensions $d=2,3$.},

We assume that the domain $\mathcal A$ between the invariant curve of $4$-periodic orbits and the boundary of the phase cylinder is foliated by $C^0$-invariant curves. Under this assumption we prove that the billiard curve is an ellipse. For the original Birkhoff-Poritsky formulation we show that if a neighborhood of the boundary of billiard domain has a $C^1$-smooth foliation by convex caustics of rotation numbers in the interval (0; 1/4], then the boundary curve is an ellipse. In the language of first integrals one can assert that if the billiard inside a centrally-symmetric $C^2$-smooth convex curve $\gamma $ admits a $C^1$-smooth first integral with non-vanishing gradient on $\mathcal A$, then the curve $\gamma $ is an ellipse. The main ingredients of the proof are (1) the non-standard generating function for convex billiards; (2) the remarkable structure of the invariant curve consisting of $4$-periodic orbits; and (3) the integral-geometry approach for rigidity results that was invented by the first named author for circular billiards.

  abstract     = {We establish convergence in norm and pointwise almost everywhere for the non-conventional (in the sense of Furstenberg) bilinear polynomial ergodic averages \[ A_N(f,g)(x) := \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} f(T^nx) g(T^{P(n)}x) $$\] as $N \to \infty $, where $T\colon X\to X$ is a measure-preserving transformation of a $\sigma $-finite measure space $(X,\mu )$, $P(\mathrm {n}) \in \mathbb Z[\mathrm {n}]$ is a polynomial of degree $d \geq 2$, and $f \in L^{p_1}(X), g \in L^{p_2}(X)$ for some $p_1,p_2 &gt; 1$ with $\frac {1}{p_1} + \frac {1}{p_2} \leq 1$. We also establish an $r$-variational inequality for these averages (at lacunary scales) in the optimal range $r &gt; 2$. We are also able to “break duality” by handling some ranges of exponents $p_1,p_2$ with $\frac {1}{p_1}+\frac {1}{p_2} &gt; 1$, at the cost of increasing $r$ slightly. This gives an affirmative answer to Problem 11 from Frantzikinakis’ open problems survey for the Furstenberg–Weiss averages (with $P(\mathrm {n})=\mathrm {n}^2$), which is a bilinear variant of Question 9 considered by Bergelson in his survey on Ergodic Ramsey Theory from 1996. This also gives a contribution to the Furstenberg–Bergelson–Leibman conjecture. Our methods combine techniques from harmonic analysis with the recent inverse theorems of Peluse and Prendiville in additive combinatorics. At large scales, the harmonic analysis of the adelic integers $\mathbb A_{\mathbb Z}$ also plays a role.},

  abstract     = {We give a construction that produces irreducible complex rigid local systems on $\mathbb {P}_{\mathbb {C}}^1-\{p_1,…,p_s\}$ via quantum Schubert calculus and strange duality. These local systems are unitary and arise from a study of vertices in the polytopes controlling the multiplicative eigenvalue problem for the special unitary groups $\operatorname {SU}(n)$ (i.e., determination of the possible eigenvalues of a product of unitary matrices given the eigenvalues of the matrices). Roughly speaking, we show that the strange duals of the simplest vertices of these polytopes give all possible unitary irreducible rigid local systems. As a consequence we obtain that the ranks of unitary irreducible rigid local systems, including those with finite global monodromy, on $\mathbb {P}^1-S$ are bounded above if we fix the cardinality of the set $S=\{p_1,…,p_s\}$ and require that the local monodromies have orders that divide $n$ for a fixed\nonbreakingspace $n$. Answering a question of N. Katz, we show that there are no irreducible rigid local systems of rank greater than one, with finite global monodromy, all of whose local monodromies have orders dividing $n$, when $n$ is a prime number. We also show that all unitary irreducible rigid local systems on $\mathbb {P}^1_{\mathbb {C}} -S$ with finite local monodromies arise as solutions to the Knizhnik-Zamalodchikov equations on conformal blocks for the special linear group. Along the way, generalizing previous works of the author and J. Kiers, we give an inductive mechanism for determining all vertices in the multiplicative eigenvalue problem for $\mathrm {SU}(n)$.},

This settles a conjecture of Greenlees. We also show an analog for homotopical real bordism rings over elementary abelian $2$-groups. Our results generalize classical theorems of Quillen (1969) on the connection between non-equivariant bordism rings and formal group laws, and extend the case $A=C_2$ due to Hanke–Wiemeler (2018). We work in the framework of global homotopy theory, which is essential for our proof. In addition to the statements for a fixed group $A$, we also prove a global algebraic universal property that characterizes the collection of all equivariant complex bordism rings simultaneously. We show that they form the universal contravariant functor from abelian compact Lie groups to commutative rings that is equipped with a coordinate; the coordinate is given by the universal Euler class at the circle group. More generally, the ring of $n$-fold cooperations of equivariant complex bordism is shown to be universal among functors equipped with a strict $n$-tuple of coordinates.},

The main difficulty in establishing sharp well-posedness results for general compressible Euler flow is due to the highly nontrivial interaction between the sound waves, governed by quasilinear wave equations, and vorticity which is transported by the flow. To overcome this difficulty, we separate the dispersive part of sound wave from the transported part, and gain regularity significantly by exploiting the nonlinear structure of the system and the geometric structures of the acoustical spacetime.},

Moreover, we prove that simplicial clusters are the unique isoperimetric minimizers (up to null-sets). In particular, the case $q=3$ confirms the Gaussian Double-Bubble Conjecture: the unique least Gaussian-weighted perimeter way to decompose $\mathbb {R}^n$ ($n \geq 2$) into three cells of prescribed (positive) Gaussian measure is to use a tripod-cluster, whose interfaces consist of three half-hyperplanes meeting along an $(n-2)$-dimensional plane at $120^{\circ }$ angles (forming a tripod or “Y” shape in the plane). The case $q=2$ recovers the classical Gaussian isoperimetric inequality. To establish the Multi-Bubble conjecture, we show that in the above range of $q$, stable regular clusters must have flat interfaces, therefore consisting of convex polyhedral cells (with at most $q-1$ facets). In the double-bubble case $q=3$, it is possible to avoid establishing flatness of the interfaces by invoking a certain dichotomy on the structure of stable clusters, yielding a simplified argument.},
