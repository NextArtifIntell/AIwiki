  abstract     = {The aim of this paper is to introduce a Frank operator in the q-rung orthopair triangular fuzzy linguistic environment on the basis of the notion of the Frank operator and the q-rung orthopair fuzzy set. Firstly, the concept of a q-rung orthopair triangular fuzzy linguistic set (q-ROTrFLS) is propo sed, then several basic operations, score, and accuracy functions to compare the q-ROTrFLS values are defined. Secondly, a series of q-rung orthopair triangular fuzzy linguistic Frank aggregation operators are developed, such as q-rung orthopair triangular fuzzy linguistic Frank weighted average (q-ROTrFLWA)operator,q-rung orthopair triangular fuzzy linguistic Frank weighted geometric (q-ROTrFLWG) operator, and we introduce several relevant properties of these operators and prove their validity, and show the relevant relationship between some operators. Thirdly, two different decision-making approaches are constructed in the q-rung orthopair triangular fuzzy linguistic environment. Furthermore, a practical example is given to explain the developed methods. Finally, a comparative study is conducted, and the relevant sensitivity analysis is also discussed, and the outcome shows the prominence and the effectiveness of the developed methods compared to previous studies.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the classification of power quality disturbances using combined ST/MST (S-Transform/Modified S-Transform) and Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) is proposed. The extraction of significant features from the power quality disturbance signals is one of the challenging tasks in recognizing different disturbances. The Stockwell Transform/Modified Stockwell Transform (ST/MST) based features are distinct, understandable and more immune to noise. The important attributes present in the signals are retrieved from the ST/MST contours, MST 3D plots and MST based statistical curves. The relevant features are also extracted from the statistical curves. The extracted features are given as input to the RBFNN for further classification. This method is evaluated under both noisy and noiseless conditions. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with other conventional approaches in the literature. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MST based RFNN technique is more effective for the detection and classification of power quality disturbances.},

Since both problems directly affect the cost of distributions of the products and supply chain, the decision of location and routing is important for the s uccess of companies. Therefore, many attempts are made to solve LRP problem in the literature. Researchers proposed exact and heuristic methods for LRP. However, exact methods cannot provide solutions for considerably large instances. In this paper, a new heuristic method is proposed for continuous or planar LRP. The proposed method contains fuzzy c-means for continuous location problem and simulated annealing algorithm for vehicle routing problem, respectively. The proposed method is applied to both capacitated and uncapacitated LRP instances that are widely used in the literature. Results of the proposed method are compared with successful researches that are made on this problem in terms of the total cost.},

  abstract     = {At present, with the continuous changes in the market situation and the continuous improvement of the supply chain network structure, the competition in all walks of life has become more and more intense, which has risen from simple enterprise competition to competition in the entire supply chain. In the construction industry, the structure of the construction supply chain is more complex and diverse, and it is more necessary to select high-quality suppliers for sincere cooperation. This requires construction companies to establish a complete supply chain management system, select high-quality suppliers to achieve win-win cooperation and improve their competitiveness. Therefore, construction enterprises need to comprehensively consider various factors, build a reasonable and feasible evaluation index system according to their own demand for materials, and use appropriate evaluation methods to select material suppliers with specific advantages, so as to ensure the entire construction supply chain of the project. of smooth operation. In this paper, we introduced some calculating laws on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFSs), Hamacher sum and Hamacher product and further propose the induced interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy Hamacher ordered weighted average (I-IVIFHOWA) operator. Meanwhile, we also study some ideal properties of built operator. Then, we apply the I-IVIFHOWA operator to deal with the multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problems under IVIFSs. Finally, an example for selecting the building material suppliers is used to test this new approach.},

The proposed method is Heuristic RNN-based Kalman Filter for Fetal Electrocardiogram Extraction (HRKFFEE) which is based on redundant noise and signal patterns in the residual signal of FECG and MECG. Two functional blocks are used in the proposed method. The first functional block is based on Heuristic RNN equipped with legacy Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for assembling a knowledgebase and the second functional block is RNN-based Kalman filter. Upon testing, the proposed method delivers better average values of accuracy, F Score, Precision and Specificity as 93.118%, 93.106%, 92.9495 % and 92.98% respectively.},

  abstract     = {In the hot strip rolling process, accurate prediction of bending force is beneficial to improve the accuracy of strip crown and flatness, and further improve the strip shape quality. Due to outliers and noise are commonly present in the data generated in the rolling process, not only the prediction accuracy should be considered, but also the uncertainty of prediction results should be described quantitatively. Therefore, for the first time, the authors establish an interval prediction model for bending force in hot strip rolling process. In this paper, we use Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and whale optimization algorithm (WOA) to produce a prediction interval model (WOA-ANN) for bending force in hot strip rolling. Based on the point prediction by ANN, interval prediction is completed by using lower upper bound estimation (LUBE) and WOA, and three indexes are used to evaluate the performance of the model. This paper uses real world data from steel factory to determine the optimal network structure and parameters of the interval prediction model. Furthermore, the proposed WOA-ANN model is compared with other interval prediction models established by other three optimization algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed WOA-ANN model has high reliability and narrow interval width, and can well complete the interval prediction of bending force in hot strip rolling. This study provides a more detailed and rigorous basis for setting bending force in hot strip rolling process.},

  abstract     = {Waypoints have enhanced the prospect of fully autonomous drone applications. However, Geographical Position System (GPS) spoofing and signal interferences are key issues in waypoint-based drone applications. Also, conceptual waypoint-based drone applications require accurate awareness of waypoints based on environmental cues and integration of additional sensing modalities. Additional sensor modalities may overwhelm drones’ processing resources, reducing operational time. This study proposes W-MobileNet, a denoising model for autonomous trajectory trail navigation based on precision control of a path planner, denoising capabilities of Weiner filters, and perceptual knowledge of convolutional neural networks. Creatively integrating the modules of W-MobileNet results in an intuitive drone navigation controller characterized by position, orientation, and speed estimation. Further, a generic loss function that significantly aids models to converge faster during training is proposed based on adaptive weights. An extensive evaluation of a simulated and real-world experiment shows that W-MobileNet is more favorable in precision and robustness than contemporary state-of-the-art models. W-MobileNet has the potential to become one of the standards for autonomous drone applications.},

Finally, a case study concerning investment project selection is given to demonstrate the merits of the developed methods. This combined method can be used for the automatic areal feature matching, medical quality assessment, and ranking of matching processes. There are very few papers about using TODIM method under DPLTS situation at present, so this is a new perspective on MAGDM.

A set of metrics, thresholds and labels constitutes a code smells detection rule. The generated rules must be optimized efficiently to ensure successful rule selection. The objective is to identi fy how rules are generated from the labeled data set and selected using bio-inspired algorithms. The goals are met by employing the C4.5 and RIPPER algorithms to generate rules then, optimized using two bio-inspired algorithms, the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) and Cockroach Swarm Optimization (CSO). The optimized sets of rules are evaluated using the similarity metrics which are computed with the help of expected and the detected code smells. The common rule subsets from SSA and CSO are merged to produce the optimal rule subset which can be used for code smell detection. The proposed work has been experimented on Xerces-J, Log4J, Gantt Project and JFreeChart dataset. The work detected code smells with an accuracy of 91.7% for Xerces-J, 96.7% for JFreeChart, 88.6% for Gantt Project and 98% for Log4J. The findings will be useful for both theory and research since the proposed framework allows focusing on rule selection.},

  abstract     = {The required division and exponentiation operations needed per iteration for the possibilistic c-means (PCM) clustering algorithm complicate its implementation, especially on homomorphically-encrypted data. This paper presents a novel efficient soft clustering algorithm based on the possibilistic p aradigm, termed SPCM. It aims at easing future applications of PCM to encrypted data. It reduces the required exponentiation and division operations at each iteration by restricting the membership values to an ordered set of discrete values in [0,1], resulting in a better performance in terms of runtime and several other performance indices. At each iteration, distances to the new clusters’ centers are determined, then the distances are compared to the initially computed and dynamically updated range of values, that divide the entire range of distances associated with each cluster center into intervals (bins), to assign appropriate soft memberships to objects. The required number of comparisons is O(log the number of discretization levels). Thus, the computation of centers and memberships is greatly simplified during execution. Also, the use of discrete values for memberships allows soft modification (increment or decrement) of the soft memberships of identified outliers and core objects instead of rough modification (setting to zero or one) in related algorithms. Experimental results on synthetic and standard test data sets verified the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The average percent of the achieved reduction in runtime is 35% and the average percent of the achieved increase in v-measure, adjusted mutual information, and adjusted rand index is 6% on five datasets compared to PCM. The larger the dataset, the higher the reduction in runtime. Also, SPCM achieved a comparable performance with less computational complexity compared to variants of related algorithms.},

The physical health evaluation of College students is frequently viewed as the multiple attribute decision making (MADM) issue. In our article, we combine the geometric Heronian mean (GHM) operator, generalized weighted Heronian mean (GWHM) operator with 2-tuple linguistic neutrosophic numbers (2TLNNs) to propose the generalized 2-tuple linguistic neutrosophic geometric HM (G2TLNGHM) operator and generalized 2-tuple linguistic neutrosophic weighted geometric HM (G2TLNWGHM) operator. Meanwhile, some ideal properties of built operator are studied. Then, the G2TLNWGHM operator is applied to deal with the MADM problems under 2TLNNs. Finally, an example for Physical health evaluation of College students is used to show the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {In this research, UPQC (Unified Power Quality Conditioner) with optimized hybrid fuzzy controller based GBSSA (Gaussian Barebone Salp Swarm Algorithm) with EPLL (Enhanced Phase Locked Loop) have been proposed for power quality enhancement in power distribution networks. Using the proposed method, t he difficulties in major of the power distribution system networks can be solved, related to power quality issues. GBSSA has been employed in this research, to improve solution accuracy and optimization efficiency. Given that, it is permissible to add some extra time cost to acquire a better solution, based on the Non-Free Lunch (NFL) theory, and that the time consumption of function evaluation is rather large, when addressing actual optimization problems, the extra time consumption can be overlooked to some extent. The EPLL control method improves the standard PLL, by reducing its fundamental flaw, which is the occurrence of main frequency errors, as well as double frequency errors. It controls the DC-bus voltage of unified power quality conditioners, during supply voltage and load voltage turbulences. The proposed UPQC control technique has been found to be resilient, to a variety of source and load perturbations, including unbalanced, transient distorted supply, voltage sag, unbalanced load and voltage swell. The proposed optimized GBSSA hybrid fuzzy controller with EPLL has been proven to be more effective in reducing the THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) to 3.22%. Moreover, comparative analysis with a conventional TSF-PLL has been performed with that of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controller and implemented using MATLAB (MATrix Laboratory).},

  abstract     = {One of the fastest-growing fields in today’s world is data analytics. Data analytics paved the way for a significant number of research and development in various fields including medicine and vaccine development, DNA analysis, artificial intelligence and many more. Data plays a very important role in providing the required results and helps in making critical decisions and predictions. However, ethical and legislative restrictions sometimes make it difficult for scientists to acquire data. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, data was very limited due to privacy and regulatory issues. To address data unavailability, data scientists usually leverage machine learning algorithms such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to augment data from existing samples. Today, there are over 450 algorithms that are designed to re-generate or augment data in case of unavailability of the data. With many algorithms in the market, it is practically impossible to predict which algorithm best fits the problem in question, unless many algorithms are tested. In this study, we select the most common types of GAN algorithms available for image augmentation to generate samples capable of representing a whole data distribution. To test the selected models, we used two unique datasets, namely COVID-19 CT images and COVID-19 X-Ray images. Five different GAN algorithms, namely CGAN, DCGAN, f-GAN, WGAN, and CycleGAN, were selected and applied to the samples to see how each algorithm reacts to the samples. To evaluate their performances, Visual Turing Test (VTT) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) were used. The VTT result shows that a human expert can accurately distinguish between different samples that were produced. Hence, CycleGAN scored 80% in CT image dataset and 77% in X-Ray image dataset. In contrast, the FID result revealed that CycleGAN had a high convergence and therefore generated high quality and clearer images on both datasets compared to CGAN, DCGAN, f-GAN, and WGAN. This study concluded that the CycleGAN model is the best when it comes to image augmentation due to its friendliness and high convergence.},

  abstract     = {Energy or load disaggregation, as one essential part of non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), is an efficient way to separate the consumption information of target appliances from the whole consumption data, and can accordingly help to regulate people’s energy consumption behaviors. However, the co nsumptions of the target appliances are usually affected by the variance of the opening time, working condition and user interference, so it is a difficult task to realize precise disaggregation. To further improve the energy disaggregation accuracy, this paper proposes a new parallel disaggregation strategy with two subnets for the energy consumption disaggregation of the target appliances in the residential buildings. In the proposed strategy, the parallel disaggregation network contains a long-term disaggregation network and a short-term disaggregation network, which can automatically and respectively learn the long-term trend features and short-term dynamic characteristics of the electrical appliances. This parallel structure can make full use of the advantages of different methods in feature extraction, so as to model the appliance features more comprehensively. To better extract the long-term and short-term features, in the long-term disaggregation subnet, we propose the double branch bi-directional temporal convolution network (DBB-TCN) which has a wider receptive field than the traditional temporal convolution networks (TCN), while in the short-term disaggregation subnet, we adopt the convolution auto-encoder to learn the short-term characteristics of the target appliances. Finally, detailed experiments and comparisons are made with two real-world datasets. Experimental results verified that the proposed parallel disaggregation method performs better than the existing methods under various evaluation criteria.},

In this paper, a hybrid technique is developed, which combines Black Widow Optimization (BWO) with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). To trai n the data set and provide a control signal for the converter, an RNN is used. After fitting the training data sets, the suggested method achieved maximum power by utilizing BWO based on the control parameters. This proposed method minimizes the difference between actual and average power. Using an optimization technique, the main goal of this proposed strategy is to obtain peak power harvest under various conditions, including partial shading, while minimizing error function, With the help of MATLAB/Simulink software, the conclusions are revealed under various partial shading conditions. For each category, the observed results are evaluated at various time intervals. The proposed method is also compared to other techniques such as the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)-RNN system, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-RNN system, and Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA)-RNN system. The proposed system is 36.11% faster than GSA with RNN, 39.47% faster than PSO, and 42.5% faster than ACO with RNN in terms of tracking speed. Significantly, the proposed work is 0.87% more efficient than the other models in terms of obtaining maximum power. In terms of obtaining maximum power, the proposed work BWOA-RNN is more effective than other methods.},

  abstract     = {Big Data is a popular research area where a vast amount of data is created, replicated, and consumed by society. The quality of the data used directly influences big data knowledge discovery. The existence of noise is the most prevalent problem influencing data quality. The following techniques wer e developed to reduce noise in data with a distributed setting: Homogenous Ensemble for Big Data (HME-BD) and Heterogeneous Ensemble for Big Data (HTE-BD). In this article, the performance of HTE-BD is improved further by developing Enhanced HTE-BD (EHTE-BD), which combines Logistic Regression based Support Vector Machine (LR-SVM) in conjunction with RF, LR, and KNN to reduce noisy data. Furthermore, the Multi-Objective Evolutionary Fuzzy Method for Subgroup Discovery throughout Big Data (MEFASD-BD) was used to resolve the multi-objective optimization challenge, and the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) was utilized to handle the rising dimensionality issue through subgroup discovery. To address the NSGA-II’s slow convergence rate, an Improved Multi-Objective Meta-Heuristic Fuzzy approach for discovering subgroups in big data is described, that contains a meta-heuristic method for subgroup discovery known as the Multi-Objective Differential Search Algorithm (MODSA). It selects the most relevant subgroups from vast amounts of data, reducing the data’s dimensionality. The Fuzzy Deep Neural Network (FDNN) classifier assesses the main subgroups. By removing noisy data and selecting the most relevant subgroups, the performance of FDNN in classifying vast amounts of data is improved.},

Social media fake image posting influence is increasing day by day regarding the natural disasters. A natural disaster can result in the death or destruction of property, as well as economic damage, the severity of which is determined by the resilience of the affected population and the infrastructure available. Many researchers applied different machine learning approaches to detect and classification of natural disaster types, but these algorithms fail to identify fake labelling occurs on disaster events images. Furthermore, when many natural disaster events occur at a time then these systems couldn’t handle the classification process and fake labelling of images. Therefore, to tackle this problem I have proposed a FLIDND-MCN: Fake Label Image Detection of Natural Disaster types with Multi Model Convolutional Neural Network for multi-phormic natural disastrous events. The main purpose of this model is to provide accurate information regarding the multi-phormic natural disastrous events for emergency response decision making for a particular disaster. The proposed approach consists of multi models’ convolutional neural network (MMCNN) architecture. The dataset used for this purpose is publicly available and consists of 4,428 images of different natural disaster events. The evaluation of proposed model is measured in the terms of different statistical values such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, and f1-score. The proposed model shows the accuracy value of 0.93 percent for fake label disastrous images detection which is higher as compared to the already proposed state-of-the-art models.},

If the faulted plate detection can be done manually, then it leads to errors and a time-consuming process. Hence, a computerized automated system is necessary to detect the abnormalities. In this paper, a novel Adaptive Faster Region Convolutional Neural Networks (AFRCNN) scheme has been proposed for automatic fault detection of stainless-steel plates. The proposed AFRCNN scheme comprises three phases: identification, detection, and recognition. Primarily, the damaged plates are identified using Region Proposal Network and Fully Convolutional Neural Network functioning as a combined process under AFRCNN. In the next phase, the number corresponding to the particular plate is recognized through the standard Automated Plate Number Recognition approach with the support of the character recognition technique. The simulation results manifest that the proposed AFRCNN scheme obtains a superior classification accuracy of 99.36%, specificity of 99.24%, and F1-score of 98.18% as compared with the existing state-of-the-art schemes.},

The product data generation process is a prerequisite for the application of the ANN algorithm. In the development of new products, the Kansei Engineering (KE) method is an effect ive emotion-based data generation method. The Semantic Difference (SD) method is usually used to obtain data to apply to design idea generation. Facing the data demand of product creativity, it is important to establish the relationship between consumer perception and product expression. Numerical relationships are not linear and several methods are required for solving these problems. The method of the Back Propagation (BP) neural network is simple and effective to be used in this case. This paper proposes an innovative data modeling method using digital coding and KE. This model explores a rational design method of perceptual intention and builds an intelligent model. Compared with traditional method, the modified model can quickly and accurately reflect the users’ perceptual needs, make the design more scientific, improve the design efficiency, and reduce design costs. This method is used in the design of electric welding machines, and this process can effectively provide technical support for NPD process in small and medium-sized enterprises.},

  abstract     = {The Pile movement is one of the most crucial matters in designing piles and foundations that need to be estimated for any project failure. Over the variables used in forecasting Pile Settlement, many methods have been introduced to appraise it. However, existing a wide range of theoretical strategi es to investigate the pile subsidence, the soil-pile interactions are still ambiguous for academic researchers. Most studies have tried to work out the subsidence rate in piles after loading passing time by artificial intelligence methods. Generally, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has drawn attention to show the actual views of pile settlement over the loading phase vertically. This research aims to present the Hybrid Radial Basis Function neural network integrated with the Novel Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm and Biogeography-Based Optimization to calculate the optimal number of neurons embedded in hidden layers. The transportation network of Klang Valley, Mass Rapid Transit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, was chosen to analyze the piles’ settlement and earth features using HRBF-AOA and HRBF-BBO scenarios. Over the prediction process, the R-values of HRBF-AOA and HRBF-BBO were obtained at 0.9825 and 0.9724, respectively. The MAE also shows a similar trend as 0.2837 and 0.323, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Learning relationships between nodes in a directed graph is a task that has been widely studied and it has been applied to a large number of topics and research areas. We establish a definition of particular kind of relationship, called analogy in a directed multigraph. An analogy can be defined fo r a certain pair of concepts, and the paths connecting them are called explanation of this analogy. We experiment with a structure built from real oneiric stories obtained from psychoanalytic descriptions (e.g. mother is represented as a bull; book represents power). Analogies found by the analysts are automatically identified by means of linguistically motivated patterns. Analogies have degrees of similarity based on the words used to describe them: represents, is a, is like a, can be a, refers to, etc. Once they are identified and graded, they are represented in the multidigraph, allowing us to provide different hypotheses in how these analogies can be explained. In order to enrich the concept graph, we added information from ConceptNet and WordNet. In addition, we propose a learning method for association rules that, given the degree of the analogy and a starting concept, allow reaching a destination concept. For example, starting from “dream”, we obtain the path &lt;dream, psychic, neurosis, symptom&gt;, being &quot;dream is a symptom&quot; a description previously given by a psychoanalyst, that was not included when training the algorithm. We evaluated 100 analogies on 171 concepts with 8,034 properties using Leave One Out cross validation, and found that the correct analogy was found within the all the possible paths for 94% of the analogies, restricted to 85% if only the top 20% possible paths are considered. This implies that, by using our method, it is possible to learn analogies between two concepts by reconstructing paths of different lengths based on local decisions considering concept, property and degree of analogy.},

  abstract     = {Sentiment analysis is a task that belongs to natural language processing and it is highly used in texts extracted from social networks. This task consists of assigning the labels or classes: positive, negative or neutral to the text. However, analyzing a piece of text extracted from social networks to determine if it represents a positive or negative sentiment is a difficult task, because social media texts contain slangs, typographical errors and cultural context. The shortcomings of traditional frequency based feature extraction models such as bag of words or TF-IDF affect the accuracy of sentiment classification. To improve the precision in the sentiment classification task, it is possible to use natural language modelling methods that are able to learn contextual information from words. In this work, word embedding such as Word2Vec, GloVe and Doc2VecC with different dimensions are used. The resulting word vectors will be used to train recurring neural networks such as LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU and BiGRU, to improve sentiment classification.},

In this paper, we provide a possible theoretical answer to this question: namely, we show that of all families with the smallest possible number of parameters, families corresponding to neurons are indeed optimal – for all optimality criteria that satisfy some reasonable requirements: namely, for all optimality criteria which are final and invariant with respect to coordinate changes, changes of measuring units, and similar linear transformations.},

We show that the Pearson correlation of financial time series could be misleading in analyzing their co-mo vements. We propose representing the co-movement of exchange rates as a non-directed graph using the measure of local trends associations (LTA). Each node in the graph represents a currency, and an edge between nodes represents an existing high association between currencies. We present several methods for network summary visualization showing the highest associations between nodes. One method allows comparing graphs corresponding to different correlation and association measures. Another one is appropriate for comparing graphs using the same association measure. We present a dynamic analysis of association networks and the network of associations with a selected currency named a “node of interest.” We show that the currency networks based on LTA are better explainable than networks based on Pearson correlation. LTA based relationships between currencies better reflect geographical, economic or political relationships between corresponding countries.},

Firstly, the hesitancy degree of probabilistic hesitant fuzzy element and the improved difference measure of probabilistic hesitant fuzzy element are defined, and an improved probabilistic hesitant fuzzy distance measure based on hesitancy degree, incompleteness degree and improved difference measure is proposed. Secondly, based on the improved distance measure, a mathematical programming model with the goal of minimizing the relative approach degree is con-structed to determine the attribute weights of evaluation indexes in multi-attribute decision making problems. Using it as a base, a new probabilistic hesitant fuzzy multi-attribute decision-making method is proposed by combining the improved probabilistic hesitant fuzzy distance measure with the compromise ratio method. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the problem of green supplier selection, and the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by case analysis and comparison with other methods.},

  abstract     = {To address data distribution discrepancy across scenarios, deep transfer learning is used to help the target scenario complete the recognition task using similar scenario data. However, fault misrecognition or low diagnostic accuracy occurs due to the weak expression of the deep transfer model in c ross-scenario application. The Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) can independently learn the importance of each channel and space features, recalibrate the channel and space features, and improve image classification performance. This study introduces the CBAM module using the Residual Network (ResNet), and proposes a transfer learning model that combines the CBAM module with an improved ResNet, denoted as TL_CBAM_ResNet17. A miniature ResNet17 deep model is constructed based on the ResNet50 model. The location of the CBAM module embedded in the ResNet17 model is determined to strengthen model expression. For effective cross-scenario transfer and reduced data distribution discrepancy between source and target domains, a multi-kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MK–MMD) layer is added in front of the classifier layer in the ResNet17 model to select data with common domain features. Considering a reciprocating compressor as the research object, cross-scenario datasets are produced by the vibration signals from the simulation test bench and simulation signals from the dynamic simulation model. Mutual transfer experiments are conducted using these datasets. The proposed method (TL_CBAM_ResNet17) demonstrates better classification performance than TCA, JDA, the TL_ResNet50 model, the TL_ResNet17 model, and the TL_ResNet17 model integrated with other attention mechanism module, and greatly improves the accuracy of fault diagnosis and generalization of the model in cross-scenario applications.},

  abstract     = {The use of recycled glass in the concrete mix instead of natural coarse aggregates and supplemental cementitious material has several advantages, including the conservation of natural resources, the reduction of CO2 emissions, and cost savings. However, due to their qualities, the mechanical proper ties of concrete containing Ground Glass Particles (GGP) differ from those of natural aggregates concrete. As a result, assessing the compressive strength (CS) of concrete with GGP is crucial. Therefore, this paper proposes the hybrid Machine Learning (ML) model including the Gradient Boosting (GB) and Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithms for predicting the compressive strength of concrete containing GGP. The hybrid ML model is developed and validated based on the training dataset (70% of the data) and the test dataset (30% of the remaining data), respectively. The performance of hybrid ML model is evaluated by three criteria, such as the Pearson correlation coefficient (R), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The K-Fold Cross-Validation technique is also used to verify the reliability of the hybrid ML model). The best performance of the hybrid ML model is determined with the R = 0.9843, RMSE = 1.7256 (MPa), and MAE = 1.3154 (MPa) for training dataset and R = 0.9784, RMSE = 2.4338 (MPa) and MAE = 1.9618 (MPa) for testing dataset. Based on the best hybrid ML model, the sensitivity analysis including SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) and Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) 2D are investigated to obtain an in-depth examination of each individual input variable on the predicted compressive strength of concrete contaning GGP. The sensitivity analysis shows that four factors, such as curing age, surface area, TiO2, and temperature have the most effect on the compressive strength of concrete containing GGP.},

The proposed Grey Wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm is incorporated in the prototype model and compared with other related optimization algorithms namely Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The various loading conditions as well as solar irradiances are modeled by using MATLAB simulation and experimentally validated by a DSPIC (DS 1104) based prototype model. A three phase PV grid connected non-linear load is observed in different operating environmental conditions. The optimization control algorithms was developed and implemented in Super-Lift Inverter (SLI) grid connected system. The findings of this work are, grid reactive power demand is compensated using DSTATCOM, and also from the real power of renewable energy system. But, majority of the active power is provided or absorbed by DSTATCOM component. The objective of this proposed work is that the three optimization control algorithms are examined, and the PV integrated grid tied system maintains a compensation power at Unity Power Factor (UPF). The proposed optimization methods produce load output power factor values such as 0.89 (GWO), 0.88, (PSO) and 0.86 (GA).},

Regarding the short-term trends of electricity consumption in China, this study established an optimized multivariate grey forecasting model with variable background values (OGM(1, N) model) to forecast the electricity consumption level in China. The established model could be converted into the GM(1, N) model and different variant models by adjusting the model parameters.

  abstract     = {Unsound wheat kernel recognition is an important part of wheat quality inspection, and it is also a key indicator to measure wheat quality. Research on unsound wheat kernel recognition is of great significance to the correct evaluation of wheat quality. The existing researches on unsound wheat ker nel recognition are mainly to directly optimize the classical classification networks, and the recognition effect is often unsatisfactory due to insufficient training data. Aiming at the problem that the recognition rate of unsound wheat kernels is not ideal due to the lack of training data, we propose a Transfer Learning Feature Fusion (TLFF) model. The model uses transfer learning and feature fusion to identify unsound wheat kernels. First, feature extraction is performed by deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) VGG-16 and VGG-19 pre-trained on the large public dataset ImageNet. Then, the features extracted by the pre-trained neural networks are fused and classified through the flattening layer, fully connected layer, Dropout layer, and Softmax layer. We conduct experiments on single model, two-model fusion, three-model fusion, and four-model fusion, and select the three-model fusion scheme to perform this task. Finally, we vote on the output results of the three best fusion models to further improve the recognition rate. The pre-trained models we use are trained on a large public dataset ImageNet. Since the scale of the dataset is very large, these pre-trained models also have good generalization performance for images other than ImageNet dataset. Therefore, although our dataset is small, we can still achieve good recognition results. Experimental results show that the recognition performance of the TLFF model is significantly better than the existing unsound wheat kernel recognition models.},

T he preference relations represented by LTWHs are an effective tool to model linguistic information. The concept and properties of additive consistency have been proposed before. This paper aims to study the multiplicative consistency of preference relations expressed by LWTHs. This paper constructs the principle of inspection for multiplicative consistency. Especially, the theories and algorithms for consistency checking and improving are proposed. We develop an automatic approach to improve a LWHPR that is not multiplicatively consistent.

And the target detection network acts as the second discriminator of GAN during training. Through the content loss function and dual discriminator, directly controllable guidance is provided for the generator, which is designed to learn the relationship between different modes adaptively through cross fusion. We conduct abundant experiments on the KITTI dataset, which is the prevalent dataset in the fusion-detection field. The experimental results show that the AP of the novel method for vehicle detection achieves 96.66%, 87.15%, and 78.46% in easy, moderate, and hard categories respectively, which is improved about 7% compared to the state-of-art methods.},

Recently, convolution neural networks (CNNs) have witnessed a great research progress, however CNNs do not excel at dealing with geometrically transformed images. Existing me thods enhancing the ability of CNNs learning invariant feature representation rely partly on data augmentation or have a relatively weak generalization ability. This paper proposes orientation adaptive kernels (OA kernels) and orientation adaptive max pooling (OA max pooling) that comprise a new topological structure, orientation adaptive neural networks (OACNNs). OA kernels output the orientation feature maps which encode the orientation information of images. OA max pooling max-pools the orientation feature maps by automatically rotating the pooling windows according to their orientation. OA kernels and OA max pooling together allow for the eight orientation response of images to be computed, and then the max orientation response is obtained, which is proved to be a robust rotation invariant feature representation. OACNNs are compared with state-of-the-art methods and consistently outperform them in various experiments. OACNNs demonstrate a better generalization ability, yielding a test error rate 3.14 on the rotated images but only trained on “up-right” images, which outperforms all state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.},

  abstract     = {The number of scientific papers has been increasing ever more rapidly. Researchers have to spend a lot of time classifying papers relevant to their study, especially into fine-grained subfields. However, almost all existing paper classification models are coarse-grained, which can not meet the need s of researchers. Observing this, we propose a lightweight fine-grained classification model for scientific paper. Dynamic weighting coefficients on feature words are incorporated into the model to improve the classification accuracy. The feature word weight is optimized by the Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) algorithm. Considering applicability, the lightweight processing is conducted through algorithm pruning and training sample pruning. Comparison with mainstream models shows simultaneous improvement in accuracy and time efficiency by our model.},

  abstract     = {Recently, some improvement has been made in the dominant notion of fuzzy set that is Yager investigated the generalized concept of fuzzy set, Intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) and Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) and called it q-rung orthopair fuzzy (q-ROF) set (q-ROFS). The aim of this manuscript is to pr esent the concept of q-ROF soft (q-ROFSt) set (q-ROFStS) based on the Dombi operations. Since Dombi operational parameter possess natural flexibility with the resilience of variability. Some new operational laws are defined based on hybrid study of soft sets and q-ROFS. The advantage of Dombi operational parameter is very important to express the experts’ attitude in decision making. In this paper, we present q-ROFSt Dombi average (q-ROFSt DA) aggregation operators including q-ROFSt Dombi weighted average (q-ROFSt DWA), q-ROFSt Dombi ordered weighted average (q-ROFSt DOWA) and q-ROFSt Dombi hybrid average (q-ROFSt DHA) operators. Moreover, we investigate q-ROFSt Dombi geometric (q-ROFSt DG) aggregation operators including q-ROFSt Dombi weighted geometric (q-ROFSt DWG), q-ROFSt Dombi ordered weighted geometric (q-ROFSt DOWG), and q-ROFSt Dombi hybrid geometric (q-ROFSt DHG) operators. The basic properties of these operators are presented with detail such us Idempotency, Boundedness, Monotonicity, Shift invariance, and Homogeneity. Thus from the analysis and advantages of proposed model, it is clear that the investigated q-ROFSt DWA operator is the generalized form of IF St DWA, PFSt DWA and q-ROFDWA operators. Similarly, the investigated q-ROFSt DWG operator is the generalized form of IF St DWG, PFSt DWG and q-ROFDWG operators. By applying the develop approach, this manuscript contains the technique and algorithm for multicriteria decision making (MCDM). Further a numerical example is developed to illustrate the flexibility and applicability of the developed operators.},

The lack of diversity and category recognition information in the neural network input may affect the performance of the network, resu lting in insufficient extraction of facial expression features. In order to address the above problems, a lightweight deep convolution neural network with convolution block attention module is proposed in this paper. The implementation of the lightweight DNN relies on the use of deep separable convolution and residual blocks. The combination of the convolution block attention module and the improved classification function can optimize the lightweight model. We use accuracy and confusion matrix to evaluate different models, ultimately achieving 71.5% and 99.5% accuracy on the Fer2013 and CK+ datasets respectively. The experimental results show that our model has good feature representation capabilities.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid industrialization and urbanization worldwide, air quality levels are deteriorating at an unprecedented rate and posing a substantial threat to humans and the environment. This brings the concern to effectively monitor and forecast air quality levels in real-time. Conventional air qua lity monitoring stations are built based on centralized architectures involving high latency, communication technologies demanding high power, sensors involving high costs and decision making with moderate accuracy. To address the limitations of the existing systems, we propose a smart and distinct Air Quality Monitoring and Forecasting system embracing Fog Computing with IoT and Deep Learning (DL). The system is a three-layered architecture with the Sensing layer first, Fog Computing layer in between, and Cloud Computing layer at the end. Fog Computing is a powerful new generation paradigm that brings storage, computation, and networking at the edge of the IoT network and reduce network latency. A DL based BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) model is deployed in the Fog Computing layer. The proposed system aims at real-time monitoring and accurate air quality forecasting to support decision making and aid timely prevention and control of pollutant emissions by alerting the stakeholders when a dangerous Air Quality Index (AQI) is expected. Experimental results show that the BiLSTM model has a better predictive performance considering the meteorological parameters than the baseline models in terms of MAE and RMSE. A proof of concept realizing the proposed system is elaborated in the paper.},

  abstract     = {Biological wastewater treatment with the use of algae-bacteria consortia for the uptake of nutrient and recovery of resource is considered as the ‘paradigm shift’ from the process of mainstream wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) so as to mitigate the pollution and thus promoting the circular econo my. In this regard, the application of machine learning algorithms (MLAs) was found to be effectual and beneficial for the prediction of uncertain performances in the process of treatment and it shows a satisfactory result for the effective optimization, monitoring, uncertainty prediction and so on in the environment systems. The proposed approach aims at modelling the treatment of wastewater, growth of micro algae and flocculation harvesting at the photobioreactor (PBR) along with the utilization of machine learning techniques. Initially, the raw data from the PBR was taken and is pre-processed using z-score normalization technique followed by extraction and selection of features that are more appropriate. The Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model is built along with the modified Fuzzy C-Means algorithm (MFCM) so as to cluster the huge amount of data. ANFIS is employed for the estimation of controller output parameters and for controlling the temperature inside the reactor. The output controller parameter performance can be enhanced by the use of optimization approach. The discrete Multilayer perceptron (DMLP) with the hyper tuning parameters of Iterative Levi’s Flight Dependent Cuckoo search optimization algorithm (ILF-CSO) is employed for the prediction purpose of attained cultivation growth rate and the pH of treated wastewater. The optimization technique based on machine learning model in turn offers the best possible solution needed for the estimation of output parameters. Thus, the removal rate of effluent T-N concentrations from the wastewater treatment is predicted with some intervals of day. At last, the performance is estimated in terms of growth rate, temperature variations, biomass, nitrate and phosphate concentrations, and error rates (RMSE, APE), and determination coefficient (R2). The attained outcome shows that the presented model is effectual and has the potential to apply for controlling and predicting the biological wastewater treatment plants.},

Many countries compete with each other to develop better UAV technology or improve the technical features of UAVs. Therefore, it is critical to determine which UAV has the best performance, considering technical and operational characteristics, because the vehicles with more advanced performance can provide countries with strategic superiority. The purpose of this study is to investigate the technical, cost, and operational performance of Medium Altitude Long Endurance UAVs (MALE UAVs). In the study, as a result of a wide literature review, we determined a performance criterion for this type of vehicle. The model presented here uses an Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Analytical Hierarch Process (IT2FAHP) and an Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (IT2FTOPSIS) hybrid method. The findings indicate that some MALE UAVs have superior technical and operational performance over others and demonstrate that range, max take-off weight, and payload are important criteria in determining the performance and superiority of these vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the number and types of IoT devices are increasing rapidly, which leads to an expansion in the attack surface of this kind of device. Besides, the number of Botnet malware on IoT devices also grows with a lot of new variants. This context leads to an urgent demand for an effective solutio n in detecting new variants of IoT Botnet malware. There have been many studies focusing on IoT Botnet malware detection using static and dynamic analysis. In particular, the combination of the dynamic method with machine learning has shown outstanding advantages to detect IoT Botnet variants. However, the preprocessing of behavioral data originated from malware is still complicated, and the number of input vector dimensions of the machine learning model is still huge. In addition, these models also consume a lot of resources and have limited detection capabilities. Besides, dynamic analysis studies based on system calls mostly use call frequency characteristics and have not effectively exploited IoT Botnet malware’s life cycle characteristics. In this paper, we propose the Directed System Call Graph (DSCG) feature to sequentially structure the system calls. This DSCG graph will be vectorized and used as an input for building a malware analysis model based on popular machine learning classifiers such as KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, etc. Experiments on the datasets demonstrate that the features extracted from this graph have low complexity but still ensure high accuracy in detecting IoT Botnets, especially with newly emerged IoT Botnet families. The proposed model was evaluated with ACC = 98.01 % , TPR = 97.93 % , FPR = 1.5 % , AUC = 0.9961 on a dataset of 5023 IoT Botnets and 3888 benign samples.},

First we extracted the feature points of the images with the binary eight or sixteen-neighborhood information. And then construct the descriptor of the feature point by neighborhood difference chain code. At last we use the Euclidean distance to match the feature points. We adopt TNO and INO data sets to verify our method, and by comparing with four objective evaluation parameters obtained by other three methods. The result demonstrated that the proposed algorithm performs competitively, compared to the state-of-arts such as Harris, SIFT and SURF, in terms of accuracy of registration and speed.},

In the current version of the application, the use of Praat has been eliminated and we have developed our solution based on neural networks. Therefore, 3 experiments with forward, 1 and 2D convolutional neural networks were performed to determine the overall success of the classification. Their common feature is that the prediction success was always highest in tests with a test subset of the RAVDESS database, with the best result being obtained using a 1D convolutional network (78.93%). Tests with the EMO-DB database were successful at 35.76%, 31.75% and 25.49%. In all three experiments, the worst results were obtained in tests with the SAVEE database - 20.24%, 18.45% and 22.02%.},

  abstract     = {Agricultural Food Supply chain management has arisen as an area of day-to-day importance for the agricultural food sector, since stakeholders involved in the execution of decision-making processes. Quality less agricultural products are added to the market in day-to-day life which leads to usage of chemicals in the production process. These leads to the major issues that gives the impact on agricultural product’s quality as well as overall well-being of the consumers. Devices are needed to identify the quality of the food products which are highly demanded due to the lack of transparency in the recent processes. Henceforth Blockchain technology is evolving as a decentralized and secure infrastructure which could replace involvement of a third party to verify the transactions inside the system. The purpose of the proposed work is to implement a Blockchain based solution i.e. constructing a Decentralized Application (DApp) using Hyperledger Fabric framework to verify the food quality and the cause of the agricultural supply chain. A private permissioned Blockchain concept is chosen instead of a public Blockchain in the proposed work to ensure transparency and secure transaction by consenting any person to access the network. Smart contract chain code was instantiated for the deployment of Blockchain network. All the performers who are involved in the supply chain must be able to interact with the system to achieve the transparency. Transaction and queries related to a food product are validated by peers of the Blockchain network. A Barcode &amp; QR code-based scanning mechanism is used to indicate the customer’s satisfaction with their products. Transactions without third party gives Farmer’s reputation for their products. A unique DApp mechanism is used to identify each product within the food supply chain. Thus, the proposed system has been implemented as a prototype and validated using smart contracts.},

In this work LID system for Indian languages is proposed based on unsupervised feature learning utilizing Deep Belief Network (DBN). The proposed methodology is implement ed in two parts. The first phase of this work is based on extracting MFCC features combined with SDC hybrid features. The resultant hybrid features are further stacked to Deep Belief Network (DBN). The second phase of the proposed work is investigating the performance of various Feed forward back propagation neural network models for classification using different training algorithms. Effect of combining different activation functions and varying the hidden neurons is also investigated The performance of the resultant models is evaluated on the basis of some performance metrics such as the epochs, training time, Mean Square Error, Regression and Mean Absolute Percentage Error. Results indicate that optimal performance is achieved in model trained with Levenberg Marquardt (LM) training algorithm. The activation functions used in the hidden and output layer are “tansig” and “purelin”. Similarly, the effect of varying the number of neurons in the hidden layer is not significant in improving the performance of the derived models. FFBPNN models trained with PL and TS activation functions gave best performance indices. A user defined language database in four different languages Hindi, English, Tamil and Malayalam is used for this work.},

  abstract     = {Human emotion recognition with the evaluation of speech signals is an emerging topic in recent decades. Emotion recognition through speech signals is relatively confusing because of the speaking style, voice quality, cultural background of the speaker, environment, etc. Even though numerous signal processing methods and frameworks exists to detect and characterize the speech signal’s emotions, they do not attain the full speech emotion recognition (SER) accuracy and success rate. This paper proposes a novel algorithm, namely the deep ganitrus algorithm (DGA), to perceive the various categories of emotions from the input speech signal for better accuracy. DGA combines independent component analysis with fisher criterion for feature extraction and deep belief network with wake sleep for emotion classification. This algorithm is inspired by the elaeocarpus ganitrus (rudraksha seed), which has 1 to 21 lines. The single line bead is rarest to find, analogously finding a single emotion from the speech signal is also complex. The proposed DGA is experimentally verified on the Berlin database. Finally, the evaluation results were compared with the existing framework, and the test result accomplishes better recognition accuracy when compared with all other current algorithms.},

Researchers were able to use their understanding of Alzheimer’s disease risk variables to develop enrichment processes for longitudinal imagin g studies. Using this method, they reduced their sample size and study time. This paper describes the primitive detective of Alzheimer’s diseases using Neuroimaging techniques. Several preprocessing methods were used to ensure that the dataset was ready for subsequent feature extraction and categorization. The noise was reduced by converting and averaging many scan frames from real to DCT space. Both sides of the averaged image were filtered and combined into a single shot after being converted to real space. InceptionV3 and DenseNet201 are two pre-trained models used in the suggested model. The PCA approach was used to select the traits, and the resulting explained variance ratio was 0.99The Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI)—Simon’s Simplex Collection (SSC)—and UCI machine learning datasets showed that our method is faster and more successful at identifying complete long-risk patterns when compared to existing methods.},

  abstract     = {During the last years, object-based image segmentation (OBIA) has seen a considerable increase in the image segmentation. OBIA is generally based on superpixel methods, in which the clustering-based method plays an increasingly important role. Most clustering methods for generating superpixels suff er from inaccurate classification points with inappropriate cluster centers. To solve the problem, we propose a competitive mechanism-based superpixel generation (CMSuG) method, which both accelerates convergence and promotes robustness for noise sensitivity. Then, image segmentation results will be obtained by a region adjacent graph (RAG)-based merging algorithm after constructing an RAG. However, high segmentation accuracy is customarily accompanied by expensive time-consuming costs. To improve computational efficiency, we address a parallel CMSuG algorithm, the time of which is much less than the CMSuG method. In addition, we present a parallel RAG method to decrease the expensive time-consuming cost in serial RAG construction. By leveraging parallel techniques, the running time of the whole image segmentation method decline with the time complexity from O (N) + O (K2) to O (N/K) or O (K2), in which N is the size of an input image and K is the given number of the superpixel. In the experiments, both nature image and remote sensing image segmentation results demonstrate that our CMSuG method outperforms the state-of-the-art superpixel generation methods, and then performs well for image segmentation in turn. Compared with the serial segmentation method, our parallel techniques gain more than four times acceleration in both remote sensing image dataset and nature image dataset.},

However, the simple structure of Jaya algorithm may result in poor performances, to boost the performance, a multi-strategy Jaya (MJaya) algorithm based on multi-population has been proposed in this paper. Three strategies correspond to three groups of solutions. The first strategy based on the first population is to introduce an adaptive weight parameter to the position-updating equation to improve the local search. The second strategy is based on rank-based mutation to enhance the global search. The third strategy is to exploit around the best solution to reinforce the local search. Three strategies cooperate well during the evolution process. The experimental results based on CEC 2014 have proven that the proposed MJaya is superior compared with Jaya and its latest variants.

  abstract     = {The synchronization phenomenon in two linearly coupled friction-induced oscillators is analyzed in this paper using a data-driven approach based on dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). The tip mass at the end of a cantilever beam in each of the oscillators is in frictional contact with a rigid rotatin g disc. The cantilever beams are subjected to base excitation and a linear spring between the tip masses provides the coupling between the two oscillators. The partial differential equation governing the motion of the system is reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations employing the method of modal projection. The qualitative nature of the coupled oscillations is determined by analyzing the time displacement response, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Poincaré map, and the phase plane diagrams. DMD approximates the dynamical system in terms of coherent structures known as spatiotemporal modes. The frequency information is captured in the corresponding spatiotemporal modes. The influence of each frequency component on the whole dynamics of the system is studied by reconstructing the motion of each subsystem using the corresponding spatiotemporal mode. The contribution of a single dynamic mode towards the overall synchronized motion of the coupled system is analyzed by evaluating the linear correlation between those modes. Evaluation of the similarity measures helps to unearth how far each spatial and temporal mode behaves similarly in time.},

  abstract     = {Some of the existing continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) methods require alignment. However, this is time-consuming, and breaks the continuity of the frame sequence, and also affects the subsequent process of CSLR. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal network framework for CSLR based on a multi-layer self-attention mechanism. We propose a 3D convolution residual neural network (CR3D) and a multi-layer self-attention network (ML-SAN) for the feature extraction stage. The CR3D obtains the short-term spatiotemporal features of the RGB and optical flow image streams, whereas the ML-SAN uses a bi-gated recurrent unit (BGRU) to model the long-term sequence relationship and a multi-layer self-attention mechanism to learn the internal relationships between sign language sequences. For the performance optimization stage, we propose a cross-modal spatial mapping loss function, which improves the precision of CSLR by studying the spatial similarity between the video and text domains. Experiments were conducted on two test datasets: the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather multi-signer dataset, and a Chinese SL (CSL) dataset. The results show that the proposed method can obtain state-of-the-art recognition performance on the two datasets, with word error rate (WER) value of 24.4% and accuracy value of 14.42%, respectively.},

Here, DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) method has been utilized to assess the interrelationship among the criteria under hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy (HPF) information. The Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) has recently obtained enormous attention and is applied widely in decision-making.

  abstract     = {Purpose:The purpose of this paper is to propose a pseudo-grey metabolic grey Markov model to deal with the prediction issue in which the original sequences are oscillation sequences. Design/methodology/approach:First, the original sequences were processed with the accelerated advection transformati on and the weighted mean generation transformation to make them smoother. Then, the mean GM (1, 1) model was applied to the multi-step prediction of the pre-processed data sequences. Finally, with the help of the optimal partitioning method, the pseudo-grey metabolic Markov model was used to correct the prediction results and determine the final prediction values. Findings:The results demonstrate that the accuracy of this model is significantly higher than that of the traditional grey Markov model, which further verifies the rationality of the proposed model. Therefore, scientific and reasonable prediction of urban rainfall is of great theoretical significance and application value for the government and decision-making departments to formulate drought prevention and disaster mitigation measures. Originality/value:The model in this paper not only provides new ideas for the data preprocessing problem of the grey Markov model, but also solves the problem of errors due to individual subjectivity in state interval division. It provides a novel idea for the development of grey prediction models. The rationality and validity of the model are illustrated by taking the Zhengzhou City of Henan Province as examples.},

Due to the complexity, veracity, and velocity of climate data, a traditional, simple, and single machine learning model will not be sufficient to perform effective and timely analysis. The climat e data can be effectively analyzed, and climate models can be developed with the proposed hybrid model. The deep learning AutoEncoder (AE) is used for feature extraction, removal of redundant and noisy data. The Synthetic Minority class Oversampling (SMOTE) technique to generate samples in minority class to mitigate the imbalance in the sample distribution. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is used for further feature classification. The proposed method exploits big data strategies and the results interpretation process to extract accurate insight from climate data. ELM handles the class imbalance problem to improve the performance of the Early Warning System (EWS) model and fine-tune it. The hybrid method drastically reduces the computation cost and improves the accuracy to 93%, 86%, 95%, and 98% of four different datasets against other machine learning models. The experimental results of the AE_SMOTE_ELM model, compared with other state-of-the-art deep learning methods, shows accuracy and an efficiency of 90.4% and 91.76%, respectively, for two climate datasets.},

Hence, it is incorporated in medical data analysis for assisting in effective decision making and disease predictions. With that concern, this paper concentrates on framing an Integrated Model for Heart Disease Diagnosis (IM-HDD) using the advanced data mining conceits. The model considers the significant features of patient data that are available in benchmark datasets. Here, the main objective of the proposed model is to enhance the classification accuracy of patient data on classes under NORMAL and ABNORMAL. For enhancing the classification accuracy, the proposed integrated model utilizes the algorithms such as Decision Tree Algorithm, Naive Baye’s Classification and Ensemble Classifiers called Random Forest and Bagging. Further, performance evaluation is performed for analyzing the proposed work. For that, images from UCI repository are utilized and the comparative analysis shows that the proposed work produces better results than the existing models compared.},

  abstract     = {The rapid and effective identification of leaf diseases of woody fruit plants can help fruit farmers prevent and cure diseases in time to improve fruit quality and minimize economic losses, which is of great significance to fruit planting. In recent years, deep learning has shown its unique advanta ges in image recognition. This paper proposes a new type of network based on deep learning image recognition method to recognize leaf diseases of woody fruit plants. The network merges the output of the convolutional layer of ResNet101 and VGG19 to improve the feature extraction ability of the entire model. It uses the transfer learning method to partially load the trained network weights, reducing model training parameters and training time. In addition, an attention mechanism is added to improve the efficiency of network information acquisition. Meanwhile, dropout, L2 regularization, and LN are used to prevent over-fitting, accelerate convergence, and improve the network’s generalization ability. The experimental results show that the overall accuracy of woody fruit plant leaf diseases identification based on the model proposed in this paper is 86.41%. Compared with the classic ResNet101, the accuracy is improved by 1.71%, and the model parameters are reduced by 96.63%. Moreover, compared with the classic VGG19 network, the accuracy is improved by 2.08%, and the model parameters are reduced by 96.42%. After data set balancing, the overall identification accuracy of woody fruit plant leaf diseases based on the model proposed in this paper can reach 86.73%.},

  abstract     = {Power quality disturbance (PQD) defines the presence of inconsistencies that occur in the usual wave shapes of voltage and current signals. Power quality is considered the main challenge for power industry with the increase in dynamic load and highly subtle electronic devices. Besides, the islandin g events, particularly unintended islanding, grasp significant challenges and it needs to be identified at the early stage. Islanding is an anomalousstate in the power system, where the distributed generators (DGs) are placed on supplying electrical energy to the local load even after the shortage of the major grid. Therefore, it is essential to identify and differentiate the PQ events and islanding events in ensuring pollution-free power, equipment, and labor safety. With this motivation, this paper presents an automated optimal deep learning based islanding detection (AODL-ID) technique. The proposed AODL-ID technique involves three major stages namely decomposition, classification, and hyperparameter tuning. Firstly, an empirical mode decomposition (EMD) approach is utilized to decompose the basic signals from the polluted signals. In addition, bidirectional gated recurrent neural network (BiGRNN) technique is employed for the classification of islanding and non-islanding PQ events in the wind energy penetrated DG systems by means of features (Voltage and current (RMS, half-cycle, peak and fundamental) Frequency. Power Factor / Cos Phi. Power and energy (active, reactive, harmonic, apparent)). Since the hyperparameters play a significant role in overall classification performance, the hyperparameter tuning of the BiGRNN model takes place using chaotic crow search algorithm (CCSA). To examine the enhanced classification outcome of the AODL-ID technique, a set of experimental analyses is carried out and the outcomes are investigated interms of various evaluation metrics. The simulation outcomes highlighted the supremacy of the AODL-ID technique over the compared techniques.},

  abstract     = {In the process of large-scale group decision making (LSGDM), probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS) is an useful tool to represent the preferences of expert. There is a common case that experts tend to provide incomplete preferences due to various reasons. However, previous methods which cope wit h the missing values never took experts′ level of cognition over alternatives and attributes into account. In reality, because of limited knowledge reservation and the complexity of decision problem, experts have diverse familiarity with each scheme and attribute. For handling the defect, we propose a novel method to fill missing preference values, based on the combination of knowledge-match degree and trust degree of experts providing reference information. We obtain the knowledge-match degree through the accuracy and reliability of preference as well as the trust degree through social network analysis technology (SNA), and use the probabilistic linguistic weighted average operator (PLWA) to integrate the referential values into preferences of the missing expert. Moreover, to solve the consensus problem at minimal cost, a consensus model based minimum adjust is developed in which the consensus degree of identified elements are all lowest at three aspects including decision matrix, internal experts and intra-group. On the basis of the trust relationship, revising the preference with low consensus guarantees regulated experts′ real aspiration. In addition, a new approach to measure the weight of sub-group is proposed in the light of trust in-degree which considers the reliability of experts in the same subgroup.The feasibility and validity of the LSGDM method are tested by using a numerical example and comparing with other methods.},

In this paper, an improved cell density method is used to screen for the high quality parents by estimating the global distribution of the objective space. Moreover, Principal Component Analysis operator is introduced to the external archive to perturb the non-dominated solution, which not only ensures the convergence but also improves the diversity. In order to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, TSDE and other advanced methods are run on 19 test functions. The results show that TSDE performs better than other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Epilepsy is a common brain disease, caused by abnormal discharge of human brain neurons, resulting in brain dysfunction syndrome. Although epilepsy does not have much impact on patients in the short term, but long-term frequent seizures can lead to physical and mental impact of patients. At present , the method used to detect epilepsy is to make a comprehensive judgment by EEG examination combined with clinical symptoms. With the application of AI technology, some advanced algorithms have been used to assist medical diagnosis. In this trend, we use extreme learning machine to observe and detect patients with epilepsy. ELM has the characteristics of high efficiency and high precision, so it is often used in regression and classification problems. However, in the face of different data sets, ELM structure is not enough to achieve good performance. This is caused by the uneven distribution of data in different data sets. To solve this problem, we add the transfer learning module to the basic ELM structure. The purpose of adding transfer learning is to divide the disordered data in the domain space and construct a data set suitable for ELM learning. Specifically, the raw data are mapped to high-dimensional space by kernel method through domain adaptive method. Secondly, in high-dimensional space, the distance between different domains should be reduced appropriately. Finally, ELM method is used to analyze and predict the changed data set. In the whole algorithm process, due to the characteristics of ELM updating weight, only a certain amount of hidden nodes are needed, and the training process is very fast. At the same time, after adding the transfer learning function module, the accuracy of ELM is also satisfactory. In this paper, the epilepsy data of patients were used for comparative experiments. The experimental results show that the method can maintain high efficiency and satisfactory accuracy.},

Subsequently, perception computing based on computing with words paradigm is introduced to implement information fusion among different decision-makers in the linguistic information-based fuzzy logic reasoning process. Then, a three-way decision (3WD) theory based on IT2 FLTSs with fuzzy neighborhood covering is proposed, and the corresponded tri-partitioning strategies that satisfy Jaccard similarity of membership distributions are given. Finally, 3WD theory is applied to multi-criteria group decision-making with linguistic terms, and the algorithm steps are illustrated by a promising application under the background of coronavirus disease 2019 to reveal the feasibility and practicability of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Modern decision-making (DM) systems are becoming more and more complex and sophisticated in their demands for information expressions and credibility levels. In the existing literature, a trapezoidal fuzzy neutrosophic value (TFNV) that combines trapezoidal fuzzy numbers with neutrosophic values ca n be better depicted by truth, indeterminacy, and falsity membership functions. Unfortunately, TFNV implies its defect since it lacks a measure of credibility. To make TFNV more creditable, TFNV should be related to its credibility level. Regarding the motivation for combining TFNV with its credibility level, this paper first proposes the concept of a credibility TFNV (C-TFNV) as a new framework of TFNV associated with the measure of credibility. The advantage of its information expression is that C-TFNV has a more creditable ability to describe indeterminate and inconsistent knowledge and judgments of human beings by the mixed information of a TFNV and a related credibility level (an ordered pair of TFNVs). Next, we propose the operational laws of C-TFNVs and the score function of C-TFNV. Furthermore, we present a C-TFNV weighted arithmetic averaging (C-TFNVWAA) and a C-TFNV weighted geometric averaging (C-TFNVWGA) operators and their properties. Then, a multicriteria DM model based on the C-TFNVWAA and C-TFNVWGA operators and the score function is established in the case of C-TFNVs. Finally, an actual DM example of slope decision schemes is provided to show the applicability and efficiency of the established DM model in the case of C-TFNVs.},

Meanwhile, we import position information of the target verbs to gain the contextual meaning more accurately. Both two DNN models use these embeddings as inputs in this paper, which are inspired by two human metaphor identification procedures augmented with contextualized word representations (ELMo embedding). By testing on two public datasets, the results show improvement over previous state-of-the-art approaches.

Island model (IM) is considered as a distributed population paradigm employed by evolutionary algorithms to preserve the diversification and, thus, to improve the local search. I n this article, we study different island model techniques integrated in to particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm in order to overcome its drawbacks: premature convergence and lack of diversity. The first IMPSO approach consists in using the migration process in a static way to enhance the police migration strategy. On the other hand, the second approach, called dynamic-IMPSO, consists in integrating a learning strategy in case of migration. The last version called constrained-IMPSO utilizes a stochastic technique to ensure good communication between the sub-swarms. To evaluate and verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, several standard constrained and unconstrained benchmark functions are used. The obtained results confirm that these algorithms are more efficient in solving low-dimensional problems (CEC’05), large-scale optimization problems (CEC’13) and constrained problems (CEC’06), compared to other well-known evolutionary algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In today’s world, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) plays a significant role in the advancement of next-generation network architecture that offers vast control to the network operators. However, the control layer is vulnerable to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks where DDoS is one of th e most powerful and devastating cyber-attacks. Thus, the development of a DDoS attack detection mechanism is very essential since these kinds of attacks have a direct impact on the overall performance of the SDN. In this paper, a new robust Tuned support vector machine-based DDoS attack detection methodology has been proposed to categorize the benign traffic from DDoS attack traffic on the SDN. Primarily, the network is created with controller and OpenFlow switch and the communication can be carried out through secure channels among different benign users and also attackers. Afterward, the multi-characteristic values are extracted by the effective extraction strategy which consists of the six-tuple characteristic values matrix. Finally, the tuned classifier has been implemented with the aid of optimization algorithm for differentiating the abnormal traffic and the normal traffic. The performance results manifest that the proposed detection framework achieves a higher accuracy of 98% and precision of 99% when compared with existing classifiers.},

Despite its promise, NMT models can still not model prior external knowledge. Recent investigations have necessitated the adaptation of past expertise to both trai ning and inference methods, resulting in translation inference issues. This paper proposes an extension of the moment matching framework that incorporates advanced prior knowledge without interfering with the inference process by using a matching mechanism between the model and empirical distributions. Our tests show that the suggested expansion outperforms the baseline and effectively over various language combinations.},

The strong domination number γs (H) is the minimum cardinality of a strong dominating set. In this paper, we introduce a new vulnerability parameter called strong domination integrity in graphs. Strong domination integrity of some families of graphs are determined and its bounds are also obtained. The proposed parameter is applied in water distribution network system to identify the influential group of nodes within the network. Fuzzy graphs can be used to model uncertain networks. By using membership values of strong arcs, strong domination integrity is extended to fuzzy graphs as a new vulnerability parameter. In this study, we investigate the strong domination integrity for complete bipartite fuzzy graphs, complete fuzzy graphs and bounds are also derived. Some basic results and theorems are obtained. This vulnerability parameter is also applied in the transportation network systems.},

The you only look once 4 (YOLOv4) algorithm is improved to reduce the redundancy of the network structure and enhance the applicability of the feature map for hand gesture recognition. Combined with the Deep-sort real-time tracking feature, the hand motion trajectory is obtained by introducing the epiphenomenal features to effectively avoid the situation that the object is not tracked when it is obscured. To avoid the problem of gradient disappearance during deep network training, the DenseNet-BC-169 network is used to balance the recognition rate and training time for gesture trajectory classification. Compared with FLIXT, the winner of the dynamic gesture recognition challenge, the final results showed a 6.13% improvement in accuracy and video processing with the IsoGD dataset reached 31fps, validating the effectiveness of this method.},

  abstract     = {Globally, the second most common cause of death for female cancer patients is breast cancer. In the United States, about 11,000 females aged below 40 are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer each year. Early detection of breast cancer is the foundation for preventing the progression of the disease , and the diagnosis can be conducted using intelligent systems for quicker detection. Based on the FUZZYDBD method and bootstrap aggregation (bagging) technique, the Bagging fuzzy-ID3 algorithm (BFID3) was proposed for this study. This method combined the techniques of the fuzzy system, ID3 algorithm and bagging. For BFID3’s data fuzzification, the automatic fuzzy database definition method, known as the FUZZYDBD method, would assist in developing the fuzzy database. One of the weaknesses of the ID3 algorithm is its incapability to handle continuous data. The problem was resolved via the linguistic variable replacement and data fuzzification in the BFID3. Meanwhile, this paper’s implementation of the bagging technique improved the generalization ability and reduced overfitting. Additionally, BFID3 was verified through an extensive comparison with several existing methods to investigate the competency of the proposed method. The study identified that BFID3 was proficient in breast cancer classification.},

In this context, Sentiment analysis is utilized to gather valuable insights from users’ opinion s. These insights would benefit a lot for the business concerns and institutions to improve their respective products/services. Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is the most robust technique that offers a more fine-grained analysis. The objective of this paper is to improve the efficacy of ABSA by framing a robust and enhanced set of rules. Several experiments were carried out to detect explicit and implicit aspects. The hybrid approach comprising of enhanced rule-based approach (ERBA) and domain-specific lexicon (DSL) is used to improve the solution of the aspect-based sentiment analysis problem. The proposed approach employs a domain-specific adjective-noun collocation list(DSANCL) tailored to the domain for fine-tuning the process of implicit aspect detection(IAD). The proposed model frames a new nine-point scale for measuring the sentiment strength by introducing a ternary classification of intensifiers based on their degree of intensification. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated using the university reviews dataset.},

  abstract     = {Risk assessment takes place depending on the expertise and subjective linguistic assessments of experts. Expert judgements are collected via a questionnaire or an interview including qualitative data. Pessimistic or optimistic status of experts can affect their perceptions on risk. Furthermore, exp ert judgments are affected by questions’ structure based on whether it is a positive type question (e.g., ‘What is the occurrence probability of the accident?) or a negative type question (e.g., ‘What is the non-occurrence probability of the accident?). All of these cases create uncertainties in the risk assessment process. For this reason, there are various studies using fuzzy risk analysis models to address these uncertainties in risk assessment. However, there is not any risk assessment tool that considers the uncertainties caused by the factors mentioned above, simultaneously. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce the concept of decomposed fuzzy sets (DFS) to model human thoughts and perceptions in a more realistic and detailed way through optimistic and pessimistic membership functions. We present the basic operations on decomposed fuzzy sets and their properties. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed method, the method is applied to operational risk analysis in business processes. The data used in the application are collected from the managerial board of a construction company. The application results and advantages of the proposed method are presented together with a comparative analysis.},

  abstract     = {In view of the shortcomings of the existing evaluation methods in fully considering the fuzziness and randomness of product design evaluation, a novel product design evaluation method based on FAHP and cloud model is proposed. First, a hierarchical structure model of product design evaluation is es tablished. Second, fuzzy pairwise comparison of criteria is constructed through questionnaire survey, and the digital characteristics of weight cloud model are acquired by the proposed fuzzy weight model. Then, based on the factor scores, the digital characteristics of scoring cloud model are obtained by backward cloud. Finally, the digital characteristics of comprehensive evaluation cloud model are obtained by using the proposed improved fuzzy composite operator, and the forward cloud is used to get the cloud picture for evaluation. Taking reading lamp as an example, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified. The results show that compared with the other two methods, the Kendall rank correlation coefficients of entropy of the method are increased by 0.17 and 0.33, respectively, which proves that the method achieves more accurate evaluation result under the complex criteria, and provides a more effective tool for decision makers and designers to evaluate and optimize design schemes.},

It not only provides high utility itemset (HUI), but also provides quantitative information of individual item in the itemset. HUQI can provide decision makers with information about items and thei r purchase quantities. However, the currently proposed HUQI mining algorithms assume that the datasets are static. In order to solve this problem, an incremental quantitative utility list (IQUL) data structure is proposed to store item information, including item name, item number, transaction weight utility of item, each entry in the list stores the transaction identifier, the utility of the original data, the remaining utility, the utility of the incremental data, the remaining utility, and the sum of the utility and the remaining utility. When data is inserted, the item information will be updated. Based on IQUL, an incrementally updating HUQI (IHUQI) mining algorithm is proposed to mine HUQI on incremental update data. A large number of experiments on real datasets show that the IHUQI algorithm can effectively mine HUQI Experimental results show better performance on sparse datasets.},

In practice, it is hardly possible to implement a single gain learning control law to improve the tracking performance due to the ex istence of large transient growth. To prevent the growth, this paper proposes a time-varying learning control design using the unique concept of fuzzy logic control to track the desired trajectory as well as the desired control input signal. The proposed control design is developed on both serial and parallel ILC configurations. The two configurations are initially constructed and implemented on a robotic manipulator with the use of a single gain learning control law. To avoid bad transients, the gain adjustment mechanism based on fuzzy logic control is introduced to vary the learning gain in each time step for enhancing the robustness of the system. According to the simulation and experiment on a robotic manipulator, both ILC structures with the proposed mechanism achieve the desired learning performance without bad transients.},

However, they have not solved the problems of modelling variational consumer preference based on time series data with the consideration of the ambiguity of emotions expressed by customers in online reviews. To solve the above problems, this article proposes the particle swarm optimization (PSO) based dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system (DENFIS) method to model variational consumer preferences based on online customer reviews. Using the time series data mined by the sentiment analysis method and the product attribute settings of the review products, the PSO-based DENFIS method is offered to dynamically model consumer preferences, in which PSO is used to adjust DENFIS parameters adaptively.},

  abstract     = {High utility mining is gaining prominence, and with the increasing set of business intelligence models, the scope of such significant practices is high. Rather than focusing only on profitability as one key utility metric, today’s organizations believe in having more robust levels of the multi-obje ctive filtering process. In this manuscript, a contemporary model of the high utility mining process is proposed, wherein the multiple averages are used for grading the recommendation of the itemsets for merchandise. The model’s key advantage is its dynamic approach. The goods-related period of the average time interval can be flexible, alongside the fusion of multiple utility thresholds of diversified features chosen for itemsets recommendation. The performance analysis has been carried out by using a multi-fold cross-validation strategy. The results obtained for cross-validation show that the proposed model is outperforming the contemporary models with significant precision, specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy having values 97%, 95%, 98%, and 97% in respective order. Whereas, the contemporary models HUPM-MUO and MOEA-FHUI have obtained 93% and 90%, 88% and 82%, 89%, and 84%, and 89% and 83% in respective order of the corresponding metrics. The experimental study of the model denotes the effectiveness and ease with which the solution can generate results and produce significant output in the real-time environment for more dynamic and periodic decisions by different organizations.},

  abstract     = {Edge Detection is the first stage in the image division into separate parts. Image division is the partitioning of a digital image to the different zones or the set of pixels. Edge detection is one of the techniques applied in digital image processing often. The purpose of detecting pixels is to ma tch the edges in the image. Filtering, Enhancement, and Detection are three steps in edge detection. Images are usually destroyed by casual changes in intensity intervals called noise or confusion. some noise variations include salt and pepper, pulse, and Gaussian. However, there is a relation between edge detection power and noise reduction. Using filters to the noise reduction causes the loss of edge detection power. For facilitating the edges detection, it is essential for the determination of pixels’ intensity constraints in their neighborhood. Many points in an image have a nontransparent slope, and all of them are not the edges of the joint space. Therefore, some of the linear and nonlinear methods such as Sobel, Prewitt, and Robert have to be used to determine the edge points. The fuzzy logic and the system based on it, is one of the most effective methods for edge detection. This paper presents an optimized rule-based fuzzy inference system and designs the efficiency mask matric. The simulation results for edge detection are presented using the traditional edge detection techniques, including Binary Filter, Sobel Filter, Prewitt Filter, and Robert Filter. Also, it is presented using the fuzzy approach. The simulation results show that the designed fuzzy system has been able to detect the edges of the image more accurately and help to increase the sharpness and quality of the edges. Therefore, the proposed method has more accurate and more reliable results and reduces false edge detection comparison to the traditional methods.},

  abstract     = {Many machine learning-based methods have been widely applied to Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and are achieving high accuracy. However, they are black-box methods that are unable to explain the reasons behind the diagnosis. The trade-off between accuracy and interpretability of diagnosis models is important, especially for human disease. This work aims to propose an approach for generating rule-based models for CAD diagnosis. The classification rule generation is modeled as combinatorial optimization problem and it can be solved by means of metaheuristic algorithms. Swarm intelligence algorithms like Equilibrium Optimizer Algorithm (EOA) have demonstrated great performance in solving different optimization problems. Our present study comes up with a Novel Discrete Equilibrium Optimizer Algorithm (NDEOA) for the classification rule generation from training CAD dataset. The proposed NDEOA is a discrete version of EOA, which use a discrete encoding of a particle for representing a classification rule; new discrete operators are also defined for the particle’s position update equation to adapt real operators to discrete space. To evaluate the proposed approach, the real world Z-Alizadeh Sani dataset has been employed. The proposed approach generate a diagnosis model composed of 17 rules, among them, five rules for the class “Normal” and 12 rules for the class “CAD”. In comparison to nine black-box and eight white-box state-of-the-art approaches, the results show that the generated diagnosis model by the proposed approach is more accurate and more interpretable than all white-box models and are competitive to the black-box models. It achieved an overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 93.54%, 80% and 100% respectively; which show that, the proposed approach can be successfully utilized to generate efficient rule-based CAD diagnosis models.},

  abstract     = {Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men, which takes many victims every year due to its latent symptoms. Thus, early diagnosis of the extent of the lesion can help the physician and the patient in the treatment process. Nowadays, detection and labeling of objects in medical images has become especially important. In this article, the prostate gland is first detected in T2 W MRI images by the Faster R-CNN network based on the AlexNet architecture and separated from the rest of the image. Using the Faster R-CNN network in the separation phase, the accuracy will increase as this network is a model of CNN-based target detection networks and is functionally coordinated with the subsequent CNN network. Meanwhile, the problem of insufficient data with the data augmentation method was corrected in the preprocessing stage, for which different filters were used. Use of different filters to increase the data instead of the usual augmentation methods would eliminate the preprocessing stage. Also, with the presence of raw images in the next steps, it was proven that there was no need for a preprocessing step and the main images could also be the input data. By eliminating the preprocessing step, the response speed increased. Then, in order to classify benign and malignant cancer images, two deep learning architectures were used under the supervision of ResNet18 and GoogleNet. Then, by calculating the Confusion Matrix parameters and drawing the ROC diagram, the capability of this process was measured. By obtaining Accuracy = 95.7%, DSC = 96.77% and AUC = 99.17%, The results revealed that this method could outperform other well-known methods in this field (DSC = 95%) and (AUC = 91%).},

  abstract     = {Probabilistic Uncertain Linguistic Term Set (PULTS), as an emerging and effective linguistic expression tool, can appropriately describe the complex evaluation information of decision makers. The cloud model is powerful in handling complex cognitive linguistic information, based on which, this pape r proposes two new Multicriteria Decision-Making (MCDM) Methods with PULTSs. Firstly, to avoid the problem of information loss in traditional linguistic conversion methods, Probabilistic Uncertainty Trapezium Cloud (PUTC) is proposed to quantify linguistic evaluation information. Secondly, the Probabilistic Uncertainty Trapezium Cloud Weighted Bonferroni mean (PUTCWBM) operator is defined, while presenting a new cloud score function and similarity measures. Additionally, two ranking methods are proposed, one on the basis of the similarity measures of PUTCs and ideal solutions, the other on the basis of the PUTCWBM operator and the cloud score function. Finally, the two methods are verified with an example of evaluation on masks, and the effectiveness and superiority of the methods are further illustrated through sensitivity analysis and method comparison.},

  abstract     = {Credit scoring is widely used by financial institutions for default prediction, however, a significant portion of online credit loan customers have inadequate or unverifiable credit histories, making it difficult for financial institutions to make effective credit decisions. Since the widespread us e of smartphones and the popularity of mobile applications, it is worth investigating whether mobile application usage behaviors (App behaviors) of customers can effectively predict online loan defaults. This paper proposes a combined algorithm of CNN and LightGBM, and establishes credit scoring models with App behaviors to evaluate the default risk of online credit loans based on logistic regression, LightGBM, CNN and the combined algorithm, respectively. The experimental results suggest that App behaviors have an obvious effect on the default prediction of customers applying for online credit loans, and the combined model outperforms the other models in terms of the area under the curve (AUC). Furthermore, integrated credit scoring models are developed by combining App behaviors with traditional scoring features. A comparison of the integrated models and the traditional scoring model indicates that the integrated models have achieved a significant improvement in classification performance and App behaviors can be a powerful complement to the traditional credit scoring model.},

  abstract     = {Adenomyosis is an abnormality in the uterine wall of women that adversely affects their normal life style. If not treated properly, it may lead to severe health issues. The symptoms of adenomyosis are identified from MRI images. It is a gynaecological disease that may lead to infertility. The prese nce of red dots in the uterus is the major symptom of adenomyosis. The difference in the extent of these red dots extracted from MRI images shows how significant the deviation from normality is. Thus, we proposed an entroxon-based bio-inspired intelligent water drop back-propagation neural network (BIWDNN) model to discover the probability of infertility being caused by adenomyosis and endometriosis. First, vital features from the images are extracted and segmented, and then they are classified using the fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm. The extracted features are then attributed and compared with a normal person’s extracted attributes. The proposed BIWDNN model is evaluated using training and testing datasets and the predictions are estimated using the testing dataset. The proposed model produces an improved diagnostic precision rate on infertility.},

  abstract     = {Classic data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a linear programming method for evaluating the relative efficiency of decision making units (DMUs) that uses multiple inputs to produce multiple outputs. In the classic DEA model inputs and outputs of DMUs are deterministic, while in the real world, are of ten fuzzy, random, or fuzzy-random. Many researchers have proposed different approaches to evaluate the relative efficiency with fuzzy and random data in DEA. In many studies, the most productive scale size (mpss) of decision making units has been estimated with fuzzy and random inputs and outputs. Also, the concept of fuzzy random variable is used in the DEA literature to describe events or occurrences in which fuzzy and random changes occur simultaneously. This paper has proposed the fuzzy stochastic DEA model to assess the most productive scale size of DMUs that produce multiple fuzzy random outputs using multiple fuzzy random inputs with respect to the possibility-probability constraints. For solving the fuzzy stochastic DEA model, we obtained a nonlinear deterministic equivalent for the probability constraints using chance constrained programming approaches (CCP). Then, using the possibility theory the possibilities of fuzzy events transformed to the deterministic equivalents with definite data. In the final section, the fuzzy stochastic DEA model, proposed model, has been used to evaluate the most productive scale size of sixteen Iranian hospitals with four fuzzy random inputs and two fuzzy random outputs with symmetrical triangular membership functions.},

These issues are focused and resolved in the proposed research work by introducing the method namely Honest aware Congestion concerned Secured Edge Disjoint Multipath Routing (HC-SEDMR) Scheme. In this work cluster head selection is done using hybridized simulated annealing with fuzzy rule descriptors. Base on these selected cluster head, clustering is done using Normalized optimal clustering algorithm. After clustering Energy and Edge disjoint aware optimal routing is done using Congestion and Collision aware Edge Disjoint multipath routing. Here secured routing is ensured by choosing honest nodes for the forwarding process. This is done by using honest forwarding node selection method.

The stability, bio-stability, conductivity and mechanical properties of the gold (Au) make it effective rather than the other metals such as tungsten, copper, pla tinum and graphite. The surface quality, proper dimension such as the tip, cone angle is the matter of the trial and practice matter. It was the main issue to develop a controlled optimized methodology to obtain the gold needles of specific dimensions in regular and systematic way. The Ansys simulation of solid microneedle has been done to check on what stress the deflection occurs on microneedles. Then fuzzy optimization has performed to optimize the parameter of the etching set up such as the voltage, current and time of etching as an input parameter and the tip size and the conical section length as the output parameters. After the simulation and optimization the experiment of the etching has performed with the 3M solution of NaCl in deionized water and small amount of hydropercaloric acid. The fabricated needles have been then characterized by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to observe the morphology and the dimensions. The fuzzy analysis has been performed for optimization of the inputs voltage of range 1–10volt, current of range 1–100 mA and etching times from 1–15minutes. These optimized values are calculated by the fuzzy analysis such as the voltage is 58.6 mA, etching time 15 minutes and the voltages found to be 10 volt. Fuzzy analysis gives the simulated size of the tip 10.6μm and Mamdani models gives the 10.7μm which have the 0.01% error and the cone length for the Mamdani was found to be 500μm and the simulated values 497 having the 0.03% error which have very close approximation with the experimental values from the SEM micrographs that which also gives the values of the cone length from 400–500μm and the tip size from 10-20μm for the time 10-15minute whose values was optimized by the fuzzy analysis.},

  abstract     = {IoT systems base devices are considered an excellent research domain owning to its expertise and applications in wide range of areas. IoT in health care domain is gaining attention due to its better access to the doctor and paramedical staff as well as sensor based studies which results in less man to man interacting and less fault in the data. The health care provider can easily access the vitals and various other medical parameters by even staying miles away from the patient. However, large amount of data transfer over various communication mediums results in more data traffic. This data transfer will require more power which will be utilized to transfer the data. To reduce this data traffic issues, an efficient method is used in this work in which only the data that is predominantly important to be send to the health care provider is send via the communication medium. Rule based fuzzy logic tool is used in this work for an elder patient having cardiac issues. Blood sugar (After eating), Blood pressues (systolic), Blood pressure (Diastolic) and cholesterol level are taken as the parameter that are examined for the patient and the medical treatment required is calculated. The rules are set on the basis of real time data and human knowledge. The results from the fuzzy logic interference shows that the health care provider will be alarmed using communication medium only when active or emergency medical treatment of the patient is required. A comparative study between the power utilized in normal data driven method and fuzzy method shows that the fuzzy method utilize 8 times less power than the normal method. The simulated and MAMDANI model calculated values shows less than 1% error which shows the accuracy of the work in health care domain.},

In this research, an automatic food item detection from unstructured text is proposed based on semantic sense modeling. The candidate nouns are detected which can be food items and then the similarity of those nouns is computed with possible food categories. The candidate noun is treated as food item if the similarity is high. For similarity between possible food item and food category is computed by WordNet ontology. The proposed framework is evaluated on benchmark datasets and competitive performance have been achieved.

Furthermore, the Gradients Histogram Orientation (GOH) features are used to improve the accuracy of existing classifiers by image-to-image matching. The classical OCR using simple binary features are not sufficient to address the problems of shape ambiguity in Sindhi numerals, i.e., the shape of digits 2, and 3, are very similar. The raw pixel values are used as features for the classification in the first stage. In second stage, the input image is matched with the dominant FP and FN of the predicted class, and the final decision is made by the image-to-image matching based on GOH features. Decision based on image to image matching with dominant FP and FN increase the accuracy of the classifier.

To achieve value-add insights, we have developed Pakistani English corpus and used it along with other existing dictionaries. Our proposed corpus incorporates the Pakistani English words used in the Dawn news stories, which are annotated and validated by a human expert.

This research paper focuses on the development of an integrated blended learning model and the performance of the model on students’ learning has been predicted using a Bayesian network (BN) classifier. The proposed model is based on the medium impact blend of the Rotation model and the Enriched Virtual Model and applied to undergraduate computing students. The Data Structures and Algorithms course is targeted for the prediction of students’ performance. The findings of the proposed Integrated BL model show that when students properly attend the classroom lectures followed by their associated lab practical in the Rotation Model and follow the online learning activities in the Enriched Virtual Model properly, then their learning outcomes may be increased as predicted using BN method. The proposed model also reports an overall accuracy of 88.5% on the collected data.},

  abstract     = {Handwritten signature for the identification and authentication of an individual has been widely used in the biometric systems. Due to the intra-class and inter-class variabilities, signature verification has become one of the most challenging problem in the biometric technology. Furthermore, the o ffline handwritten signature can be forged by the skilled persons due to its static nature. Therefore, in this paper a deep learning-based method using convolutional neural network (CNN) for online signature verification has been developed. Different values of the convolutional kernels such as 1×1, 3×3 and 5×5 are used to extract the discriminative features at multi-scales. The features of the initial and middle layers of the CNN are combined to create more powerful features. An up-sampling method with bilinear interpolation has been used to add the features of convolutional layers with different spatial dimensions. Both the addition and concatenation methods have been used to aggregate the convolutional features. A convolutional transpose method is applied to increase the depth of the convolutional layers while performing an addition operation on the layers with different depths. Finally, the concatenated features are passed to the fully connected layers for high-level feature extraction and classification. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, an android application was developed where; a custom database of 985 online signatures collected from 197 users has been created. The problem of inadequate training data for online signature verification has been addressed through the data augmentation method. The experimental results show that the deep aggregated convolutional feature representation method achieves an accuracy of 99.32% on the custom developed online signature database.},

In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework single shot multi-box detector (SSD)-based model to detect tumors in the MRI scans. The proposed SSD model is the faster algorithm to detect the tumor even with the ability to detect the smallest spot in the low-resolution MRI scans. We additionally used a lightweight neural network architecture MobileNet v2 with SSD for faster and accurate object classification. The experimental results showed 98% accuracy with the proposed method after training with the smallest dataset of 250 MRI scans.

We have selected the investigation of diabetes for this research as a substantially large fragment of our society is suffering from diabetes. It has been observed that diabetic patients are more expressi ve on social media as compared to real-life interactions. Furthermore, online communities are playing a significant role in providing social support and knowledge to patients through their experiences. Diabetes has only been monitored through wearable (sensor-based) and glucose meters. However, the problem arises when the patients become reluctant about giving the required information themselves. For this purpose, a taxonomic system based on business process models has been developed which uses the textual data from the patients in which they express their emotions regarding Diabetes. Social media support groups related to Diabetes are used to gather data. Diabetic patients tend to share their emotions and feelings with people who are face a similar situation. However, there is no established measure to calculate the behavioral impact of diabetes on diabetic patients. In our research, we have studied how diabetic patients collaborate with each other to help others through social media and the impact of social communities on diabetic patient’s lifestyles. The results show the extent to which diabetic people follow a healthy lifestyle.},

Cloud optimization relies on resource optimization to improve the performance and reliability of the cloud. Fault in the cloud places an important role in defining the reliab ility of the cloud. The identification of fault is a challenging issue in a modular cloud environment. The researchers have developed various methods for the fault-aware scheduling of cloud resources. The fault-aware resource allocation includes static, dynamic, meta-heuristic, and learning-based approaches. In this article, we primarily focused on existing fault-aware resource allocation techniques and then we proposed a model that will primarily focus on fault forecast in tasks allocation. The projected model is based nature-inspired heuristic approach and intelligent artificial neural network. The fault-tolerant aware ANN-based proposed model focuses on performance improvement and reliability testing proactively. The proposed model surpasses the existing state of art methods for proactive and reactive fault-aware scheduling techniques in a large scale datacenter.

  abstract     = {This Ongoing COVID-19 epidemic situation, which has resulted in the loss of lives and economics. In this scenario, social distancing is the only way to prevent ourselves. In such a scenario to boost the economy, a globally large number of industries and businesses have shifted their system to cloud -like education, shipping, training and many more globally. To support this transition cloud services are the only solution to provide reliable and secure services to the user to sustain their business. Due to this, the load over the existing cloud infrastructure has drastically increased. So it is the responsibility of the cloud to manage the load over the existing infrastructure to maintain reliability and serve high-quality services to the user. Task allocation in the cloud is one of the key features to optimize the performance of cloud infrastructure. In this work, we have proposed a prediction-based technique using a pre-trained neural network to find a reliable resource for a task based on previous training and history of cloud and its performance to optimize the performance under the overloaded and under loaded situation. The main aim of this work is to reduce the fault and provide high performance by reducing scheduling time, execution time and network load. The proposed model uses the Big Bang Big Crunch algorithm to generated huge datasets for training our neural model. The accuracy of the BB-BC-ANN model is improved with 98% accuracy.},

Recent growth in machine lear ning algorithm inspired us to build a predictive model for better healthcare facilities. In our work we have focused on problem of noisy and imbalanced dataset in which majority class is favored over minority one that leads to false prediction. We have experimented with two publicly available medical imbalanced dataset which varies in its size as MIT’s GOSSIS death and PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset based on binary class. In this model we have investigated 3 oversampling techniques (Synthetic Minority Oversampler, Random Oversampler and Adaptive Synthetic Sampler) along with two undersampling techniques (Random Undersampler and Near Miss) which were paired with 3 data reduction and cleaning methods namely Tomek Links, One Sided Selection and Edited Nearest Neighbors. At last, we found that combination of Adaptive Synthetic Sampler along with One Sided Selection perform better in case of large size dataset while combination of random oversampler along with Tomek Link showed better performance in case of low size data dataset. We have also analyzed that oversampling technique gives quite promising results in comparison to undersampling methods specifically when applied with machine learning classifiers as these classifiers are data hungry algorithms.},

Netting theory and graph theory jointly gives a viable way to probe the proteomic specific data of cancer types such as ovarian, colon, breast, oral, cervical, prostate, and lung. We observe that the P2P(protein-protein) interaction Nettings of the cancerous tissues blended with the seven cancers and normal have same structural attributes. But some of these point to desultory changes from the disease Nettings to normal implying the variation in the dealings and bring out the redoing in the complicacy of various cancers. The Netting-based approach has a pertinent role in precision oncology. Cancer can be better dealt with through mutated pathways or Nettings in preference to individual mutations and that the utility value of repositioned drugs can be understood from disease modules in molecular Nettings.

  abstract     = {Semantic relations have been adopted in many research fields, including the semantic web, information retrieval, and Q&amp;A systems. The aim of the semantic relations is to remove conceptual and terminological confusion. This is achieved by specifying a set of general concepts that characterize domain s and their definitions and interrelationships. This research describes how to detect semantic relations, including synonyms, hyponyms, and hypernym s based on WordNet and entities of a knowledge graph (KG). This KG was built from two resources: ACM Digital Library and Wikipedia. We used natural language processing and the deep learning approach for processing data before generating the KG with an effective algorithm. We chose five of 245 categories in the ACM Digital Library to evaluate the proposed method. The generated results show that our system has excellent performance.},

  abstract     = {The modern grid has various functionalities by using remote sensor automation in power management, monitoring and controlling the system. Thus, it is imperative to ensure secure communications for various agents in smart grid, since the system is information communication based. Being information based the smart grid encounters security and privacy challenges impeding its adoption. One way of dealing with these cyber concerns is in devising robust cryptosystem for data encryption and authenticated key agreement in the communications of these remotely controlled smart devices. However, many proposed solutions are provided at the expense of computations cost. Thus, this paper designs a novel authenticated key agreement scheme with anonymity based on widely acceptable elliptic curve cryptography with efficiency. The scheme ensures optimal computation and communication overload whilst achieving mutual authentication and anonymity in the key agreement process. The scheme is proven in both formal and informal security analysis in portraying its satisfaction of the standard and extended Canetti–Krawczyk (eCK) security requirements. A comparative analysis with related schemes indicates that the proposed scheme have merits over others.},

The advantage of anomaly patterns and machine learning leads to the the proposed model to have better performance. The proposed model consists of three phases: finding anomaly pattern features, processing imbalanced data, exploring data by machine learning model. In this paper, the main contributions with respect to previous works can be listed as follows: (i) Successful modeling the new method of SAX for time series data for finding complex and dynamic anomaly patterns.

  abstract     = {Fire calamity is one of the worst adversarial events that can happen to the human race. Fire disaster can happen as a manmade disaster or even naturally, and it may cause environmental, social, and financial damages as well. In order to minimalize the unwanted fire calamity, early detection of fire eruptions coupled with immediate and effective response is extremely vital to disaster management systems. The classification of forest fire and non fire images using deep learning techniques has recently received popularity. Detection and prevention of forest fire have lot of significance from the perspective of the forest fire department, specially for the fire and arson investigators. There are shortcomings in the current mechanisms of forest fire detection in terms of accuracy. Hence, we propose a fire detection model using LeNet5 convolutional neural networks (CNN), which can spot fire in outdoor environments by classifying fire and non fire images. L2 regularization is critical technique that manipulates the complexity of the convolutional neural network model. In our work fire images have certain features that decide if the image is fire or non fire.A weight is assigned to every feature. Regularization used to help to reduce the over fitting that used to caused by plenty of weights. Our proposed provides the directiontowards developing a system that detects the early stages of forest fire.This model can further be utilized to prevent the damage caused by the fire. A CNN is a deep learning method, which has been adopted in order to detect the images of fire and non-fire. With the non sparse solution of L2 regularization we have obtained around 87% of train accuracy, 71% of validation accuracy and 70% of test accuracy after running 10 epochs.},

This paper proposes a flexible distributed fans network, locally adapted, working under the control of temperature self-adaptive interpolative controllers. This approach enables us to adapt such buildings, that are now confined to warm temperatures, to a wide range of climates, to value a great part of renewable resources of our cities and to initiate a process of increasing the carbon offset at large scale.

Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a stage between Cognitively Normal (CN) and AD, where a significant cognitive declination can be observed. The destruction of brain cells causes a reduction in the size of GM. Evaluation of changes in GM, may help in studying the overall brain transformations and accurate classification of different stages of AD. In this work, firstly skull of brain images is stripped for 5 different slices, then segmentation of GM is performed. Finally, the average number of pixels in grey region and the average atrophy in grey pixels per year is calculated and compared amongst CN, MCI, and AD patients of various ages and genders. It is observed that, for some subjects (in some particular ages) from different dementia stages, pattern of GM changes is almost identical. To solve this issue, we have used the concept of fuzzy membership functions to classify the dementia stages more accurately. It is observed from the comparison that average difference in the number of pixels between CN and MCI= 10.01%, CN and AD= 19.63%, MCI and AD= 10.72%. It can be also observed from the comparison that, the average atrophy in grey matter per year in CN= 1.92%, MCI= 3.13%, and AD= 4.33%.},

This paper describes groundwork for presenting the data in a compact, distinctive form, improving the procedures of applying keypoint detection algorithms to preprocess and reduce the relevant features of the imag es. Our method computes for an image a number of SURF keypoints in a given interval, by adapting the threshold related to the Hessian matrix blob detector. This type of approach allows selecting the level of detail to use in image description and gives us control over the computing time. We named this method DENOL (Descriptor Number On Limits) and tested it on images from two datasets, UCID and an original image database which we propose, IIT_DB. Very good retrieval results and a significantly reduced computing time are achieved.},

  abstract     = {Meeting basic psychological needs could be difficult to maintain in current pandemic times, mainly due to preventive measures involving social distancing or full quarantine, which seem to play a very important role in well-being. The theory of basic psychological needs is a sub-theory of human moti vation theory known as the theory of self-determination. This theory argues that meeting the needs of autonomy, relatedness and competence is crucial for motivation, optimal development, efficient functioning and health. Several research, examining the effects of basic psychological needs on well-being, concluded that changes in meeting the three needs had a significant effect on well-being. Because perceived stress plays a vital role in daily life, several coping strategies have been shown to effectively manage stress and reduce its negative consequences. In this study, coping mechanisms refer to both cognitive and behavioral efforts to alleviate or overcome stressful situations, especially when an automatic response is not readily available. The present study aims to examine a predictive model of competence need satisfaction based on adaptive coping mechanisms: active coping and positive reframing, on a convenience sampling of 403 Romanian respondents. Results show that 3% of the variance in competence need satisfaction is explained by active coping and positive reframing. In this work, we have used fuzzy logic modelling on our psychological data to deal with the imprecision and vagueness inherent in input data and build a more reliable model for estimating psychological variables relations. Implications and conclusions are discussed.},

So Coronavirus can only be confirmed with a diagnostic test. 218 countries and territories worldwide have reported a total of 59.6 million active cases of the COVID-19 and 1.4 million deaths as of November 24, 2020. Rapid, accurate and early medical diagnosis of the disease is vital at this stage. Researchers analyzed the CT and X-ray findings from a large number of patients with coronavirus pneumonia to draw their conclusions. In this paper, we applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. After that we moved on to deep transfer learning models such as VGG16 and Xception which are implemented using Keras and Tensor flow to detect positive coronavirus patient using X-ray images. VGG16 and Xception show better performances as compared to SVM. In our work, Xception gained an accuracy of 97.46% with 98% f-score.},

In this paper, a simple yet effective fall detection system based on computer vision. Novelty of this paper is that it uses the Yolo v2 network on the depth videos for extracting the subject from cluttered background. The robust performance of the YOLOv2 network ensures accurate subject detection and removes the need for any complicated fall detection algorithm. Fall detection is carried out using subject’s height to width ratio and fall velocity. These parameters are simple and easy to calculate and yet provide effective results.

The soil is also considered one of the key resources which must be dealt very rationally, due to its structure and complex processes from its function. In this paper we present a model of soil water management system, comprising the irrigation process, that also takes into account one of the main parameters of an irrigation system: the plastic material used for irrigation. The model optimally choses the best suited material and the optimal water content, also taking into account the geographical area of the soil. The main purpose of building the model is to create an optimization environment for the irrigation systems, with both financial and environmental implications. In this paper, we will present some results of the model of a drip irrigation management system. In this matter, we have used two methods based on genetic algorithms and System Dynamic principles that can achieve desired results for the problem proposed.

  abstract     = {Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive, obstructive lung disease that restricts airflow from the lungs. COPD patients are at risk of sudden and acute worsening of symptoms called exacerbations. Early identification and classification of COPD exacerbation can reduce COPD risks and improve patient’s healthcare and management. Pulse oximetry is a non-invasive technique used to assess patients with acutely worsening symptoms. As part of manual diagnosis based on pulse oximetry, clinicians examine three warning signs to classify COPD patients. This may lack high sensitivity and specificity which requires a blood test. However, laboratory tests require time, further delayed treatment and additional costs. This research proposes a prediction method for COPD patients’ classification based on pulse oximetry three manual warning signs and the resulting derived few key features that can be obtained in a short time. The model was developed on a robust physician labeled dataset with clinically diverse patient cases. Five classification algorithms were applied on the mentioned dataset and the results showed that the best algorithm is XGBoost with the accuracy of 91.04%, precision of 99.86%, recall of 82.19%, F1 measure value of 90.05% with an AUC value of 95.8%. Age, current and baseline heart rate, current and baseline pulse ox. (SPO2) were found the top most important predictors. These findings suggest the strength of XGBoost model together with the availability and the simplicity of input variables in classifying COPD daily living using a (wearable) pulse oximeter.},

In the second place, the existence of a unique global bounded solution and equilibrium point, global exponential stability and synchronization of the derived difference models are investigated. Compared with the classical fractional Euler differences, fuzzy Mittag-Leffler discrete-time genetic regulatory networks can better depict and retain the dynamic characteristics of the corresponding continuous-time models.

  abstract     = {This study presents a fault diagnosis method for rolling bearing based on multi-scale deep subdomain adaptation network (MSDSAN). The proposed MSDSAN, as improvement of deep subdomain adaptation network (DSAN), is an unsupervised transfer learning method. MSDSAN reduces the subdomain distribution d iscrepancy between domains rather than marginal distribution discrepancy, and so better domain invariant fault features are derived to avoid misalignment between domains. Aiming at avoiding fault information loss by fixed receptive fields feature extraction, selective kernel convolution module is introduced into feature extraction of MSDSAN, by which multiple receptive fields are applied to ensure an optimal receptive field for each working condition. Moreover, contribution rates are adaptively assigned to all receptive fields, and the disturbing information extracted by inappropriate receptive fields is further eliminated. As a result, more comprehensive and effective fault information is derived for bearing fault diagnosis. Fault diagnosis experiment of bearings is performed to verify the superiority of the proposed method, and the experimental results demonstrate that MSDSAN achieves better transfer effects and higher accuracy than SOTA methods under varying working conditions.},

In multiple cases, the NewSigmoid function gives a better or equivalent performance as compared with both these AF. Like these AF, NewSigmoid is also a smooth S-shape, bounded, continuously differentiable, and zero-centered function. Therefore the NewSigmoid is also suitable for solving non-linear problems. We have tested this AF on iris, cancer, glass, chemical, bodyfat, wine, and ovarian datasets. We use Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG), Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), and Bayesian Regularization (BR) algorithms during the optimization of the neural network. Maximum 100% accuracy in the iris dataset while using LM, and BR; 99.9% accuracy in the cancer dataset using BR; 100% accuracy in the glass dataset using BR; 100% accuracy in the chemical and bodyfat dataset using SCG, LM, and BR; 100% accuracy in the wine dataset using LM, and BR; and 99.1% accuracy in the ovarian dataset using BR has been found while working with multilayer neural networks.

In view of the advantages of q-rung orthopair uncertain linguistic variables (q-ROULVs) in depicting uncertain information, a new DTRSs model based on q-ROUL Vs is proposed to solve three-way group decision-making (3WGDM) problems. Firstly, the loss function of DTRSs is depicted by q-ROULVs and a q-rung orthopair uncertain linguistic DTRSs model is constructed subsequently. Secondly, to aggregate different experts’ evaluation results on loss function in group decision-making (GDM) scenario, the q-rung orthopair uncertain linguistic geometric Heronian mean (q-ROULGHM) operator and the q-rung orthopair uncertain linguistic weighted geometric Heronian mean (q-ROULWGHM) operator are presented. Related properties of the proposed operators are investigated. Thirdly, to compare the expected loss of each alternative, a new score function of q-ROULVs is defined and the corresponding decision rules for 3WGDM are deduced. Finally, an illustrative example of venture capital in high-tech projects is provided to verify the rationality and effectiveness of our method. The influence of different conditional probabilities and parameter values on decision results is comprehensively discussed.},

PFS has been successfully applied in the field of fuzzy multiple criteria decision making (MCDM). Correlation coefficient is an information measure of PFS, and plays an important role in the application of PFS. At present, there is a problem that the existing correlation coefficients cannot moderately measure the correlation degree between PFSs, so this paper proposes the new correlation coefficients of PFS. The TODIM method has been proved to be effective in dealing with MCDM problems that consider the psychological behavior of decision makers. This paper extends the TODIM method with the new correlation coefficients of PFS, and the extended TODIM method is called Pythagorean fuzzy CC-TODIM method. By numerical examples, it is verified that the new correlation coefficients of PFS are more reasonable and valid. By case analysis, it is verified that the Pythagorean fuzzy CC-TODIM method can effectively solve the MCDM problems, and the Pythagorean fuzzy CC-TODIM method based on the new correlation coefficients is more accurate and reliable.},

The closed-form expressions for t he optimal solutions are derived and the results suggest that the distribution of customer valuations, yield rate and demand uncertainties have a vital influence on the firm’s optimal prices and profits. We then extend our study by allowing stockout-based substitution where a customer may be willing to purchase a substitute if his most preferred product is not available but the substitute provides him with non-negative utility. The results indicate that disregarding stockout-based substitution (i) results in severe supply-demand mismatches for the product line in two directions; (ii) leads to higher or lower profit margins for both products; (iii) may not cause profit loss when the prices of both products are exogenous; however, this result does not hold when the prices are endogenous.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the design and development of a novel approach, centered on the creation and development of a fuzzy controller to analyze electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The fuzzy controller makes use of the functions associated with the different regions of the brain to correlate multiple B rodmann areas to several outputs, where a normal analysis would associate only one region to one output. This controller was designed to quickly adapt to any data imported into it. The current implemented framework supports a math study. The math subjects’ outputs were attuned to their related study which involved transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which is a form of neurostimulation. Anode affinity, cathode affinity, calculation, memory, and decision making were the outputs focused on for the math study. This task is best suited to a fuzzy controller since interactions between Brodmann areas can be analyzed and the contributions of each area accounted for by indicating which regions have stronger and weaker effects on any given output.},

In order to enhance ATS for single document in huge datasets, a new extractive graph framework - text extractive SUMmarization framework based on EDge information with COreference resolution EDCOSUM is proposed in this paper that relies on coreference resolution, adding edge information in word-level graph and a sentence-ranking strategy. EDCOSUM combines the graph-based and statistical-based extractive summarization methods. It is a general method for any document (not limited to a specific domain). Moreover, two ranking strategies(sentence and LSA ranking strategy) are proposed for sentence selection. A set of extensive experiments on CNN/Daily Mail and NEWSROOM are conducted for investigating the proposed method. The widely used automatic evaluation tool: Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation(ROUGE) is utilized to evaluate EDCOSUM. Compared to the state-of-the-art ATS methods, EDCOSUM achieves a competitive result by improvements of over the highest scores in the literature for metrics ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L respectively.},

Delay and uncertain interference often lead to changes in the stability of the system. Establishing the judgment of the stability of uncertain delay different ial system conditions is very important. Based on the strong Lipschitz condition, the judgment of p-th moment stability for uncertain delay differential equations (UDDEs) has been investigated. Actually, the strong Lipschitz condition is assumed that it only relates to the current state, it is difficult to be employed to determine the stability in p-th moment for the UDDEs. In this paper, we consider two kinds of new Lipschitz conditions containing the current state and the past state, which are more weaker than the strong Lipschitz condition. Meanwhile, new sufficient theorems and corollaries under the new Lipschitz conditions as the tools to judge the p-th moment stability for the UDDEs are proved. Some examples explain the rationality of the corresponding theorems and corollaries.},

  abstract     = {In the era of big data, recommender systems (RSs) have become growing essential tools. They represent important machine learning solutions that mainly contribute to keeping users engaged with personalized content in e-platforms. Several RSs have been proposed in the literature, and most of them hav e focused on English content. However, for content in other languages like Arabic, very restricted works have been done to develop RSs. In recent times, the Arabic content on the Web has increased significantly because of the growing number of Arabic web users. This highlights the need for building RSs for Arabic content. To better handle this challenge, we decided to provide the research community with a novel deep learning (DL)-based RS devoted to Arabic content. The main goal of the proposed RS is to predict user preferences from textual reviews written in the Arabic language. This is achieved by combining two independent DL techniques into one system: a convolutional neural network (CNN)-text processor for representing users and items; and a neural network, in particular, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to estimate interactions between user-item pairs. Extensive experiments on four large-scale Arabic datasets demonstrate that our proposed system can achieve better prediction accuracy than other state-of-the-art alternatives. Notably, it improves the MSE between 0.84% and 16.96%, and the MAE between 0.14% and 13.71%. This work is the first attempt designed to deal with a large volume of data in the Arabic context, opening up new research possibilities for future developments of Arabic RSs.},

First, compare d to classical concept lattice theory, the interval concept lattice theory can deal with uncertain information more accurately. It is used to extract the objects within the interval parameters [α, β], and then interval concepts and lattice structure are built. Second, based on the interval concepts and lattice structure, the association rule mining algorithm is designed to further extract the association rules under different interval parameters. Third, to obtain the effective association degree between two objects, the rule optimization algorithm is put forward by comparing the update of rules. Finally, the association degree can indirectly reflect the substitutability between products. Then the price of a new product can be determined.

The goal is to minimize the energy consumption and completion time for all of the jobs’ production. Firstly, a general mathematic model for EE-MRFJSP is set up, in which the unit energy consumptions of the main resource’s different states are varied, and a constraint formula to ensure no crossover working periods for any resource is included. Then, a non-dominated sorting teaching-learning-based optimization(NSTLBO) algorithm is proposed to solving the problem, the details of NSTLBO include the real encoding method, Giffler Thompson rule for decoding, non-dominated sorting rule to rank the pareto sets and crowding distance of solution for maintaining the population’s diversity, and the traditional two evolving stages: teacher education and student mutual study. Finally, comparative experiments are made based on some new designed instances, and the results verify our proposed NSTLBO algorithm can effectively solve the EE-MMFJSP, and has obvious advantages by comparing with NSGA-II, NRGA, and MOPSO.},

  abstract     = {The face is a dominant biometric for recognizing a person. However, face recognition becomes challenging when there are severe changes in lighting conditions, i.e., illumination variations, which have been shown to have a more severe effect on recognition performance than the inherent differences b etween individuals. Most of the existing methods for tackling the problem of illumination variation assume that illumination lies in the large-scale component of a facial image; as such, the large-scale component is discarded, and features are extracted from small-scale components. Recently, it has been shown that large-scale component is also important; in addition, small-scale component contains detrimental noise features. Keeping this in view, we introduce a method for illumination invariant face recognition that exploits large-scale and small-scale components by discarding the illumination artifacts and detrimental noise using ContourletDS. After discarding the unwanted components, local and global features are extracted using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model; we examined three widely employed CNN models: VGG-16, GoogLeNet, and ResNet152. To reduce the dimensions of local and global features and fuse them, we employ linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Finally, ridge regression is used for recognition. The method was evaluated on three benchmark datasets; it achieved accuracies of 99.7%, 100%, and 79.76% on Extended Yale B, AR, and M-PIE, respectively. The comparison reveals that it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Time series forecasting (TSF) is significant for many applications, therefore the exploration and study for this problem has been proceeding. With the advances of computing power, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown powerful performance on many machine learning tasks when considerable amounts of data can be used. However, sufficient data may be unavailable in some scenarios, which leads to performance degradation or even not working of DNN-based models. In this paper, we focus on few-shot time series forecasting task and propose to employ meta-learning to alleviate the problems caused by insufficient training data. Therefore, we propose a meta-learning-based prediction mechanism for few-shot time series forecasting task, which mainly consists of meta-training and meta-testing. The meta-training phase uses first-order model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm (MAML) as a core component to conduct cross-task training, and thus our method also inherits the advantages of the MAML, i.e., model-agnostic, in the sense that our method is compatible with any model trained with gradient descent. In the meta-testing phase, the DNN-based models are fine-tuned by the small number of time series data from an unseen task in the meta-training phase. We design two groups of comparison models to validate the effectiveness of our method. The first group, as the baseline models, is trained directly on specific time series dataset from target task. The second group, as comparison models, is trained by our proposed method. Also, we conduct data sensitivity study to validate the robustness of our method. The experimental results indicate the second group models outperform the first in different degrees in terms of prediction accuracy and convergence speed, and our method has strong robustness for forecast horizons and data scales.},

About the existing problems, we introduce the fuzzy clustering and propose a co llaborative filtering algorithm based on fuzzy C-means clustering. The algorithm performs fuzzy clustering on the item attribute information to make items belonging to different categories in different membership degree, increases the data density, effectively reduces the data sparsity, and solves the issue that the inaccuracy of similarity leads to the low recommendation accuracy. Meanwhile, the algorithm introduces the time weight function. Different evaluation times give different time weight values, and recently evaluated items are more representative of the user current interest, so we give a higher weight value, and early evaluated items have less effect on the user current interest, thus the weight value are relatively lower. The experimental results show that our algorithm can effectively alleviate the data sparsity problem and time migration of users preferences, thus achieve better performance.},

Due to the harsh outdoor environment, researchers cannot squat in the deep forest for a long time. Therefore, designing a sensor network system for wildlife monitoring is of great value to wildli fe research, protection, and management. When deploying a wildlife monitoring network in the wild environment, it is necessary to solve the problem of the effective use of energy. To this end, this paper proposes an energy-saving optimization method for node scheduling and a wake-up scheme based on a cultural genetic algorithm. This method achieves the purpose of energy saving by making redundant nodes fall asleep and waking up sleep nodes to repair the coverage blind area caused by dead nodes. Simulation results show that this method can activate fewer sensor nodes to monitor the required sensing area, and its performance is better than other known solutions.},

  abstract     = {An important feature of the outbreak of systemic financial risk is that the linkage and contagion of risk amongst the various sub-markets of the financial system have increased significantly. In addition, research on the prediction of systemic financial risk plays a significant role in the sustaina ble development of the financial market. Therefore, this paper takes China’s financial market as its research object, considers the risks co-activity among major financial sub-markets, and constructs a financial composite indicator of systemic stress (CISS) for China, describing its financial systemic stress based on 12 basic indicators selected from the money market, bond market, stock market, and foreign exchange market. Furthermore, drawing on the decomposition and integration technology in the TEI@I complex system research methodology, this paper introduces advanced variational mode decomposition (VMD) technology and extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithms, constructing the VMD-DE-ELM hybrid model to predict the systemic risk of China’s financial market. According to eRMSE, eMAE, and eMAPE, the prediction model’s multistep-ahead forecasting effect is evaluated. The empirical results show that the China’s financial CISS constructed in this paper can effectively identify all kinds of risk events in the sample range. The results of a robustness test show that the overall trend of China’s financial CISS and its ability to identify risk events are not affected by parameter selection and have good robustness. In addition, compared with the benchmark model, the VMD-DE-ELM hybrid model constructed in this paper shows superior predictive ability for systemic financial risk.},

We a pply the potential of if-then rules and a new approach called Z-number that considers fuzzy constraints and reliability at the same time. Exerting Z-number in this research took maximum advantage of reducing uncertainty for predicting failures. Additionally, this research has a practical aspect in maintenance systems by using if-then rules that rely on Z-number. The proposed approach can cover the expert idea during drill operation time simultaneously. This approach also helps experts encounter ambiguous situations and formulate uncertainties. Experts or drill operators can consider key factors of drilling collapse along with the reliability of these factors. The proposed approach can be applied to a real-life situation of human inference with probability for the purpose of predicting failures during drilling. Hence, this method has excellent flexibility for implementation in various maintenance systems.},

  abstract     = {Three-way decisions (TWDs) theory is one of the core ideas of decision-theoretic rough sets (DTRSs). Reviewing the existing research results, we find that TWDs provides us with more flexible decision choices. And the traditional fuzzy number does not take into account the absence of information (in difference) in the evaluation process. In order to construct a new model which can get flexible decision results in complex decision environment, we introduce four-branch fuzzy numbers (FBFNs) to describe the evaluation information, so that the decision-makers can express the evaluation information more comprehensively. In this paper, a novel TWDs model in four-branch fuzzy environment is proposed to solve multiple-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem. The first challenge is to construct a TWDs model based on FBFNs and to develop a new linguistic interpretation of the loss functions. Then, we extend a method for aggregating the loss functions obtained from the attribute evaluation values. Finally, we use the nonlinear solution to solve the threshold, and apply TOPSIS method to solve the conditional probability of FBFNs. The effectiveness of this method is illustrated by an example, and the decision results are compared with a MADM method based on OWGA operator.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Things (IoT) services are directly deployed on resource-constrained smart devices. Smart devices are characteristic by spatial and temporal constraints and energy limitations. A single IoT service cannot meet the complex requirements of users, so multiple IoT services need to be combine d to provide services to users. As more and more smart devices are deployed in IoT, how to select IoT services with lower energy consumption and better quality of service (QoS) for service composition becomes a challenging problem. Combined with the characteristics that the data information of IoT is closely related to geographical location, the GeoHash algorithm is used to locally screen services based on geographical location, so as to narrow the range of candidate services. For smart devices with energy constraints, this paper proposes a combined optimization model. The model considers not only the transmission energy consumption and switching energy consumption, but also the execution energy consumption when the device provides services. In order to balance QoS attributes and energy consumption, the composition problem is regarded as a multi-objective optimization problem and solved using a genetic algorithm (GA). The simulation results show that service composition scheme selected by this service composition optimization model has lower energy consumption and higher service quality.},

In addition, some interesting properties of the reverse triple I method of PFMP and PFMT inference models are analysed, including the robustness, continuity and reversibility. Finally, a practical problem is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the reverse triple I method for PFMP in decision-making problems. The advantages of the new method over existing methods are also expounded. Overall, compared with the existing methods, the proposed methods are based on logical reasoning rather than using aggregation operators, so the novel methods are more logical, can better deal with the uncertain problems in complex decision-making environments and can completely reflect the decision-making opinions of decision-makers.},

  abstract     = {Caption generation using an encoder-decoder approach has recently been extensively studied and implemented in various domains, including image captioning and code captioning. In this research article, we propose one particular approach for completing a capture generation task using an “attention”-b ased sequence-to-sequence framework that, when combined with a conventional encoder-decoder model, generates captions in an attention-based manner. ResNet-152 is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based encoder that generates a comprehensive representation of an input image while embedding that into a fixed size length vector. To predict the next sentence, the decoder uses LSTM, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and an attention-based mechanism to concentrate attention on certain sections of an image selectively. Define a set of epochs to 69, which should be enough for training the model to generate informative descriptions, and the validation loss has reached its minimum limit and no longer decreases. We present the datasets as well as the evaluation metrics, as well as quantitative and qualitative analysis. Experiments on the MSCOCO and Flickr8k benchmark datasets illustrate the model’s efficacy in comparison to the baseline techniques. On MSCOCO, evaluation scores included BLEU-1 0.81, BLEU-2 0.61, BLEU-3 0.47, and 0.33 METEOR. For Flickr8k BLEU-1 0.68, BLEU-2 0.49, BLEU-3 0.41, METEOR 0.23, and 0.86 on SPICE. The proposed approach is comparable with several state-of-the-art methods in terms of standard evaluation metric, demonstrating that it can produce more accurate and richer captions.},

The objective of the paper is to construct temporal classification framework using stacked Gated Recurrent Unit (S-GRU) for predicting ozone level. Ozone level prediction plays a vital role for accomplishing healthy living environment. Temporal missing value imputation and temporal classification are two functions performed by the proposed system. In temporal missing value imputation, the temporal correlated k-nearest neighbors (TCO-KNN) approach is presented to address missing values. Using attribute dependency based KNN, the nearest significant set is identified for each missing value. The missing values are imputed using the mean values from the determined closest significant set.

The semantic proposals offer a superior comprehension of textual data and serve to altogether precision the exactness of numerous mining operations in text assignments. The extraction of concepts from textual data is a significant step forward in content analysis at the concept stage. We present a CLSA-CapsNet method that extracts concepts from natural language text. Then the extracted concepts are applied in Capsule networks (CapsNet). Moreover, the integration of Concept Level Sentiment Analysis (CLSA) and Capsule Networks (CapsNet) has not yet been implemented on the hotel review dataset. This is the first attempt, which we researched and embraced by the capsule network, to develop classification models for hotel reviews. The developed results demonstrated excellent performance with a prediction accuracy of 86.6% for CLSA-CapsNet models, respectively. Various similarities have also been made across our techniques and they are implemented by some other deep learning algorithms, such as rnn-lstm. Overall, the outstanding success obtained by CLSA-CapsNet in this investigation highlights its ability in the hotel review dataset.

Deep network ensembles are demonstrated great potential for the task of sentences classification. In order to boost the performance of CNN-based SATD detecting, we propose a deep neural network ensemble contribute to ensemble learning in a simple yet effective way. Specifically, CNN, CNN-LSTM (convolutional neural network and long short-term memory), and DPCNN (Deep Pyramid Convolutional Neural Networks) are used as individual classifiers to diversify the deep network ensembles. In order to improve the explainability, we introduce attention to measure the contribution of feature words to SATD classification. 62,285 source code comments from 10 projects were used in our experiments. The results show that our approach can effectively reduce misjudgment and detect more SATD, especially for cross-project, so as to greatly improve the detection accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Over the past decade, the computer vision community has given increased attention to the development of age estimation systems. Several approaches to more accurate and robust facial age estimation have been introduced. Apparent age datasets are typically collected from uncontrolled environments, le ading to a number of challenges. In this paper, a cascade model system, which we called the ‘Integrated Classification and Regression with Landmark Ratios (ICRL), is introduced. Our system uses a classification model in order to learn the age label distribution, then uses this knowledge as an auxiliary input to a regression model. ICRL is based on context facial information and label distribution analysis. Facial context information is introduced through the extraction of precise facial landmark ratios. Extracted landmark ratios allow the system to distinguish each age label. The ICRL system uses a classification model to train the CNN network to learn the in-between relation of age labels. ICRL sufficiently models the aging process in the form of ordered and continuous imagery. The ICRL system minimizes the number of parameters needed as well as overall computational costs whilst maintaining robust and accurate results. Despite its simplicity, our system has outperformed other state-of-the-art approaches when applied onto the MORPH II, CLAP2015, AFAD and UTKFace datasets. ICRL achieved an overall superior predictive performance, reaching 99.67% with MORPH II, 99.51% with AFAD, 96.52 with CLAP2015, and 96.28% with UTKFace.},

Thus, an attention mechanism module with high accuracy and low model complexity is designed to incorporate into MobileNet so that the cattle face under occlusion can be identify accurately, which is the RGB images captured in the ranch environment. In this paper, we also construct a Simmental cattle face image dataset for data modeling and method evaluation, which contains 10,239 images of 103 cattle. The experimental results show that when the occluder is in the upper left and lower right corner, if the occlusion rate is less than 30%, the value of Top_1 reaches more than 90%; if it is less than 50%, the value of Top_1 is more than 80%. Even if the middle part occludes lots of important information, the occlusion rate of 40% has an accuracy of more than 80%. Furthermore, comparing the proposal model with MobileNet, the parameter and model size are equal, and the amount of calculation as a cost increase a little. Therefore, the proposal model is suitable to transplant to the embedded system in the future.},

  abstract     = {The density peaks clustering algorithm (DPC) has been widely concerned since it was proposed in 2014. There is no need to specify in advance and only one parameter required. However, some disadvantages are still witnessed in DPC: (1) Requiring repeated experiments for choosing a suitable calculatio n method of the local density due to the variations in the scale of the dataset, which will lead to additional time cost. (2) Difficulty in finding an optimal cutoff distance threshold, since different parameters not only impact the selection of cluster centers but also directly affect the quality of clusters. (3) Poor fault tolerance of the allocation strategy, especially in manifold datasets or datasets with uneven density distribution. Targetting solutions to these problems, a density peaks clustering based on local fair density and fuzzy k-nearest neighbors membership allocation strategy (LF-DPC) is proposed in this paper. First, to obtain a more balanced local density, two classic local density calculation methods are combined in the algorithm to calculate the local fair density through the optimization function with the smallest local density difference. Second, a robust two stage remaining points allocation strategy is designed. In the first stage, k-nearest neighbors are used to quickly and accurately allocate points from the cluster center. In the second stage, to further improve the accuracy of allocation, a fuzzy k-nearest neighbors membership method is designed to allocate the remaining points. Finally, the LF-DPC algorithm has been experimented based on several synthetic and real-world datasets. The results prove that the proposed algorithm has obvious advantages compared with the other five ones.},

  abstract     = {This study is devoted to the development of an Adaptive-Neuro-Fuzzy-Inference-System (ANFIS) model for the prediction of ultimate load of rectangular concrete-filled steel tubular structural members. The learning process of the model is performed by conducting a combination of backpropagation gradi ent descent and least-squares techniques. The performance of the model is examined by several quality metrics such as coefficient of determination (R2), Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE), Mean-Absolute-Error (MAE), Index of Agreement (IA) and Slope of linear regression. Monte Carlo random sampling technique is employed to propagate input variations to the output response. Moreover, the performance of ANFIS is also compared with other machine learning models including Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Ensemble. Results show that the ANFIS model yields higher prediction performance than other machine learning models, for both training and testing data points and regarding all quality metrics. For instance, using training data points, the ANFIS model exhibits a RMSE of 0.0283 compared to 0.0342, 0.0588, 0.0291, and 0.0464 using ANN, Ensemble, GPR, and SVM, respectively (the corresponding gain values are+17.3%,+51.9%,+2.8%, and+39.0%, respectively). On the other hand, using testing data points, the ANFIS model exhibits a RMSE of 0.0276 compared to 0.0393, 0.0987, 0.0403, and 0.0460 using ANN, Ensemble, GPR, and SVM, respectively (the corresponding values of gain are+29.8%,+72.1%,+31.5%, and+40.0%, respectively). The same observation can be made for other quality metrics. It can be concluded that the ANFIS model outperforms other models for both training and testing datasets. The ANFIS model is also compared with existing works in the past, showing its improvement in prediction results. Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the degree of effect of the input parameters on the ultimate load.},

  abstract     = {Defectiveness of items is generally considered as a certain value in acceptance sampling plans (ASPs). It is clear that, it may not be certainly known in some real-case problems. Uncertainties of the inspection process such as measurement errors, inspectors’ hesitancies or vagueness of the process etc. should be taken into account to obtain more reliable results. The fuzzy set theory (FST) is one of the best methods to overcome these problems. There are some studies in the literature formulating the ASPs with the help of FST. Deciding the right membership functions of the fuzzy sets (FSs) has a vital importance on the quality of the uncertainty modeling. Additionally, the fuzzy set extensions have been offered to model more complicated uncertainties to achieve better modeling. As one of these extensions, type-2 fuzzy sets (T2FSs) gives an ability to model uncertainty in situations where it is not possible to determine exact membership function parameters. In this study, single and double ASPs based on interval T2FSs (IT2FSs) have been designed for binomial and Poisson distributions. Thus, it becomes possible to make more flexible, sensitive and descriptive sensitivity analyzes. The main characteristic functions of ASPs have been derived and the suggested formulations have been illustrated on a comparative application from manufacturing process. Results allowing for more comprehensive analysis as against to the traditional and T1FSs based plans have been obtained.},

Hence the selection task becomes a fuzzy decision making with the uncertainty involved. A combination of fuzzy clustering and Interval Type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FS) is proposed in such scenarios. An experiment is conducted over a resume dataset containing fifteen hundred resumes for a particular job description. Firstly, Fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM) is applied for selective clustering, while decision-making under uncertainty is carried through IT2FS. The candidates in the selected cluster are given a score for ranking as per the skillset criteria. The final decision for shortlisting the resumes is carried through IT2FS. The model shows an average accuracy of 88.2% with an F1-score of 0.76 compared to (K-means + IT2FS) model with an F1-score of 0.72. Thus, the proposed model performs better while decision-making under uncertainty.},

The proposed system comprises two stages. In the first stage, a Face Similar Matrix (FSM) guided by the Structural Similarity Index Measure is generated to provide the necessary information to recover from the lost regions of the face image. The FSM generates Related Face (RF) images similar to the probe image. In the second stage, these RF images are considered as related information and used as input data to generate eigenspaces using PCA to reconstruct the occluded face region exploiting the relationship between the occluded region and related face images, which contain relevant data to recover from the occluded area. Experimental results with five standard datasets viz. Caspeal-R1, IMFDB, and FEI have proven that the proposed method works well under illumination changes and occlusion of facial images.},

For this managing with such sorts of issues, the principle of Linear Diophantine uncertain linguistic set is a valuable and capable technique to manage awkward and inconsistent information in everyday life problems. In this manuscript, we propose the original idea of Linear Diophantine uncertain linguistic set and elaborated their essential laws. Additionally, to determine the association among any numbers of attributes, we elaborated the Linear Diophantine uncertain linguistic arithmetic Heronian mean operator, Linear Diophantine uncertain linguistic weighted arithmetic Heronian mean operator, Linear Diophantine uncertain linguistic geometric Heronian mean operator, Linear Diophantine uncertain linguistic weighted geometric Heronian mean operator, and their properties are also discovered. By using these operators, we utilize the multi-attribute decision-making procedure by using elaborated operators. To determine the consistency and validity of the elaborated operators, we illustrate some examples by using explored operators. Finally, the superiority and comparative analysis of the elaborated operators with some existing operators are also determined and justified with the help of a graphical point of view.},

  abstract     = {Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is an effective tool utilized in various fields for discovering and eliminating potential failures in products and services, which is usually implemented based on experts’ linguistic assessments. However, incomprehensive weigh information of risk factors and experts, lacking the consideration of experts’ randomness and hesitation, and incomplete risk factor system is essential challenges for the traditional FMEA model. Therefore, to properly handle these challenges and further enhance the performance of the traditional FMEA, this study develops a new FMEA strategy for assessing and ranking failures’ risks. First, a novel concept of intuitionistic fuzzy clouds (IFCs) is developed by combining the merits of the intuitionistic fuzzy set theory and the cloud model theory in manipulating uncertain information. Some basic operations and the Minkowski-type distance measure of IFCs are also presented and discussed. Further, in the proposed FMEA model, two combination weighting methods are developed to determine the synthetic weights of experts and risk factors, respectively, which consider subjectivity and objectivity simultaneously. In addition, maintenance (M) is considered as a new risk factor to enrich the assessment factor system and facilitate a more reasonable risk assessment result. Finally, a case study is implemented along with comparisons to demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the presented FMEA model.},

  abstract     = {Seismic data obtained from seismic stations are the major source of the information used to forecast earthquakes. With the growth in the number of seismic stations, the size of the dataset has also increased. Traditionally, STA/LTA and AIC method have been applied to process seismic data. However, the enormous size of the dataset reduces accuracy and increases the rate of missed detection of the P and S wave phase when using these traditional methods. To tackle these issues, we introduce the novel U-net-Bidirectional Long-Term Memory Deep Network (UBDN) which can automatically and accurately identify the P and S wave phases from seismic data. The U-net based UBDN strongly maintains the U-net’s high accuracy in edge detection for extracting seismic phase features. Meanwhile, it also reduces the missed detection rate by applying the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) mode that processes timing signals to establish the relationship between seismic phase features. Experimental results using the Stanford University seismic dataset and data from the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake aftershock confirm that the proposed UBDN method is very accurate and has a lower rate of missed phase detection, outperforming solutions that adapt traditional methods by an order of magnitude in terms of error percentage.},

The detection algorithm based on deep lea rning is used to detect dynamic objects in the environment, and the dynamic feature points are removed before the matching of feature points to reduce the impact of dynamic objects on the positioning accuracy; A method for distinguishing “pseudo-dynamic objects” is proposed to solve the problem that the stationary vehicles and pedestrians in the environment are regarded as dynamic objects. The parallel computing framework for feature point extraction and matching is established on CPU-GPU heterogeneous platform to speed up DP-PE; In the localization part of DP-PE, we propose a 3D interior point detection strategy to achieve parallel search of map points, and the saturated linear kernel function is used to act on reprojection error to realize the parallelization of pose optimization. We verify the algorithm on KITTI dataset, the experimental results show that average speedup ratio of feature point extraction and matching is 6.5 times, and the overall computational efficiency of DP-PE is about 7 times higher than that before acceleration, which can realize high precision and efficient pose estimation in dynamic scene.},

In the light of the selected and processed data and some other auxiliary approaches, the writer suggests that a modernized monitoring system be established to improve English teaching quality. Under this system, teachers’ and students’ English level can be evaluated in an objective way. Consequently, the subsequent measures such as teachers’ promotion as well as students’ development and employment and the evaluation of the quality of test-papers can be taken scientifically. We can solve the above issues with help of multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) method. Depending on the VIKOR steps and given intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs), this paper devises the IF-VIKOR to assess the teaching quality of college English. In addition, the weights of attribute are derived through CRITIC method. Then, the VIKOR method is extended to IFSs to derive the order of each alternative. Therefore, all alternatives could be ranked and the best one can be identified. Eventually, we give an example of college English teaching quality evaluation, according to some comparison with other methods to make an analysis, the results show that the method proposed in such paper is effective and easy to compute.},

Existing classification methods fail to make full use of the graph topology to improve the classification performance. To alleviate it, we propose a Dual Graph Wavelet neural Network composed of two identical graph wavelet neural networks sharing network parameters. These two networks are integrated with a semi-supervised loss function and carry out supervised learning and unsupervised learning on two matrixes representing the graph topology extracted from the same graph dataset, respectively. One matrix embeds the local consistency information and the other the global consistency information. To reduce the computational complexity of the convolution operation of the graph wavelet neural network, we design an approximate scheme based on the first type Chebyshev polynomial. Experimental results show that the proposed network significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for vertex classification on all three benchmark datasets and the proposed approximation scheme is validated for datasets with low vertex average degree when the approximation order is small.},

Given this, this paper presents an efficient semantic dynamic SLAM (ESD-SLAM), which is suitable for dynamic scenar ios. Based on the ORB-SLAM2 framework, the ESD-SLAM we proposed employs lightweight semantic segmentation network FcHarDNet to extract semantic information, and uses the region growing algorithm to optimize the semantic segmentation boundary. Then dynamic objects are removed by combining semantic information with multi-view geometry, and it further improves the localization accuracy. Combining semantic information and depth information, a dense point cloud map of static scene is constructed to serve the planning task of mobile robot. We conduct the experiments on the public TUM RGB-D dataset and in the real-world environment. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the performance of the ORB-SLAM2 system in dynamic scenes, and significantly improve the real-time performance compared with other same type dynamic SLAM algorithms.},

Thirdly, we created a vehicle dataset under the conditions of complicated and varied weather and lighting conditions, and conducted comparative experiments using the SEU vehicle dataset. Experimental results show much better performance of the proposed FDCNN with RMSprop optimizer on recognizing vehicle types. Specifically, the average classification accuracies of six vehicle types, such as truck, coach, sedan, minivan, pickup and SUV, are over 96.8%. Among the six classes of vehicle types, sedan is the most difficult to classify and the proposed FDCNN achieved over 93.81% accuracy in comparative experiments.},

To solve this problem, Depthwise Separable Convolution and Squeeze-and-Excitation Residual U-Networks (DSRU-Net) is proposed to segment MRI. Squeeze-and-Excitation method is a channel attention mechanism. The proposed method is conducive to simplify ResU-Net model, making ResU-Net more convenient to be applied to mobile MRI device.

The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation values obtained by the proposed method in 5 PROMISE12 samples and 15 ACDC samples are 0.9889 and 0.9652, respectively.

  abstract     = {Slime mould algorithm (SMA) is a new metaheuristic algorithm proposed in 2020, which has attracted extensive attention from scholars. Similar to other optimization algorithms, SMA also has the drawbacks of slow convergence rate and being trapped in local optimum at times. Therefore, the enhanced S MA named as ESMA is presented in this paper for solving global optimization problems. Two effective methods composed of multiple mutation strategy (MMS) and restart mechanism (RM) are embedded into the original SMA. MMS is utilized to increase the population diversity, and the RM is used to avoid the local optimum. To verify the ESMA’s performance, twenty-three classical benchmark functions are employed, as well as three well-known engineering design problems, including welded beam design, pressure vessel design and speed reducer design. Several famous optimization algorithms are also chosen for comparison. Experimental results show that the ESMA outperforms other optimization algorithms in most of the test functions with faster convergence speed and higher solution accuracy, which indicates the merits of proposed ESMA. The results of Wilcoxon signed-rank test also reveal that ESMA is significant superior to other comparative optimization algorithms. Moreover, the results of three constrained engineering design problems demonstrate that ESMA is better than comparative algorithms.},

To obtain the desired transient performance and precise estimations of uncertain terms, the techniques of neural network control, sliding mode control and composite learning contr ol are incorporated into the proposed control method. The presented control strategy can ensure the tracking error converges to a prescribed small residual set. Compared with the persistent excitation condition required in the conventional adaptive control, the interval excitation condition needed in the proposed control approach is weak, which guarantees that the radial basis function neural networks approximate the unknown nonlinear terms more accurately. Finally, two simulation examples are exploited to manifest the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, solving combinatorial optimization problems involves more complications, high dimensions, and multi-objective considerations. Combining the advantages of other evolutionary algorithms to enhance the performance of a unique evolutionary algorithm and form a new hybrid heuristic algo rithm has become a way to strengthen the performance of the algorithm effectively. However, the intelligent hybrid heuristic algorithm destroys the integrity, universality, and robustness of the original algorithm to a certain extent and increases its time complexity. This paper implements a new idea “ML to choose heuristics” (a heuristic algorithm combined with machine learning technology) which uses the Q-learning method to learn different strategies in genetic algorithm. Moreover, a selection-based hyper-heuristic algorithm is obtained that can guide the algorithm to make decisions at different time nodes to select appropriate strategies. The algorithm is the hybrid strategy using Q-learning on StudGA (HSQ-StudGA). The experimental results show that among the 14 standard test functions, the evolutionary algorithm guided by Q-learning can effectively improve the quality of arithmetic solution. Under the premise of not changing the evolutionary structure of the algorithm, the hyper-heuristic algorithm represents a new method to solve combinatorial optimization problems.},

However, there are still challenges in the field of FER caused by the diversity and variation of facial expressions in real scenes, the singleness of feat ure type and the lack of enough discriminant features cannot effectively improve the recognition performance. To solve these problems, we propose a Multi-feature Fusion Network (MFNet) with dual-branch based on deep learning. Firstly, the MFNet uses the pyramid parallel multiscale residual network structure with progressive max-pooling of channel attention to extract multi-level facial features and enhance the discrimination of features; In the meantime, a shallow Gabor convolutional network is designed to enhance the adaptation of learned features to the orientation and scale changes and improve the ability to capture local details features; Finally, the maximum expression features obtained by the above two networks are fused to make more effective expression recognition. Experiments on three public large-scale wild FER datasets (RAF-DB, FERPlus, and AffectNet) show that our MFNet has a superior recognition performance than other recognition methods.},

Moreover, the mixture distribution is a co-integration of double Pareto and Laplace probability distributions with various param eters. The key objective of the newly proposed methodology is to obtained optimal solutions for complex multimodal optimization problems. Hence, for its global comparison, the newly proposed mixture distribution crossover operator (MDX) is compared with double Pareto (DPX), Laplace (LX), and simulated binary (SBX) crossover operators within the conjunction of three mutation operators (MTPM, PM, and NUM). After a descriptive comparison, a Quade multiple comparison test is also administered to examine its statistical significance. Furthermore, the performance of the genetic algorithm (GA) is also examined on a set of twenty-one unconstraint benchmark functions with diverse features. The empirical results of the simulation-based study reveal that the mixture-based crossover operator obtained a substantial dominance over all considered crossover operators in terms of computational complexity, robustness, scalability, and capability of exploration and exploitation. Moreover, the Quade multiple comparison test also showed a significant superiority with graphical authentication of the performance index (PI).},

In this paper, we use both of them to drive the supervised learning of UAP, termed as fully supervised UAP(FS-UAP), and design a progressive optimization strategy to solve the FS-UAP. Specifically, we define an internal layers supervised objective relying on multiple major internal layers’ activation to estimate the deviations of adversarial examples from legitimate examples. We also define an output layer supervised objective relying on the logits of output layer to evaluate attacking degrees. In addition, we use the UAP found by previous stage as the initial solution of the next stage so as to progressively optimize the UAP stage-wise. We use seven networks and ImageNet dataset to evaluate the proposed FS-UAP, and provide an in-depth analysis for the latent factors affecting the performance of universal attacks. The experimental results show that our FS-UAP (i) has powerful capability of cheating CNNs (ii) has superior transfer-ability across models and weak data-dependent (iii) is appropriate for both untarget and target attacks.},

The data packet sensed and transmitted contains various cross layer feature set that includes many important information. Many essential aspects, which include st orage capability, consumption of energy, and, computational power should be taken into account while dealing with the data packets. On the other hand, many past researchers have carried out their work in order to detect intrusion utilizing cross-layer packets but fail in detecting them at the same time. Cross-layer and feature selection techniques play a key role in building an efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS). An advantage of using the cross-layer technique is to achieve a higher correlation among different layers of the protocol so that one layer can use the parametric information of the other layer by breaking the traditional layer barriers. In this work, we propose a cross-layer based multi-feature selection model for intrusion detection in WSNs. Firstly, an optimized multi-feature selection algorithm is proposed for selecting efficient and useful features from the cross-layered architecture of the network. Secondly, a multi class intrusion detection model is proposed for the classification of different cross-layer based intrusion in the network. The proposed algorithm is developed for providing total security to cross-layer based networks by selecting prominent features and detecting intrusion at the same time. The simulation results are utilizing on real-time intrusive data from the network by analyzing the proposed model.},

The upper and lower approximation operators in the interval-set information system are defined. The accuracy and roughness are determined by these operators. At the same time, using rough sets, a concept of three branches of rough sets on the interval-set information system is constructed. The concepts of attribute dependency and attribute importance are induced by the positive number domain of the three branch domains, and they then lead to the attribute reduction algorithm.

Further, fuzzy logic controllers can effectively capture and accommodate uncertainties that are inherent in real-world controlled systems. On the other hand, Robot O perating System (ROS) has been widely used for many robotic applications due to its modular structure and efficient message-passing mechanisms for the integration of system’s components. For this reason, Robot Operating System is an ideal tool for developing software stacks for robotic applications. This paper develops a generic and configurable Robot Operating System package for the implementation of fuzzy logic controllers, particularly type-1 and interval type-2, which are based on either Mamdani or Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy inference mechanisms. This is achieved by employing a systematic object-oriented approach using the Unified Model Language (UML) to implement the fuzzy inference system as a single class that is composed of fuzzifier, inference, and defuzzifier classes. The deployment of the developed Robot Operating System package is demonstrated by implementing an interval type-2 fuzzy logic control of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).},

The start - stop control of the loom is realized by an electromagnetic clutch. The existing control method of electromagnetic clutch of loom is high and low pressure control strategy. The operat or sets the braking advance angle according to experience, to realize the accurate braking of the spindle, but it is difficult to realize the fast and accurate control. In order to achieve good performance, it is very important to develop a fast and accurate loom braking system. Aiming at the fabric defects caused by the elongation of the warp when the loom is stopped, a method of stabilizing the excitation current of the electromagnetic clutch by using the neural adaptive PID (proportional integral differential) controller is proposed to improve the control precision of the actuator. The experimental results show that the proposed control algorithm is feasible and can effectively realize the adaptive control of the spindle braking Angle within the allowable error range.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning has been widely used in medical image segmentation, such as breast tumor segmentation, prostate MR image segmentation, and so on. However, the labeling of the data set takes a lot of time. Although the emergence of unsupervised domain adaptation fills the technical gap, the existing d omain adaptation methods for breast segmentation do not consider the alignment of the source domain and target domain breast mass structure. This paper proposes a hyperbolic graph convolutional network architecture. First, a hyperbolic graph convolutional network is used to make the source and target domains structurally aligned. Secondly, we adopt a hyperbolic space mapping model that has better expressive ability than Euclidean space in a graph structure. In particular, when constructing the graph structure, we added the completion adjacency matrix, so that the graph structure can be changed after each feature mapping, which can better improve the segmentation accuracy. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments were performed on two common breast datasets(CBIS-DDSM and INbreast). Experiments show that the method in this paper is better than the most advanced model. When CBIS-DDSM and INbreast are used as the source domain, the segmentation accuracy reaches 89.1% and 80.7%.},

Hence in this paper, we concerned with studying the uncertainty of MONLP problems. We propose algorithms to solve rough and fully-rough-interval multi-objective nonlinear programming (RIMONLP and FRIMONLP) problems, to determine optimal rough solutions value and rough decision variables, where all coefficients and decision variables in the objective functions and constraints are rough intervals (RIs). For the RIMONLP and FRIMONLP problems solving methodology are presented using the weighting method and slice-sum method with Kuhn-Tucker conditions, We will structure two nonlinear programming (NLP) problems. In the first one of this NLP problem, all of its variables and coefficients are the lower approximation (LAI) it’s RIs. The second NLP problems are upper approximation intervals (UAI) of RIs. Subsequently, both NLP problems are sliced into two crisp nonlinear problems. NLP is utilized because numerous real systems are inherently nonlinear. Also, rough intervals are so important for dealing with uncertainty and inaccurate data in decision-making (DM) problems. The suggested algorithms enable us to the optimal solutions in the largest range of possible solution. Finally, Illustrative examples of the results are given.},

There are some techniques that have achieved acceptable speed bump detection under optimal road surface conditions, especially when signs are well-marked. However, in developing countries it is very common to find unmarked speed bumps and existing techniques fail. In this paper a methodology to detect both marked and unmarked speed bumps is proposed, for clearly painted speed bumps we apply local binary patterns technique to extract features from an image dataset. For unmarked speed bump detection, we apply stereo vision where point clouds obtained by the 3D reconstruction are converted to triangular meshes by applying Delaunay triangulation. A selection and extraction of the most relevant features is made to speed bump elevation on surfaces meshes. Results obtained have an important contribution and improve some of the existing techniques since the reconstruction of three-dimensional meshes provides relevant information for the detection of speed bumps by elevations on surfaces even though they are not marked.},

According to the issues mentioned, in this work a novel method based on Bayesian dynamic networks is proposed to infer the paths of interest objects (IO). Environmental information is obtained through stereo video, the direction vectors of multiple obstacles are computed and the trajectories with the highest probability of occurrence and the possibility of collision are highlighted. The proposed approach was evaluated using test environments considering different road layouts and multiple obstacles in real-world traffic scenarios. A comparison of the results obtained against the ground truth of the paths taken by each detected IO is performed. According to experimental results, the proposed method obtains a prediction rate of 75% for the change of direction taking into consideration the risk of collision. The importance of the proposal is that it does not obviate the risk of collision in contrast with related work.},

Among the available screening tools, there is the Electro-Impedance Mammography (EIM), which is a novel and less invasive method that captures the potential differ ence stored in breast tissues under the assumption that electrical properties among normal and pathologically altered tissues are different. In this paper, we address breast cancer detection as a multi-class problem aiming to determine the corresponding label in terms of the Breast Imaging Electrical Impedance classification system, the standard used by physicians for interpreting an EIM mammogram. For experimental purposes, for the first time in the literature, we took advantage of a dataset comprising EIM of Mexican patients. Aiming to establish a baseline for this task, traditional supervised learning methods were used together with two different feature extraction techniques: raw pixel data and transfer learning. Besides, data augmentation was exploited for compensating data imbalance. Different experimental settings were evaluated reaching classification rates over 0.85 in F-score. KNN emerges as a very promising classifier for addressing this task. The obtained results allow us to validate the usefulness of traditional methods for classifying electro-impedance mammograms.},

In this work we propose a simple methodology based on the use of joint probability models that allow discriminating extreme values, collected from measurements as pairs of independent points, while allowing the preservation of the essential statistics of the measurements. The outcome of the proposed methodology is an equivalent data series where large-amplitude fluctuations are suppressed and, therefore, can be used for design purposes. For the evaluation of the proposed method, we used year-long databases of hourly-collected measurements of the wave’s height and period, performed at maritime buoys located in the Gulf of Mexico. These measurements are used to obtain a fluctuations-reduced representation of the energy potential of the waves that can be useful, for instance, for the design of electric generators.},

  abstract     = {In the medical area, the detection of invasive ductal carcinoma is the most common sub-type of all breast cancers; about 80% of all breast cancers are invasive ductal carcinomas. Detection of this type of cancer shows a great challenge for specialist doctors since the digital images of the sample m ust be analyzed by sections because the spatial dimensions of this kind of image are above 50k × 50k pixels; doing this operation manually takes long time to determine if the patient suffers this type of cancer. Time is essential for the patient because this cancer can invade quickly other parts of the body. Its name reaffirms this characteristic, with the term &quot;invasive&quot; forming part of its name. With the purpose of solving this task, we propose an automatic methodology consisting in improving the performance of a convolutional neural network that classifies images containing invasive ductal carcinoma cells by highlighting cancer cells using several preprocessing methods such as histogram stretching and contrast enhancement. In this way, characteristics of the sub-images are extracted from the panoramic sample and it is possible to learn to classify them in a better way.},

The above-mentioned two points are indeed two variables to conduct question generation, but they are not annotated in the original dataset and are thus ignored by the traditional end-to-end models. In this paper we propose a framework that clarifies those two points through two sub-modules to better conduct question generation. We take experiments based on the GPT-2 model and the SQuAD dataset, and prove that our framework can improve the performance measured by similarity metrics, while it also provides appropriate alternatives for controllable diversity enhancement.},

  abstract     = {In the last few years, text analysis has grown as a keystone in several domains for solving many real-world problems, such as machine translation, spam detection, and question answering, to mention a few. Many of these tasks can be approached by means of machine learning algorithms. Most of these a lgorithms take as input a transformation of the text in the form of feature vectors containing an abstraction of the content. Most of recent vector representations focus on the semantic component of text, however, we consider that also taking into account the lexical and syntactic components the abstraction of content could be beneficial for learning tasks. In this work, we propose a content spectral-based text representation applicable to machine learning algorithms for text analysis. This representation integrates the spectra from the lexical, syntactic, and semantic components of text producing an abstract image, which can also be treated by both, text and image learning algorithms. These components came from feature vectors of text. For demonstrating the goodness of our proposal, this was tested on text classification and complexity reading score prediction tasks obtaining promising results.},

Since a vast majority of the population exploit social media platforms such as twitter to exchange information, rapid collecting and analyzing social media data to understand personal well-being and subsequently adopting adequate measures could avoid severe socio-economic damage. Sentiment analysis on twitter data is very useful to understand and identify the mental health issues. In this research, we proposed a unified deep neuro-fuzzy approach for Covid-19 twitter sentiment classification. Fuzzy logic has been a very powerful tool for twitter data analysis where approximate semantic and syntactic analysis is more relevant because correcting spelling and grammar in tweets are merely obnoxious. We conducted the experiment on three challenging COVID-19 twitter sentiment datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that fuzzy Sugeno integral based ensembled classifiers succeed over individual base classifiers.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel methodology to identify the dynamic parameters of a real robot with a convolutional neural network (CNN). Conventional identification methodologies use continuous motion signals. However, these signals are quantized in their amplitude and are discrete in time. Therefore, the time required to identify the parameters of a robot with a limited measurement system is related to an optimized motion trajectory performed by the robot. The proposed methodology consists of an algorithm that uses a trained CNN with the data created by the dynamical model of the case study robot. A processing technique is proposed to transform the position, velocity, acceleration, and torque robot signals into an image whose characteristics are extracted by the CNN to determine their dynamic parameters. The proposed algorithm does not require any optimal trajectory to find the dynamic parameters. A proposed time-spectral evaluation metric is used to validate the robot data and the identification data. The validation results show that the proposed methodology identifies the parameters of a Cartesian robot in less than 1 second, exceeding 90% of the proposed evaluation metric and 98% for the simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Big Data is a generic term that involves the storing and processing of a large amount of data. This large amount of data has been promoted by technologies such as mobile applications, Internet of Things (IoT), and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). An example of GIS is a Spatio-Temporal Database (STDB). A complex problem to address in terms of processing time is pattern searching on STDB. Nowadays, high information processing capacity is available everywhere. Nevertheless, the pattern searching problem on STDB using traditional Data Mining techniques is complex because the data incorporate the temporal aspect. Traditional techniques of pattern searching, such as time series, do not incorporate the spatial aspect. For this reason, traditional algorithms based on association rules must be adapted to find these patterns. Most of the algorithms take exponential processing times. In this paper, a new efficient algorithm (named Minus-F1) to look for periodic patterns on STDB is presented. Our algorithm is compared with Apriori, Max-Subpattern, and PPA algorithms on synthetic and real STDB. Additionally, the computational complexities for each algorithm in the worst cases are presented. Empirical results show that Minus-F1 is not only more efficient than Apriori, Max-Subpattern, and PAA, but also it presents a polynomial behavior.},

Blockchain uses cryptographic techniques that allow decentralization and increase the integrity of the information it handles, but it still has disadvantages in terms of efficiency, making it incapable of implementing some digital services where a high rate of transactions are required. In order to increase its efficient, a multi-layer proposal based on blockchain is presented. It has four layers, where each layer specializes in a different type of information and uses properties of public blockchain and private blockchain. An statistical analysis is performed and the proposal is modeled showing that it maintains and even increases the integrity of the information while preserving the efficiency of transactions. Besides, the proposal can be flexible and adapt to different types of digital services. It also considers that voluntary nodes participate in the decentralization of information making it more secure, verifiable, transparent and reliable.},

  abstract     = {Probabilistic Bayesian methods are widely used in the machine learning domain. Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a common architecture for solving the Language Modeling task in a self-supervised way. VAE consists of a concept of latent variables inside the model. Latent variables are described as a random variable that is fit by the data. Up to now, in the majority of cases, latent variables are considered normally distributed. The normal distribution is a well-known distribution that can be easily included in any pipeline. Moreover, the normal distribution is a good choice when the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) holds. It makes it effective when one is working with i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) random variables. However, the conditions of CLT in Natural Language Processing are not easy to check. So, the choice of distribution family is unclear in the domain. This paper studies the priors selection impact of continuous distributions in the Low-Resource Language Modeling task with VAE. The experiment shows that there is a statistical difference between the different priors in the encoder-decoder architecture. We showed that family distribution hyperparameter is important in the Low-Resource Language Modeling task and should be considered for the model training.},

  abstract     = {Distant Supervision is an approach that allows automatic labeling of instances. This approach has been used in Relation Extraction. Still, the main challenge of this task is handling instances with noisy labels (e.g., when two entities in a sentence are automatically labeled with an invalid relatio n). The approaches reported in the literature addressed this problem by employing noise-tolerant classifiers. However, if a noise reduction stage is introduced before the classification step, this increases the macro precision values. This paper proposes an Adversarial Autoencoders-based approach for obtaining a new representation that allows noise reduction in Distant Supervision. The representation obtained using Adversarial Autoencoders minimize the intra-cluster distance concerning pre-trained embeddings and classic Autoencoders. Experiments demonstrated that in the noise-reduced datasets, the macro precision values obtained over the original dataset are similar using fewer instances considering the same classifier. For example, in one of the noise-reduced datasets, the macro precision was improved approximately 2.32% using 77% of the original instances. This suggests the validity of using Adversarial Autoencoders to obtain well-suited representations for noise reduction. Also, the proposed approach maintains the macro precision values concerning the original dataset and reduces the total instances needed for classification.},

  abstract     = {Academic theses writing is a complex task that requires the author to be skilled in argumentation. The goal of the academic author is to communicate clear ideas and to convince the reader of the presented claims. However, few students are good arguers, and this is a skill that takes time to master. In this paper, we present an exploration of lexical features used to model automatic detection of argumentative paragraphs using machine learning techniques. We present a novel proposal, which combines the information in the complete paragraph with the detection of argumentative segments in order to achieve improved results for the detection of argumentative paragraphs. We propose two approaches; a more descriptive one, which uses the decision tree classifier with indicators and lexical features; and another more efficient, which uses an SVM classifier with lexical features and a Document Occurrence Representation (DOR). Both approaches consider the detection of argumentative segments to ensure that a paragraph detected as argumentative has indeed segments with argumentation. We achieved encouraging results for both approaches.},

Up to now, although the authorship of the book has been attributed to several journalists and writers, it could not be demonstrated and remains an open problem. The work aims at establishing which one of the most commonly attributed writers is the real author. To do that, we implement methods based on stylometric features using textual distance, supervised, and unsupervised learning. The distance-based methods implemented in this work are Kilgarriff and Delta of Burrows, an SVM algorithm is used as the supervised method, and the k-means algorithm as the unsupervised algorithm. The applied methods were consistent by pointing out a single author as the most likely one.},

The aim and challenge is to find a strategy to achieve labelling of new / given information in the discourse rooted in a theoretically linguistic stance. The new / given distinction can be defined from different perspectives in which it varies what linguistic forms are taken into account. Thus, the focus in this work is to work with full referential devices (n = 2 388). Pearson’s R correlation tests, analysis of variance, graphical exploration of the clustering of labels, and a classification experiment with random forests are performed. For the experiment, two groups were used: noun phrases labeled with all 10 tags of informative states and a binary labelling, as well as the use of two bags-of-words for each noun phrase: the interior and the exterior. It was found that using LSA in conjunction with the inner bag of words can be used to classify certain informational states. This same measure showed good results for the binary division, detecting which sentences introduce new referents in discourse. In previous work using a similar method in noun phrases in English, 80% accuracy (n = 478) was reached in their classification exercise. Our best test for Spanish reached 79%. No work on Spanish using this method has been done before and this kind of experiment is important because Spanish exhibits a more complex inflectional morphology.},

Despite huge progress and advancements in learning approaches such as Deep Learning (DL) and Transfer Learning (TL), there are many NLP tasks such as Text Classification (TC), for which basic Machine Learning (ML) classifiers perform superior to DL or TL approaches. Added to this, an efficient feature engineering step can significantly improve the performance of ML based systems. To check the efficacy of ML based systems and feature engineering on TC, this paper explores char, character sequences, syllables, word n-grams as well as syntactic n-grams as features and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values to select the important features from the collection of extracted features. Voting Classifiers (VC) with soft and hard voting of four ML classifiers, namely: Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Linear and Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF) was trained and evaluated on Fake News Spreaders Profiling (FNSP) shared task dataset in PAN 2020. This shared task consists of profiling fake news spreaders in English and Spanish languages. The proposed models exhibited an average accuracy of 0.785 for both languages in this shared task and outperformed the best models submitted to this task.},

  abstract     = {Multi-label text classification aims at assigning more than one class to a given text document, which makes the task more ambiguous and challenging at the same time. The ambiguities come from the fact that often several labels in the prescribed label set are semantically close to each other, making clear demarcation between them difficult. As a consequence, any Machine Learning based approach for developing multi-label classification scheme needs to define its feature space by choosing features beyond linguistic or semi-linguistic features, so that the semantic closeness between the labels is also taken into account. The present work describes a scheme of feature extraction where the training document set and the prescribed label set are intertwined in a novel way to capture the ambiguity in a meaningful way. In particular, experiments were conducted using Topic Modeling and Fuzzy C-Means clustering which aim at measuring the underlying uncertainty using probability and membership based measures, respectively. Several Nonparametric hypothesis tests establish the effectiveness of the features obtained through Fuzzy C-Means clustering in multi-label classification. A new algorithm has been proposed for training the system for multi-label classification using the above set of features.},

There are advances in systems for music feature extraction and generation of harmonies with short- time and long-time patterns of music style, genre, and motif. However, there are still challenges in the creation of poly-instrumental and polyphonic music, pieces become repetitive and sometimes these systems copy the original files. The main contribution of this paper is related to the improvement of generating new non-plagiary harmonic developments constructed from the symbolic abstraction from MIDI music non-labeled data with controlled selection of rhythmic features based on evolutionary techniques. Particularly, a novel approach for generating new music compositions by replacing existing harmony descriptors in a MIDI file with new harmonic features from another MIDI file selected by a genetic algorithm. This allows combining newly created harmony with a rhythm of another composition guaranteeing the adjustment of a new music piece to a distinctive genre with regularity and consistency. The performance of the proposed approach has been assessed using artificial intelligent computational tests, which assure goodness of the extracted features and shows its quality and competitiveness.},

The present wor k introduces two alternative versions (L-M4C and L-CNMT) of top architectures (on the TextCaps challenge), which were mainly adapted to achieve near-State-of-The-Art performance while being memory-lighter when compared to the original architectures, this is mainly achieved by using distilled or smaller pre-trained models on the text-and-OCR embedding modules. On the one hand, a distilled version of BERT was used in order to reduce the size of the text-embedding module (the distilled model has 59% fewer parameters), on the other hand, the OCR context processor on both architectures was replaced by Global Vectors (GloVe), instead of using FastText pre-trained vectors, this can reduce the memory used by the OCR-embedding module up to a 94% . Two of the three models presented in this work surpassed the baseline (M4C-Captioner) of the challenge on the evaluation and test sets, also, our best lighter architecture reached a CIDEr score of 88.24 on the test set, which is 7.25 points above the baseline model.},

  abstract     = {Human-aware Artificial Intelligent systems are goal directed autonomous systems that are capable of interacting, collaborating, and teaming with humans. Activity reasoning is a formal reasoning approach that aims to provide common sense reasoning capabilities to these interactive and intelligent systems. This reasoning can be done by considering evidences –which may be conflicting–related to activities a human performs. In this context, it is important to consider the temporality of such evidence in order to distinguish activities and to analyse the relations between activities. Our approach is based on formal argumentation reasoning, specifically, Timed Argumentation Frameworks (TAF), which is an appropriate technique for dealing with inconsistencies in knowledge bases. Our approach involves two steps: local selection and global selection. In the local selection, a model of the world and of the human’s mind is constructed in form of hypothetical fragments of activities (pieces of evidences) by considering a set of observations. These hypothetical fragments have two kinds of relations: a conflict relation and a temporal relation. Based on these relations, the argumentation attack notion is defined. We define two forms of attacks namely the strong and the weak attack. The former has the same characteristics of attacks in TAF whereas for the latter the TAF approach has to be extended. For determining consistent sets of hypothetical fragments, that are part of an activity or are part of a set of non-conflicting activities, extension-based argumentation semantics are applied. In the global selection, the degrees of fulfillment of activities is determined. We study some properties of our approach and apply it to a scenario where a human performs activities with different temporal relations.},

In recent times Soft Rough Sets are being applied in various domains, though none of its applications are in the area of keyword extraction. On the other hand, the concept of Rough Set based span has been developed for improved efficiency in the domain of extractive text summarization. In this work we amalgamate these two techniques, called Soft Rough Set based Span (SRS), to provide an effective solution for keyword extraction from texts. The universe for Soft Rough Set is taken to be a collection of words from the input texts. SRS provides an ideal platform for identifying the set of keywords from the input text which cannot always be defined clearly and unambiguously. The proposed technique uses greedy algorithm for computing spanning sets. The experimental results suggest that extraction of keywords using the proposed scheme gives consistent results across different domains. Also, it has been found to be more efficient in comparison with several existing unsupervised techniques.},

The challenge is to show th at the developed vaccine, S3Pvac-Papaya, produces more antibodies and with better stability than the other vaccine and saline solution. With the aim of proving this conjecture, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple Fisher comparisons at 95% confidence were performed. The vaccine of interest, S3Pvac-Papaya, revealed in the box diagram at T2 that the development of antibodies was high and showed little dispersion, which implies that the vaccine S3Pvac Papaya is statistically efficient in the production of antibodies. Finally, the mathematical contribution centers on highlighting the low use of inferential statistical techniques, comparing means of generated antibodies by a set of vaccines in order to determine which one is more efficient and reliable. Tacitly, a methodology both statistical and procedural has been proposed along this work, to apply when contrasting other kinds of vaccines in both animals and humans for diverse conditions.},

The objective is to classify the feedback generated by teachers in online courses to the activities sent by students according to the model of Hattie and Timperley (2007), considering that fee dback may be at the levels task, process, regulation, praise and other. Four multi-label classification methods of the data transformation approach - binary relevance, classification chains, power labelset and rakel-d - are compared with the base algorithms SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes. The methodology was applied to a case study in which 11013 feedbacks written in Spanish language from 121 online courses of the Law degree from a public university in Mexico were collected from the Blackboard learning manager system. The results show that the random forests algorithms and vector support machines will have the best performance when using the binary relevance transformation and classifier chains methods.},

  abstract     = {The need to detect and classify objects correctly is a constant challenge, being able to recognize them at different scales and scenarios, sometimes cropped or badly lit is not an easy task. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have become a widely applied technique since they are completely trainab le and suitable to extract features. However, the growing number of convolutional neural networks applications constantly pushes their accuracy improvement. Initially, those improvements involved the use of large datasets, augmentation techniques, and complex algorithms. These methods may have a high computational cost. Nevertheless, feature extraction is known to be the heart of the problem. As a result, other approaches combine different technologies to extract better features to improve the accuracy without the need of more powerful hardware resources. In this paper, we propose a hybrid pooling method that incorporates multiresolution analysis within the CNN layers to reduce the feature map size without losing details. To prevent relevant information from losing during the downsampling process an existing pooling method is combined with wavelet transform technique, keeping those details &quot;alive&quot; and enriching other stages of the CNN. Achieving better quality characteristics improves CNN accuracy. To validate this study, ten pooling methods, including the proposed model, are tested using four benchmark datasets. The results are compared with four of the evaluated methods, which are also considered as the state-of-the-art.},

A system prototype was developed to be integrated as a component of ambient intelligence (AmI) for ambient assisted living (AAL) that serves to Hearing Impaired People (HIP). The prototype detects dog barks and notifies users through both a smart mobile app and a visual feedback. It consists of a connection between a Raspberry Pi 3 card and a ReSpeaker Mic Array v2.0 microphone array; a communication module with a smartphone was implemented, which displays written messages or vibrations when receiving notifications. The cylinder-shaped device was designed by the authors and sent it to 3D print with a resin material.

To handle the problem, meta-learning helps to solve this issue especially it can learn from a small set of data. We proposed a meta-learning-based image segmentation model that combines the learning of the state-of-the-art models and then used it to achieve domain adoption and high accuracy. Also, we proposed a prepossessing algorithm to increase the usability of the segment part and remove noise from the new test images. The proposed model can achieve 0.94 precision and 0.92 recall.

  abstract     = {The abrupt changes in the sensor measurements indicating the occurrence of an event are the major factors in some monitoring applications of IoT networks. The prediction-based approach for data aggregation in wireless sensor networks plays a significant role in detecting such events. This paper int roduces a prediction-based aggregation model for sensor selection named the Grey prediction model and the Kalman filter-based data aggregation model with rank-based mutual information (GMKFDA-MI) that has a dual synchronization mechanism for aggregating the data and selecting the nodes based on prediction and cumulative error thresholds. Furthermore, the nodes after deployment are clustered using K-medoids clustering along with the Salp swarm optimization algorithm to obtain an optimized aggregator position concerning the base station. An efficient clustering promises energy efficiency and better connectivity. The experiments are accomplished on real-time datasets of air pollution monitoring applications and the results for the proposed method are compared with other similar state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed method promises high prediction accuracy, low energy consumption and enhances the throughput of the network. The energy-saving is recorded to be more than 10 to 30% for the proposed model when compared with other similar approaches. Also, the proposed method achieves 97.8% accuracy as compared to other methods. The method proves its best working efficiency in the applications like event reporting, target detection, and event monitoring.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a discrete animal migration optimization (DAMO) to solve the dual-resource constrained energy-saving flexible job shop scheduling problem (DRCESFJSP), with the aim of minimizing the total energy consumption in the workshop. A job-resource-based two-vector encoding method is desi gned to represent the scheduling solution, and an energy-saving decoding approach is given based on the left-shift rule. To ensure the quality and diversity of initial scheduling solutions, a heuristic approach is employed for the resource assignment, and some dispatching rules are applied to acquire the operation permutation. In the proposed DAMO, based on the characteristics of the DRCESFJSP problem, the search operators of the basic AMO are discretized to adapt to the problem under study. An animal migration operator is presented based on six problem-based neighborhood structures, which dynamically changes the search scale of each animal according to its solution quality. An individual updating operator based on crossover operation is designed to obtain new individuals through the crossover operation between the current individual and the best individual or a random individual. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, the Taguchi design of experiment method is first applied to obtain the best combination of parameters. Numerical experiments are carried out based on 32 instances in the existing literature. Computational data and statistical comparisons indicate that both the left-shift decoding rule and population initialization strategy are effective in enhancing the quality of the scheduling solutions. It also demonstrate that the proposed DAMO has advantages against other compared algorithms in terms of the solving accuracy for solving the DRCESFJSP.},

  abstract     = {Although traditional acceptance sampling plans (ASPs) need certain mass quality characteristics, it is not easy to define them as crisp value in some real case problems. The fuzzy set theory (FST) is one of the popular techniques to model uncertainties of the process and therefore fuzzy ASPs have b een offered in the literature. Fuzzy set extensions have been proposed recently for better modeling of the uncertainties having different sources and characteristics. One of these extensions named neutrosophic sets (NSs) can be used to increase the sensitiveness and flexibility of ASPs. The ASPs based on NSs can give ability to classify the items as defective, non-defective and indeterminate. Since the operator can become indecisive for slightly defective items, these plans can provide a good representation of human evaluations under uncertainty. In this study, single and double ASPs are designed based on NSs by using binomial and poisson distributions that are also re-analyzed based on NSs. For this aim, some characteristics functions of ASPs such as probability of accepting a lot (Pa), average outgoing quality (AOQ), average total inspection (ATI) and average sample number (ASN) have also been analyzed based on NSs. Numerical examples are presented to analyze the proposed plans.},

  abstract     = {End-to-end deep learning has gained considerable interests in autonomous driving vehicles. End-to-end autonomous driving uses the deep convolutional neural network to establish input-to-output mapping. However, existing end-to-end driving models only predict steering angle with front-facing camera data and poorly extract spatial-temporal information. Based on deep learning and attention mechanism, we propose an end-to-end driving model which combines the multi-stream attention module with the multi-stream network. As a multimodal multitask model, the proposed end-to-end driving model not only fully extracts spatial-temporal information from multimodality, but also adopts the multitask learning method with hard parameter sharing to predict the steering angle and speed. Furthermore, the proposed multi-stream attention module predicts the attention weights of streams based on the multimodal feature fusion, which encourages the proposed end-to-end driving model to pay attention to streams that positively impact the prediction result. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed driving model on the public Udacity dataset compared to existing models. Experimental results show that the proposed driving model has better performances than other existing methods.},

  abstract     = {In the intelligent unmanned systems, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) obstacle avoidance technology is the core and primary condition. Traditional algorithms are not suitable for obstacle avoidance in complex and changeable environments based on the limited sensors on UAVs. In this article, we use an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to achieve the UAV autonomously avoid obstacles. For the problem of slow convergence in DRL, a Multi-Branch (MB) network structure is proposed to ensure that the algorithm can get good performance in the early stage; for non-optimal decision-making problems caused by overestimation, the Revise Q-value (RQ) algorithm is proposed to ensure that the agent can choose the optimal strategy for obstacle avoidance. According to the flying characteristics of the rotor UAV, we build a V-Rep 3D physical simulation environment to test the obstacle avoidance performance. And experiments show that the improved algorithm can accelerate the convergence speed of agent and the average return of the round is increased by 25%.},

  abstract     = {Contamination in insulators results in an increase in surface conductivity. With higher surface conductivity, insulators are more vulnerable to discharges that can damage them, thus reducing the reliability of the electrical system. One of the indications that the insulator is losing its insulating properties is its increase in leakage current. By varying the leakage current over time, it is possible to determine whether the insulator will develop an irreversible failure. In this way, by predicting the increase in leakage current, it is possible to carry out maintenance to avoid system failures. For forecasting time series, there are many models that have been studied and the definition of which model is suitable for evaluation depends on the characteristics of the data associated with the analysis. Thus, this work aims to identify the most suitable model to predict the increase in leakage current in relation to the time the insulator is outdoors, exposed to environmental variations using the same database to compare the methods. In this paper, the models based on linear regression, support vector regression (SVR), multilayer Perceptron (MLP), deep neural network (DNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) will be analyzed comparatively. The best accuracy results for prediction were found using the RNN models, resulting in an accuracy of up to 97.25%.},

  abstract     = {The detection as well as analysis of faults in Induction Motor (IM) is prominent in the industrial process in recent decades, since it has been a demanding issue in industries to confirm the safe and reliable operations of IM. Though the electrical faults, mechanical faults and environmental faults cause damages in IM, as per Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) statistical studies, the faults due to (i) rotor mass unbalance and (ii) rotor shaft bending substantially contribute 8-9% of the total motor fault. This present research work focuses on the issue of detecting and analysing the faults by studying the current and vibration data obtained from the three-phase squirrel cage IM under healthy and faulty conditions using the experimental workbench. It also depicts the development of a fault detection model for IM which comprises the integrated approach of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Fuzzy Interference System (FIS) and two level decision fuzzy measures. Besides, fuzzy integral data fusion technique has been used in this work for the improvement of diagnosing accuracy. The data acquired from the workbench system are first investigated through the PCA to extricate the appropriate features that provide the major information of collected data without reducing its dimensions. The projected data space using the principal components is non-deterministic for further synthesis process of fault classification. Hence, to classify the faults in IM, the obtained feature vectors from PCA are fed into FIS as an input and the classification performance is compared finally. The work experiment has been carried out under the healthy and different faulty conditions of motor and the proposed integrated approach is executed by using MATLAB.},

The contour information of the part is obtained using industrial cameras and digital image processing systems. The cutting speed of the trajectory segment is inferred based on the related processing parameters and the secondary fuzzy neural hybrid network. Finally, all of the processing parameters are transmitted to the PLC, so that the robot can work according to the predetermined displacement and speed. Simulations verify that the speed inference planning system offers certain advantages compared to the traditional one. The appearance of the speed inference planning realises independent design and planning of the cutting speed, and further ensures the unity of the cutting quality and cutting speed.

Then, the improved GWO (IGWO) algorithm and the K-harmonic means (KHM) algorithm are fused to solve the clustering problem. This fusion clustering algorithm is called IGWOKHM, and it combines the global search ability of IGWO with the local fast optimization ability of KHM to both solve the problem of the K-means algorithm’s sensitivity to the initial clustering centers and address the shortcomings of KHM. The experimental results on 8 test functions and 4 University of California Irvine (UCI) datasets show that the IGWO algorithm greatly improves the efficiency of the model while ensuring the stability of the algorithm. The fusion clustering algorithm can effectively overcome the inadequacies of the K-means algorithm and has a good global optimization ability.},

The numbers and locations of DAPs affect the communication quality and cost of the smart meter neighborhood network, and because smart meters rely on wireless technology to transmit data, their transmission range is limited. Thus, suburban and rural areas require a large number of DAP installation needs, and it is very important to reduce their numbers. For this problem, this study proposes a grid-based relay DAP placement scheme and presents the corresponding algorithms to reduce the number of DAPs and to avoid the large impact of relay DAP locations on communication quality for the two cases of whether or not the number of relay DAPs is limited. This paper used random smart meter coordinates for testing, and the test results verify that the proposed solution can in fact significantly reduce the number of DAPs and avoid the large impact of relay DAP locations on communication quality.},

To find the high level of specialization, suppliers of pharmaceutical logistics must be selected under a mathematical model that can treat vague and uncertain real-life circumstances. The notion of bipolarity is a key factor to address such uncertainties. A bipolar fuzzy soft set (BFSS) is a strong mathematical tool to cope with uncertainty and unreliability in various real-life problems including logistics and supply chain management. In this paper, we introduce new similarity measures (SMs) based on certain properties of bipolar fuzzy soft sets (BFSSs). The proposed SMs are the extensions of Frobenius inner product, cosine similarity measure, and weighted similarity measure for BFSSs. The proposed SMs are also illustrated with respective numerical examples. An innovative multi-attribute decision-making algorithm (MADM) and its flow chart are being developed for pharmaceutical logistics and supply chain management in COVID-19. Furthermore, the application of the suggested MADM method is presented for the selection of the best pharmaceutical logistic company and a comparative analysis of the suggested SMs with some of the existing SMs is also demonstrated.},

TQE is a process of grading and ranking a given teachers bas ed on the comprehensive consideration of multiple evaluation criteria by expert. The Maclaurin symmetric mean (MSM), as a powerful aggregation function, can capture the correlation among multiple input data more efficient. Although multitude weighted MSM operators have been developed to handle the Pythagorean fuzzy decision issues, these above operators do not possess the idempotency and reducibility during the procedure of information fusion. To conquer these defects, we present the Pythagorean fuzzy reducible weighted MSM (PFRWMSM) operator and Pythagorean fuzzy reducible weighted geometric MSM (PFRWGMSM) operator to fuse Pythagorean fuzzy assessment information. Meanwhile, several worthwhile properties and especial cases of the developed operators are explored at length. Afterwards, we develop a novel Pythagorean fuzzy entropy based upon knowledge measure to ascertain the weights of attribute. Furthermore, an extended weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) method is developed by combining the PFRWMSM operator, PFRWGMSM operator and entropy to settle the decision problems of unknown weight information. The efficiency of the proffered method is demonstrated by a teaching quality evaluation issue, as well as the discussion of sensitivity analysis for decision outcomes. Consequently, a comparative study of the presented method with the extant Pythagorean fuzzy approaches is conducted to display the superiority of the propounded approach.},

  abstract     = {An efficient visual detection method is explored in this study to address the low accuracy and efficiency of manual detection for irregular gear pitting. The results of gear pitting detection are enhanced by embedding two attention modules into Deeplabv3 + to obtain an improved segmentation model c alled attention Deeplabv3. The attention mechanism of the proposed model endows the latter with an enhanced ability for feature representation of small and irregular objects and effectively improves the segmentation performance of Deeplabv3. The segmentation ability of attention Deeplabv3+ is verified by comparing its performance with those of other typical segmentation networks using two public datasets, namely, Cityscapes and Voc2012. The proposed model is subsequently applied to segment gear pitting and tooth surfaces simultaneously, and the pitting area ratio is calculated. Experimental results show that attention Deeplabv3 has higher segmentation performance and measurement accuracy compared with the existing classical models under the same computing speed. Thus, the proposed model is suitable for measuring various gear pittings.},

But, the quality of the remote sensing images obtained from different channels can vary considerably, and manually labeling a mass amount of image data is too expensi ve and inefficiently. In this paper, we propose a point density force field clustering (PDFC) process. According to the spectral information from different ground objects, remote sensing superpixel points are divided into core and edge data points. The differences in the densities of core data points are used to form the local peak. The center of the initial cluster can be determined by the weighted density and position of the local peak. An iterative nebular clustering process is used to obtain the result, and a proposed new objective function is used to optimize the model parameters automatically to obtain the global optimal clustering solution. The proposed algorithm can cluster the area of different ground objects in remote sensing images automatically, and these categories are then labeled by humans simply.},

Pythagorean Fuzzy Sets (PFSs) is one of the important tools to describe the natural attributes of uncertain information. Therefore, how to appropriately mea sure the distance between PFSs is an important topic. The earth mover’s distance (EMD) is a real distance metric that can be used to describe the difference between two distribution laws. In this paper, a new distance measure for PFSs based on EMD is proposed. It is a new perspective to measure the distance between PFSs from the perspective of distribution law. First, a new distance measure namely DEMD is presented and proven to satisfy the distance measurement axiom. Second, an example is given to illustrate the advantages of DEMD compared with other distance measures. Third, the problem statements and solving algorithms of pattern recognition, medical diagnosis and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problems are given. Finally, by comparing the application of different methods in pattern recognition, medical diagnosis and MCDM, the effectiveness and practicability of DEMD and algorithms presented in this paper are demonstrated.},

This problem is of the same nature as computing the largest crisp simulation between two finite FLTSs. A naive approach to the latter problem is to crisp the given FLTSs and then apply one of the currently known best methods to the obtained crisp labeled transition systems. The complexity of the resulting algorithms is of order O (l (m + n) n), where l is the number of fuzzy values occurring in the specification of the input FLTSs, m is the number of transitions and n is the number of states of the input FLTSs. In the worst case, l can be m + n and O (l (m + n) n) is the same as O ((m + n) 2n). In this article, we design an efficient algorithm with the complexity O ((m + n) n) for computing the largest crisp simulation between two finite FLTSs. This gives a significant improvement.

This schema adjustment is made by a fuzzy inference system that uses the normalized fitness value of each whale and the hunting mechanism control parameters of WOA. The method proposed was tested and compared with the conventional WOA and another version that uses a fuzzy inference system as input information on the ratio of the current iteration number and the maximum number of iterations. For performance analysis of the method proposed, all optimizers were evaluated with twenty-three benchmark optimization functions in the continuous domain. The algorithms were also implemented in the identification process of two real control system that are a boiler system and water supply network. For identification process, it is used the value of MSE (mean squared error) to available each algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed fuzzy mechanism improves the convergence of the conventional WOA and it is competitive in relation to another fuzzy version adopted in the WOA design.},

  abstract     = {With recent developments in information technology and the extensive promotion of Internet Plus, the use of online centralized procurement by governments and enterprise groups has become progressively more common, and the winning bid evaluation decision making method is particularly important in th is context. However, experts might not be completely rational during the process of bid evaluation, which may induce the enhancement or repression of bid scores. To address such behaviors during the process of bid evaluation, an automatic mechanism to identify and correct such tendencies is proposed in this study. Because experts have different preferences for different alternatives, which are directly reflected in the evaluation of attribute values. Based on selection preference, this paper proposes a selection preference method for solving the subjective weight of attributes. Firstly, the weights of relevant attributes are first determined via the entropy weight method and the selection preference method, and the weights corresponding to groups are determined according to the differences between the scores assigned by experts. Then, a grouped multi-attribute bid evaluation decision making method is proposed based on the selection preference. Finally, an example is used to verify the effectiveness of the method and its superiority over existing methods. Thus, a theoretical basis and a decision support mechanism are provided in this study for centralized procurement departments of governments and enterprises. Further, it also provides guidance for multi-attribute decision making problems with identical grouped features.},

The main motivation of this paper is to obtain the solution to a multilevel rough interval linear programming (MLRILP) problem. To obtain that, we start turning the problem into its competent crisp equivalent using the interval method. Moreover, we rely on three methods to address the problem of multiple levels. First, by applying the constraint method in which upper levels give satisfactory solutions that are reasonable in rank order to the lower levels, second, by an interactive approach that uses the satisfaction test function, and third, by the fuzzy approach that is based on the concept of the tolerance membership function. A numerical example is given for illustration and to examine the validity of the approach. An application to deduce the optimality for the cost of the solid MLLP transportation problem in rough interval environment is presented.},

The proposed work first perform the abnormality detection on the sensor data using the HMM based on baum-welch algorithm in which the normal data is separated from abnormal data followed by classifying the abnormal data as critical patient data or sensor fault data using the SVM. Here the proposed work efficiently performs fault diagnosis with an overall accuracy of 99.94% which is 0.59% better than the existing SVM model. And also a comparison is made between the hybrid approach and the existing ML algorithms in terms of recall and F1-score where the proposed approach outperforms the other algorithms with a recall value of 100% and F1-score of 99.7%.},

Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) is the most important component, which is difficult to be determined due to the uncertainty of information. Gener ally, there are two ways to get BPA of evidential theory: One is a subjective judgment of the expert’s experience, Interval Belief Structure (IBS) can solve the fuzziness and uncertainty of expert’s judgment. The other is an objective calculation by sampling existing data, in which BPA is viewed as the point estimate. Therefore, one of the contributions of this paper is that the definitions and theories of Confidential Interval Belief Structure (CIBS) is developed to describe BPA in Dempster-Shafer theory, which can give a range of population parameter values and contain more information to deal with the uncertainty and fuzziness of existing data. And then, based on evidential reasoning rule for counter-intuitive behavior, another contribution of this paper is that the extended evidential reasoning approach with CIBS is proposed to obtain the combined belief degree. The proposed method can be flexibly adjusted by appropriate errors and confidence levels, which is the main advantage. Finally, a case of sustainable operation of Shanghai rail transit system to verify the feasibility of proposed method and great performance of the extended method is shown.},

  abstract     = {The major challenge of recommendation system (RS) based on implict feedback is to accurately model users’ preferences from their historical feedback. Nowadays, researchers has tried to apply adversarial technique in RS, which had presented successful results in various domains. To a certain extent, the use of adversarial technique improves the modeling of users’ preferences. Nonetheless, there are still many problems to be solved, such as insufficient representation and low-level interaction. In this paper, we propose a recommendation algorithm NCGAN which combines neural collaborative filtering and generative adversarial network (GAN). We use the neural networks to extract users’ non-linear characteristics. At the same time, we integrate the GAN framework to guide the recommendation model training. Among them, the generator aims to make user recommendations and the discriminator is equivalent to a measurement tool which could measure the distance between the generated distribution and users’ ground distribution. Through comparison with other existing recommendation algorithms, our algorithm show better experimental performance in all indicators.},

To solve these problems, a fr amework 2DSFLF proposed in this paper and used to evaluate the effectiveness of software fault localization techniques (SFL) in two-dimensional eigenvalues takes both dynamic and static features into account to construct the two-dimensional eigenvalues statement spectrum (2DSS). Firstly the statement dependency and test case coverage are extracted by the feature extraction of 2DSFLF. Subsequently these extracted features can be used to construct the statement spectrum and data flow spectrum which can be combined into the optimized spectrum 2DSS. Finally an estimator which takes Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network and ridge regression as fault localization model is trained by 2DSS to predict the suspiciousness of statements to be faulty. Experiments on Siemens Suit show that 2DSFLF improves the efficiency and precision of software fault localization compared with existing techniques like BPNN, PPDG, Tarantula and so fourth.},

With this same problem, for the purpose of validating the proposed method, a comparative analysis was made with the use of the Hesitant Fuzzy AHP-QFD-TOPSIS method and also with the traditional AHP-QFD-PROMETHEE method, which makes it impossible to capture the hesitation of decision makers. The result showed similarity in the rankings of design alternatives found in the three methods application.

  abstract     = {Driving behavior type is a hotspot in transportation field, but there have been few studies on free driving behavior type. The factor of current driving behavior evaluation model is single, and its environmental adaptability is insufficient, and driving behavior type is difficult to predict accurat ely. In addition, free driving behavior as one kind of the important driving operation behaviors lacks quantitative assessment methods and models. In view of these deficiencies, evaluation and prediction of free driving behavior based on Fuzzy Comprehensive Support Vector Machine (FC-SVM) is proposed. Firstly, a variety of individual decision-making behavior data obfuscating with environmental complexity are collected. These obtained parameters were used as FC multi-factor evaluation parameters to quantitatively evaluate free driving behavior from multiple aspects, and to qualitatively derive the driver’s driving behavior type. Further, the SVM used the RBF kernel function to obtain the optimal parameters and train the SVM network, and it used the obtained SVM model for the prediction of driving behavior type in short time. The results of simulations using different methods show that the SD value of FC-SVM evaluation results is the lowest, only 1.273. Compared with other common methods, its MacroP reaches 89.2%. It is interesting to find that aggressive driving can be more distinct from other behavior types. Moreover, the mixed traffic flow composed of aggressive driver has a higher traffic efficiency in basic sections. This work is of great value for improving driving behavior, reducing road congestion and improving road traffic efficiency in the mixed intelligent traffic.},

This study pro posed a wind speed forecasting method by complying with a model integrating the Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and the Improved Multi-Objective Dragonfly Optimization Algorithm (IMODA). First, the VMD was adopted to decompose the original wind speed signal, as an attempt to obtain multiple sub-sequences (IMFs) exhibiting stable frequency domain. Second, to simplify the calculation, the sample entropy (SE) was adopted for the sequence recombination, and the respective recombined sub-sequence of the wind speed was forecasted by using four advanced neural networks. Lastly, the IMODA algorithm was adopted to fuse the forecasting results of the neural network, and the results of the optimal wind speed were forecasted. To verify the effectiveness and adaptability of the algorithm, the wind farm data in four different regions were forecasted. As indicated from the results, this algorithm could outperform other algorithms in the comprehensive forecasting accuracy and the model calculation time, and it could be effectively applied for the wind speed forecasting in wind farms.},

There are numerous unsolved problems like crowd flow modelling and crowd behaviour detection, which ar e still open in this area, seeking great attention from the research community. Crowd flow modelling is one of such problems, and it is also an integral part of an intelligent surveillance system. Modelling of crowd flow has now become a vital concern in the development of intelligent surveillance systems. Real-time analysis of crowd behavior needs accurate models that represent crowded scenarios. An intelligent surveillance system supporting a good crowd flow model will help identify the risks in a wide range of emergencies and facilitate human safety. Mathematical models of crowd flow developed from real-time video sequences enable further analysis and decision making. A novel method identifying eight possible crowd flow behaviours commonly seen in the crowd video sequences is explained in this paper. The proposed method uses crowd flow localisation using the Gunnar-Farneback optical flow method. The Jacobian and Hessian matrix analysis along with corresponding eigenvalues helps to find stability points identifying the flow patterns. This work is carried out on 80 videos taken from UCF crowd and CUHK video datasets. Comparison with existing works from the literature proves our method yields better results.},

  abstract     = {Removing of noise component is an important task in all practical applications like hearing aids, speech therapy etc. In speech communication applications the speech components are contaminated with various types of noises. Separation of speech and noise component is a key issue in hearing aids, sp eech therapy applications. This paper demonstrates a hybrid version of singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and independent component analysis (ICA) based adaptive noise canceller (ANC) to separate noise and speech components. As ICA is not suitable for single channel sources, SSA is used to map signal channel data to multivariant data. Therefore, SSA based ICA decomposition is used to generate reference for noise cancellation process. Variable Step based adaptive learning algorithm is used to separate noise contaminations from speech signals. To reduce computational complexity of system, sign regressor operation is applied to the data vector of the proposed adaptive learning methodology. Performance measures such as Signal to noise ratio improvement, excess mean square error and misadjustment are calculated for various considered ANCs, their values for crane noise are 29.6633 dB, – 27.4854 dB and 0.2058 respectively. Among the various adaptive learning algorithms, sign regressor based step variable method performs better than the other algorithms. Hence this learning methodology is well suited for hearing aids and speech therapy applications due to its robustness, less computational complexity and filtering ability.},

  abstract     = {The most challenging process in recent Speech Enhancement (SE) systems is to exclude the non-stationary noises and additive white Gaussian noise in real-time applications. Several SE techniques suggested were not successful in real-time scenarios to eliminate noises in the speech signals due to the high utilization of resources. So, a Sliding Window Empirical Mode Decomposition including a Variant of Variational Model Decomposition and Hurst (SWEMD-VVMDH) technique was developed for minimizing the difficulty in real-time applications. But this is the statistical framework that takes a long time for computations. Hence in this article, this SWEMD-VVMDH technique is extended using Deep Neural Network (DNN) that learns the decomposed speech signals via SWEMD-VVMDH efficiently to achieve SE. At first, the noisy speech signals are decomposed into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) by the SWEMD Hurst (SWEMDH) technique. Then, the Time-Delay Estimation (TDE)-based VVMD was performed on the IMFs to elect the most relevant IMFs according to the Hurst exponent and lessen the low- as well as high-frequency noise elements in the speech signal. For each signal frame, the target features are chosen and fed to the DNN that learns these features to estimate the Ideal Ratio Mask (IRM) in a supervised manner. The abilities of DNN are enhanced for the categories of background noise, and the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the speech signals. Also, the noise category dimension and the SNR dimension are chosen for training and testing manifold DNNs since these are dimensions often taken into account for the SE systems. Further, the IRM in each frequency channel for all noisy signal samples is concatenated to reconstruct the noiseless speech signal. At last, the experimental outcomes exhibit considerable improvement in SE under different categories of noises.},

Directly fine-tuning the BERT model cannot achieve the expected effect. This paper proposes a novel summary generation model with BERT augmented by the pooling layer. In our model, we perform an average pooling operation on token embedding to improve the model’s ability to capture phrase-level semantic information. We use LCSTS and NLPCC2017 to verify our proposed method. Experimental data shows that the average pooling model’s introduction can effectively improve the generated summary quality. Furthermore, different data needs to be set with varying pooling kernel sizes to achieve the best results through comparative analysis. In addition, our proposed method has strong generalizability. It can be applied not only to the task of generating summaries, but also to other natural language processing tasks.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we presents an apporch for real-world human face close-up images cartoonization. We use generative adversarial network combined with an attention mechanism to convert real-world face pictures and cartoon-style images as unpaired data sets. At present, the image-to-image translation m odel has been able to successfully transfer style and content. However, some problems still exist in the task of cartoonizing human faces:Hunman face has many details, and the content of the image is easy to lose details after the image is translated. the quality of the image generated by the model is defective. The model in this paper uses the generative adversarial network combined with the attention mechanism, and proposes a new generative adversarial network combined with the attention mechanism to deal with these problems. The channel attention mechanism is embedded between the upper and lower sampling layers of the generator network, to avoid increasing the complexity of the model while conveying the complete details of the underlying information. After comparing the experimental results of FID, PSNR, MSE three indicators and the size of the model parameters, the new model network proposed in this paper avoids the complexity of the model while achieving a good balance in the conversion task of style and content.},

  abstract     = {The rational distribution of public bicycle rental fleets is crucial for improving the efficiency of public bicycle programs. The accurate prediction of the demand for public bicycles is critical to improve bicycle utilization. To overcome the shortcomings of traditional algorithms such as low pred iction accuracy and poor stability, using the 2011–2012 hourly bicycle rental data provided by the Washington City Bicycle Rental System, this study aims to develop an optimized and innovative public bicycle demand forecasting model based on grid search and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. First, the feature ranking method based on machine learning models is used to analyze feature importance on the original data. In addition, a public bicycle demand forecast model is established based on important factors affecting bicycle utilization. Finally, to predict bicycle demand accurately, this study optimizes the model parameters through a grid search (GS) algorithm and builds a new prediction model based on the optimal parameters. The results show that the optimized XGBoost model based on the grid search algorithm can predict the bicycle demand more accurately than other models. The optimized model has an R-Squared of 0.947, and a root mean squared logarithmic error of 0.495. The results can be used for the effective management and reasonable dispatch of public bicycles.},

This study constructs adaptive and reasoning algorithms. The former was used to optimize the AFRPN parameters, and the latter made the AFRPN model run. AFRPN could represent rules that had non-linear and attribute mapping relationships and could adjust the parameters adaptively to improve the accuracy of the output. Subsequently, the drum adjustment height model was established and compared to three models neural network (NN), classification and regression tree(CART) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT).

Presently, commercial NIDS is based on machine learning approaches that have complex algorithms and increase intrusion detection efficiency and efficacy. These machine learning-based NIDS use high dimensional network traffic data from which intrusive information is to be detected. This high-dimensional network traffic data in NIDS needs to be preprocessed and normalized to make it suitable for machine learning tools. A machine learning approach with appropriate normalization and prepossessing increases NIDS performance. This paper presents an empirical study on various normalization methods implemented on a benchmark network traffic dataset, KDD Cup’99, that has been used to evaluate the NIDS model. The present study shows decimal normalization has a better prediction performance than non-normalized traffic data categorized into ‘normal’ or ‘intrusive’ classes.},

First, the theoretical basis of NCS is introduced. Second, the PT and MARCOS method are combined. To reflect subjective views of decision makers and the objectivity of decision-making information, this paper uses geometric average method to combine subjective weights (calculated by the best-worst method) and objective weights (calculated ed by the entropy method). Then, the PT-MARCOS method is applied to a decision-making problem. Further, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to study the influence of different attenuation factor values and different expectation coefficient on the ranking; and through comparative analysis to illustrate the superiority of the PT-MARCOS method.

And they choose the best site on the basis of scores. The trait of EDAS method is to select an optimal alternative by using the distance of each alternative from the first-rank value. In this manuscript, we build the picture fuzzy EDAS method based on the cumulative prospect theory (PF-CPT-EDAS) for multiple attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) and it can help managers to choose an optimal alternative effectively. During the procedure of PF-CPT-EDAS means, we take advantage of the entropy means to calculate the original weights of all attributes. Ultimately, we testify the effectiveness of the novel model by comparing the overcome of PF-CPT-EDAS means with the results of PF-EDAS approach and other methods.},

Based on the situation of aircraft assembly workshops, the characteristics of fixed-position assembly workshop with uncertain re-e ntrance are abstracted. As the re-entrance repetition obeys some type of probability distribution, the expected value is used to describe the repetition, and a bi-level stochastic expected value programming model of integrated production planning and scheduling is constructed. Recursive expressions for start time and completion time of assembly classes and teams are confirmed. And the relation between the decision variable in the lower-level model of scheduling and the overtime and earliness of assembly classes and teams in the upper-level model of production planning is identified. Addressing the characteristics of bi-level programming model, an alternate iteration method based on Improved Genetic Algorithm (AI-IGA) is proposed to solve the models. Elite Genetic Algorithm (EGA) is introduced for the upper-level model of production planning, and Genetic Simulated Annealing Algorithm based on Stochastic Simulation Technique (SS-GSAA) is developed for the lower-level model of scheduling. Results from our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible for production planning and optimization of the fixed-position assembly workshop with uncertain re-entrance.

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are crafted by adding small, human-imperceptible perturbations to the original images, but make the model output inaccurate predictions. Before DNNs are deployed, adversarial attacks can thus be an important method to evaluate and select robust models in safety-critical applications. However, under the challenging black-box setting, the attack success rate, i.e., the transferability of adversarial examples, still needs to be improved. Based on image augmentation methods, this paper found that random transformation of image brightness can eliminate overfitting in the generation of adversarial examples and improve their transferability. In light of this phenomenon, this paper proposes an adversarial example generation method, which can be integrated with Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)-related methods to build a more robust gradient-based attack and to generate adversarial examples with better transferability. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset have demonstrated the effectiveness of the aforementioned method. Whether on normally or adversarially trained networks, our method has a higher success rate for black-box attacks than other attack methods based on data augmentation. It is hoped that this method can help evaluate and improve the robustness of models.},

Graph convolutional neural networks are receiving wide attention for session-based recommendation research for the sake of their ability to capture the complex transitions of interactions be tween sessions. Recent research on session-based recommendations mainly focuses on sequential patterns by utilizing graph neural networks. However, it is undeniable that proposed methods are still difficult to capture higher-order interactions between contextual interactions in the same session and has room for improvement. To solve it, we propose a new method based on graph attention mechanism and target oriented items to effectively propagate information, HOGAN for brevity. Higher-order graph attention networks are used to select the importance of different neighborhoods in the graph that consists of a sequence of user actions for recommendation applications. The complementarity between high-order networks is adopted to aggregate and propagate useful signals from the long distant neighbors to solve the long-range dependency capturing problem. Experimental results consistently display that HOGAN has a significantly improvement to 71.53% on precision for the Yoochoose1_64 dataset and enhances the property of the session-based recommendation task.},

On the other hand, the effect of word lexicality on aspects’ sentiment polarity judgments has not been considered in previous studies. In this paper, we propose lexical attention and aspect-oriented GCN to solve the above problems. First, we construct an aspect-oriented dependency-parsed tree by analyzing and pruning the dependency-parsed tree of the sentence, then use the lexical attention mechanism to focus on the features of the lexical properties that play a key role in determining the sentiment polarity, and finally extract the aspect-oriented lexical weighted features by a GCN.Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

We proposed a two-sided gaming model based on probabilistic linguistic term sets to address the pr oblem. Firstly, in previous studies, the mutual assessment is used to obtain the preferences of individuals in large-scale matching, but the procedure is time-consuming. We use probabilistic linguistic term sets to present the preferences based on the historical data instead of time-consuming assessment. Then, to generate the satisfaction based on the preference, we regard the similarity between the expected preferences and actual preferences as the satisfaction. Considering the distribution features of probabilistic linguistic term sets, we design a shape-distance-based method to measure the similarity. After that, the previous studies aimed to maximize the total satisfaction in matching, but the individuals’ requirements are neglected, resulting in a weak matching result. We establish the two-sided gaming matching model from the perspectives of individuals based on the game theory. Meanwhile, we also study the competition from other platforms. Meanwhile, considering the importance of the high total satisfaction, we balance the total satisfaction and the personal requirements in the matching model. We also prove the solution of the matching model is the equilibrium solution. Finally, to verify the study, we use the experiment to illustrate the advantages of our study.},

This study focuses on the optimal allocation of link resource in D2D communication systems using intelligent approaches, in order to obtain optimal energy efficiency of D2D-pair users (DP) and also ensure communication QoS. To be specific, the optimal resource allocation (ORA) model for ensuring the cooperation between DP and cellular users (CU) is established, and a novel coding strategy of ORA model is also proposed. Then, for efficiently optimizing the ORA model, a novel swarm-intelligence-based algorithm called the dynamic topology coevolving differential evolution (DTC-DE) is developed, and the efficiency of DTC-DE is also tested by a comprehensive set of benchmark functions. Finally, the DTC-DE algorithm is employed for optimizing the proposed ORA model, and some state-of-the-art algorithms are also employed for comparison. Result of case study shows that the DTC-DE outperforms its competitors significantly, and the optimal resource allocation can be obtained by DTC-DE with robust performance.},

In the modeling process of the FNEGM model, the fractional-order accumulated generating sequence is extended based on the first-order accumulated generating sequence, and the optimal parameters that increase the prediction precision of the model are obtained by using the whale optimization algorithm. The FNEGM model and the other two grey prediction models are applied to three cases, and five prediction performance indexes are used to evaluate the prediction precision of the three models.

Manufacturing industries in particular are advancing towards smart manufacturing by integrating and applying relevant technologies. The output value of machine tools in Taiwan is among the top of the world and the central region i s a key area for this industry chain, which supplies manufacturers in Taiwan and their international downstream customers. To support innovation in this industry, the current study used the Six Sigma quality indices for smaller-the-better, larger-the-better, and nominal-the-best quality characteristics to construct a fuzzy decision-making model. Based on this model, we propose a process quality fuzzy analysis chart (PQFAC) for process quality improvement. Our use of fuzzy decision values to replace lower confidence limits decreases the probability of misjudgment made by sampling errors. The proposed fuzzy model also offers a more accurate assessment of process improvement requirements. We provide a real-world example to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. Machine tool manufacturers can apply the platform and proposed model to evaluate their process capabilities for the vital parts suppliers and downstream customers, determine optimal machine parameter settings for processes with inadequate accuracy or precision, establish more suitable machine repair and maintenance systems, and combine the improvement experiences of customers to create an improvement knowledge base. This will enhance product value and industry competitiveness for the entire machine tool industry chain.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous groups of particles swarm optimization (AGPSO), inspired by individual diversity in biological swarms such as insects or birds, is a modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) variant. The AGPSO method is simple to understand and easy to implement on a computer. It has achieved an impres sive performance on high-dimensional optimization tasks. However, AGPSO also struggles with premature convergence, low solution accuracy and easily falls into local optimum solutions. To overcome these drawbacks, random-walk autonomous group particle swarm optimization (RW-AGPSO) is proposed. In the RW-AGPSO algorithm, Levy flights and dynamically changing weight strategies are introduced to balance exploration and exploitation. The search accuracy and optimization performance of the RW-AGPSO algorithm are verified on 23 well-known benchmark test functions. The experimental results reveal that, for almost all low- and high-dimensional unimodal and multimodal functions, the RW-AGPSO technique has superior optimization performance when compared with three AGPSO variants, four PSO approaches and other recently proposed algorithms. In addition, the performance of the RW-AGPSO has also been tested on the CEC’14 test suite and three real-world engineering problems. The results show that the RW-AGPSO is effective for solving high complexity problems.},

The improved algorithm is used to solve the problem that the whale optimization algorithm is more dependent on the randomness of the parameters, so that the alg orithm’s convergence accuracy and convergence speed are insufficient. The adaptive inertia weight, which varies with the fitness of individual whales, is used to balance the algorithm’s global search ability and local exploitation ability. The variable spiral position update strategy based on the collaborative convergence mechanism is used to dynamically adjust the search range and search accuracy of the algorithm. The effective combination of the two can make the improved whale optimization algorithm converge to the optimal solution faster. It had been used 18 international standard test functions, including unimodal function, multimodal function, and fixed-dimensional function to test the improved whale optimization algorithm in this paper. The test results show that the improved algorithm has faster convergence speed and higher algorithm accuracy than the original algorithm and several classic algorithms. The algorithm can quickly converge to near the optimal value in the early stage, and then effectively jump out of the local optimal through adaptive adjustment, and has a certain ability to solve large-scale optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, lakes pollution has become increasingly serious, so water quality monitoring is becoming increasingly important. The concentration of total organic carbon (TOC) in lakes is an important indicator for monitoring the emission of organic pollutants. Therefore, it is of great significa nce to determine the TOC concentration in lakes. In this paper, the water quality dataset of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River is obtained, and then the temperature, transparency, pH value, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, chlorophyll and ammonia nitrogen content are taken as the impact factors, and the stacking of different epochs’ deep neural networks (SDE-DNN) model is constructed to predict the TOC concentration in water. Five deep neural networks and linear regression are integrated into a strong prediction model by the stacking ensemble method. The experimental results show the prediction performance, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) is 0.5312, the mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.2108 mg/L, the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) is 43.92%, and the root mean squared error (RMSE) is 0.3064 mg/L. The model has good prediction performance for the TOC concentration in water. Compared with the common machine learning models, traditional ensemble learning models and existing TOC prediction methods, the prediction error of this model is lower, and it is more suitable for predicting the TOC concentration. The model can use a wireless sensor network to obtain water quality data, thus predicting the TOC concentration of lakes in real time, reducing the cost of manual testing, and improving the detection efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Connectivity parameters have a crucial role in the study of different networks in the physical world. The notion of connectivity plays a key role in both theory and application of different graphs. In this article, a prime idea of connectivity concepts in intuitionistic fuzzy incidence graphs (IFIG s) with various examples is examined. IFIGs are essential in interconnection networks with influenced flows. Therefore, it is of paramount significance to inspect their connectivity characteristics. IFIGs is an extended structure of fuzzy incidence graphs (FIGs). Depending on the strength of a pair, this paper classifies three different types of pairs such as an α - strong, β - strong, and δ-pair. The benefit of this kind of stratification is that it helps to comprehend the fundamental structure of an IFIG thoroughly. The existence of a strong intuitionistic fuzzy incidence path among vertex, edge, and pair of an IFIG is established. Intuitionistic fuzzy incidence cut pairs (IFICPs) and intuitionistic fuzzy incidence trees (IFIT) are characterized using the idea of strong pairs (SPs). Complete IFIG is defined, and various other structural properties of IFIGs are also investigated. The proof that complete IFIG does not contain any δ-pair is also provided. A real-life application of these concepts related to the network of different computers is also provided.},

The housing price to income and rent to income ratios were chosen as evaluation indicators, and the yearly median value of each indicator was taken as a dynamic reference point. The housing affordability indicators’ realistic prospect value matrix for large- and medium-sized Chinese cities were obtained for the study period’s duration. The comprehensive housing affordability prospect values were ranked using the improved VIKOR with entropy weight method. The novel proposed approach’s rationality and effectiveness were examined by comparing the original and prospect values, performing sensitivity analysis on the prospect value parameters, contrasting the ordinary and improved VIKOR methods, and comparing the proposed approach with the TOPSIS method. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can consider the decision maker’s psychological factors, endow housing affordability evaluation criteria with dynamic characteristics, overcome the problem of order reversal, and ensure the optimal compromise solution.

  abstract     = {The uncertainty is an important attribute about data that can arise from different sources including randomness and fuzziness, therefore in uncertain environments, especially, in modeling, planning, decision-making, and control under uncertainty, most data available contain some degree of fuzziness , randomness, or both, and at the same time, some of this data may be anomalous (outliers). In this regard, the new fuzzy regression approaches by creating a functional relationship between response and explanatory variables can provide efficient tools to explanation, prediction and possibly control of randomness, fuzziness, and outliers in the data obtained from uncertain environments. In the present study, we propose a new two-stage fuzzy linear regression model based on a new interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy least absolute deviation (FLAD) method so that regression coefficients and dependent variables are trapezoidal IT2 fuzzy numbers and independent variables are crisp. In the first stage, to estimate the IT2 fuzzy regression coefficients and provide an initial model (by original dataset), we introduce two new distance measures for comparison of IT2 fuzzy numbers and propose a novel framework for solving fuzzy mathematical programming problems. In the second stage, we introduce a new procedure to determine the mild and extreme fuzzy outlier cutoffs and apply them to remove the outliers, and then provide the final model based on a clean dataset. Furthermore, to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology, we introduce and employ suitable goodness of fit indices. Finally, to illustrate the theoretical results of the proposed method and explain how it can be used to derive the regression model with IT2 trapezoidal fuzzy data, as well as compare the performance of the proposed model with some well-known models using training data designed by Tanaka et al. [55], we provide two numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, how to choose a comfortable and relatively satisfactory residence is one of the multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) issues which people are paying more and more attention. However, since the inaccuracy and fuzziness of the information are given by decision makers (DMs) in pra ctical decision-making and psychological factors of DMs should be considered in the decision-making process, this paper presents TOPSIS approach based on cumulative prospect theory (CPT) to deal with the MAGDM issues under the spherical fuzzy environment. Furthermore, considering the objective relationship between the attributes, the combined weights are used to get attribute weights in spherical fuzzy sets (SFSs). Finally, an example of residential location is introduced to prove the validity of our proposed approach by comparing with spherical fuzzy TOPSIS(SF-TOPSIS) method and spherical fuzzy WASPAS (SF-WASPAS) method.},

A new mathematical model is offered to describe the overall performance of the system. Since the problem enjoys an NP-hard complexity structure, we used two distinct metaheuristic methods to achieve acceptable solutions for minimizing weighted total completion time as the objective function. The first method is customary memetic algorithm (MA). The second one, MPA, is a modified version of memetic algorithm in which the new permutating operation is replaced with the mutation. Furthermore, some predefined feasible solutions were imposed in the initial population of both MA and MPA. According to the results, the latter action caused a remarkable improvement in the performance of algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the enormous advantages of cloud services make them increasingly appealing to the small and medium-sized enterprises. The growing number of available services makes it challenging to select trustworthy services. Existing approaches focus on user preferences to guide personalized services recommendation for individual users, but lack of the research on trustworthy service recommendation for the small and medium-sized enterprises that represents a group user consisting of multiple individual users. For this type of enterprise, the cloud services recommendation must address the challenges from the diverse client context of individual users, the imprecise quality of experience in an uncertain cloud environment and the invalid or unsatisfactory recommendations. A client context-aware approach is proposed to recommend trustworthy cloud services for the small and medium-sized enterprises based on non-compensatory multi-criteria decision-making. In it, a type of client context is viewed as an independent evaluation criterion, and the interval neutrosophic numbers are employed to measure the fuzzy trustworthiness of cloud services. Based on the investigated outranking relations of interval neutrosophic numbers, a non-compensatory multi-criteria decision-making procedure via an improved ELECTRE III method is developed to rank candidate services. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach could efficiently produces the accurate ranking results of cloud services and effectively recommend the trustworthy service for small and medium-sized enterprises.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning (DL) algorithms, especially the convolutional neural network (CNN), have been proven as a newly developed tool in machinery intelligent diagnosis. However, the current CNN-based fault diagnosis studies usually consider features or images extracted from a single domain as model input. This single domain information may not reflect fault patterns comprehensively, leading to low modeling accuracy and inaccurate diagnostic results. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a new CNN-based fault diagnosis approach using image representation considering multi-domain features of vibration signals. First, multi-domain features of vibration signals are extracted. These extracted features are then used to construct a n × n matrix, and subsequently to form images by RGB color transformations. This image transformation technique allows for capturing complementary and rich diagnostic information from multiple domains. At last, these images associated with different mechanical defects are fed into a CNN model that is improved based on the classic LeNet-5 CNN architecture for fault diagnosis and identification. Comparative experiments with the traditional feature extraction methods as well as state-of-the-art CNN-based methods are also investigated. Experimental studies on rolling bearings validate the effectiveness and superiorities of the proposed approach.},

During the past few decades, many real-world supplier selection problem s have been resolved using MAGDM methods. Nevertheless, extant research on supplier selection considers either fuzzy criteria or stochastic criteria, and hence most of these methods cannot address the complex and unstructured nature of contemporary service supplier selection problems. In this study, a novel technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) approach, integrating both fuzzy criteria and stochastic criteria, is developed; in this approach, the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) cross-entropy for fuzzy criteria and the Euclidean distance for stochastic criteria are used to acquire the rankings of alternatives. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is conducted for a case study of hoisting service supplier selection, and a comparative analysis with other existing methods is performed to confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.},

Yet, the effective use of these data to assist autonomous driving remains a challenge, especially lack of exploration and exploitation of stereo images with ab undant perceptible depth. In this paper, we propose a novel Depth-embedded Instance Segmentation Network (DISNet) which can effectively improve the performance of instance segmentation by incorporating the depth information of stereo images. The proposed network takes binocular images as input to observe the displacement of the object and estimate the corresponding depth perception without additional supervisions. Furthermore, we introduce a new module for computing the depth cost-volume, which can be integrated with the colour cost-volume to jointly capture useful disparities of stereo images. The shared-weights structure of Siamese Network is applied to learn the intrinsic information of stereo images while reducing the computational burden. Extensive experiments have been carried out on publicly available datasets (i.e., Cityscapes and KITTI), and the obtained results clearly demonstrate the superiority in segmenting instances with different depths.},

  abstract     = {Detection of the rotor position is an important prerequisite for controlling the speed and developed torque in permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). Even though use of incremental encoder and resolver is one of the popular schemes for sensing the rotor position in a PMSM drive, it increases th e size and weight of the drive and reduces its reliability. Dynamic modeling of the motor and control algorithms are often used in sensor-less control of PMSM to estimate rotor position and motor speed. Most sensor-less control algorithms use machine parameters like torque constant, stator inductances and stator resistance for estimating the rotor position and speed. However, with accuracy of such estimation and the performance of the motor degrades with variation in motor parameters. Model reference adaptive control (MRAC) provides a simple solution to this issue. An improved Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) based MRAC observer for speed control of PMSM drive is presented in this paper. In the proposed method adaptive model and adaptive mechanism are replaced by an improved ANFIS controller, which neutralize the effect of parametric variation and results in improved performance of the drive. The modeling equations of PMSM are used to estimate the rotor position for speed and torque control of the drive. Simulation studies have been carried out under various operating condition using MATLAB/Simulink. In addition, a comparative analysis of the conventional MRAC based observer and improved ANFIS based MRAC observer is carried out. It is observed that the proposed method results in better performance of the PMSM drive.},

  abstract     = {Arrhythmia is an abnormality often encountered in patients with cardiac problems. The presence of arrhythmia can be detected by an electrocardiogram (ECG) test. Automatic observation based on machine learning has been developed for long time. Unfortunately, only few of them have capability of expla ining the knowledge inside themselves. Thus, transparency is important to improve human understanding of knowledge. To achieve this goal, a method based on cascaded transparent classifier is proposed. Firstly, ECG signals were separated and every single signal was extracted using feature extraction method. Several of extracted feature’s attributes were selected, and the final step was classifying data using cascade classifier which consists of decision tree and the rule based classifier. Classification performance was evaluated with publicly available dataset, the MIT-BIH Physionet Dataset. The methods were tested using 10-fold cross validation. The average of both accuracy and number of rules generated was considered. The best result using rule-based classifier achieves the accuracy and the number of rules 92.40% and 40, respectively. And the best result using cascade classifier achieves the accuracy and the number of rules 92.84% and 80, respectively. As a conclusion, transparent classifier shows a competitive performance with reasonable accuracy compared with previous research and promising in addressing the need for interpretability model.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a solar photovoltaic model integrated with brushless DC motor via DC to DC zeta converter is controlled in two stage. In first stage, a fuzzy rule based maximum power point tracking (PPT) is proposed to generate the pulse for DC to DC zeta converter. It is efficient intelligent contr ol approach to extract maximum power from the solar PV system and enhance the speed to track the maximum power. The basic three process of fuzzy logic controller (FLC) are fuzzifier, inference and defuzzifier where the defuzzification process is used center of gravity (COG) method to convert its original value. The FLC to extract maximum PPT for solar PV based brushless DC motor can be examined the performance under transient and dynamic condition with different solar insolation. Moreover, in second stage a trapezoidal control approach based electronic commutation is chosen to generate the pulses of voltage source inverter (VSI) and it offers the smooth control of the brushless DC motor which can easily applicable for water pumping or irrigation purpose. A second stage, trapezoidal control approach is close loop control algorithm using sensorless drive. The performance of proposed fuzzy rule based control algorithm is shown using simulation results on MATLAB platform.},

Vickrey second price auction is used for truthful bidding. To enhance the security and trust, blockchain technology can be incorporated. The market is shifted to decentralized state by using blockchain. To encourage the MGs to generate more, contribution index is allotted to each prosumer of a MG and to the MGs as a whole, depending on which priority is given during auction.

To prevent confidential data from getting in the hands of an attacker, some measures need to be taken. Here comes the need for an effective system, which can clas sify the traffic as an attack or normal. Intrusion Detection Systems can do this work with perfection. Many machine learning algorithms are used to develop efficient IDS. These IDS provide remarkable results. However, ensemble-based IDS using voting have been seen to outperform individual approaches (Support Vector Machine and ExtraTree). Since the Voting methodology is able to work around both, theoretically similar and different classifiers and produce a single classifier based on the majority characteristics, it proved to be better than the other ensemble based techniques. In this paper, an ensemble IDS implementation is presented based on the voting ensemble method, using the two algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVC) and ExtraTree. The experiment is performed on the KDDCup99 Dataset. The evaluation of the performance of the proposed method is based on the comparison with an unoptimized implementation of the same. The results based on performing the experiment in Python fetched an accuracy of 99.90%.},

During data transmission among nodes, intrusion detection is carried to improve data security and privacy. Intrusion detection system (IDS) examines the n etwork for intrusions based on user activities. Several works have been done in the field of intrusion detection and different measures are carried out to increase data security from the issues related to black hole, Sybil attack, Worm hole, identity replication attack and etc. In various existing approaches, secure data transmission is not achieved, therefore resulted in compromising the security and privacy of IWSNs. Accurate intrusion detection is still challenging task in terms of improving security and intrusion detection rate. In order to improve intrusion detection rate (IDR) with minimum time, generalized Frechet Hyperbolic Deep and Dirichlet Secured (FHD-DS) data communication model is introduced. At first, Frechet Hyperbolic Deep Traffic (FHDT) feature extraction method is designed to extract more relevant network activities and inherent traffic features. With the help of extracted features, anomalous or normal data is predicted. Followed by Statistical Dirichlet Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection model is applied to discover intrusion. Here, Dirichlet distribution is evaluated to attain secure data transmission and significantly detect intrusions in WSNs. Experimental evaluation is carried out with KDD cup 99 dataset on factors such as IDR, intrusion detection time (IDT) and data delivery rate (DDR). The observed results show that the generalized FHD-DS data communication method achieves higher IDR with minimum time.},

The condition monitoring system of the equipment should be reliable and avoid such a sudden breakdown or faults in the equipment. The proposed technique predicts the fault of the ID fan-motor system, being applicable for other rotating industrial equipment, and also for which the failure data, or historical data, is not available. The major problem in the industry is the monitoring of each and every machinery individually. To avoid this problem, three identical ID fans are monitored together using the proposed technique. This helps in the prediction of the faulty part and also the time left for the complete breakdown of the fan-motor system. This helps in forecasting the maintenance schedule for the equipment before breakdown. From the results, it is observed that the PCA-based technique is a good fit for early fault detection and getting alarmed under fault condition as compared with the conventional methods, including signal trend and fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis.},

  abstract     = {Under partial shading conditions (PSC), most traditional maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques may not adopt GP (global peak). These strategies also often take a considerable amount of time to reach a full power point (MPP). Such obstacles can be eliminated by the use of metaheuristic stra tegies. This paper shows, in partial shading conditions, the MPPT technique for the photovoltaic system using the Bat Algorithm (BA). Simulations have been performed in the MATLAB®/Simulink setting to verify the efficacy of the proposed method. In MPPT applications, the results of the simulations emphasize the precision of the proposed technique. The algorithm is also simple and efficient, on a low-cost microcontroller, it could be implemented. Hardware in Loop (HIL) validation is performed, with a Typhoon HIL 402 setup.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, Biometric systems are prevalent for personal recognition. But due to pandemic COVID 19, it is difficult to pursue a touch-based biometric system. To encourage a touchless biometric system, a less constrained multimodal personal identification system using palmprint and dorsal hand vein is presented. Hand based Touchless recognition system gives a higher user-friendly system and avoids the spread of coronavirus. A method using Convolution Neural Networks(CNN) to extract discriminative features from the data samples is proposed. A pre-trained function PCANeT is used in the experiments to show the performance of the system in fusion scheme. This method doesn’t require keeping the palm in a specific position or at a certain distance like most other papers. Different patches of ROI are used at two different layers of CNN. Fusion of palmprint and dorsal hand vein is done for final result matching. Both Feature level and score level fusion methods are compared. Results shows the accuracy of upto 98.55% and 98.86% and Equal error rate (EER) of upto 1.22% and 0.93% for score level fusion and feature level fusion, respectively. Our method gives higher accurate results in a less constrained environment.},

In this paper, the design and implementation for optimum placement of PMU in power system network (PSN) has been performed using 5 different intelligent approaches at an emulation platform. Different case studies based on IEEE 7, 14 and 30 bus system have been performed and analyzed. In the studies, PMU device is used for the measurement of voltage and current magnitude as well as its phase and its performance has been compared with measured real signals of PSN. PMU measurement gives the accurate results and reliability to PSN. But PMUs are not economical, so PSN operator needs to install a minimum number of PMU in PSN so that system should be fully observable in a real-time scenario. In this paper for optimal placement of PMU, five different intelligent methods have been analyzed for three different bus systems and obtained results are compared. For the further validation of selected PMUs for the PSN, a state estimation using WLS algorithm has been performed using conventional data and PMU data on IEEE14 and IEEE30 bus systems. The obtained results for voltage estimation error and phase estimation error with and without PMU data are compared.},

Due to the intermittent behaviour of renewable sources, parallel operation of RES and battery storage known as hybrid system is important particularly in remote micro-grids to reduce th e fuel consumption by diesel generators and continuity of supply to the load. In this paper, multilevel inverter called Packed E-Cell (PEC) is used for parallel operation of RES and battery storage optimally for micro-grid applications. The PEC requires less components compared to other Multi-level inverters (MLI) topology with relatively low total harmonic distortion (THD). Further, selective harmonic technique based on optimization principle is used to enhance the harmonic profile using low frequency switching technique. The 3rd and 5th harmonics are eliminated using Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization technique. The simulation-based analysis is done using Simulink/MATLAB and the results obtained for THD in the output current and voltage are presented and discussed in the paper. A comparative analysis is also presented with high frequency modulation technique phase disposition pulse width modulation (PDPWM) technique. The experimental validation of the proposed scheme is done using Typhoon HIL (hardware in loop).},

  abstract     = {Due to its clean and abundant availability, solar energy is popular as a source to generate electricity. Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology converts sunlight incident on the solar PV panel or array directly into non-linear DC electricity. However, the non-linear nature of the solar panels’ power ne eds to be tracked for its efficient utilization. The problem of non-linearity becomes more prominent when the solar PV array is shaded, even leading to high power losses and concentrated heating in some areas (hotspot condition) of the PV array. Bypass diodes used to eliminate the shading effect cause multiple peaks of power on the power versus voltage (P-V) curve and make the tracking problem quite complex. Conventional algorithms to track the optimal power point cannot search the complete P-V curve and often become trapped in local optima. More recently, metaheuristic algorithms have been employed for maximum power point tracking. Being stochastic, these algorithms explore the complete search area, thereby eliminating any chance of becoming trapped stuck in local optima. This paper proposes a hybridized version of two metaheuristic algorithms, Radial Movement Optimization and teaching-learning based optimization (RMOTLBO). The algorithm has been discussed in detail and applied to multiple shading patterns in a solar PV generation system. It successfully tracks the maximum power point (MPP) in a lesser amount of time and lesser fluctuations.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, two accurate hybrid islanding detection schemes are proposed based on Wavelet Transform and Stockwell transform (S-transform). The proposed methods use the potential of sequence voltage (negative) retrieved at the target Distributed Generation (DG) location of the distribution networ k under study. In one of the schemes, Discrete Wavelet transform (DWT) is applied to process the negative sequence voltage signal and for its decomposition, which is further used to extract six statistical features like energy, entropy, mean, kurtosis, standard deviation, and skewness from the reconstructed DWT coefficients. Test and train data sets are generated with the wide variation of loading conditions, and optimal features are chosen from the full feature set by forward feature selection method (FFS) during the training process by an artificial neural network (ANN). After that, the trained system is tested to get the detection result. Another scheme presented in this paper for islanding detection is based on S-transform, which is used to decompose the negative sequence voltage signal. Amplitude, frequency, and phase are the three coefficients acquired from the pre-processing of the raw signal by S-transform. Then the cumulative sums of the energy content of the S-transform coefficients are determined and are compared with a threshold value to get the detection result. The proposed schemes are tested in a distribution network consisting of two 9 MW wind farm driven by six 1.5 MW wind turbine connected to 120 kV main grid through a 25 kV, 30 km feeder. Several cases have been investigated like normal condition, islanding, DG line trip, disconnection of point of common coupling, and sudden change in load to test the performance of the proposed schemes. It can be observed from the results that both the approaches gave high accuracy in the detection of islanding conditions and demarcates properly from the non-islanding state. However, results show that the S-transform based approach provides a better resolution and quick detection of islanding than the wavelet transform approach.},

Then, features are extracted from experimental dataset using EMD (empirical mode decomposition) method. The IMFs (intrinsic mode functions) have generated from EMD, which are used as an input variable to the two different diagnostic models, i.e., ANN and J48 algorithm. In order to validate the performance and accuracy of the proposed hybrid model, a comparative analysis is performed by using ANN and J48 method (with and without EMD method) and the results are compared.

Most of the semi-supervised clustering algorithms exist only for the clustering of complete data, i.e., the data sets with no missing features. In this paper, an effort has been made to chec k the effectiveness of semi-supervised clustering when applied to incomplete data sets. The novelty of this approach is that it considers the missing features along with available knowledge (labels) of the data set. The linear interpolation imputation technique initially imputes the missing features of the data set, thus completing the data set. A semi-supervised clustering is now employed on this complete data set, and missing features are regularly updated within the clustering process. In the proposed work, the labeled percentage range used is 30, 40, 50, and 60% of the total data. Data is further altered by arbitrarily eliminating certain features of its components, which makes the data incomplete with partial labeling. The proposed algorithm utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data, along with certain missing values in the data. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using three performance indices, namely the misclassification rate, random index metric, and error rate. Despite the additional missing features, the proposed algorithm has been successfully implemented on real data sets and showed better/competing results than well-known standard semi-supervised clustering methods.},

  abstract     = {Impedance mismatching between different phases of a multiphase transformer is generally observed e.g., in a three-phase to seven-phase transformer, due to an unequal number of turns in different coils. This mismatching introduces error in the study of per phase equivalent circuit diagrams as well a s induces an imbalance in output voltages and currents. Therefore, it is a challenging task to develop a per-phase equivalent circuit for the secondary and primary sides (In some cases) too. This paper proposes an artificial intelligence optimization technique like PSO based modeling of the per-phase equivalent circuit of the secondary side. This paper deals with the modeling and simulation of a three-phase to seven-phase power transformer using Artificial Intelligence technique like particle swarm optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The proposed model is optimized through PSO and GA algorithms and tested for minimum voltage error in each phase. The proposed model is designed and the objective function is optimized by PSO &amp; GA in MATLAB environment. It is found that the optimized model can be effectively implemented as a per-phase equivalent circuit for the secondary side.},

The nonlinear system considered here is a single link inverted pendulum. The propo sed work combines the advantages of the sliding mode controlling technique and fuzzy logic controller. A set of linguistic rules are designed in fuzzy logic control, which causes the system to be chattering free. Parameters of the nonlinear system are adjusted according to fuzzy adaptive laws, while the uncertainties of the nonlinear system have been approximated using a fuzzy system. Various types of controller based on fuzzy sliding mode, like approximation based sliding mode control technique; equivalent control based fuzzy sliding mode technique, and switch-gain regulation based sliding mode control methods have been implemented here. A comparative analysis of various methods is also have been discussed.},

  abstract     = {In the modern electrical power system network (EPSN), the power quality disturbances (PSDs) are the serious issue for the power engineer to maintain the uninterrupted and reliable power supply. Generally, PQDs are generated due to non-linear loading conditions, perturb loading and other occurrences such as transient, harmonics, sag, swell and interruptions. These problems of PQDs effect the power demand mapping problem, which effect the reliability and stability of the EPSN operating condition. In this study, a novel approach for PQDs diagnosis (PQDD) is proposed, which includes real-time data generation, data pre-processing, feature extraction, feature selection, intelligent model development for PQDD. Data decomposition approach of EMD is utilized to generate the feature vector of IMFs. These features are utilized as an input variables to the intelligent classifiers. In this study, PQDD is analyzed based on SVM method and obtained results are compared with conventional AI method of LVQ-NN. The results represent the higher acceptability of the proposed approach with diagnosis accuracy of 99.98% (training phase), 93.11% (testing phase) for SVM and 92.56% (training phase) and 91.0% (testing phase) for LVQ-NN based PQDD method.},

First, we have obtained features from three differ ent selection approaches as mentioned above and then performed the UNION SET Operation to extract the reduced feature set. Then, Genetic Algorithm is applied to optimize the feature set further. This paper also presents an Ensemble Approach based on the error rate obtained different domain datasets. To test our proposed Hybrid Feature Selection and Ensemble Classification approach, we have considered four Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier variants. We have used UCI ML Datasets of three domains namely: IMDB Movie Review, Amazon Product Review and Yelp Restaurant Reviews. The experimental results show that our proposed approach performed best in all three domain datasets. Further, we also presented T-Test for Statistical Significance between classifiers and comparison is also done based on Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC and model execution time.},

However, due to the limitations of the actual project investment decision-making, this paper proposes a group decision making method based multifunctional intuitively fuzzy VIKOR interval sets. Firstly, according to the established investment decision-making model, the first round of preliminary candidate project schemes is selected. According to the definition of interval intuitionistic fuzzy sets and the traditional VIKOR method, established the research method of this article, and the project investment decision-making model based on VIKOR interval intuitionistic fuzzy sets is established. Finally, the project schemes are sorted according to the closeness degree of schemes. The results show that when sorting each candidate by Qi value, A4 &gt; A3 &gt; A2 &gt; A1 can be obtained. Because Q4 = 0, Q3 = 0.31, the condition q3-q4 &gt; 0.25 is satisfied. It is concluded that the method can not only meet the needs of actual decision-making, but also has strong operability and practicability. The research results have reference value and guiding significance for project investment decision-making, and can promote the sustainable development of the project.},
