  abstract     = {Identifying photovoltaic (PV) parameters accurately and reliably can be conducive to the effective use of solar energy. The grey wolf optimizer (GWO) that was proposed recently is an effective nature-inspired method and has become an effective way to solve PV parameter identification. However, dete rmining PV parameters is typically regarded as a multimodal optimization, which is a challenging optimization problem; thus, the original GWO still has the problem of insufficient accuracy and reliability when identifying PV parameters. In this study, an enhanced grey wolf optimizer with fusion strategies (EGWOFS) is proposed to overcome these shortcomings. First, a modified multiple learning backtracking search algorithm (MMLBSA) is designed to ameliorate the global exploration potential of the original GWO. Second, a dynamic spiral updating position strategy (DSUPS) is constructed to promote the performance of local exploitation. Finally, the proposed EGWOFS is verified by two groups of test data, which include three types of PV test models and experimental data extracted from the manufacturer’s data sheet. Experiments show that the overall performance of the proposed EGWOFS achieves competitive or better results in terms of accuracy and reliability for most test models.},

  abstract     = {Railway alignment design is a complicated problem affected by intricate environmental factors. Although numerous alignment optimization methods have been proposed, a general limitation among them is the lack of a spatial environmental suitability analysis to guide the subsequent alignment search. C onsequently, many unfavorable regions in the study area are still searched, which significantly degrades optimization efficiency. To solve this problem, a geographic information model is proposed for evaluating the environmental suitability of railways. Initially, the study area is abstracted as a spatial voxel set and the 3-D reachable ranges of railways are determined. Then, a geographic information model is devised which considers topographic influencing factors (including those affecting structural cost and stability) as well as geologic influencing factors (including landslides and seismic impacts) for different railway structures. Afterward, a 3-D environmental suitability map can be generated using a multi-criteria decision-making approach to combine the considered factors. The map is further integrated into the alignment optimization process based on a 3-D distance transform algorithm. The proposed model and method are applied to two complex realistic railway cases. The results demonstrate that they can considerably improve the search efficiency and also find better alignments compared to the best alternatives obtained manually by experienced human designers and produced by a previous distance transform algorithm as well as a genetic algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Safe navigation at sea is more important than ever. Cargo is usually transported by vessel because it makes economic sense. However, marine accidents can cause huge losses of people, cargo, and the vessel itself, as well as irreversible ecological disasters. These are the reasons to strive for safe vessel navigation. The navigator shall ensure safe vessel navigation. He must plan every maneuver and act safely. At the same time, he must evaluate and predict the actions of other vessels in dense maritime traffic. This is a complicated process and requires constant human concentration. It is a very tiring and long-lasting duty. Therefore, human error is the main reason of collisions between vessels. In this paper, different reinforcement learning strategies have been explored in order to find the most appropriate one for the real-life problem of ensuring safe maneuvring in maritime traffic. An experiment using different algorithms was conducted to discover a suitable method for autonomous vessel navigation. The experiments indicate that the most effective algorithm (Deep SARSA) allows reaching 92.08% accuracy. The efficiency of the proposed model is demonstrated through a real-life collision between two vessels and how it could have been avoided.},

  abstract     = {Multi-robot path planning has evolved from research to real applications in warehouses and other domains; the knowledge on this topic is reflected in the large amount of related research published in recent years on international journals. The main focus of existing research relates to the generation of efficient routes, relying the collision detection to the local sensory system and creating a solution based on local search methods. This approach implies the robots having a good sensory system and also the computation capabilities to take decisions on the fly. In some controlled environments, such as virtual labs or industrial plants, these restrictions overtake the actual needs as simpler robots are sufficient. Therefore, the multi-robot path planning must solve the collisions beforehand. This study focuses on the generation of efficient collision-free multi-robot path planning solutions for such controlled environments, extending our previous research. The proposal combines the optimization capabilities of the A* algorithm with the search capabilities of co-evolutionary algorithms. The outcome is a set of routes, either from A* or from the co-evolutionary process, that are collision-free; this set is generated in real-time and makes its implementation on edge-computing devices feasible. Although further research is needed to reduce the computational time, the computational experiments performed in this study confirm a good performance of the proposed approach in solving complex cases where well-known alternatives, such as M* or WHCA, fail in finding suitable solutions.},

  abstract     = {Industry 4.0 leads to a strong digitalization of industrial processes, but also a significant increase in communication and cooperation between the machines that make it up. This is the case with autonomous industrial vehicles (AIVs) and other cooperative mobile robots which are multiplying in fact ories, often in the form of fleets of vehicles, and whose intelligence and autonomy are increasing. While the autonomy of autonomous vehicles has been well characterized in the field of road and road transport, this is not the case for the autonomous vehicles used in industry. The establishment and deployment of AIV fleets raises several challenges, all of which depend on the actual level of autonomy of the AIVs: acceptance by employees, vehicle location, traffic fluidity, collision detection, or vehicle perception of changing environments. Thus, simulation serves to account for the constraints and requirements formulated by the manufacturers and future users of AIVs. In this paper, after having proposed a broad state of the art on the problems to be solved in order to simulate AIVs before proceeding to experiments in real conditions, we present a method to estimate positions of AIVs moving in a closed industrial environment, the extension of a collision detection algorithm to deal with the obstacle avoidance issue, and the development of an agent-based simulation platform for simulating these two methods and algorithms. The resulting/final/subsequent simulation will allow us to experiment in real conditions.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a noninvasive portable prototype is presented for biomedical audio signal processing. The proposed prototype is suitable for monitoring the health of patients. The proposed hardware setup consists of a cost-effective microphone, multipurpose microcontroller and computing node that could be a mobile phone or general-purpose computer. Using parallel and high-performance techniques, this setup allows one to register and wirelessly multicast the recorded biomedical signals to computing nodes in real time. The developed prototype was used as a case study to estimate the heart rate (HR) from the captured biomedical audio signal. In this regard, the developed algorithm for estimating HR comprises three stages: preprocessing, separation, and HR estimation. In the first stage, the signal captured by the microphone is adapted for processing. Subsequently, a separation stage was proposed to alleviate the acoustic interference between the lungs and heart. The separation is performed by combining a non-negative matrix factorization algorithm, clustering approach, and soft-filter strategy. Finally, HR estimation was obtained using a novel and efficient method based on the autocorrelation function. The developed prototype could be used not only for the estimation of the HR, but also for the retrieval of other biomedical information related to the recording of cardiac or respiratory audio signals. The proposed method was evaluated using well-known datasets and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms for source-separation. The results showed that it is possible to obtain an accurate separation and reliable real-time estimation in terms of source separation metrics and relative error in the tested scenarios by combining multi-core architectures with parallel and high-performance techniques. Finally, the proposed prototype was validated in a real-world scenario.},

Current study develops a surveying mechanism, utilizing a swarm of heterogeneous aerial mobile sensory platforms, for the continuous monitoring and detection of CH4 dispersed gas plumes. In order to timely represent the CH4 diffusion progression incident, the research concerns a simulated indoor, geometrically complex environment, where early detection and timely response are critical. The primary aim was to evaluate the efficiency of a novel multi-agent, closed-loop, algorithm responsible for the UAV path-planning of the swarm, in comparison with an efficient a state-of-the-art path-planning EGO methodology, acting as a benchmark. Abbreviated as Block Coordinate Descent Cognitive Adaptive Optimization (BCD-CAO) the novel algorithm outperformed the Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) algorithm, in seven simulation scenarios, demonstrating improved dynamic adaptation of the aerial UAV swarm towards its heterogeneous operational capabilities. The evaluation results presented herein, exhibit the efficiency of the proposed algorithm for continuously conforming the mobile sensing platforms’ formation towards maximizing the total measured density of the diffused volume plume.},

Such attacks can pose potential disruptions to critical services delivery. There are number of existing works that focus on using Machine Learning (ML) models for predicting vulnerability and exploitation but most of these works focused on parameterized values to predict severity and exploitability. This paper proposes a novel method that uses ontology axioms to define essential concepts related to the overall healthcare ecosystem and to ensure semantic consistency checking among such concepts. The application of ontology enables the formal specification and description of healthcare ecosystem and the key elements used in vulnerability assessment as a set of concepts. Such specification also strengthens the relationships that exist between healthcare-based and vulnerability assessment concepts, in addition to semantic definition and reasoning of the concepts. Our work also makes use of Machine Learning techniques to predict possible security vulnerabilities in health care supply chain services. The paper demonstrates the applicability of our work by using vulnerability datasets to predict the exploitation. The results show that the conceptualization of healthcare sector cybersecurity using an ontological approach provides mechanisms to better understand the correlation between the healthcare sector and the security domain, while the ML algorithms increase the accuracy of the vulnerability exploitability prediction. Our result shows that using Linear Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest provided a reasonable result for predicting vulnerability exploitability.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays the steel market is becoming ever more competitive for European steelworks, especially as far as flat steel products are concerned. As such competition determines the price products, profit can be increased only by lowering production and commercial costs. Production yield can be significantly increased through an appropriate scheduling of the semi-manufactured products among the available sub-processes, to ensure that customers’ orders are timely completed, resources are optimally exploited, and delays are minimized. Therefore, an ever-increasing attention is paid toward production optimization through efficient scheduling strategies in the scientific and industrial communities. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to improve the flexibility of production scheduling in steelworks producing flat steel products. Such approach combines three methods holding different scopes and modelling different aspects: an auction-based multi-agent system is applied to face production uncertainties, multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming is used for global optimal scheduling of resources under steady conditions, while a continuous flow model copes with long-term production scheduling. According to the obtained simulation results, the integration and combination of these three approaches allow scheduling production in a flexible way by providing the capability to adapt to different production conditions.},

  abstract     = {Training a model using batch learning requires uniform data storage in a repository. This approach is intrusive, as users have to expose their privacy and exchange sensitive data by sending them to central entities to be preprocessed. Unlike the aforementioned centralized approach, training of inte lligent models via the federated learning (FEDL) mechanism can be carried out using decentralized data. This process ensures that privacy and protection of sensitive information can be managed by a user or an organization, employing a single universal model for all users. This model should apply average aggregation methods to the set of cooperative training data. This raises serious concerns for the effectiveness of this universal approach and, therefore, for the validity of FEDL architectures in general. Generally, it flattens the unique needs of individual users without considering the local events to be managed. This paper proposes an innovative hybrid explainable semi-personalized federated learning model, that utilizes Shapley Values and Lipschitz Constant techniques, in order to create personalized intelligent models. It is based on the needs and events that each individual user is required to address in a federated format. Explanations are the assortment of characteristics of the interpretable system, which, in the case of a specified illustration, helped to bring about a conclusion and provided the function of the model on both local and global levels. Retraining is suggested only for those features for which the degree of change is considered quite important for the evolution of its functionality.},

  abstract     = {Consumer-centric energy management approaches are emerging as a major solution for future power systems. In this context, intelligent home management systems should control different kinds of devices existing in the houses assuring convenient comfort levels and understanding the users’ behaviour. A t the same time, the home management systems should be able to interact with other actors such as energy communities, aggregators, and system operators. The main contribution of this work is a new methodology allowing intelligent management, in near real-time (1 minute), of different types of energy resources existing in a smart home. The energy resources include appliances and other loads, micro-generation, and electric vehicles. The proposed system includes a permanent evaluation of the operation state of each energy resource considering their functional model and the behaviour and comfort level defined by the users. Participation in demand response programs reducing the power consumption limits is also considered showing the advantage of the proposed approach. The case study contains two scenarios considering a demand response program of power limitation with 120 minutes duration. To guarantee the participation in these demand response events, the system should evaluate the priority of each device according to its model. A domestic consumer with 45 energy resources (appliances, generation, and electric vehicles) is used for demonstration purposes.},

  abstract     = {Black Hole (BH) is a bioinspired metaheuristic algorithm based on the theory of relativity in which a sufficiently compact mass can deform the space-time to form a black hole, where no particles or electromagnetic radiation can escape from it. Thus, such an approach is based on the concept of a pop ulation of individuals (stars) representing solutions for a given computational problem to be optimized. In the literature, such an approach has been used to solve clustering problems, among others, since it is parameter-free and simple to implement. In this article, due to such characteristics, a hybrid solution, in software/hardware, of parallelization of the BH algorithm is proposed, aiming at accelerating its processing in hardware through a methodology that allows any user, even non-expert, implement hardware accelerators, for optimization problems, among others, through a high level tool. A System on Chip (SoC) platform was used for this implementation, containing a Zynq chip from Xilinx, which has two ARM cores and an FPGA. The BH Algorithm was implemented in software first and then in hardware for runtime comparison purposes to validate this approach. Also, in this paper, simpler and more popular optimization algorithms, such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Gravitational Search (GSA), and Big Bang – Big Crunch (BB-BC), along with simpler datasets, were used for comparison purposes, due to its ease of implementation and to keep a fairer comparison with BH as realized in other works in the literature. Therefore, the results obtained were satisfactory in terms of execution time and quality, with an average speedup of 25 times compared to the same implementation in software. In the future, it is intended to use this procedure to implement more recent clustering and optimization algorithms with larger datasets as well.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing complexity of engineered systems, digital twins (DTs) have been widely used to support integrated modeling, simulation, and decision-making of the system of systems (SoS). However, when integrating DTs of each constituent system, it is challenging to implement complexity managem ent, interface definition, and service integration across DTs. This study proposes a new concept called cognitive twin (CT) to support SoS development and operation. CTs have been defined as DTs with augmented semantic capabilities for promoting the understanding of interrelationships be-tween virtual models and enhancing the decision-making. First, CTs aim to integrate the information description of DTs across constituent systems using a unified ontology and semantic modeling technique. Second, CTs provide integrated simulations among DTs for decision-making of the SoS based on a high-level architecture (HLA). Finally, through reasoning ontology models, CTs provide decision-making options for the operations of real constituent systems. A case study on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) landing on unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) is used to verify the flexibility of this approach. From the results, we find that the CT based on the proposed ontology provides a unified formalism of DTs across UAVs and USVs. Moreover, the reasoning based on the CT provides decision-making capabilities for UAVs by implementing cognitive computing to select target USVs for landing.},

  abstract     = {Multi-center clustering algorithms have attracted the attention of researchers because they can deal with complex data sets more effectively. However, the reasonable determination of cluster centers and their number as well as the final clusters is a challenging problem. In order to solve this prob lem, we propose a multi-center clustering algorithm based on mutual nearest neighbors (briefly MC-MNN). Firstly, we design a center-point discovery algorithm based on mutual nearest neighbors, which can adaptively find center points without any parameters for data sets with different density distributions. Then, a sub-cluster discovery algorithm is designed based on the connection of center points. This algorithm can effectively utilize the role of multiple center points, and can effectively cluster non-convex data sets. Finally, we design a merging algorithm, which can effectively obtain final clusters based on the degree of overlapping and distance between sub-clusters. Compared with existing algorithms, the MC-MNN has four advantages: (1) It can automatically obtain center points by using the mutual nearest neighbors; (2) It runs without any parameters; (3) It can adaptively find the final number of clusters; (4) It can effectively cluster arbitrarily distributed data sets. Experiments show the effectiveness of the MC-MNN and its superiority is verified by comparing with five related algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles are equipped with complimentary sensors to perceive the environment accurately. Deep learning models have proven to be the most effective approach for computer vision problems. Therefore, in autonomous driving, it is essential to design reliable networks to fuse data from differ ent sensors. In this work, we develop a novel data fusion architecture using camera and LiDAR data for object detection in autonomous driving. Given the sparsity of LiDAR data, developing multi-modal fusion models is a challenging task. Our proposal integrates an efficient LiDAR sparse-to-dense completion network into the pipeline of object detection models, achieving a more robust performance at different times of the day. The Waymo Open Dataset has been used for the experimental study, which is the most diverse detection benchmark in terms of weather and lighting conditions. The depth completion network is trained with the KITTI depth dataset, and transfer learning is used to obtain dense maps on Waymo. With the enhanced LiDAR data and the camera images, we explore early and middle fusion approaches using popular object detection models. The proposed data fusion network provides a significant improvement compared to single-modal detection at all times of the day, and outperforms previous approaches that upsample depth maps with classical image processing algorithms. Our multi-modal and multi-source approach achieves a 1.5, 7.5, and 2.1 mean AP increase at day, night, and dawn/dusk, respectively, using four different object detection meta-architectures.},

Extractive summarization has specific advantages over abstractive summa rization in that it preserves style, specific text elements, and compound phrases that might be more directly associated with the text. In this article, the relative effectiveness of extractive summarization is considered on two widely different corpora: (1) a set of works of fiction (100 total, mainly novels) available from Project Gutenberg, and (2) a large set of news articles (3000) for which a ground truthed summarization (gold standard) is provided by the authors of the news articles. Both sets were evaluated using 5 different Python Sumy algorithms and compared to randomly-generated summarizations quantitatively. Two functional approaches to assessing the efficacy of summarization using a query set on both the original documents and their summaries, and using document classification on a 12-class set to compare among different summarization approaches, are introduced. The results, unsurprisingly, show considerable differences consistent with the different nature of these two data sets. The LSA and Luhn summarization approaches were most effective on the database of fiction, while all five summarization approaches were similarly effective on the database of articles. Overall, the Luhn approach was deemed the most generally relevant among those tested.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a data balancing method for multi-label biomedical data. The method can be applied in the case of semantic segmentation problems for balancing the corresponding image data. The proposed method performs oversampling of instances of minority classes in a way that increases t he frequencies of appearance (a ratio of number of samples, containing this class, over the total number of samples in the dataset) of minority classes in the data, thereby reducing the class imbalance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown experimentally by applying it to two highly unbalanced biomedical image datasets. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on several versions of those datasets: one balanced with the proposed method, another balanced with manual oversampling and an unbalanced version. The results of the experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, proving that it allows the influence of class imbalance on the learning algorithm to be reduced, thus improving its original classification results for most of the classes. Apart from biomedical image data, the proposed method was applied to several common multi-label datasets. Inherently, the proposed method does not make any assumptions about the underlying structure of the data to be balanced; therefore, it can be applied to all types of data (vectors, images, etc.) that can be described in a multi-label framework. It also can be used in conjunction with any learning algorithm that is suitable for multi-label data. To illustrate its wider applicability, a series of experiments was conducted using seven common multi-label datasets. An experimental comparison to existing multi-label data balancing approaches is provided, as well. The experimental results show that the proposed method presents a competitive alternative to existing approaches.},

These biometric applications tend to be computationally heavy, so to monitor users in an unobtrusive manner, sensing and processing modules are physically separated and connected through point-to-point wireless communication technologies. However, in this approach, sensors are very resource constrained, and common cryptographic techniques to protect private users’ information while traveling in the radio channel cannot be implemented because their computational cost. Thus, new security solutions for those biometric authentication systems in their short-range wireless communications are needed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new cryptographic approach addressing this scenario. The proposed solution employs lightweight operations to create a secure symmetric encryption solution. This cipher includes a pseudo-random number generator based, also, on simple computationally low-cost operations in order to create the secret key. In order to preserve and provide good security properties, the key generation and the encryption processes are fed with a chaotic number sequence obtained through the numerical integration of a new four-order hyperchaotic dynamic.

Typical perceptual metrics, like Detection Score (DS) and Inception Scor e (IS), were employed to assess the visual quality after generation in pose transfer task. Thus, the existing GAN-based methods do not directly benefit from these metrics which are highly associated with human ratings. In this paper, a perceptual metrics guided GAN (PIGGAN) framework is proposed to intrinsically optimize generation processing for pose transfer task. Specifically, a novel and general model-Evaluator that matches well the GAN is designed. Accordingly, a new Sort Loss (SL) is constructed to optimize the perceptual quality. Morevover, PIGGAN is highly flexible and extensible and can incorporate both differentiable and indifferentiable indexes to optimize the attitude migration process. Extensive experiments show that PIGGAN can generate photo-realistic results and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.},
