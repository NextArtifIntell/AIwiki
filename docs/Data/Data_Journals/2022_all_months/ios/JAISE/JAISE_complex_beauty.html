  abstract     = {Elderly people requiring care the entire day usually depend on the availability of their family members to give assistance. However, the family members might not provide appropriate help especially in an emergent situation. The application of Internet of Things (IoT) technology with a variety of interconnected devices provides the solution. We propose an IoT-based smart healthcare system comprising wearable devices, which integrates a variety of contact sensors with location-based mesh networks (LBMN) such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connections to continuously sense various parameters of aging people. The BLE-connected devices such as wearable sensors, fixed sensors, seat cushions, pedal mats, magnetic reed switches, and mobile devices are all involved in collecting, processing, and transmitting physiological data and their locations to the cloud. Through the utilization of convenient interfaces such as software applications on smartphones and web pages on computers, it provides real time monitoring of the elderly in terms of localization, activity pattern, and health status. Thus the system enables early detection of health risks to the elderly. We used Platform as a service (PaaS) to receive and store the health data generated from the interconnected devices and to perform analysis. The essential feature of this LBMN is to generate a complete 6W(Who, What,When,Where,Why and How)big data for policy, feed it to the PaaS analysis to easily and quickly obtain more accurate data, and then develop possible health strategy or preventive measures. The proposed healthcare system detected that, out of the 20 participants recruited, 2 persons (10%) were often restless. It was also able to detect abnormal daily activity patterns with more tag positioning and the historical data from the devices. More importantly, it can help to prevent potential physical and neuropsychiatric disorders based on the real-time monitoring information and analyzed historical data for the aging people.},

  abstract     = {Smart devices, such as smart phones, voice assistants and social robots, provide users with a range of input modalities, e.g., speech, touch, gestures, and vision. In recent years, advancements in processing of these input channels enable more natural interaction (e.g., automated speech, face, and gesture recognition, dialog generation, emotion expression etc.) experiences for users. However, there are several important challenges that need to be addressed to create these user experiences. One challenge is that most smart devices do not have sufficient computing resources to execute the Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques locally. Another challenge is that users expect responses in near real-time when they interact with these devices. Moreover, users also want to be able to seamlessly switch between devices and services any time and from anywhere and expect personalized and privacy-aware services. To address these challenges, we design and develop a cloud-based middleware (CMI) which helps to develop multi-modal interaction applications and easily integrate applications to AI services. In this middleware, services developed by different producers with different protocols and smart devices with different capabilities and protocols can be integrated easily. In CMI, applications stream data from devices to cloud services for processing and consume the results. It supports data streaming from multiple devices to multiple services (and vice versa). CMI provides an integration framework for decoupling the services and devices and enabling application developers to concentrate on “interaction” instead of AI techniques. We provide simple examples to illustrate the conceptual ideas incorporated in CMI.},

In this study, a garbage classification device was designed, and the image dataset Wit-Garbage for garbage classification was constructed bas ed on the device by collecting garbage images under different light intensity and weather environment. The performances of the five network models VGG16, ResNet50, DenseNet121, MobileNet V2, Inception V3 on this dataset were compared by transfer learning. Then, the lightweight convolutional neural network MobileNet V2 was optimized by fine-tuning the hyperparameters, such as the type of optimizer, learning rate, Dropout parameter and number of freezing layers, respectively, and the training accuracy and efficiency were discussed in detail. Finally, the optimized model MobileNet V2 was deployed to the self-made garbage classification device for verification. The results show that the MobileNet V2 network model is superior to other networks in terms of training accuracy and efficiency on the proposed dataset, when the image input size was 224 ∗ 224 pixels, the Adamax optimizer was adopted, the learning rate was 0.0001, the Dropout was less than 0.5, and the number of frozen layers is less than 30. The actual verification results show that the average accuracy of the optimized network model trained on the proposed dataset for MSW classification was up to 98.75%, and compared with the model before optimization, the average accuracy was improved by 2.83%, and the average detection time was reduced by 69%.},

  abstract     = {Hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs in 60% of healthy babies and 80% of preterm infants because of an increase in unconjugated bilirubin in red blood cells. It is subjective to determine the severity of jaundice by visual assessment of the skin color of a newborn, and clinical judgement is dependent on the doctor’s knowledge. The paper explains the development of a non-invasive bilirubin detection technique called CliNicS, to check the bilirubin level of premature babies and report premature births and deaths to the health organization via an IOT network. CliNicS provides a noninvasive, transcutaneous bilirubin monitoring system using LED having a wavelength of 410 nm to 460 nm, and it also provides the treatment automatically by using LCT (LED Controlled Therapy) method. The level of bilirubin will be detected by using the photo detector, and the bilirubin measurement will be displayed on the LCD display. The bilirubin levels will be transmitted to doctors and health organizations via the IOT network. The proposed method helps to detect neonatal jaundice earlier, which reduces the risk of hyperbilirubinemia in newborns and makes it easier to measure total serum bilirubin levels than ever before.},

  abstract     = {With the social evolution, economic development, and continuously improved living standards, the dramatically increasing garbage produced by human beings has seriously affected our living environment. There are 3 main ways to dispose of garbage: sanitary landfill, incineration, or recycling. At present, a huge amount of labor resources is required for pre-sorting before garbage disposal, which greatly reduces efficiency, increases costs, and even leads to direct incineration without sorting. Hence, this study proposes a solution scenario of how to use object detection technology for garbage sorting. With the development of the deep learning theory, object detection technology has been widely used in all fields, thus, how to find target objects accurately and rapidly is one of the key technologies. This paper proposes a highly efficient garbage pick-up embedded system, where detection is optimized based on the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) neural network architecture and reduced model parameters. The experimental verification scenario was conducted in a dynamic environment integrating a robotic arm with a conveyor belt simulated by an electronic rotating turntable. The experimental results show that the modified model can accurately identify garbage types, with a significant speed of 27.8 FPS (Frames Per Second) on NVidia Jetson TX2, and an accuracy rate of approximately 87%.},

COVID-19 has also been a process of mass experiences regarding society. Determining the mass impact the pandemic has had on society shows that the pandemic is facilitating the transition to the so-called new normal. Istanbul is a multi-identity city where 16 million people have intensely experienced the pandemic’s impact. While determining the identities of cities in the world, one can see that different city structures provide different data sets. This study models a machine learning algorithm suitable for the data set we’ve determined for the 39 different districts of Istanbul and 82 different features of Istanbul. The aim of the study is to indicate the changing societal trends during the COVID-19 pandemic using machine learning techniques. Thus, this work contributes to the literature and real life in terms of redesigning cities for the post-COVID19 period. Another contribution of this study is that the proposed methodology provides clues on what people in cities consider important during a pandemic.},

Energy harvesting is one of the methodologies extending the lifetime of a battery. This paper presents the design of an Internet of Things enabled personalized healthcare device for monitoring human vital signs. The hardware prototype is developed with a low cost Wi-Fi enabled embedded board known as NodeMCU. The NodeMCU interfaced with vital signs monitoring sensors, an activity monitoring sensor, a rechargeable battery, and a solar panel. The vital signs of a person, such as body temperature, heart rate and activity are collected in a cloud environment and an alert is sent to the caregiver under abnormal circumstances. The results show that the prototype can successfully monitor the vital signs and activity such as idle or fallen, and also the lifetime of the battery has been extended for long term use, contributing to a healthier life style.},

The developed IoT-based monitoring system is portable and provides users with real-time data transfer about IAQ. During the COVID-19 period, air quality data were collected from the kitchen, bedroom and balcony of their home, where a family of 5 spend most of their time. As a result of the analyzes, it has been determined that indoor particulate matter is mainly caused by outdoor infiltration and cooking emissions, and the CO 2 value can rise well above the permissible health limits in case of insufficient ventilation due to night sleep activity. The obtained results show that the developed measuring devices may be suitable for measurement-based indoor air quality management. In addition, the proposed low-cost measurement system compared to existing systems; It has advantages such as modularity, scalability, low cost, portability, easy installation and open-source technologies.},

Although existing deep learning techniques have made great progress in detecting traffic signs, there are still many unsolved challenges. We propose a novel traffic sign detection network named ReYOLO that learns rich contextual information and senses scale variations to efficiently detect small and ambiguous traffic signs in the wild. Specifically, we first replace the conventional convolutional block with modules that are built by structural reparameterization methods and are embedded into bigger structures, thus decoupling the training structures and the inference structures using parameter transformation, and allowing the model to learn more effective features. We then design a novel weighting mechanism which can be embedded into a feature pyramid to exploit foreground features at different scales to narrow the semantic gap between multiple scales. To fully evaluate the proposed method, we conduct experiments on a traditional traffic sign dataset GTSDB as well as two new traffic sign datasets TT100K and CCTSDB2021, achieving 97.2%, 68.3% and 83.9% mAP (Mean Average Precision) for the three-class detection challenge in these three datasets.},

Therefore, the purpose of this work is to survey the existing literature about IoT and their related paradigms to obtain a model that provides a definition usable to guide in the selection of that paradigm that fits better the requirements of the system-to-be. For this aim, a rigorous and systematic Thematic Synthesis has been conducted to analyze the most relevant studies of the selected paradigms and specify a model that integrates their definitions, their relations and differences. Furthermore, Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS) has been identified as the paradigm focusing on social and human factors that better realizes the complex hyperspace of the smart world since it entails relevant and convenient aspects from other paradigms.},

  abstract     = {With the commencement of new technologies like IoT and the Cloud, the sources of data generation have increased exponentially. The use and processing of this generated data have motivated and given birth to many other domains. The concept of a smart city has also evolved from making use of this data in decision-making in the various aspects of daily life and also improvement in the traditional systems. In smart cities, various technologies work collaboratively; they include devices used for data collection, processing, storing, retrieval, analysis, and decision making. Big data storage, retrieval, and analysis play a vital role in smart city applications. Traditional data processing approaches face many challenges when dealing with such voluminous and high-speed generated data, such as semi-structured or unstructured data, data privacy, security, real-time responses, and so on. Probabilistic Data Structures (PDS) has been evolved as a potential solution for many applications in smart cities to complete this tedious task of handling big data with real-time response. PDS has been used in many smart city domains, including healthcare, transportation, the environment, energy, and industry. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of PDS and its applications in the domains of smart cities. The prominent domain of the smart city has been explored in detail; origin, current research status, challenges, and existing application of PDS along with research gaps and future directions. The foremost aim of this paper is to provide a detailed survey of PDS in smart cities; for readers and researchers who want to explore this field; along with the research opportunities in the domains.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, Virtual Assistive Smart Eyes (VASE) is described which introduces a new advanced smart glass technology for the visually impaired. Smart glasses in general, have come up as the most calculative device in the modern age to amalgamate humans and machines with the help of machine learning and information technology. These devices are frequently used in industries like medicine and gaming, but their exploration in the field of assistive technology, specifically for the visually impaired is very limited. Majority of these devices are focusing on only a fraction of the features required. It is unfair to leave the average person no choice but to invest in products that are expensive and are not covering all aspects of the problems faced, that they would need to be autonomous in their every-day lives. The proposed VASE is a cost-effective pair of smart glasses which includes many features such as obstruction detection and object recognition. VASE would immensely benefit the visually impaired people in doing their daily tasks and lead an independent life. It will impact the society enormously, as it aids in the prevention of accidents and any other unfortunate incidents, bringing about a major technological advancement benefiting the whole world.},

  abstract     = {Connected devices are deployed at a rapid rate and in broad domains like home automation or industry, forming the Internet of Things. Those devices need to be secure and trusted to prevent malicious use. However some connected devices are low-cost, memory constrained, power constrained, etc.. This greatly limits the deployment of usual security solutions. As the absence of security is not acceptable, it is necessary to search for lightweight security solutions adapted to such devices. Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) technology can support new lightweight security mechanisms and several lightweight security protocols using this technology have been proposed over the years. Those protocols look promising, however there are still some unaddressed challenges which have slowed down a large scale adoption. This article presents the design of a new authentication protocol for constrained devices which takes into account those challenges. This protocol is implemented on a hardware platform used for connected devices development, which is then used to evaluate the security level and performances of the protocol in a realistic scenario. This evaluation shows that the protocol is secure and can meet industrial time constraints.},

This multi-agent system is designed to monitor the interaction between the user and other agents, and regulate itself based on the estimated level of mental engagement of the user in order to contribute to help them maintain adequate levels of awareness and interaction with their home environment. The agents are devices programmed to preserve the security, comfort and health of the user, who is also conceptualized as one of the agents in the system. The user engagement level is estimated through fuzzy inference, that is, by means of a set of fuzzy membership functions and rules applied over the interaction of the user with different categories of agents. The system incorporates several dozen agents and is tested using two different datasets of real interactions between users and devices in their home environments. A uniform parameter configuration yielded very positive results for diverse scenarios and subsequently the parameters of the system were automatically optimized to show that improved performance, in the form of a more efficient system regulation and increased certainty in adjustment estimation, is obtained.},

  abstract     = {The world population is aging in the last few years and this trend is expected to increase in the future. The number of persons requiring assistance in their everyday life is also expected to rise. Luckily, smart homes are becoming a more and more compelling alternative to direct human supervision. Smart homes are equipped with sensors that, coupled with Artificial Intelligence (AI), can support their occupants whenever needed. At the heart of the problem is the recognition of activities. Human activity recognition is a complex problem due to the variety of sensors available, their impact on privacy, the high number of possible activities, and the several ways even a simple activity can be performed. This paper proposes a deep learning model combining LSTM and a tuned version of the EfficientNet model using transfer learning, data fusion, minimalist pre-processing as well as training for both activity and movement recognition using data from three ultra-wideband (UWB) radars. As regards activity recognition, experiments were conducted in a real and furnished apartment where 15 different activities were performed by 10 participants. Results showed an improvement of 18.63% over previous work on the same dataset with 65.59% in Top-1 accuracy using Leave-One-Subject-Out cross validation. Furthermore, the experiments that address movement recognition were conducted under the same conditions where a single participant was asked to perform four distinct arm movements with the three UWB radars positioned at two different heights. With an overall accuracy of 73% in Top-1, the detailed analysis of the results obtained showed that the proposed model was capable of recognizing accurately large and fine-grained movements. However, the medium-sized movements demonstrated a significant impact on the movement recognition due to an insufficient degree of variation between the four proposed movements.},

  abstract     = {Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is an emerging technology that has the potential to redefine healthcare sector around the world. It can perform proactively by ubiquitously monitoring human health. But its enormous scope is challenged by limited battery power of the sensors, energy and bandwidth. Moreover, the random motion of human beings makes sensor positioning difficult and restricts efficiently routing of critical health parameter values. State of the art protocols do not address the adverse effects of heating of the implanted sensors on human tissues along with energy constraints and interference issues simultaneously. This paper handles all these issues jointly by designing a topology which has an optimized number of relay nodes and then proposes an efficient routing algorithm. Relay nodes are incorporated to frame the backbone of the connected wireless network so that all sensor nodes are coupled with at least one relay node and none of the nodes in the network remain isolated. In the proposed method, the remaining energy of the in-vivo sensors are dissipated intelligently and homogeneously so that network lifetime is enhanced without compromising reliability. Moreover, in our method, multicasting has been used to reduce transmission of unnecessary packets. Our design also leads to minimum hop count from body sensors to the sink node. The effectiveness and feasibility of our proposed approach has been evaluated and analyzed through numerous simulations. The analysis illustrates the efficacy of the proposed solution in terms of delay, network lifetime, energy efficiency, SAR and throughput.},

Here, the equipment is restricted to use by the authorized individual under its working limits. The access control for energy monitoring has been carried out using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and IEEE 802.11ac with the design of customized breakout board. The DAEM has been carried out by comparing the electrical characteristics like current, voltage, active power, apparent power, and power factor with their preset warning and trip threshold values. Using DAEM, the electrical circuit overload is prevented ensuring the operator’s safety. Moreover, the timer in the circuit will automatically disconnect the load from the mains after a timeout to prevent unnecessary wastage of energy.},

By using a mobile app, park visitors can control the sound playback by selecting the natural sounds they like, such as birds or a waterfall, and setting the volume. This process of adding artificial sounds to the existing sound environment results in an augmented soundscape. Comparison of the environment with and without this sound playback showed that most visitors experience this as an improvement of the park environment and enjoy controlling the sounds. An experiment with 165 users identified various correlations between the visitors’ subjective evaluations of the sound environment and objective measures of their usage behavior with the app, such as the number of interactions and the spent time.},

Intelligent fire evacuation requires dynamic planning of paths in fire field, it is necessary to automatically adjust the evacuation route in the building according to the real-time information of the fire. In this paper, an improved bidirectional ant colony algorithm is proposed to optimize fire evacuation routes. In order to improve the global search capability of the algorithm, a bidirectional search strategy with the A* algorithm is designed for the ant colony algorithm, the blindness of the algorithm is reduced in the initial search, the pheromone update strategy is improved, and the convergence speed of the algorithm is increased. The fire scene information is combined with the steering penalty coefficient to improve the algorithm’s evaporation coefficient, heuristic function and transition probability, avoid the risk of falling into the local optimum, improve the search efficiency of the algorithm and the smoothness of the path, and effectively avoid areas affected by the fire. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by simulation.},

  abstract     = {Epilepsy is a chronic brain disease resulted from the central nervous system lesion, which leads to repeated seizure occurs for the patients. Automatic seizure detection with Electroencephalogram (EEG) has witnessed great progress. However, existing methods paid little attention to the topological relationships of different EEG electrodes. Latest neuroscience researches have demonstrated the connectivity between different brain regions. Besides, class-imbalance is a common problem in EEG based seizure detection. The duration of epileptic EEG signals is much shorter than that of normal signals. In order to deal with the above mentioned two challenges, we propose to model the multi-channel EEG data using the Attention-based Graph ResNet (AGRN). In particular, each channel of the EEG signal represents a node of the graph and the inter-channel relations are modeled via the adjacency matrix in the graph. The loss function of the ARGN model is re-designed using focal loss to cope with the class-imbalance problem. The proposed ARGN with focal model could learn discriminative features from the raw EEG data. Experiments are carried out on the CHB-MIT dataset. The proposed model achieves an average accuracy of 98.70%, a sensitivity of 97.94%, a specificity of 98.66% and a precision of 98.62%. The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is 98.69%.},

  abstract     = {In this work, advanced learning and moving window-based methods have been used for epileptic seizure detection. Epilepsy is a disorder of the central nervous system and roughly affects 50 million people worldwide. The most common non-invasive tool for studying the brain activity of an epileptic patient is the electroencephalogram. Accurate detection of seizure onset is still an elusive work. Electroencephalogram signals belonging to pediatric patients from Children’s Hospital Boston, Massachusetts Institute of Technology have been used in this work to validate the proposed method. For determining between seizure and non-seizure signals, feature extraction techniques based on time-domain, frequency domain, time-frequency domain have been used. Four different methods (decision tree, random forest, artificial neural network, and ensemble learning) have been studied and their performances have been compared using different statistical measures. The test sample technique has been used for the validation of all seizure detection methods. The results show better performance by random forest among all the four classifiers with an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 91.9%, 94.1%, and 89.7% respectively. The proposed method is suggested as an improved method because it is not channel specific, not patient specific and has a promising accuracy in detecting epileptic seizure.},

  abstract     = {Dose-volume histogram (DVH) is an important tool to evaluate the radiation treatment plan quality, which could be predicted based on the distance-volume spatial relationship between planning target volumes (PTV) and organs-at-risks (OARs). However, the prediction accuracy is still limited due to the complicated calculation process and the omission of detailed spatial geometric features. In this paper, we propose a spatial geometric-encoding network (SGEN) to incorporate 3D spatial information with an efficient 2D convolutional neural networks (CNN) for accurate prediction of DVH for esophageal radiation treatments. 3D computed tomography (CT) scans, 3D PTV scans and 3D distance images are used as the multi-view input of the proposed model. The dilation convolution based M ulti-scale concurrent S patial and C hannel S queeze &amp; E xcitation (msc-SE) structure in the proposed model not only can maintain comprehensive spatial information with less computation cost, but also can extract the features of organs at different scales effectively. Five-fold cross-validation on 200 intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) esophageal radiation treatment plans were used in this paper. The mean absolute error (MAE) of DVH focusing on the left lung can achieve 2.73 ± 2.36 , while the MAE was 7.73 ± 3.81 using traditional machine learning prediction model. In addition, extensive ablation studies have been conducted and the quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of different components in the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Due to the increase in the global aging population and its associated age-related challenges, various cognitive, physical, and social problems can arise in older adults, such as reduced walking speed, mobility, falls, fatigue, difficulties in performing daily activities, memory-related and social isolation issues. In turn, there is a need for continuous supervision, intervention, assistance, and care for elderly people for active and healthy aging. This research proposes an ambient assisted living system with the Internet of Medical Things that leverages deep learning techniques to monitor and evaluate the elderly activities and vital signs for clinical decision support. The novelty of the proposed approach is that bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit, and Gated Recurrent Unit deep learning techniques with mutual information-based feature selection technique is applied to select robust features to identify the target activities and abnormalities. Experiments were conducted on two datasets (the recorded Ambient Assisted Living data and MHealth benchmark data) with bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit, and Gated Recurrent Unit deep learning techniques and compared with other state of art techniques. Different evaluation metrics were used to assess the performance, findings reveal that bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit deep learning techniques outperform other state of art approaches with an accuracy of 98.14% for Ambient Assisted Living data, and 99.26% for MHealth data using the proposed approach.},
