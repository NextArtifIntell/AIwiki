To develop effective decision-making approaches, we take a special focus on (i) temporal uncertainty, in particular of action execution; (ii) the ability to provide rich guarantees of performance, both at a local (robot) level and at a global (team) level; and (iii) scaling up to systems with real-world impact.

For the case where the system (agents and their environment) can be explicitly modelled, we develop formal verification methods over several logic languages, such as temporal epistemi c logic and strategy logic, to reason about the knowledge and strategy of the agents. For the case where the system cannot be explicitly modelled, we study multiagent deep reinforcement learning, aiming to develop efficient and scalable learning methods for cooperative multiagent tasks. In addition to these, we develop (both formal and simulation-based) verification methods for the neural network based perception agent that is trained with supervised learning, considering its safety and robustness against attacks from an adversarial agent, and other approaches (such as explainable AI, reliability assessment, and safety argument) for the analysis and assurance of the learning components. Our ultimate objective is to combine formal methods, machine learning, and reliability engineering to not only develop dependable learning-enabled multiagent systems but also provide rigorous methods for the verification and assurance of such systems.},

  abstract     = {Agent-based modelling (ABM) is a facet of wider Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) research that explores the collective behaviour of individual ‘agents’, and the implications that their behaviour and interactions have for wider systemic behaviour. The method has been shown to hold considerable value in exp loring and understanding human societies, but is still largely confined to use in academia. This is particularly evident in the field of Urban Analytics; one that is characterised by the use of new forms of data in combination with computational approaches to gain insight into urban processes. In Urban Analytics, ABM is gaining popularity as a valuable method for understanding the low-level interactions that ultimately drive cities, but as yet is rarely used by stakeholders (planners, governments, etc.) to address real policy problems. This paper presents the state-of-the-art in the application of ABM at the interface of MAS and Urban Analytics by a group of ABM researchers who are affiliated with the Urban Analytics programme of the Alan Turing Institute in London (UK). It addresses issues around modelling behaviour, the use of new forms of data, the calibration of models under high uncertainty, real-time modelling, the use of AI techniques, large-scale models, and the implications for modelling policy. The discussion also contextualises current research in wider debates around Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and MAS more broadly.},

  abstract     = {The mechanisms of emergence and evolution of collective behaviours in dynamical Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) of multiple interacting agents, with diverse behavioral strategies in co-presence, have been undergoing mathematical study via Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT). Their systematic study also resort s to agent-based modelling and simulation (ABM) techniques, thus enabling the study of aforesaid mechanisms under a variety of conditions, parameters, and alternative virtual games. This paper summarises some main research directions and challenges tackled in our group, using methods from EGT and ABM. These range from the introduction of cognitive and emotional mechanisms into agents’ implementation in an evolving MAS, to the cost-efficient interference for promoting prosocial behaviours in complex networks, to the regulation and governance of AI safety development ecology, and to the equilibrium analysis of random evolutionary multi-player games. This brief aims to sensitize the reader to EGT based issues, results and prospects, which are accruing in importance for the modeling of minds with machines and the engineering of prosocial behaviours in dynamical MAS, with impact on our understanding of the emergence and stability of collective behaviours. In all cases, important open problems in MAS research as viewed or prioritised by the group are described.},

  abstract     = {Prioritized Datalog± is a well-studied formalism for modelling ontological knowledge and data, and has a success story in many applications in the (Semantic) Web and in other domains. Since the information content on the Web is both inherently context-dependent and frequently updated, the occurrenc e of a logical inconsistency is often inevitable. This phenomenon has led the research community to develop various types of inconsistency-tolerant semantics over the last few decades. Although the study of query answering under inconsistency-tolerant semantics is well-understood, the problem of explaining query answering under such semantics took considerably less attention, especially in the scenario where the facts are prioritized. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap. More specifically, we use Dung’s abstract argumentation framework to address the problem of explaining inconsistency-tolerant query answering in Datalog± KB where facts are prioritized, or preordered. We clarify the relationship between preferred repair semantics and various notions of extensions for argumentation frameworks. The strength of such argumentation-based approach is the explainability; users can more easily understand why different points of views are conflicting and why the query answer is entailed (or not) under different semantics. To this end we introduce the formal notion of a dialogical explanation, and show how it can be used to both explain showing why query results hold and not hold according to the known semantics in inconsistent Datalog± knowledge bases.},

First, there is feature redundancy and less discriminating feature representations. Second, the number of effective multi-scale features is limited. In this paper, we aim to solve these constraints with the proposed network that utilizes two effective pre-trained models as an encoder. We develop a cross-form attention pyramid that acquires semantically rich multi-scale information from local and global priors. A spatial-wise attention module is introduced to further enhance the segmentation findings. It highlights more discriminating regions of low-level features to focus on significant location information. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed network on three datasets, including IDD Lite, PASCAL VOC 2012, and CamVid. Our model achieves a mIoU score of 70.7% on the IDD Lite, 83.98% on the PASCAL VOC 2012, and 73.8% on the CamVid dataset.},

A new model is proposed to use global features more rationally and extract more fine-grained part features. Specifically, our model captures global features by using a multi-scale attention global feature extraction module, and we design a new context-based adaptive part feature extraction module to consider continuity between different body parts of pedestrians. In addition, we have added additional enhancement modules to the model to enhance its performance. Experiments show that our model achieves competitive results on the Market1501, Dukemtmc-ReID, and MSMT17 datasets. The ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each module of our model.

  abstract     = {3D skeleton data has been widely used in action recognition as the skeleton-based method has achieved good performance in complex dynamic environments. The rise of spatio-temporal graph convolutions has attracted much attention to use graph convolution to extract spatial and temporal features toget her in the field of skeleton-based action recognition. However, due to the huge difference in the focus of spatial and temporal features, it is difficult to improve the efficiency of extracting the spatiotemporal features. In this paper, we propose a channel attention and multi-scale neural network (CA-MSN) for skeleton-based action recognition with a series of spatio-temporal extraction modules. We exploit the relationship of body joints hierarchically through two modules, i.e., a spatial module which uses the residual GCN network with the channel attention block to extract the high-level spatial features, and a temporal module which uses the multi-scale TCN network to extract the temporal features at different scales. We perform extensive experiments on both the NTU-RGBD60 and NTU-RGBD120 datasets to verify the effectiveness of our network. The comparison results show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance with the competitive computing speed. In order to test the application effect of our CA-MSN model, we design a multi-task tandem network consisting of 2D pose estimation, 2D to 3D pose regression and skeleton action recognition model. The end-to-end (RGB video-to-action type) recognition effect is demonstrated. The code is available at https://github.com/Rh-Dang/CA-MSN-action-recognition.git.},

  abstract     = {Printed Circuit Board (PCB) is the heart component of electronic products, and its defect detection is the basic requirement of PCB quality control in the production process. Traditional visual detection methods need artificial design features, so their detection accuracy is poor, and the rate of m issed and false detection is high. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes an improved YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) detection method for PCB plug-in solder spot defects based on the combination of the ordered probability density weighting and the attention mechanism. First, in order to obtain a higher priority priori box, the ordered probability density weighting (OWA) method is used to optimize the multiple sets of a priori boxes generated by K-means. Then, to get more effective feature information, the Squeeze-and-Excitation mechanism (SE) is added to the backbone network. In the feature detection network, the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) attention mechanism is joined, at the same time in the inspection network output layer three layer feature are fusions. Finally, in order to accelerate the convergence speed of model and improve the accuracy of the model, the network loss function was improved by using the generalized joint generalized intersection over union (GIoU), and the COCO data model was applied to PCB solder spot defect training by transfer learning method. After testing, the average detection accuracy of improved network is improved from 84.35% to 96.69%, and the improved network has better convergence than the original network. The study shows that the improved method based on YOLOv3 is more suitable for industrial application of PCB plug-in solder spot defect detection.},

We derive multiple objectives and measures and propose continuous and discrete optimization methods embracing the AI model to improve samples in an iterative fashion by removing, shifting and reordering points of the gesture trajectory.

  abstract     = {The Maximum Satisfiability Problem, or MaxSAT, offers a suitable problem solving formalism for combinatorial optimization problems. Nevertheless, MaxSAT solvers implementing the Branch-and-Bound (BnB) scheme have not succeeded in solving challenging real-world optimization problems. It is widely be lieved that BnB MaxSAT solvers are only superior on random and some specific crafted instances. At the same time, SAT-based MaxSAT solvers perform particularly well on real-world instances. To overcome this shortcoming of BnB MaxSAT solvers, this paper proposes a new BnB MaxSAT solver called MaxCDCL. The main feature of MaxCDCL is the combination of clause learning of soft conflicts and an efficient bounding procedure. Moreover, the paper reports on an experimental investigation showing that MaxCDCL is competitive when compared with the best performing solvers of the 2020 MaxSAT Evaluation. MaxCDCL performs very well on real-world instances, and solves a number of instances that other solvers cannot solve. Furthermore, MaxCDCL, when combined with the best performing MaxSAT solvers, solves the highest number of instances of a collection from all the MaxSAT evaluations held so far.},

In this work, we focus on Transformer-based image captioning models and provide qualitative and quantitative tools to increase interpretability and assess the grounding and temporal alignment capabilities of such models. Firstly, we employ attribution methods to visualize what the model concentrates on in the input image, at each step of the generation. Further, we propose metrics to evaluate the temporal alignment between model predictions and attribution scores, which allows measuring the grounding capabilities of the model and spot hallucination flaws.

The gravity of the subject is further demonstrated by António Guterres, the United Nations Secretary-G eneral, calling it “a menace to democratic values, social stability, and peace”. One central platform for the spread of hate speech is the Internet and social media in particular. Thus, automatic detection of hateful and offensive content on these platforms is a crucial challenge that would strongly contribute to an equal and sustainable society when overcome. One significant difficulty in meeting this challenge is collecting sufficient labeled data. In our work, we examine how various resources can be leveraged to circumvent this difficulty. We carry out extensive experiments to exploit various data sources using different machine learning models, including state-of-the-art transformers. We have found that using our proposed methods, one can attain state-of-the-art performance detecting hate speech on Twitter (outperforming the winner of both the HASOC 2019 and HASOC 2020 competitions). It is observed that in general, adding more data improves the performance or does not decrease it. Even when using good language models and knowledge transfer mechanisms, the best results were attained using data from one or two additional data sets.},

In this paper a novel stochastic gradient descent possibilistic clustering algorithm, called O-PCM2 is introduced. The algorithm is presented in detail and it is rigorously proved that the gradient of the associated cost function tends to zero in the L2 sense, based on general convergence results established for the family of the stochastic gradient descent algorithms. Furthermore, an additional discussion is provided on the nature of the points where the algorithm may converge.

  abstract     = {The purpose of the salient object detection (SOD) task is to suppress the background noise and segment the salient foreground regions. Some previous methods considered the strategies of background suppression and multi-level feature fusion. Other methods encountered the problem that single-scale co nvolution features are difficult to capture the correct object size. This paper reconsiders the above problems and proposes a comprehensive solution to achieve SOD for improving the detection performance and ensuring relatively fewer parameters. First, it is difficult to achieve a better refinement effect through only one refinement operation. To this end, a multi-scale denoising module (MSDM) and multi-pooling refinement module (MPRM) are proposed to jointly complete the refinement task of multi-level features. Besides, it is difficult to fully integrate complementary features through only one feature integration operation. Mutual learning module (MLM) is proposed to preliminarily integrate multi-level features. To reduce information redundancy, multi-attention (MA) mechanism is used to assist further integration. The proposed algorithm is called multiple refinement and integration network (MRINet). Experimental results on five benchmark datasets show that MRINet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple evaluation metrics. Moreover, our ResNet-based algorithm only contains 25.202 million parameters, which is less than other ResNet-based algorithms and can run at over 37 fps on a single GPU.

  abstract     = {Many feature pyramid models now use simple contextual feature aggregation, which does not make full use of the semantic information of multi-scale features. Therefore, Multi-scale Redistribution Feature Pyramid Network (MRFPN) is proposed. In order to strengthen feature fusion and solve the two pro blems of feature redundancy and high abstraction, modified-BiFPN is designed. The features output by the modified-BiFPN module are semantically balanced through the balanced feature map, so as to alleviate the semantic differences between multi-scales. Then a new channel attention module is proposed, which realizes the multi-scale association of the feature information fused to the balanced feature map. Finally, a new feature pyramid is formed through the residual edge for prediction. MRFPN have been evaluated on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset and MS COCO dataset, which has higher detection accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art detectors.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the emergence of the digital language division and the availability of cross-lingual benchmarks make researches of cross-lingual texts more popular. However, the performance of existing methods based on mapping relation are not good enough, because sometimes the structures of language spa ces are not isomorphic. Besides, polysemy makes the extraction of interaction features hard. For cross-lingual word embedding, a model named Cross-lingual Word Embedding Space Based on Pseudo Corpus (CWE-PC) is proposed to obtain cross-lingual and multilingual word embedding. For cross-lingual sentence pair interaction feature capture, a Cross-language Feature Capture Based on Similarity Matrix (CFC-SM) model is built to extract cross-lingual interaction features. ELMo pretrained model and multiple layer convolution are used to alleviate polysemy and extract interaction features. These models are evaluated on multiple language pairs and results show that they outperform the state-of-the-art cross-lingual word embedding methods.},

  abstract     = {In the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, glomerulus as the blood filter provides important information for an accurate disease diagnosis. Thus automatic localization of the glomeruli is the necessary groundwork for future auxiliary kidney disease diagnosis, such as glomerular classification and area measurement. In this paper, we propose an efficient glomerular object locator in kidney whole slide image(WSI) based on proposal-free network and dynamic scale evaluation method. In the training phase, we construct an intensive proposal-free network which can learn efficiently the fine-grained features of the glomerulus. In the evaluation phase, a dynamic scale evaluation method is utilized to help the well-trained model find the most appropriate evaluation scale for each high-resolution WSI. We collect and digitalize 1204 renal biopsy microscope slides containing more than 41000 annotated glomeruli, which is the largest number of dataset to our best knowledge. We validate the each component of the proposed locator via the ablation study. Experimental results confirm that the proposed locator outperforms recently proposed approaches and pathologists by comparing F1 and run time in localizing glomeruli from WSIs at a resolution of 0.25 μm/pixel and thus achieves state-of-the-art performance. Particularly, the proposed locator can be embedded into the renal intelligent auxiliary diagnosis system for renal clinical diagnosis by localizing glomeruli in high-resolution WSIs effectively.},

  abstract     = {Markov Decision Process Models (MDPs) are a powerful tool for planning tasks and sequential decision-making issues. In this work we deal with MDPs with imprecise rewards, often used when dealing with situations where the data is uncertain. In this context, we provide algorithms for finding the poli cy that minimizes the maximum regret. To the best of our knowledge, all the regret-based methods proposed in the literature focus on providing an optimal stochastic policy. We introduce for the first time a method to calculate an optimal deterministic policy using optimization approaches. Deterministic policies are easily interpretable for users because for a given state they provide a unique choice. To better motivate the use of an exact procedure for finding a deterministic policy, we show some (theoretical and experimental) cases where the intuitive idea of using a deterministic policy obtained after “determinizing” the optimal stochastic policy leads to a policy far from the exact deterministic policy.},

  abstract     = {Analogical proportions are statements of the form “a is to b as c is to d”, denoted a:b::c:d, that may apply to any type of items a, b, c, d. Analogical proportions, as a building block for analogical reasoning, is then a tool of interest in artificial intelligence. Viewed as a relation between pai rs (a,b) and (c,d), these proportions are supposed to obey three postulates: reflexivity, symmetry, and central permutation (i.e., b and c can be exchanged). The logical modeling of analogical proportions expresses that a and b differ in the same way as c and d, when the four items are represented by vectors encoding Boolean properties. When items are real numbers, numerical proportions – arithmetic and geometric proportions – can be considered as prototypical examples of analogical proportions. Taking inspiration of an old practice where numerical proportions were handled in a vectorial way and where sequences of numerical proportions of the form x1:x2:⋯:xn::y1:y2:⋯:yn were in use, we emphasize a vectorial treatment of Boolean analogical proportions and we propose a Boolean logic counterpart to such sequences. This provides a linear algebra calculus of analogical inference and acknowledges the fact that analogical proportions should not be considered in isolation. Moreover, this also leads us to reconsider the postulates underlying analogical proportions (since central permutation makes no sense when n⩾3) and then to formalize a weak form of analogical proportion which no longer obeys the central permutation postulate inherited from numerical proportions. But these weak proportions may still be combined in multiple weak analogical proportions.},

  abstract     = {Recent AI-related scandals have shed a spotlight on accountability in AI, with increasing public interest and concern. This paper draws on literature from public policy and governance to make two contributions. First, we propose an AI accountability ecosystem as a useful lens on the system, with di fferent stakeholders requiring and contributing to specific accountability mechanisms. We argue that the present ecosystem is unbalanced, with a need for improved transparency via AI explainability and adequate documentation and process formalisation to support internal audit, leading up eventually to external accreditation processes. Second, we use a case study in the gambling sector to illustrate in a subset of the overall ecosystem the need for industry-specific accountability principles and processes. We define and evaluate critically the implementation of key accountability principles in the gambling industry, namely addressing algorithmic bias and model explainability, before concluding and discussing directions for future work based on our findings.},
