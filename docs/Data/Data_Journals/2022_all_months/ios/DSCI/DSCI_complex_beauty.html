  abstract     = {Open access to datasets is increasingly driving modern science. Consequently, discovering such datasets is becoming an important functionality for scientists in many different fields. We investigate methods for dataset recommendation : the task of recommending relevant datasets given a dataset that is already known to be relevant. Previous work has used meta-data descriptions of datasets and interest profiles of authors to support dataset recommendation. In this work, we are the first to investigate the use of co-author networks to drive the recommendation of relevant datasets. We also investigate the combination of such co-author networks with existing methods, resulting in three different algorithms for dataset recommendation. We obtain experimental results on a realistic corpus which show that only the ensemble combination of all three algorithms achieves sufficiently high precision for the dataset recommendation task.},

  abstract     = {There is public and scholarly debate about the effects of personalized recommender systems implemented in online social networks, online markets, and search engines. Some have warned that personalization algorithms reduce the diversity of information diets which confirms users’ previously held attitudes and beliefs. This, in turn, fosters the emergence opinion polarization. Critics of this personalization-polarization hypothesis argue that the effects of personalization on information diets are too weak to have meaningful effects. Here, we show that contributions to both sides of the debate fail to consider the complexity that arises when large numbers of interdependent individuals interact and exert influence on one another in algorithmically governed communication systems. Summarizing insights derived from formal models of social networks, we demonstrate that opinion dynamics can be critically influenced by mechanisms active on three levels of analysis: the individual, local, and global level. We show that theoretical and empirical research on these three levels is needed before one can determine whether personalization actually fosters polarization or not. We describe how the complexity approach can be used to anticipate and prevent undesired effects of communication technology on public debate and democratic decision-making.},

  abstract     = {An increasing number of researchers support reproducibility by including pointers to and descriptions of datasets, software and methods in their publications. However, scientific articles may be ambiguous, incomplete and difficult to process by automated systems. In this paper we introduce RO-Crate, an open, community-driven, and lightweight approach to packaging research artefacts along with their metadata in a machine readable manner. RO-Crate is based on Schema.org annotations in JSON-LD, aiming to establish best practices to formally describe metadata in an accessible and practical way for their use in a wide variety of situations. An RO-Crate is a structured archive of all the items that contributed to a research outcome, including their identifiers, provenance, relations and annotations. As a general purpose packaging approach for data and their metadata, RO-Crate is used across multiple areas, including bioinformatics, digital humanities and regulatory sciences. By applying “just enough” Linked Data standards, RO-Crate simplifies the process of making research outputs FAIR while also enhancing research reproducibility. An RO-Crate for this article 1 1 is archived at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5146227 .},

  abstract     = {Digital Economy in recent years, especially in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, is growing rapidly. E-commerce is one part of the Digital Economy. BPS-Statistics Indonesia as a Non-ministerial Government Agency responsible directly to the president has conducted an E-commerce Survey in 2019. From this publication, it is concluded that the interest of Indonesian traders using the internet in selling in recent years has increased. So, the urgency of using e-commerce data in its application in official Statistics is increasingly needed. Several studies have carried out the application of e-commerce data in the calculation of The Consumer Price Index (CPI). In this research, e-commerce data is applied with a case study using the data from one of online marketplaces in Indonesia in calculating CPI at city level in Java. The purpose of this study is to compare the marketplace-based CPI data and BPS-Statistics’ survey-based CPI. The data is collected through web scraping techniques and followed by preprocessing data and analyzed descriptively. Web scraper that is built can be used in obtaining data. Commodity-level CPI with marketplace data tends to have relatively large prices which result in higher CPI being compared to BPS-Statistics CPI. Meanwhile, at the expenditure group level, the CPI between the two approaches is broadly similar in general.},

  abstract     = {In a previous paper that we co-authored (Ozisik et al. 2021) we showed that in some cases Vitamin A and Vitamin D receptor binding sites are present in genes associated with Congenital Anomalies of the Kidney and Urinary Tract (CAKUT). From that finding we derived the statement that sometimes Vitamin A targets are the same as genes associated with CAKUT. We present here a formalization of that claim, stating that all things of class “genes associated with CAKUT” sometimes have a relation of type “is same as” to a thing of class “targets of vitamin A”.},
