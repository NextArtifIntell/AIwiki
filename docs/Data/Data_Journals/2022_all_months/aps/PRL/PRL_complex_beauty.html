  abstract     = {We combine percolation theory and Monte Carlo simulation to study in two dimensions the connectivity of an equilibrium lattice model of interacting Janus disks which self-assemble into an orientationally ordered stripe phase at low temperature. As the patch size is increased or the temperature is lowered, clusters of patch-connected disks grow, and a percolating cluster emerges at a threshold. In the stripe phase, the critical clusters extend longer in the direction parallel to the stripes than in the perpendicular direction, and percolation is thus anisotropic. It is found that the critical behavior of percolation in the Janus system is consistent with that of standard isotropic percolation, when an appropriate spatial rescaling is made. The rescaling procedure can be applied to understand other anisotropic systems, such as the percolation of aligned rigid rods and of the q -state Potts model with anisotropic interactions.},

  abstract     = {We study the energy cost of flocking in the active Ising model (AIM) and show that, besides the energy cost for self-propelled motion, an additional energy dissipation is required to power the alignment of spins. We find that this additional alignment dissipation reaches its maximum at the flocking transition point in the form of a cusp with a discontinuous first derivative with respect to the control parameter. To understand this singular behavior, we analytically solve the two- and three-site AIM models and obtain the exact dependence of the alignment dissipation on the flocking order parameter and control parameter, which explains the cusped dissipation maximum at the flocking transition. Our results reveal a trade-off between the energy cost of the system and its performance measured by the flocking speed and sensitivity to external perturbations. This trade-off relationship provides a new perspective for understanding the dynamics of natural flocks and designing optimal artificial flocking systems.},

  abstract     = {Local topological markers, topological invariants evaluated by local expectation values, are valuable for characterizing topological phases in materials lacking translation invariance. The Chern marker—the Chern number expressed in terms of the Fourier transformed Chern character—is an easily applicable local marker in even dimensions, but there are no analogous expressions for odd dimensions. We provide general analytic expressions for local markers for free-fermion topological states in odd dimensions protected by local symmetries: a Chiral marker , a local Z marker which in case of translation invariance is equivalent to the chiral winding number, and a Chern-Simons marker , a local Z 2 marker characterizing all nonchiral phases in odd dimensions. We achieve this by introducing a one-parameter family P ϑ of single-particle density matrices interpolating between a trivial state and the state of interest. By interpreting the parameter ϑ as an additional dimension, we calculate the Chern marker for the family P ϑ . We demonstrate the practical use of these markers by characterizing the topological phases of two amorphous Hamiltonians in three dimensions: a topological superconductor ( Z classification) and a topological insulator ( Z 2 classification).},

  abstract     = {In this Letter, we establish a new theoretical paradigm for vortex Majorana physics in the recently discovered topological iron-based superconductors (TFeSCs). While TFeSCs are widely accepted as an exemplar of topological insulators (TIs) with intrinsic s -wave superconductivity, our theory implies that such a common belief could be oversimplified. Our main finding is that the normal-state bulk Dirac nodes, usually ignored in TI-based vortex Majorana theories for TFeSCs, will play a key role of determining the vortex state topology. In particular, the interplay between TI and Dirac nodal bands will lead to multiple competing topological phases for a superconducting vortex line in TFeSCs, including an unprecedented hybrid topological vortex state that carries both Majorana bound states and a gapless dispersion. Remarkably, this exotic hybrid vortex phase generally exists in the vortex phase diagram for our minimal model for TFeSCs and is directly relevant to TFeSC candidates such as LiFeAs. When the fourfold rotation symmetry is broken by vortex-line tilting or curving, the hybrid vortex gets topologically trivialized and becomes Majorana free, which could explain the puzzle of ubiquitous trivial vortices observed in LiFeAs. The origin of the Majorana signal in other TFeSC candidates such as FeTe x Se 1 − x and CaKFe 4 As 4 is also interpreted within our theory framework. Our theory sheds new light on theoretically understanding and experimentally engineering Majorana physics in high-temperature iron-based systems.},

  abstract     = {The discovery of hidden spin polarization (HSP) in centrosymmetric nonmagnetic crystals, i.e., spatially distributed spin polarization originated from local symmetry breaking, has promised an expanded material pool for future spintronics. However, the measurements of such exotic effects have been limited to subtle space- and momentum-resolved techniques, unfortunately, hindering their applications. Here, we theoretically predict macroscopic non-reciprocal transports induced by HSP when coupling another spatially distributed quantity, such as staggered local moments in a space-time P T -symmetric antiferromagnet. By using a four-band model Hamiltonian, we demonstrate that HSP plays a crucial role in determining the asymmetric bands with respect to opposite momenta. Such band asymmetry leads to non-reciprocal nonlinear conductivity, exemplified by tetragonal CuMnAs via first-principles calculations. We further provide the material design principles for large nonlinear conductivity, including two-dimensional nature, multiple band crossings near the Fermi level, and symmetry protected HSP. Our Letter not only reveals direct spintronic applications of HSP (such as Néel order detection), but also sheds light on finding observables of other hidden effects, such as hidden optical polarization and hidden Berry curvature.},

  abstract     = {A new frictional mechanism, based on collective stick-slip motion of moiré superstructures across polycrystalline two-dimensional material interfaces, is predicted. The dissipative stick-slip behavior originates from an energetic bistability between low- and high-commensurability configurations of large-scale moiré superstructures. When the grain boundary separates between grains of small and large interfacial twist angle, the corresponding moiré periods are significantly different, resulting in forbidden grain boundary crossing of the moiré superstructures during shear induced motion. For small twist angle grains, where the moiré periods are much larger than the lattice constant, this results in multiple reflections of collective surface waves between the surrounding grain boundaries. In combination with the individual grain boundary dislocation snap-through buckling mechanism dominating at the low normal load regime, the friction exhibits nonmonotonic behavior with the normal load. While the discovered phenomenon is demonstrated for h − BN / graphene polycrystalline junctions, it is expected to be of general nature and occur in many other large-scale layered material interfaces.},

We demonstrate that the selective one-way routing of valley phonon states along the topological interface can be reversed by imposing the elastic spin metasource at different interface locations with opposite valley-spin correspondence. We unveil the physical mechanism of selective directionality as the elastic spin controlled chiral coupling of valley phonon states, through both analytical theory and experimental measurement of the opposite local elastic spin density at different interface locations for different transport directions. The elastic spin of valley topological edge phonons can be extended to other topological states and offers new tool to explore topological metamaterials.},

The amount of dark mix is an important quantity as it is thought to affect both fusion fuel compression and burn propagation when it turns into hot mix as the burn wave propagates through the initially colder fuel region surrounding an igniting hot spot.

  abstract     = {Dynamically encircling an exceptional point in a non-Hermitian system can lead to chiral behaviors, but this process is difficult for on-chip P T -symmetric devices which require accurate control of gain and loss rates. Here, we experimentally demonstrated encircling an exceptional point with a fixed loss rate in a compact anti- P T -symmetric integrated photonic system, where chiral mode switching was achieved within a length that is an order of magnitude shorter than that of a P T -symmetric system. Based on the experimental demonstration, we proposed a topologically protected mode (de)multiplexer that is robust against fabrication errors with a wide operating wavelength range. With the advantages of simplified fabrication and characterization processes, the demonstrated system can be used for studying higher-order exceptional points and for exotic light manipulation.},

  abstract     = {We propose and study the manipulation of the macroscopic transient absorption of an ensemble of open two-level systems via temporal engineering. The key idea is to impose an ultrashort temporal gate on the polarization decay of the system by transient absorption spectroscopy, thus confining its free evolution and the natural reshaping of the excitation pulse. The numerical and analytical results demonstrate that even at moderate optical depths, the resonant absorption of light can be reduced or significantly enhanced by more than 5 orders of magnitude relative to that without laser manipulation. The achievement of the quasicomplete extinction of light at the resonant frequency, here referred to as resonant perfect absorption, arises from the full destructive interference between the excitation pulse and its subpulses developed and tailored during propagation, and is revealed to be connected with the formation of zero-area pulses in the time domain.},

In particular, we implement Landauer erasure on a driven electron level in a semiconductor quantum dot, and compare the standard protocol in which the energy is increased linearly in time with the one coming from geometric optimization. The latter is obtained by choosing a suitable metric structure, whose geodesics correspond to optimal finite-time thermodynamic protocols in the slow driving regime. We show experimentally that geodesic drivings minimize dissipation for slow protocols, with a bigger improvement as one approaches perfect erasure. Moreover, the geometric approach also leads to smaller dissipation even when the time of the protocol becomes comparable with the equilibration timescale of the system, i.e., away from the slow driving regime. Our results also illustrate, in a single-electron device, a fundamental principle of thermodynamic geometry: optimal finite-time thermodynamic protocols are those with constant dissipation rate along the process.},

  abstract     = {The algorithmic error of digital quantum simulations is usually explored in terms of the spectral norm distance between the actual and ideal evolution operators. In practice, this worst-case error analysis may be unnecessarily pessimistic. To address this, we develop a theory of average-case performance of Hamiltonian simulation with random initial states. We relate the average-case error to the Frobenius norm of the multiplicative error and give upper bounds for the product formula (PF) and truncated Taylor series methods. As applications, we estimate average-case error for the digital Hamiltonian simulation of general lattice Hamiltonians and k -local Hamiltonians. In particular, for the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg chain with n spins, the error is quadratically reduced from O ( n ) in the worst case to O ( n ) on average for both the PF method and the Taylor series method. Numerical evidence suggests that this theory accurately characterizes the average error for concrete models. We also apply our results to error analysis in the simulation of quantum scrambling.},

Recently, they have been adapted to the field of machine learning, giving rise to an emergent research frontier that has attracted considerable attention. Here, we study the trainability of tensor-network based machine learning models by exploring the landscapes of different loss functions, with a focus on the matrix product states (also called tensor trains) architecture. In particular, we rigorously prove that barren plateaus (i.e., exponentially vanishing gradients) prevail in the training process of the machine learning algorithms with global loss functions. Whereas, for local loss functions the gradients with respect to variational parameters near the local observables do not vanish as the system size increases. Therefore, the barren plateaus are absent in this case and the corresponding models could be efficiently trainable. Our results reveal a crucial aspect of tensor-network based machine learning in a rigorous fashion, which provide a valuable guide for both practical applications and theoretical studies in the future.},

We characterize the self-similar nature of these critical fluctuations through their effective fractal dimension d f ′ = 3 d / 4 , and correlation length exponent ν ′ = 2 / d , where d is the dimension of the system. By analyzing percolation and magnetization, we demonstrate that d f ′ and ν ′ are the same for both, i.e., independent of the symmetry of the process for any d of the underlying networks.},

Interfacial active stresses can arrest phase separation, as previously demonstrated. Bulk extensile active stresses can additionally strongly suppress phase separation by sustained self-stirring of the fluid, substantially reducing the size of the coexistence region in the temperature-concentration plane relative to that of the passive system. The phase-separated state is a dynamical emulsion of continuously splitting and merging droplets, as suggested by recent experiments. Using scaling analysis and simulations, we identify various regimes for the dependence of droplet size on activity. These results can provide a criterion for identifying the mechanisms responsible for arresting phase separation in experiments.},

We show that such Josephson diodes have several important advantages, like being electrically tunable and requiring only time-reversal breaking by a magnetic flux. We also show that our diodes have a characteristic ac response, revealed by the Shapiro steps. Even the simplest realization of our Josephson diode paradigm that relies on only two junctions can achieve efficiencies of up to ∼ 40\% and, interestingly, far greater efficiencies are achievable by concatenating interferometer loops. We hope that our Letter will stimulate the search for highly tunable Josephson diode effects in Josephson devices based semiconductor-superconductor hybrids, 2 d materials, and topological insulators, where nonsinusoidal current-phase relations were recently observed.},

In this Letter, we propose how to mediate tunable effective couplings via Andreev bound states in a semiconductor-superconductor nanowire connecting two quantum dots. We show that in this way it is possible to individually control both the coupling mediated by Cooper pairs and by single electrons by changing the properties of the Andreev bound states with easily accessible experimental parameters. In addition, the problem of coupling suppression is greatly mitigated. We also propose how to experimentally extract the coupling strengths from resonant current in a three-terminal junction.

  abstract     = {Skyrmions endowed with topological protection have been extensively investigated in various platforms including magnetics, ferroelectrics, and liquid crystals, stimulating applications such as memories, logic devices, and neuromorphic computing. While the optical counterpart has been proposed and realized recently, the study of optical skyrmions is still in its infancy. Among the unexplored questions, the investigation of the topology induced robustness against disorder is of substantial importance on both fundamental and practical sides but remains elusive. In this Letter, we manage to generate optical skyrmions numerically in real space with different topological features at will, providing a unique platform to investigate the robustness of various optical skyrmions. A disorder-induced topological state transition is observed for the first time in a family of optical skyrmions composed of six classes with different skyrmion numbers. Intriguingly, the optical skyrmions produced from a vectorial hologram are exceptionally robust against scattering from a random medium, shedding light on topological photonic devices for the generation and manipulation of robust states for applications including imaging and communication.},

  abstract     = {The three-dimensional emergent magnetic field B e of a magnetic hopfion gives rise to emergent magnetomultipoles in a similar manner to the multipoles of classical electromagnetic field. Here, we show that the nonlinear responses of a hopfion are characterized by its emergent magnetic toroidal moment T z e = 1 2 ∫ ( r × B e ) z d V and emergent magnetic octupole component Γ e = ∫ [ ( x 2 + y 2 ) B z e − x z B x e − y z B y e ] d V . The hopfion exhibits nonreciprocal dynamics (nonlinear hopfion Hall effect) under an ac driving current applied along (perpendicular to) the direction of T z e . The sign of nonreciprocity and nonlinear Hall angle is determined by the polarity and chirality of hopfion. The nonlinear electrical transport induced by a magnetic hopfion is also discussed. This Letter reveals the vital roles of emergent magnetomultipoles in nonlinear hopfion dynamics and could stimulate further investigations on the dynamical responses of topological spin textures induced by emergent electromagnetic multipoles.},

The resistivity in the insulating phase exhibits the activation behavior with the activation energy, which goes to zero at the QPT.

  abstract     = {Although doping with alkali atoms is a powerful technique for introducing charge carriers into physical systems, the resulting charge-transfer systems are generally not air stable. Here we describe computationally a strategy towards increasing the stability of alkali-doped materials that employs stoichiometrically unbalanced salt crystals with excess cations (which could be deposited during, e.g., in situ gating) to achieve doping levels similar to those attained by pure alkali metal doping. The crystalline interior of the salt crystal acts as a template to stabilize the excess dopant atoms against oxidation and deintercalation, which otherwise would be highly favorable. We characterize this doping method for graphene, NbSe 2 , and Bi 2 Se 3 and its effect on direct-to-indirect band gap transitions, 2D superconductivity, and thermoelectric performance. Salt intercalation should be generally applicable to systems which can accommodate this “ionic crystal” doping (and particularly favorable when geometrical packing constraints favor nonstoichiometry).},

By considering the energy budget and required current density near the x-line, we analytically show that in the magnetically dominated relativistic regime, the x-line thermal pressure is significantly lower than the upstream magnetic pressure due to the extreme energy needed to sustain the current density, consistent with kinetic simulations. This causes the upstream magnetic field lines to collapse in, producing the open outflow geometry which enables fast reconnection. The result is important for understanding a wide range of extreme astrophysical environments, where fast reconnection has been evoked to explain observations such as transient flares and nonthermal particle signatures.},

We summarize the physics of resonant nanopumping in an analytical model that reproduces the results of numerical simulations.

In this Letter, we report the discovery of a generic non-Hermitian phenomenon that we call an “extended state in a localized continuum” (ELC). As the name suggests, the ELC is the inversion of the BIC—a single extended state embedded in a continuous spectrum entirely consisting of localized modes, and its emergence rests in the interplay between the BIC and the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). Herein, the BIC is a zero-energy corner mode that spectrally overlaps with a bulk band in a Hermitian kagome lattice. The ELC emerges with the introduction of the NHSE in a particular way, such that it turns all the bulk states into corner skin modes and simultaneously delocalizes the corner mode. We experimentally realize the ELC using an active mechanical lattice. Our findings not only demonstrate the rich potential of the NHSE but may also spark new wave-based applications.},

While the commutation rules between the frame charges are well established, the underlying relationship between distant band gap closing nodes remains to be explored. In this Letter, we present a photonic multiple nodal links system, where the nodal lines of nonadjacent bands are investigated with symmetry constraints on frame charges. Through an orthogonal nodal chain, the nodal line from the lower two bands predicts the existence of nodal lines formed between the higher bands.

This interaction enables quantum control of atomic motion in all axes with a single beam direction, which leads to applications in quantum computing and simulations with ion crystals. Here we demonstrate all the key features required for these applications, namely, coherent dynamics and strong carrier suppression in a configuration with the ion centered in the beam, which allows for single ion addressing and also provides robustness against pointing instabilities. To quantify transverse momentum transfer, we observe coherent dynamics on the sidebands of the S 1 / 2 to D 5 / 2 transition near 729 nm of a singly charged Ca + 40 ion, cooled near the ground state of motion in the 3D harmonic potential of a Paul trap, and placed at the center of a first-order Laguerre-Gaussian beam. Exchange of quanta in the perpendicular direction to the beam’s wave vector k is observed with a centered vortex shaped beam, together reduction of the parasitic carrier excitation by a factor of 40. This is in sharp contrast to the vanishing spin-motion coupling at the center of the Gaussian beam. Further, we characterize the coherent interaction by an effective transverse Lamb-Dicke factor η ⊥ exp = 0.0062 ( 5 ) which is in agreement with our theoretical prediction η ⊥ theo = 0.0057 ( 1 ) .},

  abstract     = {Two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference is a fundamental quantum effect with no classical counterpart. The existing research on two-photon interference was mainly limited in one degree of freedom (DOF); hence, it is still a challenge to realize quantum interference in multiple DOFs. Here, we demonstrate HOM interference between two hyperentangled photons in two DOFs of polarization and orbital angular momentum (OAM) for all 16 hyperentangled Bell states. We observe hyperentangled two-photon interference with a bunching effect for ten symmetric states (nine boson-boson states and one fermion-fermion state) and an antibunching effect for six antisymmetric states (three boson-fermion states and three fermion-boson states). More interestingly, expanding the Hilbert space by introducing an extra DOF for two photons enables one to transfer the unmeasurable external phase in the initial DOF to a measurable internal phase in the expanded two DOFs. We directly measured the symmetric exchange phases being 0.012 ± 0.002 , 0.025 ± 0.002 , and 0.027 ± 0.002 in radian for the three boson states in OAM and the antisymmetric exchange phase being 0.991 π ± 0.002 in radian for the other fermion state, as theoretical predictions. Our Letter may not only pave the way for more wide applications of quantum interference, but also develop new technologies by expanding Hilbert space in more DOFs.},

Nonlinear Stokes operators are obtained from harnessing the click-counting theory in combination with angular-momentum-type algebras. To quantify quantum effects, theoretical bounds are derived for second- and higher-order moments of nonlinear Stokes operators. The experimental validation of our concept is rendered possible by developing an efficient source, using a spectrally decorrelated type-II phase-matched waveguide inside a Sagnac interferometer. Correlated click statistics and moments are directly obtained from an eight-time-bin quasi-photon-number-resolving detection system. Macroscopic Bell states that are readily available with our source show the distinct nature of nonlinear polarization squeezing in up to eighth-order correlations, matching our theoretical predictions. Furthermore, our data certify nonclassical correlations with high statistical significance, without the need to correct for experimental imperfections and limitations. Also, our nonlinear squeezing can identify nonclassicality of noisy quantum states which is undetectable with the known linear polarization-squeezing criterion.},

  abstract     = {Topological defects can act as local impurities that seed cosmological phase transitions. In this Letter, we study the case of domain walls and how they can affect the electroweak phase transition in the singlet-extended standard model with a Z 2 -symmetric potential. When the transition occurs in two steps, the early breaking of the Z 2 symmetry implies the formation of domain walls which then act as nucleation sites for the second step. We develop a method based on a Kaluza-Klein decomposition to calculate the rate of the catalyzed phase transition within the 3D theory on the domain wall surface. By comparison with the standard homogeneous rate, we conclude that the seeded phase transition is generically faster and it ultimately determines the way the phase transition is completed. We finally comment on the phenomenological implications for gravitational waves.},

  abstract     = {We revisit the possibility that dark matter is composed of stable scalar glueballs of a confining dark SU(3) gauge theory coupled only to gravity. The relic abundance of dark glueballs is studied for the first time in a thermal effective theory accounting for strong-coupling dynamics. An important ingredient of our analysis is the use of an effective potential for glueballs that is fitted by lattice simulations. We predict the relic abundance to be in the range 0.12 ζ T − 3 Λ / ( 137.9 eV ) ≲ Ω h 2 ≲ 0.12 ζ T − 3 Λ / ( 82.7 eV ) , with Λ being the confinement scale, ζ T the visible-to-dark sector temperature ratio, and the uncertainty is coming from the fit to lattice data. This prediction is an order of magnitude smaller than the existing glueball abundance results in the literature. Our framework can be easily generalized to different gauge groups and modified cosmological histories paving the way toward consistent exploration of strongly coupled dark sectors and their cosmological implications.},

We demonstrate the robustness of our new formulation in practice by studying equal mass black hole binary mergers for different values of the coupling constants. Although our analysis of well-posedness is restricted to cases in which the couplings are small, we find that in simulations we are able to push the couplings to larger values, so that a certain weak coupling condition is order one, without instabilities developing.

In this Letter, we present the first dark matter analysis with LHAASO-KM2A, using the first 340 days of data from 1 / 2 -KM2A and 230 days of data from 3 / 4 -KM2A. Several regions of interest are used to search for a signal and account for the residual cosmic-ray background after γ / hadron separation. We find no excess of dark matter signals, and thus place some of the strongest γ -ray constraints on the lifetime of heavy dark matter particles with mass between 10 5 and 10 9 GeV . Our results with LHAASO are robust, and have important implications for dark matter interpretations of the diffuse astrophysical high-energy neutrino emission.},

In this Letter, we study the effect of a quantum massless scalar field on the Cauchy horizon inside a rotating (Kerr) black hole that is evaporating via the emission of Hawking radiation (corresponding to the field being in the Unruh state). We calculate the flux components (in Eddington coordinates) of the renormalized stress-energy tensor of the field on the Cauchy horizon, as functions of the black hole spin and of the polar angle. We find that these flux components are generically nonvanishing. Furthermore, we find that the flux components change sign as these parameters vary. The signs of the fluxes are important, as they provide an indication of whether the Cauchy horizon expands or crushes (when backreaction is taken into account). Regardless of these signs, our results imply that the flux components generically diverge on the Cauchy horizon when expressed in coordinates which are regular there. This is the first time that irregularity of the Cauchy horizon under a semiclassical effect is conclusively shown for (four-dimensional) spinning black holes.},

In this Letter, we present large-scale (50 km) simulations of FFC in spherical symmetry by using a novel approach. We effectively rescale the oscillation scale of FFC by reducing the number of injected neutrinos in the simulation box, and then extrapolate back to the case of the target density of neutrinos with a convergence study. We find that FFC in all models achieves a quasisteady state in the nonlinear regime, and its saturation property of FFC is universal. We also find that temporal- and spatial variations of FFC are smeared out at large radii due to phase cancellation through neutrino self-interactions. Finally, we provide a new diagnostic quantity, electron neutrino lepton number subtracted by heavy one angular crossing, to assess the nonlinear saturation of FFC.},

Although such a continuous measurement cannot affect physical observables, it has a nontrivial effect on the probability distribution of the random walker. At small γ , we show analytically that the time evolution of the latter can be mapped to the stochastic heat equation. In this limit, the width of the log-probability thus follows a Family-Vicsek scaling law, N α f ( t / N α / β ) , with roughness and growth exponents corresponding to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class, i.e., α KPZ 1 D = 1 / 2 and β KPZ 1 D = 1 / 3 , respectively. When γ is increased outside this regime, we find numerically in 1D a crossover from the KPZ class to a new universality class characterized by exponents α M 1 D ≈ 1 and β M 1 D ≈ 1.4 . In 3D, varying γ beyond a critical value γ M c leads to a phase transition from a smooth phase that we identify as the Edwards-Wilkinson class to a new universality class with α M 3 D ≈ 1 .},

While this true perturbation is nonzero at any finite disorder strength W , it decreases with increasing W . This establishes a view that the strongly disordered system should be viewed as a weakly perturbed integrable model, i.e., a weakly perturbed Anderson insulator. As a consequence, the latter can hardly be distinguished from a strictly integrable system in finite-size calculations at large W . We then introduce a rescaled model in which the true perturbation is of the same order of magnitude as the other terms of the Hamiltonian, and show that the system remains ergodic at arbitrary large disorder.},

Because of the exponentially large dimension and complex geometric structure of the state space, the detection of entanglement in many-body systems is extremely challenging in reality. Conventional means, like entanglement witness and entropy criterion, either highly depend on the prior knowledge of the studied systems or the detection capability is relatively weak. In this Letter, we propose a framework for designing multipartite entanglement criteria based on permutation moments, which have an effective implementation with either the generalized control- swap quantum circuits or the random unitary techniques. As an example, in the bipartite scenario, we develop an entanglement criterion that can detect bound entanglement and show strong detection capability in the multiqubit Ising model with a long-range X Y Hamiltonian. In the multipartite case, the permutation-moment-based criteria can detect entangled states that are not detectable by any criteria extended from the bipartite case. Our framework also shows potential in entanglement quantification and entanglement structure detection.},

We identify coherent quantum oscillations induced by such superpositions in observables complementary to the one involved in symmetry breaking. These oscillations satisfy Kibble-Zurek dynamical scaling laws with the quench rate, with an instantaneous oscillation frequency set primarily by the gap of the system. In addition to the obvious fundamental significance of a superposition of different broken symmetry states, quantum coherent oscillations can be used to verify unitarity and test for imperfections of the experimental implementations of quantum simulators.},

In the Page-Wootters formalism, for example, evolution of a quantum system S is described by a stationary joint state of S and a quantum clock, where time dependence of S arises from conditioning on the value of the clock. Here, we consider (possibly imperfect) internal quantum reference frames R for arbitrary compact symmetry groups, and show that there is an exact quantitative correspondence between the amount of entanglement in the invariant state on R S and the amount of asymmetry in the corresponding conditional state on S . Surprisingly, this duality holds exactly regardless of the choice of coherent state system used to condition on the reference frame. Averaging asymmetry over all conditional states, we obtain a simple representation-theoretic expression that admits the study of the quality of imperfect quantum reference frames, quantum speed limits for imperfect clocks, and typicality of asymmetry in a unified way. Our results shed light on the role of entanglement for establishing asymmetry in a fully symmetric quantum world.},

Modular flow provides an intuitive picture for this conjecture based on bulk-edge correspondence. We also provide numerics on free-fermion models that lend support to our picture.},

  abstract     = {The modular commutator is a recently discovered entanglement quantity that quantifies the chirality of the underlying many-body quantum state. In this Letter, we derive a universal expression for the modular commutator in conformal field theories in 1 + 1 dimensions and discuss its salient features. We show that the modular commutator depends only on the chiral central charge and the conformal cross ratio. We test this formula for a gapped ( 2 + 1 )-dimensional system with a chiral edge, i.e., the quantum Hall state, and observe excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Furthermore, we propose a geometric dual for the modular commutator in certain preferred states of the AdS/CFT correspondence. For these states, we argue that the modular commutator can be obtained from a set of crossing angles between intersecting Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces.},

  abstract     = {Many phenomena and fundamental predictions, ranging from Hawking radiation to the early evolution of the Universe rely on the interplay between quantum mechanics and gravity or more generally, quantum mechanics in curved spacetimes. However, our understanding is hindered by the lack of experiments that actually allow us to probe quantum mechanics in curved spacetime in a repeatable and accessible way. Here we propose an experimental scheme for a photon that is prepared in a path superposition state across two rotating Sagnac interferometers that have different diameters and thus represent a superposition of two different spacetimes. We predict the generation of genuine entanglement even at low rotation frequencies and show how these effects could be observed even due to the Earth’s rotation. These predictions provide an accessible platform in which to study the role of the underlying spacetime in the generation of entanglement.},

We adapt a recently developed method to automatically identify optimal continuum models for active nematics directly from spatiotemporal data, via sparse regression of the coarse-grained fields onto generic low order PDEs. After extensive benchmarking, we apply the method to experiments with microtubule-based active nematics, finding a surprisingly minimal description of the system. Our approach can be generalized to gain insights into active gels, microswimmers, and diverse other experimental active matter systems.},

In compact magnetic crystals, we show that there are magnonic modes that can support orbital angular momentum and that these modes can be driven by linearly polarized microwave fields. Because of conservation of angular momentum, exciting such magnon modes induces a mechanical torque on the crystal. We study a levitated magnetic crystal, a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) microsphere, where such orbital angular momentum magnon modes are driven by microwaves held in a microwave high- Q microwave cavity. We find that the YIG sphere experiences a mechanical torque and can be spun up to ultralarge angular speeds exceeding 10 GHz.},

Recent research on classical wave dynamics has explored the spatiotemporal modulation to exhibit preferred directions in photons and plasmons. Here we report a distinct rectification effect on diffusion-wave fields by modulating the conductivity and observe nonreciprocal transport of charges. We experimentally create a spatiotemporal diffusion metamaterial, in which a mode transition to zero frequency is realized. A direct current component thereby emerges, showcasing a biased effect on the charge diffusion when the incident fundamental frequency is a multiple of the system modulation frequency. These results may find applications spanning a plethora of diffusive fields in general.},

We show that for multiasperity (naturally oxidized) Si-on-Si interfaces, the friction coefficient goes through a maximum as a function of relative humidity. An adhesion model based on the boundary element method that takes the roughness of the interfaces into account reproduces this nonmonotonic behavior very well. Remarkably, we find the dry friction to be significantly lower than the lubricated friction with macroscopic amounts of water present. The difference is attributed to the hydrogen-bonding network across the interface. Accordingly, the lubricated friction increases significantly if the water is replaced by heavy water ( D 2 O ) with stronger hydrogen bonding.},

However, it remains unknown if vibrational coherence is sustained through a phase transition, during which coupling between modes can be strong and may lead to rapid loss of coherence. Here we use coherent phonon spectroscopy to track lattice coherence in the structural phase transition of V 2 O 3 . In both the low and high symmetry phases unique coherent phonon modes are generated at low fluence. However, coherence is lost when driving between the low and high symmetry phases.

By crossing several of these laser beams, patterns that have both small and large scales can be painted. The patterns are visualized a while later by inducing fluorescence of the NO molecules with a second UV laser and registering the image. The width of the lines that make the pattern is approximately 50 μ m , a few times the Kolmogorov length η , the smallest length scale in turbulence, while the overall size of the patterns ( ≈ 4 mm ) is inside the inertial range of the used turbulent jet flow. At small scales molecular clouds disperse under the joint action of molecular diffusion and turbulence. The experiments reveal for the first time this subtle, yet very important interaction. At macroscales ( ≈ 200 η ) we verify the Batchelor dispersion of objects whose size is inside the inertial range; however, the expected influence of molecular diffusion is smaller than the accuracy of the experiments.},

  abstract     = {Topological phases of matter have remained an active area of research in the last few decades. Periodic driving is a powerful tool for enriching such exotic phases, leading to various phenomena with no static analogs. One such phenomenon is the emergence of the elusive π / 2 modes, i.e., a type of topological boundary state pinned at a quarter of the driving frequency. The latter may lead to the formation of Floquet parafermions in the presence of interaction, which is known to support more computational power than Majorana particles. In this Letter, we experimentally verify the signature of π / 2 modes in an acoustic waveguide array, which is designed to simulate a square-root periodically driven Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. This is accomplished by confirming the 4 T -periodicity ( T being the driving period) profile of an initial-boundary excitation, which we also show theoretically to be the smoking gun evidence of π / 2 modes. Our findings are expected to motivate further studies of π / 2 modes in quantum systems for potential technological applications.},

The intensity distribution of the beam is mapped as a function of the ion’s position by measuring the light shift on an auxiliary electric quadrupole transition. In the center of the vortex beam, we observe excitation of the E 3 transition with a fivefold reduced light shift in comparison to excitation by plane wave radiation for the same Rabi frequency. We measure the excitation probabilities for Laguerre-Gaussian twisted light modes of first and second order for different polarization patterns at various orientations of the ion quantization axis with respect to the beam propagation vector.

  abstract     = {Subradiant states in a finite chain of two-level quantum emitters coupled to a one-dimensional reservoir are a resource for superior photon storage and their controlled release. As one can maximally store one energy quantum per emitter, storing multiple excitations requires delocalized states, which typically exhibit fermionic correlations and antisymmetric wave functions, thus making them hard to access experimentally. Here we identify a new class of quasilocalized dark states with up to half of the qubits excited, which only appear for lattice constants of an integer multiple of the wavelength. These states allow for a high-fidelity preparation and minimally invasive readout in state-of-the-art setups. In particular, we suggest an experimental implementation using a coplanar waveguide coupled to superconducting transmon qubits on a chip. With minimal free space and intrinsic losses, virtually perfect dark states can be achieved for a low number of qubits featuring fast preparation and precise manipulation.},

We find a significant dependence of the photoelectron angular distributions on the direction of propagation of the ionizing radiation. It results from an interplay of nondipole effects, on one hand, and molecular effects, on the other. The nondipole effects lead to an increase of the emission probability in the forward direction along the light propagation, and the photoelectron wave being scattered by the molecular potential gives rise to a strong peak in the direction of the atom neighboring the emitter site. These effects can either conspire or extenuate each other, depending on the photoelectron emission direction and molecular orientation in space.},

The band diagram and compact localized states are measured. In these nontrivial band gaps, we observe the topological edge states by near-field measurements. Furthermore, we propose a digitalized metasurface by loading controllable diodes with C 3 symmetry in every unit cell. By pumping a digital signal into the metasurface, we investigate the interaction between incident waves and the dynamic metasurface. Experimental results indicate that compact localized states in the nontrivial flat band could enhance the wave-matter interactions to convert more incident waves to time-modulated harmonic photonics. Although our experiments are conducted in the microwave regime, extending the related concepts into the optical plasmonic systems is feasible. Our findings pave an avenue toward planar integrated photonic devices with nontrivial flat bands and exotic transmission phenomena.},

We find that the peak in the sound velocity is attributed to the derivative contribution from the trace anomaly that steeply approaches the conformal limit. Smooth continuity to the behavior of high-density QCD implies that the matter part of the trace anomaly may be positive definite.

Assuming strong final-state interactions, we provide model results for charged hadron multiplicity, identified particle mean transverse momenta, and charged hadron anisotropic flow coefficients, and compare them with experimental data from the ALICE and ATLAS Collaborations. The elliptic flow hierarchy between p + Pb and γ * + Pb collisions is dominated by the difference in longitudinal flow decorrelations and reproduces the experimental data well.

We considerably strengthen this scenario by placing it in a global anti–de Sitter background, where the formation of “de Sitter bubbles” will be enhanced by mechanisms analogous to the Bizoń-Rostworowski instability in general relativity. This opens an arena for discussing the production of multiple accelerating universes from anti–de Sitter fluctuations.

An update of the energy spectrum of carbon is also presented with an increase in statistics over our previous measurement. The observed boron flux shows a spectral hardening at the same transition energy E 0 ∼ 200 GeV / n of the C spectrum, though B and C fluxes have different energy dependences. The spectral index of the B spectrum is found to be γ = − 3.047 ± 0.024 in the interval 25 &lt; E &lt; 200 GeV / n . The B spectrum hardens by Δ γ B = 0.25 ± 0.12 , while the best fit value for the spectral variation of C is Δ γ C = 0.19 ± 0.03 . The B / C flux ratio is compatible with a hardening of 0.09 ± 0.05 , though a single power-law energy dependence cannot be ruled out given the current statistical uncertainties. A break in the B / C ratio energy dependence would support the recent AMS-02 observations that secondary cosmic rays exhibit a stronger hardening than primary ones. We also perform a fit to the B / C ratio with a leaky-box model of the cosmic-ray propagation in the Galaxy in order to probe a possible residual value λ 0 of the mean escape path length λ at high energy. We find that our B / C data are compatible with a nonzero value of λ 0 , which can be interpreted as the column density of matter that cosmic rays cross within the acceleration region.},

  abstract     = {Axion dark matter (DM) may efficiently convert to photons in the magnetospheres of neutron stars (NSs), producing nearly monochromatic radio emission. This process is resonantly triggered when the plasma frequency induced by the underlying charge distribution approximately matches the axion mass. We search for evidence of this process using archival Green Bank Telescope data collected in a survey of the Galactic Center in the C band by the Breakthrough Listen project. While Breakthrough Listen aims to find signatures of extraterrestrial life in the radio band, we show that their high-frequency resolution spectral data of the Galactic Center region is ideal for searching for axion-photon transitions generated by the population of NSs in the inner pc of the Galaxy. We use data-driven models to capture the distributions and properties of NSs in the inner Galaxy and compute the expected radio flux from each NS using state-of-the-art ray tracing simulations. We find no evidence for axion DM and set leading constraints on the axion-photon coupling, excluding values down to the level g a γ γ ∼ 10 − 11 GeV − 1 for DM axions for masses between 15 and 35 μ eV .},

  abstract     = {A weighted, semidiscrete, fast optimal transport (OT) algorithm for reconstructing the Lagrangian positions of protohalos from their evolved Eulerian positions is presented. The algorithm makes use of a mass estimate of the biased tracers and of the distribution of the remaining mass (the “dust”) but is robust to errors in the mass estimates. Tests with state-of-art cosmological simulations show that if the dust is assumed to have a uniform spatial distribution, then the shape of the OT-reconstructed pair correlation function of the tracers is very close to linear theory, enabling subpercent precision in the baryon acoustic oscillation distance scale that depends weakly, if at all, on a cosmological model. With a more sophisticated model for the dust, OT returns an estimate of the displacement field which yields superb reconstruction of the protohalo positions and, hence, of the shape and amplitude of the initial pair correlation function of the tracers. This enables direct and independent determinations of the bias factor b and the smearing scale Σ , potentially providing new methods for breaking the degeneracy between b and σ 8 .},

However, assigning a precise dimension is often an approximation of what is actually a higher-dimensional process. Here, we introduce and investigate quantum information encoded in carriers that nearly, but not entirely, correspond to standard qudits. We demonstrate the relevance of this concept for semi-device-independent quantum information by showing how small higher-dimensional components can significantly compromise the conclusions of established protocols. Then we provide a general method, based on semidefinite relaxations, for bounding the set of almost qudit correlations, and apply it to remedy the demonstrated issues. This method also offers a novel systematic approach to the well-known task of device-independent tests of classical and quantum dimensions with unentangled devices. Finally, we also consider viewing almost qubit systems as a physical resource available to the experimenter and determine the optimal quantum protocol for the well-known random access code.},

  abstract     = {Quantum metrology with entangled resources aims to achieve sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit by harnessing quantum effects even in the presence of environmental noise. So far, sensitivity has been mainly discussed from the viewpoint of reducing statistical errors under the assumption of perfect knowledge of a noise model. However, we cannot always obtain complete information about a noise model due to coherence time fluctuations, which are frequently observed in experiments. Such unknown fluctuating noise leads to systematic errors and nullifies the quantum advantages. Here, we propose an error-mitigated quantum metrology that can filter out unknown fluctuating noise with the aid of purification-based quantum error mitigation. We demonstrate that our protocol mitigates systematic errors and recovers superclassical scaling in a practical situation with time-inhomogeneous bias-inducing noise. Our result is the first demonstration to reveal the usefulness of purification-based error mitigation for unknown fluctuating noise, thus paving the way not only for practical quantum metrology but also for quantum computation affected by such noise.},

Here by mapping the momentum space to the parameter space of a three-level system in a trapped ion, we experimentally explore the transitions between different types of TDPs driven by spin-tensor-momentum couplings. We observe the phase transitions between TDPs with different topological charges by measuring the Berry flux on a loop surrounding the gap-closing lines, and the jump of the Berry flux gives the jump of the topological charge (up to a 2 π factor) across the transitions. For the Berry flux measurement, we employ a new method by examining the geometric rotations of both spin vectors and tensors, which lead to a generalized solid angle equal to the Berry flux. The controllability of a multilevel ion offers a versatile platform to study high-spin physics, and our Letter paves the way to explore novel topological phenomena therein.},

Here we consider the role of HIs in the self-assembly of oppositely charged colloidal particles, which is a promising candidate for electrical tunable soft materials. We employ the fluid particle dynamics method to consider many-body HIs and the coupling between the colloid, ion, and fluid motions. We find that, under a constant electric field, oppositely charged colloidal particles form clusters and percolate into a gel network, unlike bundlelike aggregates aligned in the field direction observed by Brownian dynamics simulations neglecting HIs. We reveal that the cluster-forming tendency originates from the incompressibility-induced “inverse squeezing flow” effect that dramatically slows down the disaggregation of attached colloids. Our findings indicate that the HI selects a unique kinetic pathway to the nonequilibrium colloidal self-assembly.},

Intense diffuse scattering is observed around the modulation vector of the I-CDW, Q I-CDW . It is already visible at room temperature and collapses into superstructure reflections in the long-range ordered state where a small orthorhombic distortion occurs. A clear dip in the dispersion of a low-energy transverse optical phonon mode is observed around Q I-CDW . The phonon continuously softens upon cooling, ultimately driving the transition to the I-CDW state. The transverse character of the soft-phonon branch elucidates the complex pattern of the I-CDW satellites observed in the current and earlier studies and settles the debated unidirectional nature of the I-CDW. The phonon instability and its reciprocal space position are well captured by our ab initio calculations. These, however, indicate that neither Fermi surface nesting, nor enhanced momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling can account for the I-CDW formation, demonstrating its unconventional nature.},

  abstract     = {An escalating challenge in condensed-matter research is the characterization of emergent order-parameter nanostructures such as ferroelectric and ferromagnetic skyrmions. Their small length scales coupled with complex, three-dimensional polarization or spin structures makes them demanding to trace out fully. Resonant elastic x-ray scattering (REXS) has emerged as a technique to study chirality in spin textures such as skyrmions and domain walls. It has, however, been used to a considerably lesser extent to study analogous features in ferroelectrics. Here, we present a framework for modeling REXS from an arbitrary arrangement of charge quadrupole moments, which can be applied to nanostructures in materials such as ferroelectrics. With this, we demonstrate how extended reciprocal space scans using REXS with circularly polarized x rays can probe the three-dimensional structure and chirality of polar skyrmions. Measurements, bolstered by quantitative scattering calculations, show that polar skyrmions of mixed chirality coexist, and that REXS allows valuation of relative fractions of right- and left-handed skyrmions. Our quantitative analysis of the structure and chirality of polar skyrmions highlights the capability of REXS for establishing complex topological structures toward future application exploits.},

However, the correlations between these IXs remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate the cascade transitions between IXs in a moiré superlattice by performing energy- and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements in the MoS 2 / WSe 2 heterostructure. Furthermore, we show that the lower-energy IX can be excited to higher-energy ones, facilitating IX population inversion. Our finding of cascade transitions between IXs contributes to the fundamental understanding of the IX dynamics in moiré superlattices and may have important applications, such as in exciton condensate, quantum information protocols, and quantum cascade lasers.},

By attaching a thin solid film on top of a liquid meniscus, we create a solid-liquid interface. The interface determines the curvature of the meniscus, analysis of which yields γ SL with an uncertainty of less than 10\%. Measurement of classically challenging metal-water interfaces reveals γ SL ∼ 30 – 60 mJ / m 2 , demonstrating quantitatively that water-metal adhesion is 80\% stronger than the cohesion energy of bulk water, and experimentally verifying previous quantum chemical calculations.},

Here, we show that the measured potentials at multiple locations within a device at elevated temperature are well described by solution of Laplace’s equation, assuming spatially uniform conductivity, suggesting nonequilibrium current flows through the two-dimensional bulk. Extrapolation suggests that at even lower temperatures current may still flow primarily through the bulk rather than, as had been assumed, through edge modes.

This is achieved by generalizing the self-consistent Born approximation to nonequilibrium systems, making it possible to calculate the full time-dependent many-body wave function. Our approach reveals three distinct dynamical regimes, ultimately leading to the formation of magnetic polarons. Following the initial ballistic stage of the hole dynamics, coherent formation of string excitations gives rise to characteristic oscillations in the hole density. Their damping eventually leaves behind magnetic polarons that undergo ballistic motion with a greatly reduced velocity. The developed theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding nonequilibrium physics of defects in quantum magnets and quantitatively explains recent observations from cold-atom quantum simulations in the strong coupling regime.},

Here we combine state-of-the-art photoemission theory and experiments over a wide range of excitation energies for the Weyl semimetals TaAs and TaP. Our results show that simple surface-band-counting schemes, proposed previously to identify nonzero Chern numbers, are ambiguous due to pronounced momentum-dependent spectral weight variations and the pronounced surface-bulk hybridization.

Among them, we estimate that Li 6 Al at 150 GPa has a superconducting transition temperature of around 29 K and enters a superionic state at a high temperature and wide pressure range. The diffusion in Li 6 Al is found to be affected by an electride and attributed to the atomic collective motion.

It is unclear whether classical nucleation theory applies in such a complex case. In this Letter, we directly measure the critical nucleus size of the MIT by introducing size-controlled nanoscale nucleation seeds with focused ion irradiation at the surface of a deeply supercooled metal phase of VO 2 . The results compare favorably with classical nucleation theory and are further explained by phase-field modeling.

  abstract     = {One of the most enduring and intensively studied problems of x-ray astronomy is the disagreement of state-of-the art theory and observations for the intensity ratio of two Fe XVII transitions of crucial value for plasma diagnostics, dubbed 3 C and 3 D . We unravel this conundrum at the PETRA III synchrotron facility by increasing the resolving power 2.5 times and the signal-to-noise ratio thousandfold compared with our previous work. The Lorentzian wings had hitherto been indistinguishable from the background and were thus not modeled, resulting in a biased line-strength estimation. The present experimental oscillator-strength ratio R exp = f 3 C / f 3 D = 3.51 ( 2 ) stat ( 7 ) sys agrees with our state-of-the-art calculation of R th = 3.55 ( 2 ) , as well as with some previous theoretical predictions. To further rule out any uncertainties associated with the measured ratio, we also determined the individual natural linewidths and oscillator strengths of 3 C and 3 D transitions, which also agree well with the theory. This finally resolves the decades-old mystery of Fe XVII oscillator strengths.},

  abstract     = {Creating, manipulating, and detecting coherent electrons is at the heart of future quantum microscopy and spectroscopy technologies. Leveraging and specifically altering the quantum features of an electron beam source at low temperatures can enhance its emission properties. Here, we describe electron field emission from a monocrystalline, superconducting niobium nanotip at a temperature of 5.9 K. The emitted electron energy spectrum reveals an ultranarrow distribution down to 16 meV due to tunable resonant tunneling field emission via localized band states at a nanoprotrusion’s apex and a cutoff at the sharp low-temperature Fermi edge. This is an order of magnitude lower than for conventional field emission electron sources. The self-focusing geometry of the tip leads to emission in an angle of 3.7°, a reduced brightness of 3.8 × 10 8 A / ( m 2 sr V ) , and a stability of hours at 4.1 nA beam current and 69 meV energy width. This source will decrease the impact of lens aberration and enable new modes in low-energy electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and high-resolution vibrational spectroscopy.},

By performing extensive numerical simulations of the plane channel flow, we show that the pattern emerges from a spatial modulation of the turbulent flow, due to a linear instability. We sample over many realizations the linear response of the fluctuating turbulent field to a temporal impulse, in the regime where the turbulent flow is stable, just before the onset of the instability. The dispersion relation is constructed from the ensemble-averaged relaxation rates. As the instability threshold is approached, the relaxation rate of the least damped modes eventually reaches zero. The method allows, despite the presence of turbulent fluctuations and without any closure model, for an accurate estimation of the wave vector of the modulation at onset.},

Together with mechanical state preparation and sensitive readout, we demonstrate the microwave-to-optical conversion with an ultrawide tuning range up to 3 GHz. In addition, we observe a mechanical motion interference effect, in which the optically driven mechanical motion is canceled by the microwave-driven coherent motion.

With the inner BEC removed, we obtain a hollow shell BEC that shows self-interference as a manifestation of implosion.

We find static electric fields as small as 10 V / cm can lead to nonconservation of angular momentum, while we find nuclear spin is conserved during collisions. We also compute loss of collision complexes due to spontaneous emission and absorption of black-body radiation, which are found to be slow.},

The resulting state-dependent level shifts allow us to study many-body systems displaying intriguing nonequilibrium phenomena, such as constrained spin systems, and are at the heart of numerous technological applications, e.g., in quantum simulation and computation platforms. Here, we show that these interactions also have a significant impact on dissipative effects caused by the inevitable coupling of Rydberg atoms to the surrounding electromagnetic field. We demonstrate that their presence modifies the frequency of the photons emitted from the Rydberg atoms, making it dependent on the local neighborhood of the emitting atom. Interactions among Rydberg atoms thus turn spontaneous emission into a many-body process which manifests, in a thermodynamically consistent Markovian setting, in the emergence of collective jump operators in the quantum master equation governing the dynamics. We discuss how this collective dissipation—stemming from a mechanism different from the much studied superradiance and subradiance—accelerates decoherence and affects dissipative phase transitions in Rydberg ensembles.},

To address this issue, we study coherent J / ψ electroproduction on He 4 and He 3 in the kinematics of a future electron-ion collider and show that this process has the power to disentangle the contributions of the interaction with a specific number of nucleons k , in particular, with two nucleons at the momentum transfer t ≠ 0 . We predict a dramatic shift of the t dependence of the differential cross section toward smaller values of | t | due to a nontrivial correlation between x and k . This calculation, which makes use for the first time of realistic wave functions, provides a stringent test of models of nuclear shadowing and a novel probe of the 3D imaging of gluons in light nuclei. In addition, thanks to this analysis, unique information on the real part of the corresponding scattering amplitude could be accessed.},

The negative-parity, complex-structure final states in Ca 38 are observed following the in-beam γ -ray spectroscopy of events in the Be 9 ( Ca 38 , Ca 38 + γ ) X reaction in which the scattered projectile loses longitudinal momentum of order Δ p | | = 700 MeV / c . The characteristics of the observed final states are discussed and found to be consistent with the formation of excited states involving the rearrangement of multiple nucleons in a single, highly energetic projectile-target collision. Unlike the far-less-dissipative, surface-grazing reactions usually exploited for the in-beam γ -ray spectroscopy of rare isotopes, these more energetic collisions appear to offer a practical pathway to nuclear-structure studies of more complex multiparticle configurations in rare isotopes—final states conventionally thought to be out of reach with high-luminosity fast-beam-induced reactions.},

  abstract     = {We perform the first simultaneous global QCD extraction of the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton distribution functions and the TMD fragmentation functions in nuclei. We have considered the world set of data from semi-inclusive electron-nucleus deep inelastic scattering and Drell-Yan dilepton production. In total, this data set consists of 90 data points from HERMES, Fermilab, RHIC, and LHC. Working at next-to-leading order and next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy, we achieve a χ 2 / d . o . f . = 1.196 . In this analysis, we perform the first extraction of nuclear modified TMDs and compare these to those in free nucleons. We also make predictions for the ongoing JLab 12 GeV program and future electron-ion collider measurements.},

Employing a generalized Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approach, we find that the pair creation rate along the symmetry plane x = 0 (where one would expect the maximum contribution) displays the same exponential dependence as for a purely time-dependent electric field A ( t ) = 2 f ( c t ) e y . The prefactor in front of this exponential does also contain corrections due to focusing or defocusing effects induced by the spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field.

  abstract     = {We propose a new, chiral description for massive higher-spin particles in four spacetime dimensions, which facilitates the introduction of consistent interactions. As proof of concept, we formulate three theories, in which higher-spin matter is coupled to electrodynamics, non-Abelian gauge theory, or gravity. The theories are chiral and have simple Lagrangians, resulting in Feynman rules analogous to those of massive scalars. Starting from these Feynman rules, we derive tree-level scattering amplitudes with two higher-spin matter particles and any number of positive-helicity photons, gluons, or gravitons. The amplitudes reproduce the arbitrary-multiplicity results that were obtained via on-shell recursion in a parity-conserving setting, and which chiral and nonchiral theories thus have in common. The presented theories are currently the only examples of consistent interacting field theories with massive higher-spin fields.},

  abstract     = {A striking feature of the solar cycle is that at the beginning, sunspots appear around midlatitudes, and over time the latitudes of emergences migrate toward the equator. The maximum level of activity (e.g., sunspot number) varies from cycle to cycle. For strong cycles, the activity begins early and at higher latitudes with wider sunspot distributions than for weak cycles. The activity and the width of sunspot belts increase rapidly and begin to decline when the belts are still at high latitudes. Surprisingly, it has been reported that in the late stages of the cycle the level of activity (sunspot number) as well as the widths and centers of the butterfly wings all have the same statistical properties independent of how strong the cycle was during its rise and maximum phases. We have modeled these features using a Babcock-Leighton type dynamo model and show that the flux loss through magnetic buoyancy is an essential nonlinearity in the solar dynamo. Our Letter shows that the nonlinearity is effective if the flux emergence becomes efficient at the mean-field strength of the order of 10 4 G in the lower part of the convection zone.},

A corollary statement is that the abundance of any particle that can decay into photons over cosmological timescales is constrained to be much smaller than the cold dark-matter density. We show that an irreducible freeze-in contribution to the relic density of axions is in violation of that statement in a large portion of the parameter space. This allows us to set stringent constraints on axions in the mass range 100 eV–100 MeV. At 10 keV our constraint on a photophilic axion is g a γ γ ≲ 8.1 × 10 − 14 GeV − 1 , almost 3 orders of magnitude stronger than the bounds established using horizontal branch stars; at 100 keV our constraint on a photophobic axion coupled to electrons is g a e e ≲ 8.0 × 10 − 15 , almost 4 orders of magnitude stronger than the present results. Although we focus on axions, our argument is more general and can be extended to, for instance, sterile neutrinos.},

We derive numerous polychromatic pulse trains, which generate broadband, narrowband, and passband excitation profiles for different target transition probabilities. This makes it possible to create high-fidelity excitation profiles which are either (i) robust to deviations in the experimental parameters, which is attractive for quantum computing, or (ii) more sensitive to such variations, which is attractive for crosstalk elimination and quantum sensing. The method is demonstrated experimentally using one of IBM’s superconducting quantum processors, in a very good agreement between theory and experiment. These results demonstrate both the excellent coherence properties of the IBM qubits and the accuracy, robustness, and flexibility of the proposed quantum control technique. They also show that the detuning is a control parameter which is as efficient as the pulse phase that is commonly used in composite pulses. Hence the method opens a variety of perspectives for quantum control in areas where phase manipulation is difficult or inaccurate.},

We propose and demonstrate a crosstalk suppression scheme that eliminates all first-order crosstalk utilizing only local control of target qubits, as opposed to an existing scheme which requires control over all neighboring qubits. We report a two-qubit Bell state fidelity of 99.52(6)\% with the echoing pulses applied after collective gates and 99.37(5)\% with the echoing pulses applied to each gate in a five-ion chain.

We show that, for small displacement, a squeezed vacuum probe field is optimal among strategies with same average energy. A squeezer followed by photodetection is the optimal detection strategy that attains the quantum Fisher information, whereas the customarily used homodyne detection becomes useless in the limit of small displacements, due to the same effect that gives Rayleigh’s curse in optical superresolution. There is a quantum advantage: a squeezed or a Fock state with N average photons allow to asymptotically estimate the parameter with a N better precision than classical states with same energy.},

In this Letter, we address the task of estimating the expectation values of M different observables, each to within additive error ϵ , with the same 1 / ϵ dependence. We describe an approach that leverages Gilyén et al. ’s quantum gradient estimation algorithm to achieve O ( M / ϵ ) scaling up to logarithmic factors, regardless of the commutation properties of the M observables. We prove that this scaling is worst-case optimal in the high-precision regime if the state preparation is treated as a black box, even when the operators are mutually commuting.

  abstract     = {Uncertainty relations express limits on the extent to which the outcomes of distinct measurements on a single state can be made jointly predictable. The existence of nontrivial uncertainty relations in quantum theory is generally considered to be a way in which it entails a departure from the classical worldview. However, this perspective is undermined by the fact that there exist operational theories which exhibit nontrivial uncertainty relations but which are consistent with the classical worldview insofar as they admit of a generalized-noncontextual ontological model. This prompts the question of what aspects of uncertainty relations, if any, cannot be realized in this way and so constitute evidence of genuine nonclassicality. We here consider uncertainty relations describing the tradeoff between the predictability of a pair of binary-outcome measurements (e.g., measurements of Pauli X and Pauli Z observables in quantum theory). We show that, for a class of theories satisfying a particular symmetry property, the functional form of this predictability tradeoff is constrained by noncontextuality to be below a linear curve. Because qubit quantum theory has the relevant symmetry property, the fact that its predictability tradeoff describes a section of a circle is a violation of this noncontextual bound, and therefore constitutes an example of how the functional form of an uncertainty relation can witness contextuality. We also deduce the implications for a selected group of operational foils to quantum theory and consider the generalization to three measurements.},

  abstract     = {The problem of predicting a protein’s 3D structure from its primary amino acid sequence is a longstanding challenge in structural biology. Recently, approaches like a lpha f old have achieved remarkable performance on this task by combining deep learning techniques with coevolutionary data from multiple sequence alignments of related protein sequences. The use of coevolutionary information is critical to these models’ accuracy, and without it their predictive performance drops considerably. In living cells, however, the 3D structure of a protein is fully determined by its primary sequence and the biophysical laws that cause it to fold into a low-energy configuration. Thus, it should be possible to predict a protein’s structure from only its primary sequence by learning an approximate biophysical energy function. We provide evidence that a lpha f old has learned such an energy function, and uses coevolution data to solve the global search problem of finding a low-energy conformation. We demonstrate that a lpha f old’slearned energy function can be used to rank the quality of candidate protein structures with state-of-the-art accuracy, without using any coevolution data. Finally, we explore several applications of this energy function, including the prediction of protein structures without multiple sequence alignments.},

Different scaling regimes are predicted for the evolution of the structural relaxation time τ with age (waiting time t w ), depending on the depth of the quench from the liquid into the glass: “simple” aging ( τ ∼ t w ) applies for quenches close to the critical point of mode-coupling theory (MCT) and implies “subaging” ( τ ≈ t w δ with δ 1 ) emerges for quenches deep into the glass. The latter is cut off by non-mean-field fluctuations that we account for within a recent extension of MCT, the stochastic β -relaxation theory (SBR).

Here, we present simulations testing the Onsager relations between surface-coupled diffusive and bulk fluxes in a system prepared in a nonequilibrium steady state. The system consists of a mixture of two identical species maintained at different temperatures inside a channel. In order to tune the friction of the two species with the walls independently, while keeping the particle-wall interaction potentials the same, we allow the kinematics of particle-wall collisions to be different: “bounce-back” ( B ) or “specular” ( S ). In the B B case, diffusio-capillary transport can only take place if the two species have different temperatures. We find that the Onsager reciprocity relations are obeyed in the linear regime, even in the B B case where all fluxes are the result of perturbing the system from a nonequilibrium steady state in a way that does not satisfy time-reversal symmetry. Our Letter provides a direct, numerical illustration of the validity of the Onsager relations outside their original range of application, and suggests their relevance for transport in driven or active systems.},

Here, we use double-layer graphene with a boron nitride spacer as a model system to demonstrate that the lifetime of coupled Dirac plasmons can be remotely tuned by electric field-controlled damping pathways. Essentially, one of the graphene layers serves as an external damping amplifier whose efficiency can be controlled by the corresponding doping level. Through this damping switch, the damping rate of the plasmon can be actively tuned up to 1.7 fold. This Letter provides a prototype design to actively control the lifetime of graphene plasmons and also broadens our horizon for the damping control of other quasiparticle systems.},

Then, the magnetization undergoes natural damped THz oscillations at a frequency characteristic of the crystalline phase. We describe the experimental observations solving the inertial Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. Using the results from the relativistic theory of magnetic inertia, we find that the angular momentum relaxation time η is the only material parameter needed to describe all the experimental evidence.

Using Eliashberg theory, we show that the ferroelectric quantum critical point is unstable against the formation of a ferroelectric density wave (FDW), whose fluctuations, in turn, lead to a first-order superconducting transition. Surprisingly, long-range superconducting and FDW orders are found to cooperate with each other, in contrast to the more usual scenario of phase competition. Therefore, we suggest that driving charge neutral Dirac materials, e.g., Pb x Sn 1 − x Te , through a ferroelectric quantum critical point may lead to superconductivity intertwined with FDW order.},

Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate the spin Hall effect of light in photonic crystal slabs via momentum-space topological vortices around BICs. The strong spin-orbit interactions of light are induced by using the topological vortices around BICs, introducing both wave-vector-dependent Pancharatnam-Berry phase gradients and cross-polarized resonant phase gradients to the spinning light beam, which lead to spin-dependent in-plane-oblique lateral light beam shifts.

Here, we present measurements of oxygen vacancy ordering in epitaxial thin films of SrCoO x and the brownmillerite-perovskite phase transition employing x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy. These and associated synchrotron measurements and theory calculations reveal the close interaction between the kinetics and the dynamics of the phase transition, showing how spatial and temporal fluctuations of heterointerface evolve during the transformation process. The energetics of the transition are correlated with the behavior of oxygen vacancies, and the dimensionality of the transformation is shown to depend strongly on whether the phase is undergoing oxidation or reduction. The experimental and theoretical methods described here are broadly applicable to in situ measurements of dynamic phase behavior and demonstrate how coherence may be employed for novel studies of the complex oxides as enabled by the arrival of fourth-generation hard x-ray coherent light sources.},

The inclusion of effects from the locally puffed atomic helium on particle and energy sources within the reduced plasma turbulence model is found to strengthen correlations between the electric field and electron pressure. The neutrals are also directly associated with broadening the distribution of turbulent field amplitudes and increasing E × B shearing rates. This demonstrates a novel approach in plasma experiments by solving for nonlinear dynamics consistent with partial differential equations and data without encoding explicit boundary nor initial conditions.},

This, in turn, allows the realization of ultracompact light sources based on free-electron lasers (FELs) [5], as demonstrated by two pioneering experiments that reported the observation of self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) driven by plasma-accelerated beams [6,7]. However, the lack of stability and reproducibility due to the intrinsic nature of the SASE process (whose amplification starts from the shot noise of the electron beam) may hinder their effective implementation for user purposes. Here, we report a proof-of-principle experiment using plasma-accelerated beams to generate stable and reproducible FEL light seeded by an external laser. FEL radiation is emitted in the infrared range, showing the typical exponential growth of its energy over six consecutive undulators. Compared to SASE, the seeded FEL pulses have energies 2 orders of magnitude larger and stability that is 3 times higher.},

While in theory the perfect tunneling holds only for normal incidence, so far the angular dependence of the Klein tunneling and its strong variation with the barrier height were not measured experimentally. In this Letter, we capitalize on the versatility of atomic vapor cells with paraxial beam propagation and index patterning by electromagnetically induced transparency. We report the first experimental observation of perfect Klein transmission in a 2D photonic system (photonic graphene) at normal incidence and measure the angular dependence. Counterintuitively, but in agreement with the Dirac equation, we observe that the decay of the Klein transmission versus angle is suppressed by increasing the barrier height, a key result for the conductivity of graphene and its analogs.},

  abstract     = {Considering the example of superconducting circuits, we show how Floquet engineering can be combined with reservoir engineering for the controlled preparation of target states. Floquet engineering refers to the control of a quantum system by means of time-periodic forcing, typically in the high-frequency regime, so that the system is governed effectively by a time-independent Floquet Hamiltonian with novel interesting properties. Reservoir engineering, on the other hand, can be achieved in superconducting circuits by coupling a system of artificial atoms (or qubits) dispersively to pumped leaky cavities, so that the induced dissipation guides the system into a desired target state. It is not obvious that the two approaches can be combined, since reaching the dispersive regime, in which system and cavities exchange excitations only virtually, can be spoiled by driving-induced resonant transitions. However, working in the extended Floquet space and treating both system-cavity coupling as well as driving-induced excitation processes on the same footing perturbatively, we identify regimes, where reservoir engineering of targeted Floquet states is possible and accurately described by an effective time-independent master equation. We successfully benchmark our approach for the preparation of the ground state in a system of interacting bosons subjected to Floquet-engineered magnetic fields in different lattice geometries.},

We also clarify finite temperature effects from the same two-phonon exchange process. The temperature T introduces the additional length scale c s / T with the speed of sound c s . Leading corrections at finite temperature scale as T 6 / r for distances r ≪ c s / T smaller than the thermal length. For larger distances the potential shows a nonrelativistic van der Waals behavior ( ∼ T / r 6 ) instead of the relativistic one. Our EFT formulation applies not only to weakly coupled Bose or Fermi superfluids but also to those composed of strongly correlated unitary fermions with a weakly coupled impurity. The sound velocity controls the magnitude of the van der Waals potential, which we evaluate for the fermionic superfluid in the BCS-BEC crossover.},

In this Letter, we present measurements performed on a high-resolution LiInSe 2 bolometer in a “ source = detector ” configuration to measure the spectral shape of the fourfold forbidden β decay of In 115 . The value of g A / g V is determined by comparing the spectral shape of theoretical predictions to the experimental β spectrum taking into account various simulated background components as well as a variety of detector effects. We find evidence of quenching of g A / g V at &gt; 5 σ with a model-dependent quenching factor of 0.655 ± 0.002 as compared to the free-nucleon value for the interacting shell model. We also measured the In 115 half-life to be [ 5.18 ± 0.06 ( stat ) − 0.015 + 0.005 ( sys ) ] × 10 14 yr within the interacting shell model framework. This Letter demonstrates the power of the bolometeric technique to perform precision nuclear physics single- β decay measurements, which along with improved nuclear modeling can help reduce the uncertainties in the calculation of several decay nuclear matrix elements including those used in 0 ν β β sensitivity calculations.},

  abstract     = {There has been recent interest in the question of whether QCD collinear singularities can be viewed as the operator product expansion of a two-dimensional conformal field theory. We analyze a version of this question for the self-dual limit of pure gauge theory (incorporating states of both helicities). We show that the known one-loop collinear singularities do not form an associative chiral algebra. The failure of associativity can be traced to a novel gauge anomaly on twistor space. We find that associativity can be restored for certain gauge groups if we introduce an unusual axion, which cancels the twistor space anomaly by a Green-Schwarz mechanism. Alternatively, associativity can be restored for some gauge groups with carefully chosen matter.},

  abstract     = {We study pole skipping in holographic conformal field theories dual to diffeomorphism invariant theories containing an arbitrary number of bosonic fields in the large N limit. Defining a weight to organize the bulk equations of motion, a set of general pole skipping conditions are derived. In particular, the frequencies simply follow from general covariance and weight matching. In the presence of higher-spin fields, we find that the imaginary frequency for the highest-weight pole skipping point equals the higher-spin Lyapunov exponent which lies outside of the chaos bound. Without higher-spin fields, we show that the energy density Green’s function has its highest-weight pole skipping happening at a location related to the out-of-time-order correlator for arbitrary higher-derivative gravity, with a Lyapunov exponent saturating the chaos bound and a butterfly velocity matching that extracted from a shockwave calculation. We also suggest an explanation for this matching at the metric level by obtaining the on-shell shockwave solution from a regularized limit of the metric perturbation at the skipped pole.},

On the other hand, certain null reductions of the 6D (2,0) theory give rise to 5D Lagrangian theories with SU(1,3) spacetime symmetry, SO(5) R symmetry, and 24 supercharges. This appears to be closely related to the superconformal group of a 3D superconformal Chern-Simons theory known as the Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena theory, which is believed to be integrable in the planar limit, if one exchanges the role of conformal and R symmetry. In this Letter, we construct a representation of the 5D superconformal group using 6D supertwistors and show that it admits an infinite dimensional extension known as Yangian symmetry, which opens up the possibility that these 5D theories are exactly solvable in the planar limit.},

We compute the spectral energy distribution from such decays and the contribution to the flux measured by LORRI. Assuming that axionlike particles make up all of the dark matter, the parameter space unconstrained to date that explains the measured excess spans masses and effective axion-photon couplings of 8–20 eV masses and 3 – 6 × 10 − 11 GeV − 1 , respectively.

  abstract     = {For the newly discovered W -boson mass anomaly, one of the simplest dark matter (DM) models that can account for the anomaly without violating other astrophysical and experimental constraints is the inert two Higgs doublet model, in which the DM mass ( m S ) is found to be within ∼ 54 – 74 GeV . In this model, the annihilation of DM via S S → b b ¯ and S S → W W * would produce antiprotons and gamma rays, and may account for the excesses identified previously in both particles. Motivated by this, we reanalyze the AMS-02 antiproton and Fermi-LAT Galactic center γ -ray data. For the antiproton analysis, the novel treatment is the inclusion of the charge-sign-dependent three-dimensional solar modulation model as constrained by the time-dependent proton data. We find that the excess of antiprotons is more distinct than previous results based on the force-field solar modulation model. The interpretation of this excess as the annihilation of S S → W W * ( S S → b b ¯ ) requires a DM mass of ∼ 40 – 80 (40–60) GeV and a velocity-averaged cross section of O ( 10 − 26 ) cm 3 s − 1 . As for the γ -ray data analysis, besides adopting the widely used spatial template fitting, we employ an orthogonal approach with a data-driven spectral template analysis. The fitting to the GeV γ -ray excess yields DM model parameters overlapped with those to fit the antiproton excess via the W W * channel. The consistency of the DM particle properties required to account for the W -boson mass anomaly, the GeV antiproton excess, and the GeV γ -ray excess suggests a common origin of them.},

We analyze the thermodynamics of this information capacity increasing process. We show how the information capacity increase is compatible with thermodynamics. We show that there may indeed be an information capacity increase for consecutive thermalizations obeying the first and second laws of thermodynamics if these are placed in an indefinite order and moreover that only a significantly bounded increase is possible. The increase comes at the cost of consuming a thermodynamic resource, the free energy of coherence associated with the switch.},

In this Letter, we show a novel approach where the latest version of the adaptive resolution scheme (AdResS), with noninteracting tracers as particles’ reservoir, is combined with a fluctuating hydrodynamics (FHD) solver. The resulting algorithm, supported by a solid mathematical model, allows for a physically consistent exchange of matter and energy between the particle domain and its fluctuating continuum reservoir. Numerical tests are performed to show the validity of the algorithm. Differently from previous algorithms of the same kind, the current approach allows for simulations where, in addition to density fluctuations, also thermal fluctuations can be accounted for, thus large complex molecular systems, as, for example, hydrated biological membranes in a thermal field, can now be efficiently treated.},

Indeed, numerical and experimental observations have demonstrated that spin transport in this paradigmatic model falls into the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. This has inspired the significantly stronger conjecture that KPZ dynamics, in fact, occur in all integrable spin chains with non-Abelian symmetry. Here, we provide extensive numerical evidence affirming this conjecture. Moreover, we observe that KPZ transport is even more generic, arising in both supersymmetric and periodically driven models. Motivated by recent advances in the realization of SU ( N ) -symmetric spin models in alkaline-earth-based optical lattice experiments, we propose and analyze a protocol to directly investigate the KPZ scaling function in such systems.},

Its applicability has so far been limited to specific forms of spectral reservoir distributions and relatively elevated temperatures.

This leads to an elegant extension of the HEOM to arbitrary temperatures and very general reservoirs in combination with efficiency, high accuracy, and long-time stability. Moreover, the technique can directly be implemented in other approaches such as Green’s function, stochastic, and pseudomode formulations. As one highly nontrivial application, for the subohmic spin-boson model at vanishing temperature the Shiba relation is quantitatively verified which predicts the long-time decay of correlation functions.},

The algorithm for sparse states is exponentially faster than best-known results and the number of ancillary qubits is nearly optimal and only increases polynomially with the system size. We discuss applications of the results in different quantum computing tasks, such as Hamiltonian simulation, solving linear systems of equations, and realizing quantum random access memories, and find cases with exponential reductions of the circuit depth for all these three tasks.

It has been proved that entanglement exists almost surely for a random quantum state, while the realizations of effective entanglement criteria usually consume exponentially many resources with regard to system size or qubit number, and efficient criteria often perform poorly without prior knowledge. This fact implies a fundamental limitation might exist in the detectability of entanglement. In this work, we formalize this limitation as a fundamental trade-off between the efficiency and effectiveness of entanglement criteria via a systematic method to evaluate the detection capability of entanglement criteria theoretically. For a system coupled to an environment, we prove that any entanglement criterion needs exponentially many observables to detect the entanglement effectively when restricted to single-copy operations. Otherwise, the detection capability of the criterion will decay double exponentially. Furthermore, if multicopy joint measurements are allowed, the effectiveness of entanglement detection can be exponentially improved, which implies a quantum advantage in entanglement detection problems. Our results may shed light on why quantum phenomena are difficult to observe in large noisy systems.},

Here, we calculate optimal error thresholds for quantum error correcting codes based on fracton models. By mapping the error-correction process for bit-flip and phase-flip noises into novel statistical models with Ising variables and random multibody couplings, we obtain models that exhibit an unconventional subsystem symmetry instead of a more usual global symmetry. We perform large-scale parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations to obtain disorder-temperature phase diagrams, which are then used to predict optimal error thresholds for the corresponding fracton code. Remarkably, we found that the X-cube fracton code displays a minimum error threshold (7.5\%) that is much higher than 3D topological codes such as the toric code (3.3\%), or the color code (1.9\%). This result, together with the predicted absence of glass order at the Nishimori line, shows great potential for fracton phases to be used as quantum memory platforms.},

  abstract     = {We consider quantum circuits composed of single-qubit operations and global entangling gates generated by Ising-type Hamiltonians. It is shown that such circuits can implement a large class of unitary operators commonly used in quantum algorithms at a very low cost—using a constant or effectively constant number of global entangling gates. Specifically, we report constant-cost implementations of Clifford operations with and without ancillae, constant-cost implementation of the multiply-controlled gates with linearly many ancillae, and an O ( log * ( n ) ) cost implementation of the n -controlled single-target gates using logarithmically many ancillae. This shows a significant asymptotic advantage of circuits enabled by the global entangling gates.},

  abstract     = {We address the problem of closing the detection efficiency loophole in Bell experiments, which is crucial for real-world applications. Every Bell inequality has a critical detection efficiency η that must be surpassed to avoid the detection loophole. Here, we propose a general method for reducing the critical detection efficiency of any Bell inequality to arbitrary low values. This is accomplished by entangling two particles in N orthogonal subspaces (e.g., N degrees of freedom) and conducting N Bell tests in parallel. Furthermore, the proposed method is based on the introduction of penalized N -product (PNP) Bell inequalities, for which the so-called simultaneous measurement loophole is closed, and the maximum value for local hidden-variable theories is simply the N th power of the one of the Bell inequality initially considered. We show that, for the PNP Bell inequalities, the critical detection efficiency decays exponentially with N . The strength of our method is illustrated with a detailed study of the PNP Bell inequalities resulting from the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality.},

Focusing on the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality and allowing parties to share classical randomness, we determine the optimal trade-off in the magnitude of Bell violations for a maximally entangled state. We then find that nonmaximally entangled states make possible larger sequential violations, which contrasts the standard Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt scenario. Furthermore, we show that nonlocality can be recycled using projective qubit measurements even when no shared classical randomness is available.

However, the identification of the innately quantum features that enable these speedups is challenging. In the continuous-variable setting—a promising paradigm for the realization of universal, scalable, and fault-tolerant quantum computing—contextuality and Wigner negativity have been perceived as two such distinct resources. Here we show that they are in fact equivalent for the standard models of continuous-variable quantum computing. While our results provide a unifying picture of continuous-variable resources for quantum speedup, they also pave the way toward practical demonstrations of continuous-variable contextuality and shed light on the significance of negative probabilities in phase-space descriptions of quantum mechanics.},

In order to resolve this issue, we have performed extensive numerical simulations of athermally driven elastoplastic models with long-range and anisotropic realistic interaction kernels in two and three dimensions. Our results provide clear evidence for a finite-disorder critical point separating brittle and ductile yielding, and we provide an estimate of the critical exponents in 2D and 3D.},

Most of the work has been, so far, focused on linear chains and on their variety of conformational properties compared to standard polymers. Here we go beyond the linear case and show that, by circularizing such macrochains, one can exploit the topology of the local interlockings to store twist in the system, significantly altering its metric and local properties. Moreover, by properly defining the twist (Tw) and writhe (Wr) of these macrorings we show the validity of a relation equivalent to the Călugăreanu-White-Fuller theorem T w + W r = const , originally proved for ribbonlike structures such as double stranded DNA. Our results suggest that circular polycatenanes with storable and tunable twist can form a new category of highly designable multiscale structures with potential applications in supramolecular chemistry and material science.},

  abstract     = {There is a number of contradictory findings with regard to whether the theory describing easy-plane quantum antiferromagnets undergoes a second-order phase transition. The traditional Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson approach suggests a first-order phase transition, as there are two different competing order parameters. On the other hand, it is known that the theory has the property of self-duality which has been connected to the existence of a deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP). The latter regime suggests that order parameters are not the elementary building blocks of the theory, but rather consist of fractionalized particles that are confined in both phases of the transition and only appear—deconfine—at the critical point. Nevertheless, many numerical Monte Carlo simulations disagree with the claim of a DQCP in the system, indicating instead a first-order phase transition. Here we establish from exact lattice duality transformations and renormalization group analysis that the easy-plane CP 1 antiferromagnet does feature a DQCP. We uncover the criticality starting from a regime analogous to the zero temperature limit of a certain classical statistical mechanics system which we therefore dub frozen. At criticality our bosonic theory is dual to a fermionic one with two massless Dirac fermions, which thus undergoes a second-order phase transition as well.},

  abstract     = {The two-dimensional Wigner crystal (WC) occurs in the strongly interacting regime ( r s ≫ 1 ) of the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). The magnetism of a pure WC is determined by tunneling processes that induce multispin ring-exchange interactions, resulting in fully polarized ferromagnetism for large enough r s . Recently, Hossain et al. [ Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 117 , 32244 (2020) ] reported the occurrence of a fully polarized ferromagnetic insulator at r s ≳ 35 in an AlAs quantum well, but at temperatures orders of magnitude larger than the predicted exchange energies for the pure WC. Here, we analyze the large r s dynamics of an interstitial defect in the WC, and show that it produces local ferromagnetism with much higher energy scales. Three hopping processes are dominant, which favor a large, fully polarized ferromagnetic polaron. Based on the above results, we speculate concerning the phenomenology of the magnetism near the metal-insulator transition of the 2DEG.},

  abstract     = {Investigation of dynamical excitations is difficult but crucial to the understanding of many exotic quantum phenomena discovered in quantum materials. This is particularly true for highly frustrated quantum antiferromagnets whose dynamical properties deviate strongly from theoretical predictions made based on the spin-wave or other approximations. Here, we present a large-scale numerical calculation on the dynamical correlation functions of spin- 1 / 2 triangular Heisenberg model using a state-of-the-art tensor network renormalization group method. The calculated results allow us to gain for the first time a comprehensive picture on the nature of spin excitation spectra in this highly frustrated quantum system. It provides a quantitative account for all the key features of the dynamical spectra disclosed by inelastic neutron scattering measurements for Ba 3 CoSb 2 O 9 , revealing the importance of the interplay between low- and high-energy excitations and its renormalization effect to the low-energy magnon bands and high-energy continuums. We identify the longitudinal Higgs modes in the intermediate-energy scale and predict the energy and momentum dependence of spectral functions along the three principal axes that can be verified by polarized neutron scattering experiments. Furthermore, we find that the spin excitation spectra weakly depend on the anisotropic ratio of the antiferromagnetic interaction.},

  abstract     = {We propose a universal gate set acting on a qubit formed by the degenerate ground states of a Coulomb-blockaded time-reversal invariant topological superconductor island with spatially separated Majorana Kramers pairs: the “Majorana Kramers qubit.” All gate operations are implemented by coupling the Majorana Kramers pairs to conventional superconducting leads. Interestingly, in such an all-superconducting device, the energy gap of the leads provides another layer of protection from quasiparticle poisoning independent of the island charging energy. Moreover, the absence of strong magnetic fields—which typically reduce the superconducting gap size of the island—suggests a unique robustness of our qubit to quasiparticle poisoning due to thermal excitations. Consequently, the Majorana Kramers qubit should benefit from prolonged coherence times and may provide an alternative route to a Majorana-based quantum computer.},

While this mechanism has been extensively studied for equilibrium transitions, its applicability to nonequilibrium transitions has not yet been fully examined. Recent simulation has shown the applicability of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism to dynamical ordering transitions in particlelike assemblies, including superconducting vortices, driven over random disorder. Here, we experimentally study the configurational order of vortices in the course of dynamical ordering with various quench rates. We verify a power-law scaling of the defect density with the quench rate and an impulse-adiabatic crossover on the ordered side of the transition, which are key predictions of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Our results suggest the applicability of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism to other nonequilibrium phase transitions.},

The presence of dislocation loops under graphene leads to a ferrimagnetic ordering of moments in the two C sublattices. It is shown that the band gap of ∼ 80 meV in the K ¯ point has a magnetic nature and exists for ferrimagnetic ordering. Interplay between Rashba and exchange couplings is evidenced by spin splitting asymmetry in spin-ARPES measurements and fully supported by DFT calculation of a ( 9 × 9 ) unit cell. Owing to sign-opposite Berry curvatures for K ¯ and K ¯ ′ valleys, the synthesized system is promising for the realization of a circular dichroism Hall effect.},

This approach, which is automated, allows one to perform high-quality coupled cluster molecular dynamics, CCMD, as we demonstrate for liquid water including nuclear quantum effects.

Despite steady progress in beam phase-space manipulation over the last several decades, future accelerator applications continue to outpace the ability to manipulate the phase space. This situation is especially pronounced for longitudinal beam phase-space manipulation, and is now getting increased attention. Herein, we report the first experimental demonstration of the double emittance exchange concept, which allows for the control of the longitudinal phase space using relatively simple transverse manipulation techniques. The double emittance exchange beamline enables extensive longitudinal manipulation, including tunable bunch compression, time-energy correlation control, and nonlinearity correction, in a remarkably flexible manner. The demonstration of this new method opens the door for arbitrary longitudinal beam manipulations capable of responding to the ever increasing demands of future accelerator applications.},

This general argument, which we propose, predicts a nonwetting gap in the phase diagram, challenging the common belief in “critical-point wetting,” even for short-range forces. A demonstration is provided by exact solution of a mean-field two-density functional theory for three-phase equilibria near a tricritical point (TCP). Complete wetting is found in a tiny vicinity of the TCP. Away from it, nonwetting prevails and no wetting transition takes place, not even when a critical endpoint is approached. Far from the TCP, reentrant wetting may occur, with a different wetting phase. These findings shed light on hitherto unexplained experiments on ternary H 2 O -oil-nonionic amphiphile mixtures in which nonwetting continues to exist as one approaches either one of the two critical endpoints.},

Here, we study the interplay of these paradigmatic settings. In a series of examples, we show that a single quantum emitter coupled to a non-Hermitian bath displays a number of unconventional behaviors, many without Hermitian counterpart. We first consider a unidirectional hopping lattice whose complex dispersion forms a loop. We identify peculiar bound states inside the loop as a manifestation of the non-Hermitian skin effect. In the same setting, emitted photons may display spatial amplification markedly distinct from free propagation, which can be understood with the help of the generalized Brillouin zone. We then consider a nearest-neighbor lattice with alternating loss. We find that the long-time emitter decay always follows a power law, which is usually invisible for Hermitian baths. Our Letter points toward a rich landscape of anomalous quantum emitter dynamics induced by non-Hermitian baths.},

  abstract     = {We define a new geometry obtained from the all-loop amplituhedron in N = 4 SYM by reducing its four-dimensional external and loop momenta to three dimensions. Focusing on the simplest four-point case, we provide strong evidence that the canonical form of this “reduced amplituhedron” gives the all-loop integrand of the Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena four-point amplitude. In addition to various all-loop cuts manifested by the geometry, we present explicitly new results for the integrand up to five loops, which are much simpler than results in N = 4 SYM. One of the reasons for such all-loop simplifications is that only a very small fraction of the so-called negative geometries survives the dimensional reduction, which corresponds to bipartite graphs. Our results suggest an unexpected relation between four-point amplitudes in these two theories.},

Recently, it has been shown that in addition to conventional BMS supertranslation symmetries, there exists an additional infinite set of magnetic asymptotic symmetries, dual BMS supertranslations, again parametrized by a function on the two-sphere. We show that the Dirac bracket between these generators exhibits an anomalous central term when one parameter function exhibits a singularity in the complex stereographical coordinates on the sphere. In order to preserve general coordinate invariance, we demonstrate that this central term can be removed by postulating a holographic gravitational Chern-Simons theory on the horizon. This indicates that for an anomaly-free theory of quantum gravity in the presence of a black hole, one should include a boundary theory on the horizon.},

Applied to certain integrable models, the double copy defines an isomorphism between Lax connections, Wilson lines, and infinite towers of conserved currents. We also implement the double copy at the level of nonperturbative classical solutions, both analytically and numerically, and present a generalization of the double copy map that includes a fixed tower of higher-dimension corrections given by the Moyal algebra.},

  abstract     = {The construction of the generalized Gibbs ensemble, to which isolated integrable quantum many-body systems relax after a quantum quench, is based upon the principle of maximum entropy. In contrast, there are no universal and model-independent laws that govern the relaxation dynamics and stationary states of open quantum systems, which are subjected to Markovian drive and dissipation. Yet, as we show, relaxation of driven-dissipative systems after a quantum quench can, in fact, be determined by a maximum entropy ensemble, if the Liouvillian that generates the dynamics of the system has parity-time symmetry. Focusing on the specific example of a driven-dissipative Kitaev chain, we show that, similar to isolated integrable systems, the approach to a parity-time symmetric generalized Gibbs ensemble becomes manifest in the relaxation of local observables and the dynamics of subsystem entropies. In contrast, the directional pumping of fermion parity, which is induced by nontrivial non-Hermitian topology of the Kitaev chain, represents a phenomenon that is unique to relaxation dynamics in driven-dissipative systems. Upon increasing the strength of dissipation, parity-time symmetry is broken at a finite critical value, which thus constitutes a sharp dynamical transition that delimits the applicability of the principle of maximum entropy. We show that these results, which we obtain for the specific example of the Kitaev chain, apply to broad classes of noninteracting fermionic models, and we discuss their generalization to a noninteracting bosonic model and an interacting spin chain.},

Despite its importance in the physics of active and living systems, the entropy production of systems with many degrees of freedom has remained of little practical significance because the high dimensionality of their state space makes it difficult to measure. Here we introduce a local measure of entropy production and a numerical protocol to estimate it. We establish a connection between the entropy production and extractability of work in a given region of the system and show how this quantity depends crucially on the degrees of freedom being tracked. We validate our approach in theory, simulation, and experiments by considering systems of active Brownian particles undergoing motility-induced phase separation, as well as active Brownian particles and E.coli in a rectifying device in which the time-reversal asymmetry of the particle dynamics couples to spatial asymmetry to reveal its effects on a macroscopic scale.},

Traditional tomography is limited to a handful of qubits, and shadow tomography has been suggested as a scalable replacement for larger systems. Shadow tomography is conventionally analyzed based on outcomes of ideal projective measurements on the system upon application of randomized unitaries. Here, we suggest that shadow tomography can be much more straightforwardly formulated for generalized measurements, or positive operator valued measures. Based on the idea of the least-square estimator shadow tomography with generalized measurements is both more general and simpler than the traditional formulation with randomization of unitaries. In particular, this formulation allows us to analyze theoretical aspects of shadow tomography in detail. For example, we provide a detailed study of the implication of symmetries in shadow tomography. Moreover, with this generalization we also demonstrate how the optimization of measurements for shadow tomography tailored toward a particular set of observables can be carried out.},

In contrast to the ordinary Anderson localization, where disorder induces localization and prevents transport, in flat band systems disorder can induce mobility, a phenomenon dubbed inverse Anderson transition. Here, we report on the experimental realization of the AB cage using a synthetic lattice in the momentum space of ultracold atoms with tailored gauge fields, and demonstrate the geometric localization due to the flat band and the inverse Anderson transition when correlated binary disorder is added to the system.

When the growth does not generate any stress, the body shape only reflects the growth density. In two dimensions, we show that stress free configurations are simply determined by the time evolution of a conformal mapping which concerns not only the boundary but also the displacement field during an arbitrary period of time inside the sample. Fresh planar leaves are good examples for our study: they have no elastic stress, almost no weight, and their shape can be easily represented by holomorphic functions. The growth factor, isotropic or anisotropic, is related to the metrics between the initial and current conformal maps. By adjusting the mathematical shape function, main characteristics such as tips (convex or concave or sharp-pointed), undulating borders, and veins can be mathematically recovered, which are in good agreement with observations. It is worth mentioning that this flexible method allows us to study complex morphologies of growing leaves such as the fenestration process in Monstera deliciosa , and can also shed light on many other 2D biological patterns.},

  abstract     = {According to previous theoretical work, the binary oxide CuO can become a room-temperature multiferroic via tuning of the superexchange interactions by application of pressure. Thus far, however, there has been no experimental evidence for the predicted room-temperature multiferroicity. Here, we show by neutron diffraction that the multiferroic phase in CuO reaches 295 K with the application of 18.5 GPa pressure. We also develop a spin Hamiltonian based on density functional theory and employing superexchange theory for the magnetic interactions, which can reproduce the experimental results. The present Letter provides a stimulus to develop room-temperature multiferroic materials by alternative methods based on existing low temperature compounds, such as epitaxial strain, for tunable multifunctional devices and memory applications.},

  abstract     = {Yb 2 Ti 2 O 7 is a celebrated example of a pyrochlore magnet with highly frustrated, anisotropic exchange interactions. To date, attention has largely focused on its unusual, static properties, many of which can be understood as coming from the competition between different types of magnetic order. Here we use inelastic neutron scattering with exceptionally high energy resolution to explore the dynamical properties of Yb 2 Ti 2 O 7 . We find that spin correlations exhibit dynamical scaling, analogous to behavior found near to a quantum critical point. We show that the observed scaling collapse can be explained within a phenomenological theory of multiple-phase competition, and confirm that a scaling collapse is also seen in semiclassical simulations of a microscopic model of Yb 2 Ti 2 O 7 . These results suggest that dynamical scaling may be general to systems with competing ground states.},

The photoemission quantum yield of the InGaN samples with more than 5\% of indium drops by more than 1 order of magnitude when the temperature is decreased while it remains constant for lower indium content. This drop is attributed to a freezing of photoelectron transport in p -InGaN due to electron localization in the fluctuating potential induced by the alloy disorder. This interpretation is supported by the disappearance at low temperature of the peak in the photoemission spectrum that corresponds to the contribution of the photoelectrons relaxed at the bottom of the InGaN conduction band.},

Topological insulators feature gapless surface states and, moreover, magnetic doping and resultant ferromagnetic ordering break time-reversal symmetry to realize quantum anomalous Hall and Chern insulators. Here, we focus on the bulk and investigate the mutual coupling of electronic and magnetic properties of Dirac electrons. Without carrier doping, spiral magnetic orders cause a ferroelectric polarization through the spin-orbit coupling. In a doped metallic state, the anisotropic magnetoresistance arises without uniform magnetization. We find that electric current induces uniform magnetization and conversely an oscillating magnetic order induces electric current. Our model provides a coherent and unified description of all those phenomena. The mutual control of electric and magnetic properties demonstrates implementations of antiferromagnetic spintronics. We also discuss the stoichiometric magnetic topological insulator MnBi 2 Te 4 .},

Realizing coherent transfer of phonons between distant oscillators is a key challenge in phononic quantum information processing. Here, we report on the realization of robust unidirectional adiabatic pumping of phonons in a parametrically coupled nanomechanical system engineered as a one-dimensional phononic topological insulator. By exploiting three nearly degenerate local modes—two edge states and an interface state between them—and the dynamic modulation of their mutual couplings, we achieve nonreciprocal adiabatic transfer of phononic excitations from one edge to the other with near unit fidelity. We further demonstrate the robustness of such adiabatic transfer of phonons in the presence of various noises in the control signals. Our experiment paves the way toward nonreciprocal phonon dynamics via adiabatic pumping and is valuable for phononic quantum information processing.},

In contrast to a monotonically growing static correlation length, the dynamical correlation length that measures the extent of surface-dynamics acceleration into the bulk displays a striking nonmonotonic temperature evolution that is robust also against changes in detailed interatomic interaction. This nonmonotonic change defines a crossover temperature T * that is distinct from the critical temperature T c of mode-coupling theory. We connect this nonmonotonic change to a morphological change of cooperative rearrangement regions of fast particles, and to the point where the decoupling of fast-particle motion from the bulk relaxation is most sensitive to fluctuations. We propose a rigorous definition of this new crossover temperature T * within a recent extension of mode-coupling theory, the stochastic β -relaxation theory.},

As a mitigation strategy, a gentle acceleration of this interface is predicted by simulations and theory to significantly reduce this instability growth in the early stage of the implosion. We have performed high-contrast, time-resolved x-ray refraction enhanced radiography (RER) to accurately measure the level of acceleration as a function of the initial laser drive time history for indirect-drive implosions on the National Ignition Facility. We demonstrate a transition from no acceleration to 20 ± 1.8 μ m ns − 2 acceleration by tweaking the drive that should reduce the initial instabilities by an order of magnitude at high modes.},

As an example, we find that the effective collision rate in the laser-overlap region of hohlraums on the National Ignition Facility is expected to exceed the Coulomb collision rate by 1 order of magnitude, leading to a fundamental change to the electron transport properties.

It is therefore of great practical relevance to engineer heralded sources of highly pure and indistinguishable photons. Inspired by magic state distillation, we present a protocol using standard linear optics which can be used to increase the indistinguishability of a photon source, to arbitrary accuracy. In particular, in the asymptotic limit of small error ε , to reduce the error to ε ′ &lt; ε requires O ( ( ε / ε ′ ) 2 ) photons.

  abstract     = {The control of low-energy electrons by carrier-envelope-phase-stable near-single-cycle THz pulses is demonstrated. A femtosecond laser pulse is used to create a temporally localized wave packet through multiphoton absorption at a well defined phase of a synchronized THz field. By recording the photoelectron momentum distributions as a function of the time delay, we observe signatures of various regimes of dynamics, ranging from recollision-free acceleration to coherent electron-ion scattering induced by the THz field. The measurements are confirmed by three-dimensional time-dependent Schrödinger equation simulations. A classical trajectory model allows us to identify scattering phenomena analogous to strong-field photoelectron holography and high-order above-threshold ionization.},

We uncover that these speckle patterns unambiguously originate from the subnanometer surface undulations, and develop an intuitive model to illustrate how subnanometer nonresonant dielectric features could generate pronounced interference contrast in the far field. We introduce the concept of optical fingerprint for the deterministic speckle pattern associated with a particular substrate surface area and intentionally enhance the speckle amplitudes for potential applications. We demonstrate such optical fingerprints can be leveraged for reproducible position identification and marker-free lateral displacement detection with an experimental precision of 0.22 nm. The reproducible position identification allows us to detect new nanoscopic features developed during laborious processes performed outside of the microscope. The demonstrated capability for ultrasensitive displacement detection may find applications in the semiconductor industry and superresolution optical microscopy.},

Nine Na 39 events have been unambiguously observed in this work and clearly establish the particle stability of Na 39 . Furthermore, the lack of observation of Ne 3 5 , 3 6 isotopes in this experiment significantly improves the overall confidence that Ne 3 4 is the neutron dripline nucleus of neon. These results provide new key information to understand nuclear binding and nuclear structure under extremely neutron-rich conditions. The newly established stability of Na 39 has a significant impact on nuclear models and theories predicting the neutron dripline and also provides a key to understanding the nuclear shell property of Na 39 at the neutron number N = 2 8 , which is normally a magic number.},

We describe a new proposal using the homogeneous precession domain of superfluid He 3 as the detection medium, where the effect of the axion wind is a small shift in the precession frequency of a large-amplitude NMR signal. We argue that this setup can provide broadband detection of multiple axion masses simultaneously and has competitive sensitivity to other axion wind experiments such as CASPEr-Wind at masses below 10 − 7 eV by exploiting precision frequency metrology in the readout stage.},

Holography suggests that this theory is dual to an exotic maximally supersymmetric conformal field theory (CFT) in d dimensions whose only light single trace operator is the stress tensor. This contrasts with more standard cases like type IIB string theory on AdS 5 × S 5 dual to N = 4 super-Yang-Mills, where the CFT has light single trace operators for each Kaluza-Klein mode on S 5 . We compute the one-loop correction to the pure AdS d + 1 theory in a small Planck length expansion, which is dual to the large central charge expansion in the CFT. We find that this correction saturates the most general nonperturbative conformal bootstrap bounds on this correlator in the large central charge regime for d = 3 , 4, 6, while the one-loop correction to CFTs with string and M-theory duals all lie inside the allowed region.},

We show how this generic phenomenon arises in a dark sector composed of millicharged particles strongly self-interacting via a dark photon. The millicharged plasma wind emerging in this model has novel yet predictive signatures that encourages new experimental directions. This phenomenon demonstrates how a small step away from the simplest models can lead to radically different outcomes and thus motivates a broader search for dark sector particles.},

This brings up the notion of “symmetry-enriched” quantum criticality. While recent works in the literature focused on critical states with robust degenerate edge modes, we propose that the conformal boundary condition (B.C.) is a more generic characteristic of such quantum critical states. We show that in two families of quantum spin chains, which generalize the Ising and the three-state Potts models, the quantum critical point between a symmetry-protected topological phase and a symmetry-breaking order realizes a conformal B.C. distinct from the simple Ising and Potts chains. Furthermore, we argue that the conformal B.C. can be derived from the bulk effective field theory, which realizes a novel bulk-boundary correspondence in symmetry-enriched quantum critical states.},

However, classical techniques are hindered by physical limitations including loss, noise, and the fact that the received light is generally quantum in nature. We show how to overcome these issues using quantum communication techniques. We present a general framework for using quantum error correction codes for protecting and imaging starlight received at distant telescope sites. In our scheme, the quantum state of light is coherently captured into a nonradiative atomic state via stimulated Raman adiabatic passage, which is then imprinted into a quantum error correction code. The code protects the signal during subsequent potentially noisy operations necessary to extract the image parameters. We show that even a small quantum error correction code can offer significant protection against noise. For large codes, we find noise thresholds below which the information can be preserved. Our scheme represents an application for near-term quantum devices that can increase imaging resolution beyond what is feasible using classical techniques.},

  abstract     = {Quantum memories at telecom wavelengths are crucial for the construction of large-scale quantum networks based on existing fiber networks. On-demand storage of telecom photonic qubits is an essential request for such networking applications but yet to be demonstrated. Here we demonstrate the storage and on-demand retrieval of telecom photonic qubits using a laser-written waveguide fabricated in an Er 167 3 + : Y 2 SiO 5 crystal. Both ends of the waveguide memory are directly connected with fiber arrays with a fiber-to-fiber efficiency of 51\%. Storage fidelity of 98.3(1)\% can be obtained for time-bin qubits encoded with single-photon-level coherent pulses, which is far beyond the maximal fidelity that can be achieved with a classical measure and prepared strategy. This device features high reliability and easy scalability, and it can be directly integrated into fiber networks, which could play an essential role in fiber-based quantum networks.},

The associated strain rate is commonly found to decay in time as γ ˙ ∼ t − ν , followed either by arrest or by a sudden fluidization. Various empirical laws have been suggested for the creep exponent ν and fluidization time τ f in experimental and numerical studies. Here, we postulate that plastic flow is governed by the difference between Σ and the transient yield stress Σ t ( γ ) that characterizes the stability of configurations visited by the system at strain γ . Assuming the analyticity of Σ t ( γ ) allows us to predict ν and asymptotic behaviors of τ f in terms of properties of stationary flows. We test successfully our predictions using elastoplastic models and published experimental results.},

In the regime of iridescence with a well-defined pitch length of chirality, we find low energy Raman scattering that can be decomposed into helical and chiral components depending on the scattering vector and the topological charge of the incident photon field. Based on the observation of an anomalous dispersion we attribute quasielastic scattering to a transfer of angular momenta to rotonlike quasiparticles. The latter are due to a competition of short-range repulsive and long-range dipolar interactions. Our approach using a transfer of orbital angular momentum opens up an avenue for the advanced characterization of chiral and optically active devices and materials.},

Nonequilibrium vibrational dynamics are known to direct electron-transfer mechanisms in molecular systems; however, the structural features of a molecule that lead to certain modes being pushed out of equilibrium are not well understood. Herein, we report on electron transport through a porphyrin dimer molecule, weakly coupled to graphene electrodes, that displays sequential tunneling within the Coulomb-blockade regime. The sequential transport is initiated by current-induced phonon absorption and proceeds by rapid sequential transport via a nonequilibrium vibrational distribution of low-energy modes, likely related to torsional molecular motions. We demonstrate that this is an experimental signature of slow vibrational dissipation, and obtain a lower bound for the vibrational relaxation time of 8 ns, a value dependent on the molecular charge state.},

Theoretical studies so far have predicted that under strong Coulomb correlations the 0 − π transition should go through intermediate states, 0 ′ and π ′ phases. By combining a nonperturbative numerical method and the resistively shunted junction model, we investigated the magnetic-field-driven phase transition of the QDJJs in the Kondo regime and found that the low-field magnetotransport exhibits a unique feature which can be used to distinguish the intermediate phases. In particular, the magnetic-field driven π ′ − π transition is found to lead to the enhancement of the supercurrent which is strongly related to the Kondo effect.},

Here, we use resonant x-ray scattering to study the layered trimer iridate Ba 4 Ir 3 O 10 , which shows no magnetic order down to 0.2 K. An emergent one-dimensional spinon continuum is observed that can be well described by X X Z spin- 1 / 2 chains with a magnetic exchange of ∼ 55 meV and a small Ising-like anisotropy. With 2\% isovalent Sr doping, magnetic order appears below T N = 130 K along with sharper excitations in ( Ba 1 − x Sr x ) 4 Ir 3 O 10 . Combining our data with exact diagonalization calculations, we find that the frustrated intratrimer interactions effectively reduce the system into decoupled spin chains, the subtle balance of which can be easily tipped by perturbations such as chemical doping. Our results put Ba 4 Ir 3 O 10 between the one-dimensional chain and two-dimensional quantum spin liquid scenarios, illustrating a new way to suppress magnetic order and realize fractional spinons.},

Depending on the quasiparticle statistics, band structure, and device geometry these semimetallic phases of matter can feature unconventional responses to external fields that often defy simple interpretations in terms of single-particle physics. Here we show that small-angle twisted bilayer graphene (SA TBG) offers a highly tunable system in which to explore interactions-limited electron conduction. By employing a dual-gated device architecture we tune our devices from a nondegenerate charge-neutral Dirac fluid to a compensated two-component e − h Fermi liquid where spatially separated electrons and holes experience strong mutual friction. This friction is revealed through the T 2 resistivity that accurately follows the e − h drag theory we develop. Our results provide a textbook illustration of a smooth transition between different interaction-limited transport regimes and clarify the conduction mechanisms in charge-neutral SA TBG.},

For a resonant adsorbate, whose frontier orbitals lie close to the Fermi level, the electromigration force is dominated by the electron wind force that is strongly enhanced along the electron flow direction, irrespective of the sign of the adsorbate charge. For a nonresonant adsorbate, the electromigration force is essentially the direct force that depends on the adsorbate charge. We also show that the magnitude of electromigration forces can be continuously tunable through electrostatic gating for resonant adsorbates.

Here we report a systematic angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) study of Cs ( V 1 − x Nb x ) 3 Sb 5 as a function of Nb content x , where isovalent Nb substitution causes an enhancement of superconducting transition temperature ( T c ) and the reduction of CDW temperature ( T CDW ). We found that the Nb substitution shifts the Sb-derived electron band at the Γ point downward and simultaneously moves the V-derived band around the M point upward to lift up the saddle point (SP) away from the Fermi level, leading to the reduction of the CDW-gap magnitude and T CDW . This indicates a primary role of the SP density of states to stabilize the CDW. The present result also suggests that the enhancement of superconductivity by Nb substitution is caused by the cooperation between the expansion of the Sb-derived electron pocket and the recovery of the V-derived density of states at the Fermi level.},

  abstract     = {Approximation of molecular surfaces is of central importance in numerous scientific fields. In this study we theoretically derive a physical model to relate phase-change thermodynamics to molecular surfaces. The model allows accurately predicting vaporization enthalpy of compounds for a wide temperature range without requiring any empirical parameter. Through the new model, we conceptualize thermodynamically effective molecular surfaces and show that they, although only marginally different than van der Waals surfaces, substantially improve predictability of multiple thermodynamic quantities.},

  abstract     = {Accreting supermassive black holes can now be observed at the event-horizon scale at millimeter wavelengths. Current predictions for the image rely on hypotheses (fluid modeling, thermal electrons) which might not always hold in the vicinity of the black hole, so that a full kinetic treatment is in order. In this Letter, we describe the first 3D global general-relativistic particle-in-cell simulation of a black-hole magnetosphere. The system displays a persistent equatorial current sheet. Synthetic radio images are computed by ray-tracing synchrotron emission from nonthermal particles accelerated in this current sheet by magnetic reconnection. We identify several time-dependent features of the image at moderate viewing angles: a variable radius of the ring, and hot spots moving along it. In this regime, our model predicts that most of the flux of the image lies inside the critical curve. These results could help promote understanding of future observations of black-hole magnetospheres at improved temporal and spatial resolution.},

This Letter details a robust range of counter-current rotation over which RMPs cause this density pump-in effect for high confinement (H mode) plasmas. The pump in is shown to be caused by a reduction of the turbulent transport and to be correlated with a change in the sign of the induced neoclassical transport.

  abstract     = {What is the final state of turbulence when the driving parameter approaches infinity? For the traditional Rayleigh-Bénard convection, a possible ultimate scaling dependence of the heat transport (quantified by the Nusselt number Nu) on the Rayleigh number (Ra), which can be extrapolated to arbitrarily high Ra, is predicted by theories. The existence of the ultimate scaling has been intensively debated in the past decades. In this Letter, we adopt a novel supergravitational thermal convection experimental setup to study the possible transition to the ultimate regime. This system is characterized by the combined effects of radial-dependent centrifugal force, the Earth’s gravity, and the Coriolis force. With an effective gravity up to 100 times the Earth’s gravity, both Ra and shear Reynolds number can be boosted due to the increase of the buoyancy driving and the additional Coriolis forces. With over a decade of Ra range, we demonstrate the existence of ultimate regime with four direct evidences: the ultimate scaling dependence of Nu versus Ra; the appearance of the turbulent velocity boundary layer profile; the enhanced strength of the shear Reynolds number; and the new statistical properties of local temperature fluctuations. The present findings will greatly improve the understanding of the flow dynamics in geophysical and astrophysical flows.},

In these situations, elastohydrodynamic coupling leads to (i) a nonlinear pressure-vs-flow-rate relation, strongly affecting the hydraulic resistance; and (ii), because of the compliance-enabled volume storage, a finite relaxation time under a stepwise change in pressure. This latter effect remains relatively unexplored, even while the timescale can vary over a decade in typical situations. In this study we provide time-resolved measurements of the relaxation dynamics for thin and soft, rectangular microfluidic channels. We describe our data using a perturbative lubrication approximation of the Stokes equation coupled to linear elasticity, while taking into account the effect of compliance and resistance of the entrance. The modeling allows us to completely describe all of the experimental results. Our Letter is relevant for any microfluidic scenario wherein a time-dependent driving is applied and provides a first step in the dynamical description of compliant channel networks.},

In contrast to the claims of the above article, longitudinal, transverse, and “hybrid” contributions to the angular momenta are equally important in general and cannot be neglected.

Here, we use a strongly coupled optical cavity to read out the state of a single tweezer-trapped Rb 87 atom within a small tweezer array. Measuring either atomic fluorescence or the transmission of light through the cavity, we detect both the presence and the state of an atom in the tweezer, within only tens of microseconds, with state preparation and measurement infidelities of roughly 0.5\% and atom loss probabilities of around 1\%. Using a two-tweezer system, we find measurement on one atom within the cavity causes no observable hyperfine-state decoherence on a second atom located tens of microns from the cavity volume. This high-fidelity mid-circuit readout method is a substantial step toward quantum error correction in neutral atom arrays.},

We observe that the recombination coefficient K 3 ∝ ε kin a 6 , where the first factor, the average kinetic energy per particle ε kin , arises from a three-body threshold law, and the second one from the universality of recombination. Both scaling laws are consequences of Pauli blocking effects in three-body collisions involving two identical fermions. As a result of the interplay between Fermi statistics and the momentum dependence of the recombination process, the system exhibits nontrivial temperature dynamics during recombination, alternatively heating or cooling depending on its initial quantum degeneracy.

  abstract     = {The concept of contact interaction is fundamental in various areas of physics. It simplifies physical models by replacing the detailed short-range interaction with a zero-range contact potential that reproduces the same low-energy scattering parameter, i.e., the s -wave scattering length. In this Letter, we generalize this concept to open quantum systems with short-range two-body losses. We show that the short-range two-body losses can be effectively described by a complex scattering length. However, in contrast to closed systems, the dynamics of an open quantum system is governed by the Lindblad master equation the includes a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian as well as an extra recycling term. We thus develop proper methods to regularize both terms in the master equation in the contact (zero-range) limit. We then apply our regularized complex contact interaction to study the dynamic problem of a weakly interacting and dissipating Bose-Einstein condensate. It is found that the physics is greatly enriched because the scattering length is continued from the real axis to the complex plane. For example, we show that a strong dissipation may prevent an attractive Bose-Einstein condensate from collapsing. We further calculate the particle decay in this system to the order of ( density ) 3 / 2 which resembles the celebrated Lee-Huang-Yang correction to the ground state energy of interacting Bose gases [Lee and Yang, Phys. Rev. 105 , 1119 (1957) ; Lee, Huang, and Yang, Phys. Rev. 106 , 1135 (1957) ]. Possible methods for tuning the complex scattering length in cold atomic gas experiments are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {Intense light-induced fragmentation of spherical clusters produces highly energetic ions with characteristic spatial distributions. By subjecting argon clusters to a wavelength tunable laser, we show that ion emission energy and anisotropy can be controlled through the wavelength—isotropic and energetic for shorter wavelengths and increasingly anisotropic at longer wavelengths. The anisotropic part of the energy spectrum, consisting of multiply charged high-energy ions, is considerably more prominent at longer wavelengths. Classical molecular dynamics simulations reveal that cluster ionization occurs inhomogeneously producing a columnlike charge distribution along the laser polarization direction. This previously unknown distribution results from the dipole response of the neutral cluster which creates an enhanced field at the surface, preferentially triggering ionization at the poles. The subsequently formed nanoplasma provides an additional wavelength-dependent ionization mechanism through collisional ionization, efficiently homogenizing the system only at short wavelengths close to resonance. Our results open the door to studying polarization induced effects in nanostructures and complex molecules and provide a missing piece in our understanding of anisotropic ion emission.},

  abstract     = {Several recent attoclock experiments have investigated the fundamental question of a quantum mechanically induced time delay in tunneling ionization via extremely precise photoelectron momentum spectroscopy. The interpretations of those attoclock experimental results were controversially discussed, because the entanglement of the laser and Coulomb field did not allow for theoretical treatments without undisputed approximations. The method of semiclassical propagation matched with the tunneled wave function, the quasistatic Wigner theory, the analytical R-matrix theory, the backpropagation method, and the under-the-barrier recollision theory are the leading conceptual approaches put forward to treat this problem, however, with seemingly conflicting conclusions on the existence of a tunneling time delay. To resolve the contradicting conclusions of the different approaches, we consider a very simple tunneling scenario which is not plagued with complications stemming from the Coulomb potential of the atomic core, avoids consequent controversial approximations and, therefore, allows us to unequivocally identify the origin of the tunneling time delay.},

When a defect breaks a global symmetry, there is a contact term in the conservation equation with an exactly marginal defect operator. The resulting defect conformal manifold is the symmetry breaking coset, and its Zamolodchikov metric is expressed as the two-point function of the exactly marginal operator. As the Riemann tensor on the conformal manifold can be expressed as an integrated four-point function of the marginal operators, we find an exact relation to the curvature of the coset space. We confirm this relation against previously obtained four-point functions for insertions into the 1 / 2 BPS Wilson loop in N = 4 SYM and 3D N = 6 theory and the 1 / 2 BPS surface operator of the 6D N = ( 2 , 0 ) theory.},

The correction not only steers the reduced system toward a correct steady state but also improves the accuracy of the dynamics, thereby refining the archetypal Born-Markov weak-coupling second-order master equations. In case of equilibrium, we use the exact mean-force Gibbs state to correct the Redfield quantum master equation. By benchmarking it with the exact solution of the damped harmonic oscillator, we show that our method also helps correct the long-standing issue of positivity violation, albeit without complete positivity. Our method of a canonically consistent quantum master equation opens a new perspective in the theory of open quantum systems leading to a reduced density matrix accurate beyond the commonly used Redfield and Lindblad equations, while retaining the same conceptual and numerical complexity.},

  abstract     = {Magic sets of observables are minimal structures that capture quantum state-independent advantage for systems of n ≥ 2 qubits and are, therefore, fundamental tools for investigating the interface between classical and quantum physics. A theorem by Arkhipov (arXiv:1209.3819) states that n -qubit magic sets in which each observable is in exactly two subsets of compatible observables can be reduced either to the two-qubit magic square or the three-qubit magic pentagram [N. D. Mermin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 65 , 3373 (1990) ]. An open question is whether there are magic sets that cannot be reduced to the square or the pentagram. If they exist, a second key question is whether they require n &gt; 3 qubits, since, if this is the case, these magic sets would capture minimal state-independent quantum advantage that is specific for n -qubit systems with specific values of n . Here, we answer both questions affirmatively. We identify magic sets that cannot be reduced to the square or the pentagram and require n = 3 , 4, 5, or 6 qubits. In addition, we prove a generalized version of Arkhipov’s theorem providing an efficient algorithm for, given a hypergraph, deciding whether or not it can accommodate a magic set, and solve another open problem, namely, given a magic set, obtaining the tight bound of its associated noncontextuality inequality.},

  abstract     = {We show that, by using a saturable gain g sat , generalized P T ( G P T ) symmetry can be achieved in the intrinsically unbalanced (non- P T -symmetric) high-order wireless power transfer systems. A topology decomposition approach is implemented to analyze the parity of the high-order wireless power transfer systems. In the coupling parametric space, a global G P T -symmetric eigenstate is observed along with the spontaneous phase transition of the local G P T -symmetric eigenstates on the exceptional contour. G P T symmetry guarantees a highly efficient and stable power transfer across the distinct coupling regions, which introduces a new paradigm for a broad range of application scenarios involving asymmetric coupling.},

Density-dependent quorum sensing is one of the mechanisms implicated in biofilm initiation. Here we present and analyze a model for quorum-sensing triggered biofilm initiation. In our model, individual, planktonic bacteria adhere to a surface, proliferate, and undergo a collective transition to a biofilm phenotype. This model predicts a stochastic transition between a loosely attached, finite layer of bacteria near the surface and a growing biofilm. The transition is governed by two key parameters: the collective transition density relative to the carrying capacity and the immigration rate relative to the detachment rate. Biofilm initiation is complex, but our model suggests that stochastic nucleation phenomena may be relevant.},

In this Letter, a quasinormal mode (QNM) expansion theory under the NEBC is proposed. By adopting the easily solved classical QNMs under the classical electromagnetic boundary condition as a complete set of basis functions, rigorous expansions of the nonclassical source-free QNMs and source-excited electromagnetic field under the nonperturbative NEBC are provided. With the obtained nonclassical QNMs as basis functions, expansions of the nonclassical source-excited field and Green’s function tensor are further obtained. These expansions have a fully analytical dependence on the NEBC and classical QNMs, thus transparently unveiling their impact on the nonclassical QNMs and source-excited electromagnetic field. For instance, a new expression of mode volume is proposed for analyzing the nonclassically corrected Purcell factor. The proposed theory is physically intuitive and computationally efficient which is enabled by the dominance of a small set of classical QNMs, thus providing an efficient tool for understanding and designing mesoscale plasmonic nanoresonators.},

Electron spin decoherence due to atomic vibrations (phonons) plays a special role as it sets an intrinsic limit to the performance of spin-based quantum devices. Two main sources of phonon-induced spin decoherence—the Elliott-Yafet and Dyakonov-Perel mechanisms—have distinct physical origins and theoretical treatments. Here, we show calculations that unify their modeling and enable accurate predictions of spin relaxation and precession in semiconductors. We compute the phonon-dressed vertex of the spin-spin correlation function with a treatment analogous to the calculation of the anomalous electron magnetic moment in QED. We find that the vertex correction provides a giant renormalization of the electron spin dynamics in solids, greater by many orders of magnitude than the corresponding correction from photons in vacuum. Our Letter demonstrates a general approach for quantitative analysis of spin decoherence in materials, advancing the quest for spin-based quantum technologies.},

This is normally achieved via applying either hydrostatic pressure or uniaxial strain. We study here a very high-quality, low-density, two-dimensional hole system, confined to a 30-nm-wide (001) GaAs quantum well, in which the two lowest-energy Landau levels can be gate tuned to cross at and near filling factor ν = 1 . As we tune the field position of the crossing from one side of ν = 1 to the other by changing the hole density, the energy gap for the quantum Hall state at ν = 1 remains exceptionally large, and only shows a small dip near the crossing. The gap overall follows a B dependence, expected for the exchange energy. Our data are consistent with a robust quantum Hall ferromagnet as the ground state.},

A specific perturbation splits each bulk massive Dirac cone into two valleys separated in energy-momentum space with opposite second Chern numbers, in which the 3D boundary modes become a nodal sphere or a Weyl semimetallic phase. By introducing the electromagnetic (EM) and pseudo-EM fields, exotic topological responses of our 4D system are revealed, which are found to be described by the ( 4 + 1 ) D mixed Chern-Simons theories in the low-energy regime. Notably, several topological phase transitions occur from a CP -broken Z 2 TI to a Z TI when the bulk gap closes by giving rise to exotic double-nodal-line or nodal-hyper-torus gapless phases. Finally, we propose to probe experimentally these topological effects in cold atoms.},

Understanding the nature of relaxation processes in this dramatic slowdown is key for understanding the glass transition. Here, we show by atomistic simulations that the heterogeneous dynamics of glass-forming liquids strongly correlate with the local residual plastic strengths along soft directions computed in the initial inherent structures. The correlation increases with decreasing temperature and is maximum in the vicinity of the relaxation time. For the lowest temperature investigated, this maximum is comparable with the best values from the literature dealing with the structure-property relationship. However, the nonlinear probe of the local shear resistance in soft directions provides here a real-space picture of relaxation processes. Our detection method of thermal rearrangements allows us to investigate the first passage time statistics and to study the scaling between the activation energy barriers and the residual plastic strengths. These results shed new light on the nature of relaxations of glassy systems by emphasizing the analogy between the thermal relaxations in viscous liquids and the plastic shear transformation in amorphous solids.},

This relation elucidates the origin of previously observed topological spin liquids by directly linking the latter to a deconfined phase of a solvable gauge theory. By means of exact diagonalization and unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the deconfined phases extend in a broad region of the parameter space; these states are characterized by a large ground state overlap with resonating valence bond wave functions. These blockaded models include both creation or annihilation and hopping dynamics, and can be experimentally realized with Rydberg-dressed atoms, offering novel and controllable platforms for the engineering and characterization of spin liquid states.},

In this Letter, we show that in turbulent helical dynamos, the inverse flux of magnetic helicity toward the large scales Π H is bounded by | Π H | ≤ c ε k η − 1 , where ε is the energy injection rate, k η is the Kolmogorov magnetic dissipation wave number, and c an order one constant. Assuming the classical isotropic turbulence scaling, the inverse flux of magnetic helicity Π H decreases at least as a − 3 / 4 power law with the magnetic Reynolds number R m : | Π H | ≤ c ε ℓ f R m − 3 / 4 max [ P m , 1 ] 1 / 4 , where P m is the magnetic Prandtl number and ℓ f the forcing length scale. We demonstrate this scaling with R m using direct numerical simulations of turbulent dynamos forced at intermediate scales. The results further indicate that nonlinear saturation is achieved by a balance between the inverse cascade and dissipation at domain size scales L for which the saturation value of the magnetic energy is bounded by E m ≤ c L ( ε ℓ f ) 2 / 3 R m 1 / 4 max [ 1 , P m ] 1 / 4 . Numerical simulations also demonstrate this bound. These results are independent of the dynamo mechanism considered. In our setup, they imply that inviscid mechanisms cannot explain large scale magnetic fields and have critical implications for the modeling of astrophysical dynamos.},

The improvements are determined from energy spectral measurements of the 2.45 MeV neutrons from the D ( d , n ) He 3 reaction, and the compressed central core B field is estimated to be ∼ 4.9 k T using the 14.1 MeV secondary neutrons from the D ( T , n ) He 4 reactions.

  abstract     = {Shock ignition enables high gain at low implosion velocity, reducing ablative Rayleigh-Taylor instability growth, which can degrade conventional direct drive. With this method, driving a strong shock requires high laser power and intensity, resulting in inefficiencies in the drive and the generation of hot electrons that can preheat the fuel. A new “shock-augmented ignition” pulse shape is described that, by preconditioning the ablation plasma before launching a strong shock, enables the shock ignition of thermonuclear fuel, but importantly, with substantially reduced laser power and intensity requirements. The reduced intensity requirement with respect to shock ignition limits laser-plasma instabilities, such as stimulated Raman and Brillouin scatter, reducing the risk of hot-electron preheat and restoring the laser coupling advantages of conventional direct drive. Simulations indicate that, due to the reduced power requirements, high gain ( ∼ 100 ) ignition of large-scale direct drive implosions (outer radius ∼ 1750 μ m , deuterium-tritium ice thickness ∼ 165 μ m ) may be possible within the power and energy limits of existing facilities such as the National Ignition Facility. Moreover, this concept extends to indirect drive implosions, which exhibit substantial yield increases at reduced implosion velocity. Shock-augmented ignition expands the viable design space of laser inertial fusion.},

The fidelity to a fixed maximally entangled state is limited by the excitonic fine-structure splitting. This work demonstrates that, even if this splitting is absent, the degree of entanglement cannot reach unity when the excitation pulse in a two-photon resonance scheme has a finite duration. The degradation of the entanglement has its origin in a dynamically induced splitting of the exciton states caused by the laser pulse itself. Hence, in the setting explored here, the excitation process limits the achievable concurrence for entangled photons generated in an optically excited four-level quantum emitter.},

When it comes to spatial degrees of freedom, orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes have received widespread attention since they enable encoding with inherent infinite number of dimensions. Although the faithful storage of OAM qubits or qutrits has been realized in previous works, the achieved lifetimes are still on the order of a few microseconds as limited by the spatially dependent decoherence. We here demonstrate a long-lived quantum memory for OAM qutrits by suppressing the decoherence in the transverse and longitude direction simultaneously; the achieved fidelity beats the quantum-classical criteria after a storage time of 400 μ s , which is 2 orders of magnitude longer than earlier works. The present work is promising for establishing high-dimensional quantum networks.},

We bear upon this question in two-dimensional holographic conformal field theories via the quantum null energy condition that we have shown earlier to implement the restrictions imposed by quantum thermodynamics on such many-body systems. We study an explicit encoding of a logical qubit into two similar chirally propagating excitations of finite von Neumann entropy on a finite temperature background whose erasure can be implemented by an appropriate inhomogeneous and instantaneous energy-momentum inflow from an infinite energy memoryless bath due to which the system transits to a thermal state. Holographically, these fast erasure processes can be depicted by generalized AdS-Vaidya geometries described previously in which no assumption of specific form of bulk matter is needed. We show that the quantum null energy condition gives analytic results for the minimal finite temperature needed for the deletion which is larger than the initial background temperature in consistency with Landauer’s principle. In particular, we find a simple expression for the minimum final temperature needed for the erasure of a large number of encoding qubits. We also find that if the encoding qubits are localized over an interval shorter than a specific localization length , then the fast erasure process is impossible, and furthermore this localization length is the largest for an optimal amount of encoding qubits determined by the central charge. We estimate the optimal encoding qubits for realistic protection against fast erasure. We discuss possible generalizations of our study for novel constructions of fault-tolerant quantum gates operating at finite temperature.},

  abstract     = {The nature of dark matter is one of the most important unsolved questions in science. Some dark matter candidates do not have sufficient nongravitational interactions to be probed in laboratory or accelerator experiments. It is thus important to develop astrophysical probes which can constrain or lead to a discovery of such candidates. We illustrate this using state-of-the-art measurements of strong gravitationally lensed quasars to constrain four of the most popular sterile neutrino models, and also report the constraints for other independent methods that are comparable in procedure. First, we derive effective relations to describe the correspondence between the mass of a thermal relic warm dark matter particle and the mass of sterile neutrinos produced via Higgs decay and grand unified theory (GUT)-scale scenarios, in terms of large-scale structure and galaxy formation astrophysical effects. Second, we show that sterile neutrinos produced through the Higgs decay mechanism are allowed only for mass &gt; 26 keV , and GUT-scale scenario &gt; 5.3 keV . Third, we show that the single sterile neutrino model produced through active neutrino oscillations is allowed for mass &gt; 92 keV , and the three sterile neutrino minimal standard model ( ν MSM ) for mass &gt; 16 keV . These are the most stringent experimental limits on these models.},

  abstract     = {Impulsive supernova feedback and nonstandard dark matter models, such as self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), are the two main contenders for the role of the dominant core formation mechanism at the dwarf galaxy scale. Here we show that the impulsive supernova cycles that follow episodes of bursty star formation leave distinct features in the distribution function of stars: groups of stars with similar ages and metallicities develop overdense shells in phase space. If cores are formed through supernova feedback, we predict the presence of such features in star-forming dwarf galaxies with cored host halos. Their systematic absence would favor alternative dark matter models, such as SIDM, as the dominant core formation mechanism.},

  abstract     = {The localization and distance inference of gravitational waves are two crucial factors for dark sirens as precise probes of cosmology, astrophysics, and fundamental physics. In this Letter, for the first time we investigate the parameter estimation of gravitational waves emitted by the eccentric compact binaries in the midfrequency (0.1–10 Hz) band. Based on the configuration of one cluster of DECIGO (B-DECIGO), we simulate five types of typical compact binaries in GWTC-3 with component mass ranging from O ( 1 ∼ 100 ) M ⊙ . For each type of binaries, we assign discrete eccentricities from 0 to 0.4 at 0.1 Hz in 10 3 random orientations. The multiple harmonics induced by eccentricity can break the degeneracy between parameters. We find that with eccentricity e 0 = 0.4 , these typical binaries can achieve O ( 10 2 – 10 4 ) improvement for the distance inference in the near face-on orientations, compared to the circular case. More importantly, a nonvanishing eccentricity (0.01–0.4) can significantly improve the source localization of the typical binary black holes, most by 1.5–3.5 orders of magnitude. Our result shows the remarkable significance of eccentricity for dark sirens in the midband as precise probes of the Universe.},

The topological number defined as the sum of the winding numbers for all the black hole branches at an arbitrary given temperature is found to be a universal number independent of the black hole parameters. Moreover, this topological number only depends on the thermodynamic asymptotic behaviors of the black hole temperature at small and large black hole limits. Different black hole systems are characterized by three classes via this topological number. This number could help us in better understanding the black hole thermodynamics and, further, shed new light on the fundamental nature of quantum gravity.},

In this way the number of entangled pairs that need to be measured and hence destroyed is significantly reduced as compared to previous, even optimal, approaches that operate on individual copies.

  abstract     = {Genuine multipartite entanglement represents the strongest type of entanglement, which is an essential resource for quantum information processing. Standard methods to detect genuine multipartite entanglement, e.g., entanglement witnesses, state tomography, or quantum state verification, require full knowledge of the Hilbert space dimension and precise calibration of measurement devices, which are usually difficult to acquire in an experiment. The most radical way to overcome these problems is to detect entanglement solely based on the Bell-like correlations of measurement outcomes collected in the experiment, namely, device independently. However, it is difficult to certify genuine entanglement of practical multipartite states in this way, and even more difficult to quantify it, due to the difficulty in identifying optimal multipartite Bell inequalities and protocols tolerant to state impurity. In this Letter, we explore a general and robust device-independent method that can be applied to various realistic multipartite quantum states in arbitrary finite dimension, while merely relying on bipartite Bell inequalities. Our method allows us both to certify the presence of genuine multipartite entanglement and to quantify it. Several important classes of entangled states are tested with this method, leading to the detection of genuinely entangled states. We also certify genuine multipartite entanglement in weakly entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, showing that the method applies equally well to less standard states.},

It has been shown that the work cost of preparing a quantum state is determined by its free energy. Considering a similar setting, here we determine the coherence cost of preparing a general state when there are no restrictions on work consumption. More precisely, the coherence cost is defined as the minimum rate of consumption of systems in a pure coherent state, that is needed to prepare copies of the desired system. We show that the coherence cost of any system is determined by its quantum Fisher information about the time parameter, hence introducing a new operational interpretation of this central quantity of quantum metrology.

  abstract     = {In a standard quantum sensing (QS) task one aims at estimating an unknown parameter θ , encoded into an n -qubit probe state, via measurements of the system. The success of this task hinges on the ability to correlate changes in the parameter to changes in the system response R ( θ ) (i.e., changes in the measurement outcomes). For simple cases the form of R ( θ ) is known, but the same cannot be said for realistic scenarios, as no general closed-form expression exists. In this Letter, we present an inference-based scheme for QS. We show that, for a general class of unitary families of encoding, R ( θ ) can be fully characterized by only measuring the system response at 2 n + 1 parameters. This allows us to infer the value of an unknown parameter given the measured response, as well as to determine the sensitivity of the scheme, which characterizes its overall performance. We show that inference error is, with high probability, smaller than δ , if one measures the system response with a number of shots that scales only as Ω ( log 3 ( n ) / δ 2 ) . Furthermore, the framework presented can be broadly applied as it remains valid for arbitrary probe states and measurement schemes, and, even holds in the presence of quantum noise. We also discuss how to extend our results beyond unitary families. Finally, to showcase our method we implement it for a QS task on real quantum hardware, and in numerical simulations.},

This leads to a notion of simulability, where we demand that the statistics obtained from M and an arbitrary quantum state ρ are recovered exactly by first compressing ρ into a lower-dimensional space, followed by some quantum measurements. A full quantum compression is possible, i.e., leaving only classical information, if and only if the set M is jointly measurable. Our notion of simulability can thus be seen as a quantification of measurement incompatibility in terms of dimension. After defining these concepts, we provide an illustrative example involving mutually unbiased bases, and develop a method based on semidefinite programming for constructing simulation models. In turn we analytically construct optimal simulation models for all projective measurements subjected to white noise or losses. Finally, we discuss how our approach connects with other concepts introduced in the context of quantum channels and quantum correlations.},

The ordered state belongs to a new universality class, whose scaling laws we calculate using three different renormalization group schemes, which all give scaling exponents within 0.02 of each other, indicating that our results are quite accurate.

  abstract     = {Centrosymmetric antiferromagnetic semiconductors, although abundant in nature, seem less promising than ferromagnets and ferroelectrics for practical applications in semiconductor spintronics. As a matter of fact, the lack of spontaneous polarization and magnetization hinders the efficient utilization of electronic spin in these materials. Here, we propose a paradigm to harness electronic spin in centrosymmetric antiferromagnets via Zeeman spin splitting of electronic energy levels—termed as the spin Zeeman effect—which is controlled by an electric field. By symmetry analysis, we identify 21 centrosymmetric magnetic point groups that accommodate such a spin Zeeman effect. We further predict by first principles that two antiferromagnetic semiconductors, Fe 2 TeO 6 and SrFe 2 S 2 O , are excellent candidates showcasing Zeeman splittings as large as ∼ 55 and ∼ 30 meV , respectively, induced by an electric field of 6 MV / cm . Moreover, the electronic spin magnetization associated to the splitting energy levels can be switched by reversing the electric field. Our Letter thus sheds light on the electric-field control of electronic spin in antiferromagnets, which broadens the scope of application of centrosymmetric antiferromagnetic semiconductors.},

Using high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, we report a systematic study of the temperature-dependent plasmon behaviors of 1 T − TiSe 2 . We unambiguously resolve the plasmon from phonon modes, revealing the existence of Landau damping to the plasmon at finite momentums, which does not support the plasmon softening picture for exciton condensation. Moreover, we discover that the plasmon lifetime at zero momentum responds dramatically to the band gap evolution associated with the CDW transition. The interband transitions near the Fermi energy in the normal phase are demonstrated to serve as a strong damping channel of plasmons, while such a channel in the CDW phase is suppressed due to the CDW gap opening, which results in the dramatic tunability of the plasmon in semimetals or small-gap semiconductors.},

We report on experimental realization of a hybrid SrIrO 3 / SrTiO 3 superlattice that integrates monolayer and bilayer square lattices in one layered structure. By synchrotron x-ray diffraction, resonant x-ray magnetic scattering, magnetization, and resistivity measurements, we found that the hybrid superlattice exhibits properties that are distinct from both the single-layer and bilayer systems and cannot be explained by a simple addition of them. In particular, the entire hybrid superlattice orders simultaneously through a single antiferromagnetic transition at temperatures similar to the bilayer system but with all the J eff = 1 / 2 moments mainly pointing in the a b plane similar to the single-layer system. The results show that bringing monolayer and bilayer with orthogonal properties in proximity to each other in a hybrid superlattice structure is a powerful way to stabilize a unique state not obtainable in a uniform structure.},

In the parent compound BaFe 2 As 2 we observe a strain-induced suppression of the nematic susceptibility which follows the expected behavior of an Ising order parameter under a symmetry breaking field. For the superconducting compound, the suppression of the nematic susceptibility correlates with the decrease of the critical temperature T c , indicating a significant contribution of nematic fluctuations to electron pairing. Our results validate theoretical scenarios of enhanced T c near a nematic quantum critical point.},

Because the sublattice polarizability is mainly contributed by interband fluctuations, superconductivity occurs over a wide range of filling fraction. It is suppressed by (i) applying a sublattice polarizing field (generated by an aligned BN substrate) or (ii) changing moiré band filling to favor valley polarization. The enhanced intrasublattice attraction close to sublattice polarization instability is analogous to enhanced like-spin attraction in liquid He 3 near the melting curve and the enhanced valley-singlet repulsion close to valley-polarization instabilities is analogous to enhanced spin-singlet repulsion in metals that are close to a ferromagnetic instability.

  abstract     = {In the second-order response regime, the Hall voltage can be nonzero without time-reversal symmetry breaking but inversion symmetry breaking. Multiple mechanisms contribute to the nonlinear Hall effect. The disorder-related contributions can enter the NLHE in the leading role, but experimental investigations are scarce, especially the exploration of the contributions from different disorder sources. Here, we report a giant nonlinear response in twisted bilayer graphene, dominated by disorder-induced skew scattering. The magnitude and direction of the second-order nonlinearity can be effectively tuned by the gate voltage. A peak value of the second-order Hall conductivity reaching 8.76 μ m SV − 1 is observed close to the full filling of the moiré band, four order larger than the intrinsic contribution detected in WTe 2 . The scaling shows that the giant second-order nonlinear Hall effect in twisted bilayer graphene stems from the collaboration of the static (impurities) and dynamic (phonons) disorders. It is mainly determined by the impurity skew scattering at 1.7 K. The phonon skew scattering, however, has a much larger coupling coefficient, and becomes comparable to the impurity contribution as the temperature rises. Our observations provide a comprehensive experimental understanding of the disorder-related mechanisms in the nonlinear Hall effect.},

Here, we show that incorporating a photonic crystal pattern in an integrated microring can result in WGMs with fractional optical angular momentum. By choosing the photonic crystal periodicity to open a photonic band gap with a band-edge momentum lying between that of two WGMs of the unperturbed ring, we observe hybridized WGMs with half-integer quantized angular momentum numbers ( m ∈ Z + 1 / 2 ). Moreover, we show that these modes with fractional angular momenta exhibit high optical quality factors with good cavity-waveguide coupling and an order of magnitude reduced group velocity. Additionally, by introducing multiple artificial defects, multiple modes can be localized to small volumes within the ring, while the relative orientation of the delocalized band-edge states can be well controlled. Our Letter unveils the renormalization of WGMs by the photonic crystal, demonstrating novel fractional angular momentum states and nontrivial multimode orientation control arising from continuous rotational symmetry breaking. The findings are expected to be useful for sensing and metrology, nonlinear optics, and cavity quantum electrodynamics.},

On top of the conventional first-order self-consistent phonon (SC1) dynamical matrix, the proposed method incorporates frequency renormalization effects by the bubble self-energy within the QP approximation. We apply the developed methodology to the strongly anharmonic α − CsPbBr 3 that displays phonon instability within the harmonic approximation in the whole Brillouin zone. While the SC1 theory significantly underestimates the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition temperature ( T c ) by more than 50\%, we show that our approach yields T c = 404 – 423 K , in excellent agreement with the experimental value of 403 K. We also demonstrate that an accurate determination of QP peaks is paramount for quantitative prediction and elucidation of the phonon linewidth.},

  abstract     = {The anomalous Hall effect has had a profound influence on the understanding of many electronic topological materials but is much less studied in their bosonic counterparts. We predict that an intrinsic anomalous Hall effect exists in a recently realized bosonic chiral superfluid, a p -orbital Bose-Einstein condensate in a 2D hexagonal boron nitride optical lattice [Wang et al. , Nature (London) 596 , 227 (2021) ]. We evaluate the frequency-dependent Hall conductivity within a multi-orbital Bose-Hubbard model that accurately captures the real experimental system. We find that in the high frequency limit, the Hall conductivity is determined by finite loop current correlations on the s -orbital residing sublattice, the latter a defining feature of the system’s chirality. In the opposite limit, the dc Hall conductivity can trace its origin back to the noninteracting band Berry curvature at the condensation momentum, although the contribution from atomic interactions can be significant. We discuss available experimental probes to observe this intrinsic anomalous Hall effect at both zero and finite frequencies.},

  abstract     = {We consider theoretically the nonlinear quantized Thouless pumping of a Bose-Einstein condensate loaded in two-dimensional dynamical optical lattices. We encountered three different scenarios of the pumping: a quasilinear one occurring for gradually dispersing wave packets, transport carried by a single two-dimensional soliton, and a multisoliton regime when the initial wave packet splits into several solitons. The scenario to be realized depends on the number of atoms in the initial wave packet and on the strength of the two-body interactions. The magnitude and direction of the displacement of a wave packet are determined by Chern numbers of the populated energy bands and by the interband transitions induced by two-body interactions. As a case example we explore a separable potential created by optical lattices whose constitutive sublattices undergo relative motion in the orthogonal directions. For such potentials, obeying parity-time symmetry, fractional Chern numbers, computed over half period of the evolution, acquire relevance. We focus mainly on solitonic scenarios, showing that one-soliton pumping occurs at relatively small as well as at sufficiently large amplitudes of the initial wave packet, while at intermediate amplitudes the transport is multisolitonic. We also describe peculiarities of the pumping characterized by two different commensurate periods of the modulations of the lattices in the orthogonal directions.},

A formalism for deriving the semiclassical model directly from the quantum Hamiltonian is developed here. Working in a displaced Fock-state basis | α , n ⟩ , the semiclassical limit is obtained by taking | α | → ∞ and the coupling to zero. This resolves the discrepancy between coherent-state dynamics and semiclassical Rabi oscillations in both standard and ultrastrong coupling and driving regimes. Furthermore, it provides a framework for studying the quantum-to-semiclassical transition, with potential applications in quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {We map a quantum Rabi ring, consisting of N cavities arranged in a ring geometry, into an effective magnetic model containing the X Y exchange and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions. The analog of the latter is induced by an artificial magnetic field, which modulates photon hopping between nearest-neighbor cavities with a phase. This mapping facilitates the description and understanding of the different phases in the quantum optical model through simple arguments of competing magnetic interactions. For the square geometry ( N = 4 ) the rich phase diagram exhibits three superradiant phases denoted as ferro-superradiant, antiferro-superradiant, and chiral superradiant. In particular, the DM interaction is responsible for the chiral phase in which the energetically degenerate configurations of the order parameters are similar to the in-plane magnetizations of skyrmions with different helicities. The antiferro-superradiant phase is suppressed in the triangle geometry ( N = 3 ) as geometric frustration contributes to stabilize the chiral phase even for small values of the DM interaction. The chiral phases for odd and even N show a different scaling behavior close to the phase transition. The equivalent behavior on both systems opens the possibility of simulating chiral magnetism in a few-body quantum optical platform, as well as understanding one system using the insights gained from the other.},

We first demonstrate a key signature dependence of the entangled two-photon absorption rate on the type of entangled pair flux attenuation: linear, when the laser pump power is attenuated, and quadratic, when the pair flux itself experiences linear loss. We then perform a fluorescence-based Z -scan measurement to study the influence of beam waist size on the entangled two-photon absorption process and compare this to classical single- and two-photon absorption processes. We demonstrate that the entangled two-photon absorption shares a beam waist dependence similar to that of classical two-photon absorption.

The spectral structure of the intense self-amplified spontaneous emission free-electron laser pulses has been resolved on a single-shot level to allow for post selection of pulses, leading to an enhanced spectral resolution, and introducing a new experimental method. The measured angular distribution is directly compared to state-of-the-art theory based on multichannel quantum defect theory and the streamlined R -matrix method.

We illustrate and describe the physical origin of a previously unexplored phenomenon in the adiabatic alignment dynamics of molecules, which is fundamentally interesting and also has an important practical implication. Specifically, the intensity dependence of the degree of adiabatic alignment exhibits a threshold behavior, below which molecules are isotropically distributed rotationally and above which the alignment rapidly reaches a plateau. Furthermore, we show that both the intensity and the temperature dependencies of the alignment of all linear molecules exhibit universal curves and derive analytical forms to describe these dependencies. Finally, we illustrate that the alignment threshold occurs very generally at a lower intensity than the off-resonance ionization threshold, a numerical observation that is readily illustrated analytically. The threshold behavior is attributed to a tunneling mechanism that rapidly switches off at the threshold intensity, where tunneling between the potential wells corresponding to the two orientations of the aligned molecules becomes impossible. The universal threshold behavior of molecular alignment is a simple phenomenon, but one that was not realized before and can be readily tested experimentally.},

Our approach capitalizes on nonlocal correlations in curved spacetime quantum field theory, allowing us to formulate a metric for spacetime superpositions as well as characterizing the coupling of particle detectors to a quantum field. We apply our approach to analyze the dynamics of a detector (using the Unruh-deWitt model) in a spacetime generated by a Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole in a superposition of masses. We find that the detector exhibits signatures of quantum-gravitational effects corroborating and extending Bekenstein’s seminal conjecture concerning the quantized mass spectrum of black holes in quantum gravity. Crucially, this result follows directly from our approach, without any additional assumptions about the black hole mass properties.},

  abstract     = {Fully general-relativistic binary-neutron-star (BNS) merger simulations with quark-hadron crossover (QHC) equations of state (EOS) are studied for the first time. In contrast to EOS with purely hadronic matter or with a first-order quark-hadron phase transition (1PT), in the transition region QHC EOS show a peak in sound speed and thus a stiffening. We study the effects of such stiffening in the merger and postmerger gravitational (GW) signals. Through simulations in the binary-mass range 2.5 &lt; M / M ⊙ &lt; 2.75 , characteristic differences due to different EOS appear in the frequency of the main peak of the postmerger GW spectrum ( f 2 ), extracted through Bayesian inference. In particular, we found that (i) for lower-mass binaries, since the maximum baryon number density ( n max ) after the merger stays below 3–4 times the nuclear-matter density ( n 0 ), the characteristic stiffening of the QHC models in that density range results in a lower f 2 than that computed for the underlying hadronic EOS and thus also than that for EOS with a 1PT; (ii) for higher-mass binaries, where n max may exceed 4 – 5 n 0 depending on the EOS model, whether f 2 in QHC models is higher or lower than that in the underlying hadronic model depends on the height of the sound-speed peak. Comparing the values of f 2 for different EOS and BNS masses gives important clues on how to discriminate different types of quark dynamics in the high-density end of EOS and is relevant to future kilohertz GW observations with third-generation GW detectors.},

The superconducting qubit is based upon a π -periodic Josephson junction realized with gate-tunable semiconducting wires, where the tunneling of individual Cooper pairs is suppressed. One of the wires additionally contains four Majorana zero modes that define a qubit. We demonstrate that this enables the implementation of a SWAP gate, allowing for the transduction of quantum information between the topological and conventional qubit. This architecture combines fast gates, which can be realized with the superconducting qubit, with a topologically protected Majorana memory.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites (2DHPs) are natural quantum-well-like materials, in which strong quantum and dielectric confinement effects due to the organic spacers give rise to tightly bound excitons with large binding energy. To examine the mutual interactions between the organic spacer cations and the inorganic charge-residing octahedral framework in 2DHPs, here we perform femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy by direct vibrational pumping of the organic spacers, followed by a visible-to-ultraviolet probe covering their excitonic resonances. Measurements on prototypical lead-bromide based 2DHP compounds, ( BA ) 2 PbBr 4 and ( BA ) 2 ( FA ) Pb 2 Br 7 ( BA + = butylammonium ; FA + = formamidinium ), reveal two distinct regimes of the temporal response. The first regime is dominated by a pump-induced transient expansion of the organic spacer layers that reduces the exciton oscillator strength, whereas the second regime arises from pump-induced lattice heating effects primarily associated with a spectral shift of the exciton energy. In addition, vibrational excitation enhances the biexciton emission, which we attribute to a stronger intralayer exciton confinement as well as vibrationally induced exciton detrapping from defect states. Our study provides fundamental insights regarding the impact of organic spacers on excitons in 2DHPs, as well as the excited-state dynamics and vibrational energy dissipation in these structurally diverse materials.},

We find a perfectly chiral gapless edge mode and a rapid decay of correlation functions at short distances consistent with a bulk gap, concomitant with a gossamer long-range tail originating from a PEPS bulk-edge correspondence. For increasing bond dimension, (i) the rapid decrease of spurious features—SU(2) symmetry breaking and long-range tails in correlations—together with (ii) a faster convergence of the ground state energy as compared to state-of-the-art cylinder matrix-product state simulations involving far more variational parameters, prove the fundamental relevance of the PEPS ansatz for simulating systems with chiral topological order.},

A condensate is called “fragmented” if not a single, but multiple states are macroscopically occupied. While fragmentation is known to occur in particular Bose-Einstein condensates, we propose that fragmentation naturally takes place in striped superconductors. To this end, we investigate the nature of the superconducting ground state realized in the two-dimensional t − t ′ − J model. In the presence of charge density modulations, the condensate is shown to be fragmented and composed of partial condensates located on the stripes. The fragments of the condensates hybridize to form an extended macroscopic wave function across the system. The results are obtained from evaluating the singlet-pairing two-particle density matrix of the ground state on finite cylinders computed via the density matrix renormalization group method. Our results shed light on the intricate relation between stripe order and superconductivity in systems of strongly correlated electrons.},

We show that, when the conserved quantities are given as the Noether charges associated with internal symmetries or the Hamiltonian itself, the corresponding persistent currents can be bounded by a correlation function of two operators at a distance proportional to the system size, implying that they decay at least algebraically as the system size increases. In contrast, the persistent currents of accidentally conserved quantities can be nonzero even in the thermodynamic limit and even in the presence of the time-reversal symmetry.

Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe that Dirac node replicas move closer and finally overlap with a gap opening, as the moiré pattern expands to + ∞ and evolves into a Kekulé distortion. A moiré Hamiltonian coupling Dirac fermions from different valleys explains experimental results and indicates narrow moiré band. Our Letter demonstrates a platform to study continuous evolution of the moiré pattern, and provides an unprecedented approach for tailoring Dirac fermions with tunable intervalley coupling.},

  abstract     = {Functional defects in periodic media confine waves—acoustic, electromagnetic, electronic, spin, etc.—in various dimensions, depending on the structure of the defect. While defects are usually modeled by a superlattice with a typical band-structure representation of energy levels, determining the confinement associated with a given band is highly nontrivial and no analytical method is known to date. Therefore, we propose a rigorous method to classify the dimensionality of wave confinement. Starting from the confinement energy and the mode volume, we use finite-size scaling to find that ratios of these quantities raised to certain powers yield the confinement dimensionality of each band. Our classification has negligible additional computational costs compared to a band structure calculation and is valid for any type of wave, both quantum and classical, and in any dimension. In the quantum regime, we illustrate our method on electronic confinement in 2D hexagonal boron nitride (BN) with a nitrogen vacancy, in agreement with previous results. In the classical case, we study a three-dimensional photonic band gap cavity superlattice, where we identify novel acceptorlike behavior. We briefly discuss the generalization to quasiperiodic lattices.},

We measure the temperature of the onset of the motion, relevant to the long term storage of radioactive elements. We demonstrate the unique behavior of silver in soda-lime glass, enabling a thermal battery with rapid discharge of stored energy above a threshold temperature. We show that the Meyer-Neldel rule applies when comparisons of temperature-dependent diffusion rates are made between related measurements on one sample or between the same measurements on related samples. The results support a thermodynamic interpretation of the Meyer-Neldel rule as an enthalpy-entropy correlation where the Meyer-Neldel temperature ( T MN ) is the temperature that enables liquidlike, barrier-free motion of the ions, with an upper limit set by the melting point of the host medium. This interpretation explains the observed reduction in T MN by built-in electric fields in depletion layers and why the upper limit for T MN for all ions is set by the glass transition temperature.},

We show that at the depinning threshold, due to symmetry breaking caused by the direction of the driving force, elastic interfaces with local, long-range, and mean-field elasticity exhibit asymmetric roughness. It is manifested as a skewed distribution of the local interface heights, and can be quantified by using detrended fluctuation analysis to compute a spectrum of local, segment-level scaling exponents. The asymmetry is observed as approximately linear dependence of the local scaling exponents on the difference of the segment height from the mean interface height.},

  abstract     = {Acoustic meta-atoms serve as the building blocks of metamaterials, with linear properties designed to achieve functions such as beam steering, cloaking, and focusing. They have also been used to shape the characteristics of incident acoustic fields, which led to the manipulation of acoustic radiation force and torque for development of acoustic tweezers with improved spatial resolution. However, acoustic radiation force and torque also depend on the shape of the object, which strongly affects its scattering properties. We show that by designing linear properties of an object using metamaterial concepts, the nonlinear acoustic effects of radiation force and torque can be controlled. Trapped objects are typically small compared with the wavelength, and are described as particles, inducing monopole and dipole scattering. We extend such models to a polarizability tensor including Willis coupling terms, as a measure of asymmetry, capturing the significance of geometrical features. We apply our model to a three-dimensional, subwavelength meta-atom with maximal Willis coupling, demonstrating that the force and the torque can be reversed relative to an equivalent symmetrical particle. By considering shape asymmetry in the acoustic radiation force and torque, Gorkov’s fundamental theory of acoustophoresis is thereby extended. Asymmetrical shapes influence the acoustic fields by shifting the stable trapping location, highlighting a potential for tunable, shape-dependent particle sorting.},

  abstract     = {Quantum-correlated biphoton states play an important role in quantum communication and processing, especially considering the recent advances in integrated photonics. However, it remains a challenge to flexibly transport quantum states on a chip, when dealing with large-scale sophisticated photonic designs. The equivalence between certain aspects of quantum optics and solid-state physics makes it possible to utilize a range of powerful approaches in photonics, including topologically protected boundary states, graphene edge states, and dynamic localization. Optical dynamic localization allows efficient protection of classical signals in photonic systems by implementing an analogue of an external alternating electric field. Here, we report on the observation of dynamic localization for quantum-correlated biphotons, including both the generation and the propagation aspects. As a platform, we use sinusoidal waveguide arrays with cubic nonlinearity. We record biphoton coincidence count rates as evidence of robust generation of biphotons and demonstrate the dynamic localization features in both spatial and temporal space by analyzing the quantum correlation of biphotons at the output of the waveguide array. Experimental results demonstrate that various dynamic modulation parameters are effective in protecting quantum states without introducing complex topologies. Our Letter opens new avenues for studying complex physical processes using photonic chips and provides an alternative mechanism of protecting communication channels and nonclassical quantum sources in large-scale integrated quantum optics.},

We employ photonic waveguide arrays to demonstrate the topological phase transitions based on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. By measuring the survival probability at the lattice boundary, we show that in the long-time limit, the survival probability is P = ( 1 − e − 2 / ξ loc ) 2 , where ξ loc is the localization length. This length derived from the survival probability is compared with the distance from the transition point, yielding a critical exponent of ν = 0.94 ± 0.04 at the phase boundary.

However, it was recently suggested that long-lived Rydberg states can play a particularly important role in high harmonic generation by atoms driven by the combination of the counterrotating circularly polarized fundamental light field and its second harmonic. Here we report direct experimental evidence of very long and stable Rydberg trajectories contributing to high-harmonic generation in such fields. We track their dynamics inside the laser pulse using the spin-orbit evolution in the ionic core, utilizing the spin-orbit Larmor clock. We confirm their effect on harmonic emission both via microscopic simulations and by showing how this radiation can lead to a well-collimated macroscopic far-field signal. Our observations contrast sharply with the general view that long-lived Rydberg orbits should generate negligible contribution to the macroscopic far-field high harmonic response of the medium.},

Two distinct deflection angles are observed in the photoelectron angular distribution in the molecular frame, corresponding to the direct and resonant ionization pathways. We find the electron is temporally trapped in the Coulomb potential wells of the Ar − Kr + before finally releasing into the continuum when the electron tunnels through the internal barrier. By utilizing the direct tunneling ionization as a self-referenced arm of the attoclock, the time delay of the electron trapped in the resonant state is revealed to be 3.50 ± 0.04 fs .

  abstract     = {The β -delayed one- and two-neutron emission probabilities ( P 1 n and P 2 n ) of 20 neutron-rich nuclei with N ≥ 82 have been measured at the RIBF facility of the RIKEN Nishina Center. P 1 n of Ag 130 , 131 , Cd 133 , 134 , In 135 , 136 , and Sn 138 , 139 were determined for the first time, and stringent upper limits were placed on P 2 n for nearly all cases. β -delayed two-neutron emission ( β 2 n ) was unambiguously identified in Cd 133 and In 135 , 136 , and their P 2 n were measured. Weak β 2 n was also detected from Sn 137 , 138 . Our results highlight the effect of the N = 82 and Z = 50 shell closures on β -delayed neutron emission probability and provide stringent benchmarks for newly developed macroscopic-microscopic and self-consistent global models with the inclusion of a statistical treatment of neutron and γ emission. The impact of our measurements on r -process nucleosynthesis was studied in a neutron star merger scenario. Our P 1 n and P 2 n have a direct impact on the odd-even staggering of the final abundance, improving the agreement between calculated and observed Solar System abundances. The odd isotope fraction of Ba in r -process-enhanced ( r − II ) stars is also better reproduced using our new data.},

In many models, the mixing with the hypercharge gauge boson captures only part of the kinetic mixing term with the photon, since the new gauge bosons can also mix with the neutral component of the SU ( 2 ) L gauge bosons. We take these contributions into account and present a consistent description of kinetic mixing for general Abelian gauge groups both in the electroweak symmetric and the broken phase. We identify an effective operator that captures the kinetic mixing with SU ( 2 ) L and demonstrate how renormalizable contributions arise if the charged fields only obtain their masses from electroweak symmetry breaking. For the first time, a low-energy theorem for the couplings of novel Abelian gauge bosons with the standard model Higgs boson is derived from the one-loop kinetic mixing amplitudes.},

In the quantum regime, however, this elementary principle should be amended as the system energy cannot be sharply determined at a given quantum phase space point. In this Letter, we propose and experimentally test a quantum generalization of the microscopic reversibility when a quantum system interacts with a heat bath through energy-preserving unitary dynamics. Quantum effects can be identified by noting that the backward process is less likely to happen in the existence of quantum coherence between the system’s energy eigenstates. The experimental demonstration has been realized by mixing coherent and thermal states in a beam splitter, followed by heterodyne detection in an optical setup. We verify that the quantum modification for the principle of microscopic reversibility is critical in the low-temperature limit, while the quantum-to-classical transition is observed as the temperature of the thermal field gets higher.},

In this Letter, we uncover the close relation between this perspective on ETH and free probability theory, as applied to a thermal ensemble or an energy shell. This mathematical framework allows one to reduce in a straightforward way higher-order correlation functions to a decomposition given by minimal blocks, identified as free cumulants, for which we give an explicit formula. This perspective naturally incorporates the consistency property that local functions of ETH operators also satisfy ETH. The present results uncover a direct connection between the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and the structure of free probability, widening considerably the latter’s scope and highlighting its relevance to quantum thermalization.},

  abstract     = {The operation of near-term quantum technologies requires the development of feasible, implementable, and robust strategies of controlling complex many body systems. To this end, a variety of techniques, so-called “shortcuts to adiabaticity,” have been developed. Many of these shortcuts have already been demonstrated to be powerful and implementable in distinct scenarios. Yet, it is often also desirable to have additional, approximate strategies available that are applicable to a large class of systems. Hence, in this Letter, we take inspiration from thermodynamics and propose to focus on the macrostate, rather than the microstate. Adiabatic dynamics can then be identified as such processes that preserve the equation of state, and systematic corrections are obtained from adiabatic perturbation theory. We demonstrate this approach by improving upon fast quasiadiabatic driving, and by applying the method to the quantum Ising chain in the transverse field.},

Seeking to understand their effect on the long-time dynamics, we numerically study a stochastic cellular automaton evolution that obeys such symmetries. We prove that, in one dimension, the periodically modulated symmetries lead to a diffusive scaling of correlations modulated by a finite microscopic momentum. In higher dimensions, these symmetries take the form of lines and surfaces of conserved momenta. These give rise to exotic forms of subdiffusive behavior with a rich spatial structure influenced by lattice-scale features. Exponential modulation, on the other hand, can lead to correlations that are infinitely long-lived at the boundary while decaying exponentially in the bulk.},

We study the OE of the density matrix of 1D many-body models undergoing dissipative evolution. It is expected that, after an initial linear growth reminiscent of unitary quench dynamics, the OE should be suppressed by dissipative processes as the system evolves to a simple stationary state. Surprisingly, we find that this scenario breaks down for one of the most fundamental dissipative mechanisms: dephasing. Under dephasing, after the initial “rise and fall,” the OE can rise again, increasing logarithmically at long times. Using a combination of MPO simulations for chains of infinite length and analytical arguments valid for strong dephasing, we demonstrate that this growth is inherent to a U(1) conservation law. We argue that in an X X Z spin model and a Bose-Hubbard model the OE grows universally as 1 4 log 2 t at long times and as 1 2 log 2 t for a Fermi-Hubbard model. We trace this behavior back to anomalous classical diffusion processes.},

Using the NRG results obtained from realistic parameters as input for a semiclassical simulation for a large QD ensemble, we demonstrate that the experimentally reported phase shifts in the coherent spin dynamics between single- and two-color laser pumping can be reproduced by our model, solving a long-standing open problem of the microscopic origin of the inter-QD electron spin-spin interaction.},

  abstract     = {We propose a novel approach based on the subcycle injection of carriers to extend the high-energy cutoff in solid-state high harmonics. The mechanism is first examined by employing the standard single-cell semiconductor Bloch equation (SC SBE) method for one-dimensional (1D) Mathieu potential model for ZnO subjected to the intense linearly polarized midinfrared laser field and extreme-ultraviolet pulse. Then, we use coupled solution of Maxwell propagation equation and SC SBE to propagate the fundamental laser field through the sample, and find that the high-harmonics pulse train from the entrance section of the sample can inject carriers to the conduction bands with attosecond timing, subsequently leading to a dramatic extension of high-energy cutoff in harmonics from the backside. We predict that for a peak intensity at 2 × 10 11 W / cm 2 , as a result of the self-seeding, the high-energy cutoff shifts from 20th (7.75 eV) order to around 50th (19.38 eV) order harmonics.},

  abstract     = {The everlasting interest in spin chains is mostly rooted in the fact that they generally allow for comparisons between theory and experiment with remarkable accuracy, especially for exactly solvable models. A notable example is the spin- 1 2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain (AFHC), which can be well described by the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid theory and exhibits fractionalized spinon excitations with distinct thermodynamic and spectroscopic experimental signatures consistent with theoretical predictions. A missing piece, however, is the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the spinon heat transport in AFHC systems, due to difficulties in its experimental evaluation against the backdrop of other heat carriers and complex scattering processes. Here we address this situation by performing ultralow-temperature thermal conductivity measurements on a nearly ideal spin- 1 2 AFHC system copper benzoate Cu ( C 6 H 5 COO ) 2 · 3 H 2 O , whose field-dependent spin excitation gap enables a reliable extraction of the spinon thermal conductivity κ s at zero field. κ s was found to exhibit a linear temperature dependence κ s ∼ T at low temperatures, with κ s / T as large as 1.70 mW cm − 1 K − 2 , followed by a precipitate decline below ∼ 0.3 K . The observed κ s ∼ T clarifies the discrepancies between various spin chain systems and serves as a benchmark for one-dimensional spinon heat transport in the low-temperature limit. The abrupt loss of κ s with no corresponding anomaly in the specific heat is discussed in the context of many-body localization.},

Concretely, we consider the PDW superconductivity on a hexagonal lattice with nested FS at 3 / 4 electron filling, which is related to a recently discovered superconductor CsV 3 Sb 5 . Because of nesting of the FSs, each momentum k on the FS has at least two counterparts − k ± Q α ( α = 1 , 2, 3) on the FS to form finite momentum ( ± Q α ) Cooper pairs, resulting in a TRS and inversion broken PDW state with stable Bogoliubov Fermi pockets. Various spectra, including (local) density of states, electron spectral function, and the effect of quasiparticle interference, have been investigated. The partial melting of the PDW will give rise to 4 × 4 and ( 4 / 3 ) × ( 4 / 3 ) charge density wave (CDW) orders, in addition to the 2 × 2 CDW. Possible implications to real materials such as CsV 3 Sb 5 and future experiments have been discussed further.},

We theoretically study the partition and collision of two interacting hot electrons at a potential barrier. We predict their kinetic energy change by their Coulomb interaction during the scattering delay time inside the barrier. The energy change results in characteristic deviation of the partition probabilities from the noninteracting case. The derivation includes nonmonotonic dependence of the probabilities on the barrier height, which qualitatively agrees with recent experiments, and reduction of the fermionic antibunching.},

Spin mapping across steps of unit cell height demonstrates the existence of spin-polarized electrons with an antiferromagnetic stacking order. We further uncover the correlation between antiferromagnetism and charge order anisotropy, highlighting the unusual magnetic coupling of the charge order. Finally, we detect a pronounced edge state within the charge order energy gap, which is robust against the irregular shape fluctuations of the kagome lattice edges.

In the solar wind, in situ magnetic field measurements reveal the presence of cyclotron waves, while measured ion velocity distribution functions have hinted at the active presence of cyclotron resonance. Here, we present Parker Solar Probe observations that connect the presence of ion-cyclotron waves directly to signatures of resonant damping in observed proton-velocity distributions using the framework of quasilinear theory. We show that the quasilinear evolution of the observed distribution functions should absorb the observed cyclotron wave population with a heating rate of 10 − 14 W / m 3 , indicating significant heating of the solar wind.},

The observations can be qualitatively captured by a phenomenological model simply involving diffusion and two-body collisional loss, in which the vortex lifetime is mostly determined by the slower process of the two. In particular, the counterintuitive vortex decay in the BCS regime can be interpreted by considering the competition between the temperature dependence of the vortex annihilation rate and that of unpaired fermions. Our results suggest a competing mechanism for the complex vortex decay dynamics in the BCS-BEC crossover for the fermionic superfluids.},

This is the first measurement of entanglement in an OPO with a χ ( 3 ) media above threshold. We reconstruct the covariance matrix for several configurations and based on a full picture of the four side band mode state, we study entanglement between all possible bipartitions. We show a robust generation of entanglement with stronger generation for a specific pair of modes. For this system, we show that atomic density is a determinant factor for the generation and loss of quantum correlations. The generation of entangled fields with an atomic OPO operating close to atomic resonance of alkali atoms enables a natural integration into quantum networks.},

While many such constraints have been derived for standard model coupling constants and masses, the θ ¯ parameter of QCD has not been as extensively examined. In this Letter, we discuss potentially promising paths to investigate the time dependence of the θ ¯ parameter. While laboratory searches for C P -violating signals of θ ¯ yield the most robust bounds on today’s value of θ ¯ , we show that C P -conserving effects provide constraints on the variation of θ ¯ over cosmological timescales. We find no evidence for a variation of θ ¯ that could have implied an “iron-deficient” Universe at higher redshifts. By converting recent atomic clock constraints on a variation of constants, we infer d ( θ ¯ 2 ) / d t ≤ 6 × 10 − 15 yr − 1 , at 1 σ . Finally, we also sketch an axion model that results in a varying θ ¯ and could lead to excess diffuse gamma ray background, from decays of axions produced in high redshift supernova explosions.},

In QED, while there is no conserved Noether current for the U ( 1 ) A axial symmetry because of the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly, for every rational angle 2 π p / N , we construct a conserved and gauge-invariant topological symmetry operator. Intuitively, it is a composition of the axial rotation and a fractional quantum Hall state coupled to the electromagnetic U(1) gauge field. These conserved symmetry operators do not obey a group multiplication law, but a noninvertible fusion algebra. They act invertibly on all local operators as axial rotations, but noninvertibly on the ’t Hooft lines. We further generalize our construction to QCD, and show that the coupling π 0 F ∧ F in the effective pion Lagrangian is necessary to match these noninvertible symmetries in the UV. Therefore, the conventional argument for the neutral pion decay using the ABJ anomaly is now rephrased as a matching condition of a generalized global symmetry.},

Floquet engineering provides an effective way to tune the coupling strength between nearby qubits, which is used to demonstrate quantum walks with tunable couplings, reversed time evolution, and the measurement of OTOCs. A clear light-cone-like operator propagation is observed in the system with multiple excitations, and has a nearly equal velocity as the single-particle quantum walk. For the butterfly operator that is nonlocal (local) under the Jordan-Wigner transformation, the OTOCs show distinct behaviors with (without) a signature of information scrambling in the near integrable system.},

  abstract     = {Continuous-time quantum walks provide a natural framework to tackle the fundamental problem of finding a node among a set of marked nodes in a graph, known as spatial search. Whether spatial search by continuous-time quantum walk provides a quadratic advantage over classical random walks has been an outstanding problem. Thus far, this advantage is obtained only for specific graphs or when a single node of the underlying graph is marked. In this Letter, we provide a new continuous-time quantum walk search algorithm that completely resolves this: our algorithm can find a marked node in any graph with any number of marked nodes, in a time that is quadratically faster than classical random walks. The overall algorithm is quite simple, requiring time evolution of the quantum walk Hamiltonian followed by a projective measurement. A key component of our algorithm is a purely analogue procedure to perform operations on a state of the form e − t H 2 | ψ ⟩ , which, for a given Hamiltonian H , only requires evolving H for time scaling as t . This allows us to quadratically fast-forward the dynamics of a continuous-time classical random walk. The applications of our Letter thus go beyond the realm of quantum walks and can lead to new analog quantum algorithms for preparing ground states of Hamiltonians or solving optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Non-Abelian gauge theories underlie our understanding of fundamental forces in nature, and developing tailored quantum hardware and algorithms to simulate them is an outstanding challenge in the rapidly evolving field of quantum simulation. Here we take an approach where gauge fields, discretized in spacetime, are represented by qudits and are time evolved in Trotter steps with multiqudit quantum gates. This maps naturally and hardware efficiently to an architecture based on Rydberg tweezer arrays, where long-lived internal atomic states represent qudits, and the required quantum gates are performed as holonomic operations supported by a Rydberg blockade mechanism. We illustrate our proposal for a minimal digitization of SU(2) gauge fields, demonstrating a significant reduction in circuit depth and gate errors in comparison to a traditional qubit-based approach, which puts simulations of non-Abelian gauge theories within reach of NISQ devices.},

  abstract     = {It has long been realized that even a perfectly clean electronic system harbors a Landauer-Sharvin resistance, inversely proportional to the number of its conduction channels. This resistance is usually associated with voltage drops on the system’s contacts to an external circuit. Recent theories have shown that hydrodynamic effects can reduce this resistance, raising the question of the lower bound of resistance of hydrodynamic electrons. Here, we show that by a proper choice of device geometry, it is possible to spread the Landauer-Sharvin resistance throughout the bulk of the system, allowing its complete elimination by electron hydrodynamics. We trace the effect to the dynamics of electrons flowing in channels that terminate within the sample. For ballistic systems this termination leads to back-reflection of the electrons and creates resistance. Hydrodynamically, the scattering of these electrons off other electrons allows them to transfer to transmitted channels and avoid the resistance. Counterintuitively, we find that in contrast to the ohmic regime, for hydrodynamic electrons the resistance of a device with a given width can decrease with its length, suggesting that a long enough device may have an arbitrarily small total resistance.},

In a system with antiferromagnetic correlations, the HHG signal is drastically enhanced with decreasing temperature, even though the gap increases and the production of charge carriers is suppressed. This anomalous behavior, which has also been observed in recent HHG experiments on Ca 2 RuO 4 , originates from a cooperative effect between the spin-charge coupling and the thermal ensemble, as well as the strongly temperature-dependent coherence between charge carriers. We argue that the peculiar temperature dependence of HHG is a generic feature of Mott insulators, which can be controlled via the Coulomb interaction and dimensionality of the system. Our results demonstrate that correlations between different degrees of freedom, which are a characteristic feature of strongly correlated solids, have significant and nontrivial effects on nonlinear optical responses.},

Such interlayer ordering will induce a vast normalization of the electronic ground state; however, it has not been observed in Fermi surface measurements. Here we report quantum oscillations of CsV 3 Sb 5 using tunnel diode oscillator frequency measurements. We observed a large number of frequencies, many of which were not reported. The number of frequencies cannot be explained by DFT calculations when only SD or ISD distortion is considered. Instead, our results are consistent with calculations when interlayer ordering is taken into account, providing strong evidence that the CDW phase of CsV 3 Sb 5 has complicated structure distortion which in turn has dramatic effects on the Fermi surface properties.},

Particularly intriguing among the FQHSs are those observed at even-denominator Landau level filling factors, as their quasiparticles are generally believed to obey non-Abelian statistics and be of potential use in topological quantum computing. Such states, however, are very rare and fragile, and are typically observed in the excited Landau level of 2D electron systems with the lowest amount of disorder. Here we report the observation of a new and unexpected even-denominator FQHS at filling factor ν = 3 / 4 in a GaAs 2D hole system with an exceptionally high quality (mobility). Our magnetotransport measurements reveal a strong minimum in the longitudinal resistance at ν = 3 / 4 , accompanied by a developing Hall plateau centered at ( h / e 2 ) / ( 3 / 4 ) . This even-denominator FQHS is very unusual as it is observed in the lowest Landau level and in a 2D hole system. While its origin is unclear, it is likely a non-Abelian state, emerging from the residual interaction between composite fermions.},

The Fourier law should be modified after homogenizing spatiotemporal parameters, featuring thermal Willis coupling between heat flux and temperature change rate. Thermal Willis coupling drives asymmetric heat diffusion, and the diffusion direction is reversible at a critical point determined by the degree of spatiotemporal modulation. Moreover, thermal Willis coupling stands robustly even when only thermal conductivity is modulated.

However, the bulk-disclination correspondence has never been studied in non-Euclidean geometry, nor in systems with p -orbital physics. Here, by creating p -orbital topological acoustic metamaterials with disclination-induced conic and hyperbolic surfaces, we demonstrate the rich emergent bound states arising from the interplay among the real-space geometry, the bulk band topology, and the p -orbital physics. This phenomenon is confirmed by clear experimental evidence that is consistent with theory and simulations.

  abstract     = {While non-Hermitian systems are normally constructed through incoherent coupling to a larger environment, recent works have shown that under certain conditions coherent couplings can be used to similar effect. We show that this new paradigm enables the behavior associated with the P T -symmetric phase of a non-Hermitian subsystem to control the containing Hermitian system through the coherent couplings. This is achieved in parametric nonlinear wave mixing where simultaneous second harmonic generation replaces the role of loss to induce non-Hermitian behavior that persists through a full exchange of power within the Hermitian system. These findings suggest a new approach for the engineering of dynamics where energy recovery and sustainability are of importance that could be of significance for photonics and laser science.},

  abstract     = {We explore the interaction between two trapped ions mediated by a surrounding quantum degenerate Bose or Fermi gas. Using perturbation theory valid for weak atom-ion interaction, we show analytically that the interaction mediated by a Bose gas has a power-law behavior for large distances whereas it has a Yukawa form for intermediate distances. For a Fermi gas, the mediated interaction is given by a power law for large density and by a Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida form for low density. For strong atom-ion interaction, we use a diagrammatic theory to demonstrate that the mediated interaction can be a significant addition to the bare Coulomb interaction between the ions, when an atom-ion bound state is close to threshold. Finally, we show that the induced interaction leads to substantial and observable shifts in the ion phonon frequencies.},

Here, we investigate vector fields with self-interactions by replacing the mass term in the Proca equation with a general potential. We show that this seemingly benign modification inevitably introduces ghost instabilities of the same kind as those recently identified for vector-tensor theories of modified gravity (but in this simpler, minimally coupled theory). It has been suggested that nonperturbative dynamics may drive systems away from such instabilities. We demonstrate that this is not the case by evolving a self-interacting Proca field on a Kerr background, where it grows due to the superradiant instability. The system initially evolves as in the massive case, but instabilities are triggered in a finite time once the self-interaction becomes significant. These instabilities have implications for the formation of condensates of massive, self-interacting vector bosons, the possibility of spin-one bosenovae, vector dark matter models, and effective models for interacting photons in a plasma.},

Specifically, we construct a complexity phase diagram with easy and hard “phases” and derive analytic bounds on the location of the phase boundary with respect to the evolution time and the degree of locality. We find that the location of the phase transition is intimately related to upper bounds on the spread of quantum correlations and protocols to transfer quantum information. Remarkably, although the location of the transition point is unchanged by on-site interactions, the nature of the transition point does change. Specifically, we find that there are two kinds of transitions, sharp and coarse, broadly corresponding to interacting and noninteracting bosons, respectively.

These conflicting aspects, at the interface between quantum computing and thermodynamics, are often overlooked or, at best, addressed only at a single-qubit level.

Given recent experimental progress, we consider weak dissipation, resulting in a small error probability per operation. Here, we find a simple formula for the fidelity reduction of any desired quantum operation, where the ideal evolution is confined to the computational subspace. Interestingly, this reduction is independent of the specific operation; it depends only on the operation time and the dissipation. Using our formula, we investigate the situation where dissipation in different parts of the system has correlations, which is detrimental for the successful application of quantum error correction. Surprisingly, we find that a large class of correlations gives the same fidelity reduction as uncorrelated dissipation of similar strength.},

  abstract     = {The scalable production of multipartite entangled states in ensembles of qubits is a crucial function of quantum devices, as such states are an essential resource both for fundamental studies on entanglement, as well as for applied tasks. Here we focus on the U(1) symmetric Hamiltonians for qubits with dipolar interactions—a model realized in several state-of-the-art quantum simulation platforms for lattice spin models, including Rydberg-atom arrays with resonant interactions. Making use of exact and variational simulations, we theoretically show that the nonequilibrium dynamics generated by this Hamiltonian shares fundamental features with that of the one-axis-twisting model, namely, the simplest interacting collective-spin model with U(1) symmetry. The evolution governed by the dipolar Hamiltonian generates a cascade of multipartite entangled states—spin-squeezed states, Schrödinger’s cat states, and multicomponent superpositions of coherent spin states. Investigating systems with up to N = 144 qubits, we observe full scalability of the entanglement features of these states directly related to metrology, namely, scalable spin squeezing at an evolution time O ( N 1 / 3 ) and Heisenberg scaling of sensitivity of the spin parity to global rotations for cat states reached at times O ( N ) . Our results suggest that the native Hamiltonian dynamics of state-of-the-art quantum simulation platforms, such as Rydberg-atom arrays, can act as a robust source of multipartite entanglement.},

Here we show how to use a simple and customizable class of circuits—randomized mirror circuits—to perform scalable, robust, and flexible randomized benchmarking of Clifford gates. We show that this technique approximately estimates the infidelity of an average many-qubit logic layer, and we use simulations of up to 225 qubits with physically realistic error rates in the range 0.1\%–1\% to demonstrate its scalability. We then use up to 16 physical qubits of a cloud quantum computing platform to demonstrate that our technique can reveal and quantify crosstalk errors in many-qubit circuits.},

  abstract     = {Multiphoton entangled quantum states are key to advancing quantum technologies such as multiparty quantum communications, quantum sensing, or quantum computation. Their scalable generation, however, remains an experimental challenge. Current methods for generating these states rely on stitching together photons from probabilistic sources, and state generation rates drop exponentially in the number of photons. Here, we implement a system based on active feed-forward and multiplexing that addresses this challenge. We demonstrate the scalable generation of four-photon and six-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, increasing generation rates by factors of 9 and 35, respectively. This is consistent with the exponential enhancement compared to the standard nonmultiplexed approach that is predicted by our theory. These results facilitate the realization of practical multiphoton protocols for photonic quantum technologies.},

These nonlocal correlations are a fundamental feature of quantum theory but also have practical applications. For instance, they can be used for device-independent random number generation, whose security is certified independently of the operations performed inside the devices. The amount of certifiable randomness that can be generated from some given nonlocal correlations is a key quantity of interest. Here, we derive tight analytic bounds on the maximum certifiable randomness as a function of the nonlocality as expressed using the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) value. We show that for every CHSH value greater than the local value (2) and up to 3 3 / 2 ≈ 2.598 there exist quantum correlations with that CHSH value that certify a maximal two bits of global randomness. Beyond this CHSH value the maximum certifiable randomness drops. We give a second family of Bell inequalities for CHSH values above 3 3 / 2 , and show that they certify the maximum possible randomness for the given CHSH value. Our work hence provides an achievable upper bound on the amount of randomness that can be certified for any CHSH value. We illustrate the robustness of our results, and how they could be used to improve randomness generation rates in practice, using a Werner state noise model.},

  abstract     = {Quantum theory predicts the existence of genuinely tripartite-entangled states, which cannot be obtained from local operations over any bipartite-entangled states and unlimited shared randomness. Some of us recently proved that this feature is a fundamental signature of quantum theory. The state | GHZ 3 ⟩ = ( | 000 ⟩ + | 111 ⟩ ) / 2 gives rise to tripartite quantum correlations that cannot be explained by any causal theory limited to bipartite nonclassical common causes of any kind (generalizing entanglement) assisted with unlimited shared randomness. Hence, any conceivable physical theory that would reproduce quantum predictions will necessarily include genuinely tripartite resources. In this Letter, we verify that such tripartite correlations are experimentally achievable. We derive a new device-independent witness capable of falsifying causal theories wherein nonclassical resources are merely bipartite. Using a high-performance photonic | GHZ 3 ⟩ state with fidelities of 0.9741 ± 0.002 , we provide a clear experimental violation of that witness by more than 26.3 standard deviations, under the locality and fair sampling assumption. We generalize our Letter to the | GHZ 4 ⟩ state, obtaining correlations that cannot be explained by any causal theory limited to tripartite nonclassical common causes assisted with unlimited shared randomness.},

Here, we provide a Bell-type inequality as a test for genuine multipartite nonlocality in network by exploiting a matrix representation of the causal structure of a multipartite system. We further present experimental demonstrations that both four-photon GHZ state and generalized four-photon GHZ state significantly violate the inequality, i.e., the observed four-partite correlations resist explanations involving three-way nonlocal resources subject to local operations and common shared randomness, hence confirming that nature is boundless multipartite nonlocal.},

It is found that cells aggregate into clusters at low cell density. With increasing cell number density, the structural percolation through the formation of a large cell cluster percolating through the space precedes the dynamical percolation transition of forming a percolating cluster of slow cell elements. Both percolating transitions exhibit scale-free scaling behaviors of cluster size distributions and fractal structures, similar to those of the universality class of 2D nonequilibrium systems governed by percolation theory. Dynamically, at low cell density, cell aggregation enhances cooperative motion. The structural percolation leads to slower motion, especially with stronger suppression for the high-frequency modes in the turbulent-like velocity power spectra. The following slowing-down percolation associated with the onset of cell crowding in regions occupied by cells further enhances dynamical slowing-down, and suppresses the increasing trend of dynamical heterogeneity and the steepening of the power spectrum of motion, until their reversions after the confluent transition.},

When unperturbed, the tissue exhibits a transition between a solidlike state and a fluidlike state tuned by cell motility and deformability—the ratio of the energetic costs of steric cell-cell repulsion and cell-edge tension. When perturbed, solid tissues exhibit local yield-stress behavior, with a threshold force for the onset of motion of a probe particle that vanishes upon approaching the solid-to-liquid transition. This onset of motion is qualitatively different in the low and high deformability regimes. At high deformability, the tissue is amorphous when solid, it responds compliantly to deformations, and the probe transition to motion is smooth. At low deformability, the monolayer is more ordered translationally and stiffer, and the onset of motion appears discontinuous. Our results suggest that cellular or nanoparticle transport in different types of tissues can be fundamentally different and point to ways in which it can be controlled.},

Here, we engineer a trap for room-temperature polaritons in an all-dielectric optical microcavity by locally increasing the interactions between the WS 2 excitons and cavity photons. The resulting confinement enhances the population and the first-order coherence of the polaritons in the ground state, with the latter effect related to dramatic suppression of disorder-induced inhomogeneous dephasing.

At several different laser wavelengths we experimentally observe a prominent angular shift of the parallel-polarized odd harmonics for energies above approximately 3.5 eV, and our calculations indicate that this shift originates in subtle differences in the recombination dipole strengths involving multiple conduction bands.

The presence of at least six nonoverlapping spin-wave branches is at odds with all models proposed to date. Above the ordering temperature, persisting dynamic correlations can be described by equal-time magnetic structure factors of a hexagonal cluster, which reveal the leading instabilities.

Here, we show how atomically resolved scanning tunneling microscopy can be used as a fingerprint of symmetry-breaking order. By analyzing the pattern of sublattice polarization and “Kekulé” distortions in small magnetic fields, order parameters for each of the most competitive symmetry-breaking states can be identified. In particular, we show that the “Kramers intervalley coherent state,” which theoretical work predicts to be the ground state at even integer fillings, shows a Kekulé distortion which emerges only in a magnetic field.},

In the presence of electrostatic interactions and disorder these modes may renormalize into charge and upstream neutral modes. Orthodox models of Laughlin phases anticipate only a downstream charge mode. Here we show that in the latter case, in the presence of a smooth confining potential, edge reconstruction leads to the emergence of pairs of counterpropagating modes, which, by way of mode renormalization, may give rise to nontopological upstream neutral modes, possessing nontrivial statistics. This may explain the experimental observation of ubiquitous neutral modes, and the overwhelming suppression of anyonic interference in Mach-Zehnder interferometry platforms.

However, direct observation of their topological surface states still lacks. Here, we reveal the coexistence of the strong and weak topological phases in a quasi-one-dimensional material, TaNiTe 5 , by spin- and angle- resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The surface states protected by weak topological order forms Dirac-node arcs in the vicinity of the Fermi energy, providing the opportunity to develop spintronics devices with high carrier density that is tunable by bias voltage.},

  abstract     = {Near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) between planar metallic surfaces was computationally explored over five decades ago by Polder and van Hove [ Phys. Rev. B 4 , 3303 (1971) ]. These studies predicted that, as the gap size ( d ) between the surfaces decreased, the radiative heat flux first increases by several orders of magnitude until d is ∼ 1 0 0 nm after which the heat flux saturates. However, despite both the fundamental and practical importance of these predictions, the combined enhancement and saturation of NFRHT at small gaps in metallic surfaces remains experimentally unverified. Here, we probe NFRHT between planar metallic (Pt, Au) surfaces and show that RHT rates can exceed the far-field rate by over a thousand times when d is reduced to ∼ 2 5 nm . More importantly, we show that for small values of d RHT saturates due to the dominant contributions from transverse electric evanescent modes. Our results are in excellent agreement with the predictions of fluctuational electrodynamics and are expected to inform the development of technologies such as near-field thermophotovoltaics, radiative heat-assisted magnetic recording, and nanolithography.},

  abstract     = {It is widely believed that the emergence of slow glassy dynamics is encoded in a material’s microstructure. First-principles theory [mode-coupling theory (MCT)] is able to predict the dramatic slowdown of the dynamics from only static two-point correlations as input, yet it cannot capture all of the observed dynamical behavior. Here we go beyond two-point spatial correlation functions by extending MCT systematically to include higher-order static and dynamic correlations. We demonstrate that only adding the static triplet direct correlations already qualitatively changes the predicted glass-transition diagram of binary hard spheres and silica. Moreover, we find a nontrivial competition between static triplet correlations that work to stabilize the glass state and dynamic higher-order correlations that destabilize it for both materials. We conclude that the conventionally neglected static triplet direct correlations as well as higher-order dynamic correlations are, in fact, non-negligible in both fragile and strong glassformers.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear wave focusing originating from the universal modulation instability (MI) is responsible for the formation of strong wave localizations on the water surface and in nonlinear wave guides, such as optical Kerr media and plasma. Such extreme wave dynamics can be described by breather solutions of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) like by way of example the famed doubly-localized Peregrine breathers (PB), which typify particular cases of MI. On the other hand, it has been suggested that the MI relevance weakens when the wave field becomes broadband or directional. Here, we provide experimental evidence of nonlinear and distinct PB-type focusing in standing water waves describing the scenario of two counterpropagating wave trains. The collected collinear wave measurements are in excellent agreement with the hydrodynamic coupled NLSE (CNLSE) and suggest that MI can undisturbedly prevail during the interplay of several wave systems and emphasize the potential role of exact NLSE solutions in extreme wave formation beyond the formal narrow band and unidirectional limits. Our work may inspire further experimental investigations in various nonlinear wave guides governed by CNLSE frameworks as well as theoretical progress to predict strong wave coherence in directional fields.},

One of these methods, quantum-electrodynamical density-functional theory (QEDFT), promises computationally efficient calculations for large correlated light-matter systems with the quality of the calculation depending on the underlying approximation for the exchange-correlation functional. So far no true density-functional approximation has been introduced limiting the efficient application of the theory. In this Letter, we introduce the first gradient-based density functional for the QEDFT exchange-correlation energy derived from the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We benchmark this simple-to-implement approximation on small systems in optical cavities and demonstrate its relatively low computational costs for fullerene molecules up to C 180 coupled to 400 000 photon modes in a dissipative optical cavity. This Letter now makes first principle calculations of much larger systems possible within the QEDFT framework effectively combining quantum optics with large-scale electronic structure theory.},

The competition between on-site repulsion and global cavity-induced interactions leads to a rich phase diagram, which exhibits superfluid, supersolid, and insulating (Mott and checkerboard) phases. We use a slave-boson treatment of harmonic quantum fluctuations around the mean-field solution and calculate the entanglement entropy across the phase transitions. At commensurate filling, the insulator-superfluid transition is signaled by a singularity in the area-law scaling coefficient of the entanglement entropy, which is similar to the one reported for the standard Bose-Hubbard model. Remarkably, at the continuous Z 2 superfluid-to-supersolid transition we find a critical logarithmic term, regardless of the filling. This behavior originates from the appearance of a roton mode in the excitation and entanglement spectrum, becoming gapless at the critical point, and it is characteristic of collective models.},

The cross section of such a proposed process is evaluated using the Feshbach projection operator formalism and compared to other known excitation phenomena, i.e., photoexcitation and nuclear excitation by electron capture (NEEC), showing up to 10 orders of magnitude increase in cross section. NE μ C is particularly interesting for MeV excitations that become accessible thanks to the stronger binding of muons to the nucleus. The binding energies of muonic atoms have been calculated introducing a state of the art modification to the Flexible Atomic Code. An analysis of experimental scenarios in the context of modern muon production facilities shows that the effect can be detectable for selected isotopes. The total probability of NE μ C is predicted to be P ≈ 1 × 10 − 6 per incident muon in a beam-based scenario. Given the high transition energy provided by muons, NE μ C can have important consequences for isomer feeding and particle-induced fission.},

However, as a boson cloud grows through superradiance, nonlinear effects from interactions with itself or other fields may become important. As a representative example of this, we use nonlinear evolutions to study black hole superradiance of a vector boson that attains a mass, via a coupling to a complex scalar, through the Higgs mechanism. For the cases considered, we find that the superradiant instability can lead to a transient period where the scalar field reaches its symmetry restoration value, leading to the formation of closed vortex strings, the temporary disruption of the exponential growth of the cloud, and an explosive outburst of energy. After the cloud loses sufficient mass, the superradiant growth resumes, and the cycle repeats. Thus, the black hole will be spun down but, potentially, at a much lower rate compared to when nonlinear effects are unimportant and with the liberated energy going primarily into bosonic radiation instead of gravitational waves.},

This spin structure alone is not enough to fix all deformations of the Compton amplitude by contact terms, but when combined with considerations of the ultrarelativistic limit we can uniquely assign values to the parameters remaining in the even-in-spin sector.

  abstract     = {Persistent oscillatory dynamics in nonequilibrium many-body systems is a tantalizing manifestation of ergodicity breakdown that continues to attract much attention. Recent works have focused on two classes of such systems: discrete time crystals and quantum many-body scars (QMBS). While both systems host oscillatory dynamics, its origin is expected to be fundamentally different: discrete time crystal is a phase of matter which spontaneously breaks the Z 2 symmetry of the external periodic drive, while QMBS span a subspace of nonthermalizing eigenstates forming an su(2) algebra representation. Here, we ask a basic question: is there a physical system that allows us to tune between these two dynamical phenomena? In contrast to much previous work, we investigate the possibility of a continuous time crystal (CTC) in undriven, energy-conserving systems exhibiting prethermalization. We introduce a long-range X Y Z spin model and show that it encompasses both a CTC phase as well as QMBS. We map out the dynamical phase diagram using numerical simulations based on exact diagonalization and time-dependent variational principle in the thermodynamic limit. We identify a regime where QMBS and CTC order coexist, and we discuss experimental protocols that reveal their similarities as well as key differences.},

We unravel a deep connection between current fluctuations and generalized time-reversal symmetry, providing new insight into time-averaged observables. We highlight the essential role of coarse graining in space from mathematical, thermodynamical, and experimental points of view. Spatial coarse graining is required to uncover salient features of currents that break detailed balance, and a thermodynamically “optimal” coarse graining ensures the most precise inference of dissipation. Defined without coarse graining, the fluctuations of empirical density and current are proven to diverge on all timescales in dimensions higher than one, which has far-reaching consequences for the central-limit regime in continuous space. We apply the results to examples of irreversible diffusion. Our findings provide new intuition about time-averaged observables and allow for a more efficient analysis of single-molecule experiments.},

By taking advantage of the quantum nature of the platform, we circumvented difficulties from the limited qubit number and gate fidelity in present-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum era quantum computers, paving the way for the quantum simulation of more sophisticated topological states on very rapidly developing quantum hardware.},

We verify the simulation results even for large ion numbers by engineering low excitations and thus low effective dimensions; then we extend to 32 excitations for an effective dimension of 2 77 , which is difficult for classical computers. By regarding the phonon modes as baths, we explore Markovian or non-Markovian spin dynamics in different parameter regimes of the JCH model, similar to quantum emitters in a structured photonic environment. We further examine the dependence of the non-Markovian dynamics on the effective Hilbert space dimension.

Here we report on an additional bound that exists for states with a bounded energy spectrum. This bound is dual to the Margolus-Levitin one in the sense that it depends on the difference between the state’s mean energy and the energy of the highest occupied eigenstate. Each of the three bounds can become the most restrictive one, depending on the spread and mean of the energy, forming three dynamical regimes which are accessible in a multilevel system. The new bound is relevant for quantum information applications, since in most of them, information is stored and manipulated in a Hilbert space with a bounded energy spectrum.},

For different symmetry classes, we analytically and/or numerically calculate the universal crossovers in the average decay of the initial state as the level spacing is varied, with the golden rule emerging in the limit of a continuum. Among the corrections to the exponential decay of the initial state given by Fermi’s golden rule is the appearance of the spectral form factor in the longtime regime for small but nonzero level spacing.},

  abstract     = {Quantum mechanics is commonly formulated in a complex, rather than real, Hilbert space. However, whether quantum theory really needs the participation of complex numbers has been debated ever since its birth. Recently, a Bell-like test in an entanglement-swapping scenario has been proposed to distinguish standard quantum mechanics from its real-valued analog. Previous experiments have conceptually demonstrated, yet not satisfied, the central requirement of independent state preparation and measurements and leave several loopholes. Here, we implement such a Bell-like test with two separated independent sources delivering entangled photons to three separated parties under strict locality conditions that are enforced by spacelike separation of the relevant events, rapid random setting generation, and fast measurement. With the fair-sampling assumption and closed loopholes of independent source, locality, and measurement independence simultaneously, we violate the constraints of real-valued quantum mechanics by 5.30 standard deviations. Our results disprove the real-valued quantum theory to describe nature and ensure the indispensable role of complex numbers in quantum mechanics.},

  abstract     = {The experimental realization of magnetic skyrmion crystals in centrosymmetric materials has been driven by theoretical understanding of how a delicate balance of anisotropy and frustration can stabilize topological spin structures in applied magnetic fields. Recently, the centrosymmetric material Gd 2 PdSi 3 was shown to host a field-induced skyrmion crystal, but the skyrmion stabilization mechanism remains unclear. Here, we employ neutron-scattering measurements on an isotopically enriched polycrystalline Gd 2 PdSi 3 sample to quantify the interactions that drive skyrmion formation. Our analysis reveals spatially extended interactions in triangular planes, and large ferromagnetic interplanar magnetic interactions that are modulated by the Pd / Si superstructure. The skyrmion crystal emerges from a zero-field helical magnetic order with magnetic moments perpendicular to the magnetic propagation vector, indicating that the magnetic dipolar interaction plays a significant role. Our experimental results establish an interaction space that can promote skyrmion formation, facilitating identification and design of centrosymmetric skyrmion materials.},

  abstract     = {The spin-splitter effect is theoretically predicted to generate an unconventional spin current with x - and z - spin polarization via the spin-split band in antiferromagnets. The generated torque, namely, spin-splitter torque, is effective for the manipulation of magnetization in an adjacent magnetic layer without an external magnetic field for spintronic devices such as MRAM. Here, we study the generation of torque in collinear antiferromagnetic RuO 2 with (100), (101), and (001) crystal planes. Next we find all x -, y -, and z -polarized spin currents depending on the Néel vector direction in RuO 2 ( 101 ) . For RuO 2 ( 100 ) and (001), only y -polarized spin current was present, which is independent of the Néel vector. Using the z -polarized spin currents, we demonstrate field-free switching of the perpendicular magnetized ferromagnet at room temperature. The spin-splitter torque generated from RuO 2 is verified to be useful for the switching phenomenon and paves the way for a further understanding of the detailed mechanism of the spin-splitter effect and for developing antiferromagnetic spin-orbitronics.},

  abstract     = {Revealing the bonding and time-evolving atomic dynamics in functional materials with complex lattice structures can update the fundamental knowledge on rich physics therein, and also help to manipulate the material properties as desired. As the most prototypical chalcogenide phase change material, Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 has been widely used in optical data storage and nonvolatile electric memory due to the fast switching speed and the low energy consumption. However, the basic understanding of the structural dynamics on the atomic scale is still not clear. Using femtosecond electron diffraction, structure factor calculation, and time-dependent density-functional theory molecular dynamic simulation, we reveal the photoinduced ultrafast transition of the local correlated structure in the averaged rocksalt phase of Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 . The randomly oriented Peierls distortion among unit cells in the averaged rocksalt phase of Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 is termed as local correlated structures. The ultrafast suppression of the local Peierls distortions in the individual unit cell gives rise to a local structure change from the rhombohedral to the cubic geometry within ∼ 0.3 ps . In addition, the impact of the carrier relaxation and the large number of vacancies to the ultrafast structural response is quantified and discussed. Our Letter provides new microscopic insights into contributions of the local correlated structure to the transient structural and optical responses in phase change materials. Moreover, we stress the significance of femtosecond electron diffraction in revealing the local correlated structure in the subunit cell and the link between the local correlated structure and physical properties in functional materials with complex microstructures.},

  abstract     = {The low-energy excitations in many condensed matter and metamaterial systems can be well described by the Dirac equation. The mass term associated with these collective excitations, also known as the Dirac mass, can take any value and is directly responsible for determining whether the resultant band structure exhibits a band gap or a Dirac point with linear dispersion. Manipulation of this Dirac mass has inspired new methods of band structure engineering and electron confinement. Notably, it has been shown that a massless state necessarily localizes at any domain wall that divides regions with Dirac masses of different signs. These localized states are known as Jackiw-Rebbi-type Dirac boundary modes and their tunability and localization features have valuable technological potential. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate that nonlinearity within a 1D Dirac material can result in a self-induced domain boundary for the Dirac mass. Our experiments are performed in a dimerized magnetomechanical metamaterial that allows complete control of both the magnitude and sign of the local material nonlinearity, as well as the sign of the Dirac mass. We find that the massless bound state that emerges at the self-induced domain boundary acts similarly to a dopant site within an insulator, causing the material to exhibit a dramatic binary switch in its conductivity when driven above an excitation threshold.},

We demonstrate that, when the wave packets are short, nonresonant interactions enable such scattering of hundred-keV electrons by introducing a spread in wave number space. We generalize the quasilinear diffusion model to include nonresonant effects. The resultant model exhibits an exponential decay of the scattering rates extending below the minimum resonant energy depending on the shortness of the wave packets.

  abstract     = {In recent years there has been a great interest in topological materials and in their fascinating properties. Topological band theory was initially developed for condensed matter systems, but it can be readily applied to arbitrary wave platforms with few modifications. Thus, the topological classification of optical systems is usually regarded as being mathematically equivalent to that of condensed matter systems. Surprisingly, here we find that both the particle-hole symmetry and the dispersive nature of nonreciprocal photonic materials may lead to situations where the usual topological methods break down and the Chern topology becomes ill defined. It is shown that due to the divergence of the density of photonic states in plasmonic systems the gap Chern numbers can be noninteger notwithstanding that the relevant parametric space is compact. In order that the topology of a dispersive photonic crystal is well defined, it is essential to take into account the nonlocal effects in the bulk materials. We propose two different regularization methods to fix the encountered problems. Our results highlight that the regularized topologies may depend critically on the response of the bulk materials for large k .},

Here, we provide an alternative to these two methods based on a modification of the modes of dielectric resonators by means of an active medium. On the example of the dielectric active layer of size substantially smaller than a half-wavelength of light, we demonstrate that there is a gain at exceeding of which the change in phase due to the reflection at the layer boundaries compensates the change in phase due to propagation over the layer. Above this value of the gain, an unconventional mode forms, in which the phase shift after a round-trip of the light is zero. We show that this mode can be exploited to create a laser, the size of which is much smaller than the wavelength of the generated light and scales inversely with the square of absolute value of the refractive index in the active medium. Our results pave the way to creation of dielectric lasers of subwavelength size.},

Here, we put forward a more efficient, flexible, and error-mitigated method: variational entanglement-assisted quantum process tomography with arbitrary ancillary qubits. Numerically, we simulate up to eight-qubit quantum processes and show that this tomography with m ancillary qubits ( 0 ≤ m ≤ n ) alleviates the exponential costs on state preparation (from 4 n to 2 n − m ), measurement settings (at least a 1 order of magnitude reduction), and data postprocessing (efficient and robust parameter optimization). Experimentally, we first demonstrate our method on a silicon photonic chip by rebuilding randomly generated one-qubit and two-qubit unitary quantum processes. Further using the error mitigation method, two-qubit quantum processes can be rebuilt with average gate fidelity enhanced from 92.38\% to 95.56\%.

Our interpretation of the experimental results is supported by solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation of a 1D double-well potential, as well as coupled-channel multiconfigurational quantum-scattering calculations of Kr 2 .

They are distinguished from previous (quasi-)static scars by a rigid spectral pairing only possible in Floquet systems, where strong interaction and drivings equalize the quasienergy corrections to all scars and maintain their spectral spacings against generic bilinear perturbations. Scars then enforce the spatial localization and rigid discrete time crystal (DTC) oscillations as verified numerically in a trimerized kagome lattice model relevant to recent cold atom experiments. Our analytical solutions offer a potential scheme to understand the mechanisms for more generic translation-invariant DTCs.},

Direct measurements at astrophysical energies in above-ground laboratories are hindered by the extremely small cross sections and vast cosmic-ray-induced background. We performed the first consistent direct measurement in the range of E c . m . = 0.24 to 1.9 MeV using the accelerators at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory and Sichuan University. Our measurement covers almost the entire intermediate process Gamow window in which the large uncertainty of the previous experiments has been reduced from 60\% down to 15\%, eliminates the large systematic uncertainty in the extrapolation arising from the inconsistency of existing datasets, and provides a more reliable reaction rate for the studies of the slow-neutron-capture and intermediate processes along with the first direct determination of the alpha strength for the near-threshold state.},

We explore the ability of existing mechanical systems to directly detect the fifth force associated with chameleons in an astrophysically viable regime where it could be dark energy. We provide analytical expressions for the weakest accessible chameleon model parameters in terms of experimentally tunable variables and apply our analysis to two mechanical systems: levitated microspheres and torsion balances, showing that the current generation of these experiments have the sensitivity to rule out a significant portion of the proposed chameleon parameter space.

  abstract     = {As a central thermodynamic property, free energy enables the calculation of virtually any equilibrium property of a physical system, allowing for the construction of phase diagrams and predictions about transport, chemical reactions, and biological processes. Thus, methods for efficiently computing free energies, which in general is a difficult problem, are of great interest to broad areas of physics and the natural sciences. The majority of techniques for computing free energies target classical systems, leaving the computation of free energies in quantum systems less explored. Recently developed fluctuation relations enable the computation of free energy differences in quantum systems from an ensemble of dynamic simulations. While performing such simulations is exponentially hard on classical computers, quantum computers can efficiently simulate the dynamics of quantum systems. Here, we present an algorithm utilizing a fluctuation relation known as the Jarzynski equality to approximate free energy differences of quantum systems on a quantum computer. We discuss under which conditions our approximation becomes exact, and under which conditions it serves as a strict upper bound. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrate a proof of concept of our algorithm using the transverse field Ising model on a real quantum processor. As quantum hardware continues to improve, we anticipate that our algorithm will enable computation of free energy differences for a wide range of quantum systems useful across the natural sciences.},

We describe the (non)linear scattering of the emerging polariton states and show that for near resonant photons the scattering dynamics directly implements a perfect control phase gate between the incoming photons in the limit of many emitters. For a finite number of emitters we show that the dominant error mechanism can be suppressed by a simple frequency filter at the cost of a minor reduction in the success probability. We verify the results via comparison with exact scattering matrix theory and show that the fidelity can reach values F ∼ 99\% with a gate success probability of &gt; 99\% for as few as eight emitters.},

In 1984, Berry interpreted this effect as a geometrical phase factor. The same year, Wilczek and Zee generalized the concept of Berry phases to degenerate levels and showed that a non-Abelian gauge field arises in these systems. In sharp contrast with the Abelian case, spatially uniform non-Abelian gauge fields can induce particle noninertial motion. We explore this intriguing phenomenon with a degenerated Fermionic atomic gas subject to a two-dimensional synthetic SU(2) non-Abelian gauge field. We reveal the spin Hall nature of the noninertial dynamic as well as its anisotropy in amplitude and frequency due to the spin texture of the system. We finally draw the similarities and differences of the observed wave packet dynamic and the celebrated Zitterbewegung effect of the relativistic Dirac equation.},

In this Letter, we use methods from large deviation theory to identify a thermodynamic control principle for structural transitions in a model cytoskeletal network. Specifically, we demonstrate that biasing the dynamics with respect to the work done by nonequilibrium components effectively renormalizes the interaction strength between such components, which can eventually result in a morphological transition. Our work demonstrates how a thermodynamic quantity can be used to renormalize effective interactions, which in turn can tune structure in a predictable manner, suggesting a thermodynamic principle for the control of cytoskeletal structure and dynamics.},

While the behavior of smooth cracks in ideal materials is well understood, it is assumed that for real, heterogeneous systems, fracture propagation is complex, generating rough fracture surfaces that are highly sensitive to specific details of the medium. Here we show how fracture roughness and material heterogeneity are inextricably connected via a simple framework. Studying hydraulic fractures in brittle hydrogels that have been supplemented with microbeads or glycerol to create controlled material heterogeneity, we show that the morphology of the crack surface depends solely on one parameter: the probability to perturb the front above a critical size to produce a steplike instability. This probability scales linearly with the number density, and with heterogeneity size to the 5 / 2 power. The ensuing behavior is universal and is captured by the 1D ballistic propagation and annihilation of steps along the singular fracture front.},

By probing the lattice dynamics corresponding to multiple Brillouin zones through the x-ray diffuse scattering with pulses from the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) (wavelength 1.3 Å and &lt; 10 fs pulse duration), we observe changes in the diffuse intensity associated with a hardening of the transverse acoustic phonon branches along Γ to X and Γ to M . Using force constants from density functional theory, we fit the quasiequilibrium intensity and obtain the instantaneous lattice temperature and density of photoexcited charge carriers. The density functional theory calculations demonstrate that photoexcitation transfers charge from oxygen 2 p derived π -bonding orbitals to Ta 5 d derived antibonding orbitals, further suppressing the ferroelectric instability and increasing the stability of the cubic, paraelectric structure.},

We demonstrate that CrBr 3 has next-neighbor J 2 and J 3 interactions approximately 5\% of J 1 , an ideal Dirac magnon dispersion at the K point, and the associated signature of isospin winding. The magnon lifetime and the thermal band renormalization show the universal T 2 evolution expected from an interacting spin-wave treatment, but the measured dispersion lacks the predicted van Hove features, pointing to the need for more sophisticated theoretical analysis.},

Our theoretical formulation establishes a quantitative connection between the many-body and one-body forms of self-interaction in terms of electron screening, thereby conferring superiority to the concept of many-body self-interaction. Our semilocal methodology involves the use of a weak localized potential and applies equally to electron and hole polarons.

Because of the distortion of the lattice, impurities, or pinning effect, confined skyrmions experience slightly different local fields, which leads to dephasing of the initial signal. The interaction between skyrmions also can contribute to the dephasing process. However, switching the magnetization direction in the nanodiscs (e.g., by spin transfer torque) also switches the helical rotation of the skyrmions from clockwise to anticlockwise (or vice versa), and this restores the initial signal (which is the essence of skyrmion echo).},

Recent studies have theoretically revealed a full Dirac hierarchy comprising an eightfold bulk DC, a fourfold surface DC, and a twofold hinge DC, associated with a hierarchy of topological phases including first-order to third-order three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators, using the same 3D base lattice. Here, we report the first experimental observation of the Dirac hierarchy in 3D acoustic TIs. Using acoustic measurements, we unambiguously reveal that lifting of multifold DCs in each hierarchy can induce two-dimensional topological surface states with a fourfold DC in a first-order 3D TI, one-dimensional topological hinge states with a twofold DC in a second-order 3D TI, and zero-dimensional topological corner states in a third-order 3D TI.

In this work, we clarify the origin of this duality and propose a design principle of 2D self-dual structures with arbitrary complexity. We find that this duality originates from the partial central inversion (PCI) symmetry of the hinge, which belongs to a more general end-fixed scaling transformation. This symmetry gives the structure an extra degree of freedom without modifying its dynamics. This results in dynamic isomers , i.e., dissimilar 2D mechanical structures, either periodic or aperiodic, having identical dynamic modes, based on which we demonstrate a new type of wave guide without reflection or loss. Moreover, the PCI symmetry allows us to design various 2D periodic isostatic networks with hinge duality. At last, by further studying a 2D nonmechanical magnonic system, we show that the duality and the associated hidden symmetry should exist in a broad range of Hamiltonian systems.},

  abstract     = {In a turbulent fluid, the time-reversal symmetry is explicitly broken by viscosity, and spontaneously broken in the inviscid limit. Recently, Drivas [ J. Nonlinear Sci. 29 , 65 (2019) .] proved the equivalence of two different local indicators of time irreversibility: (i) an Eulerian one, based on regularity properties of the velocity field [Duchon and Robert, Nonlinearity 13 , 249 (2000) .]; (ii) a Lagrangian one, based on symmetry properties of the trajectories under time reversal [Jucha et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 113 , 054501 (2014) .]. We test this equivalence in a turbulent Von Kármán experiment at a resolution of the order of the Kolmogorov scale using a high resolution 4D-PTV technique. We use the equivalence to perform the first joined Eulerian-Lagrangian exploration of the dynamics leading to time irreversibility, and find that it is linked with vortex interaction, suggesting a link between irreversibility and singularity.},

We find that such system features the rare property that clockwise and counterclockwise vortex states are nonequivalent. Focusing on arrays with C 6 v discrete rotation symmetry, we find that a longitudinal twist stabilizes the vortex solitons with the lowest topological charges m = ± 1 , which are always unstable in untwisted arrays with the same symmetry. Twisting also leads to the appearance of instability domains for otherwise stable solitons with m = ± 2 and generates vortex modes with topological charges m = ± 3 that are forbidden in untwisted arrays. By and large, we establish a rigorous relation between the discrete rotation symmetry of the array, its twist direction, and the possible soliton topological charges.},

A similar tunneling effect has also been observed in classical systems, such as the frustrated total internal reflection. Here we reveal an unexplored form of tunneling for electromagnetic waves which features opposite behaviors for the electric and magnetic fields, with one turning into a growing field, and the other a decaying field, in a medium that exhibits both ϵ − μ -zero and bianisotropy.

Here, we demonstrate a novel coupling scheme between an artificial molecule comprising two identical, strongly coupled transmon qubits and two microwave waveguides. In our scheme, the coupling is engineered so that transitions between states of the same (opposite) symmetry, with respect to the permutation operator, are predominantly coupled to one (the other) waveguide. The symmetry-based coupling selectivity, as quantified by the ratio of the coupling strengths, exceeds a factor of 30 for both waveguides in our device. In addition, we implement a Raman process activated by simultaneously driving both waveguides, and show that it can be used to coherently couple states of different symmetry in the single-excitation manifold of the molecule. Using that process, we implement frequency conversion across the waveguides, mediated by the molecule, with efficiency of about 95\%. Finally, we show that this coupling arrangement makes it possible to straightforwardly generate spatially separated Bell states propagating across the waveguides. We envisage further applications to quantum thermodynamics, microwave photodetection, and photon-photon gates.},

  abstract     = {While the squeezing of a propagating field can, in principle, be made arbitrarily strong, the cavity-field squeezing is subject to the well-known 3 dB limit, and thus has limited applications. Here, we propose the use of a fully quantum degenerate parametric amplifier (DPA) to beat this squeezing limit. Specifically, we show that by simply applying a two-tone driving to the signal mode, the pump mode can, counterintuitively , be driven by the photon loss of the signal mode into a squeezed steady state with, in principle, an arbitrarily high degree of squeezing. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this intracavity squeezing can increase the signal-to-noise ratio of longitudinal qubit readout exponentially with the degree of squeezing. Correspondingly, an improvement of the measurement error by many orders of magnitude can be achieved even for modest parameters. In stark contrast, using intracavity squeezing of the semiclassical DPA cannot practically increase the signal-to-noise ratio and thus improve the measurement error. Our results extend the range of applications of DPAs and open up new opportunities for modern quantum technologies.},

The bistability manifests itself in both the mechanical frequency and linewidth under a strong microwave drive field, which simultaneously activates three different kinds of nonlinearities, namely, magnetostriction, magnon self-Kerr, and magnon-phonon cross-Kerr nonlinearities. The magnon-phonon cross-Kerr nonlinearity is first predicted and measured in magnomechanics. The system enters a regime where Kerr-type nonlinearities strongly modify the conventional cavity magnomechanics that possesses only a radiation-pressure-like magnomechanical coupling. Three different kinds of nonlinearities are identified and distinguished in the experiment. Our Letter demonstrates a new mechanism for achieving mechanical bistability by combining magnetostriction and Kerr-type nonlinearities, and indicates that such Kerr-modified cavity magnomechanics provides a unique platform for studying many distinct nonlinearities in a single experiment.},

We quench between configurations and use a form of quantum state tomography, enabled by diabatically tuning lattice parameters, to directly follow the time evolution of the Zak phase as well as a chiral winding number. The Zak phase evolves continuously; however, when chiral symmetry transiently appears in the out-of-equilibrium system, the chiral winding number becomes well defined and can take on any integer value. When quenching between two configurations obeying the same three symmetries, the Zak phase is time independent; we confirm the dynamically induced symmetry breaking predicted in [McGinley and Cooper, Phys.

Our main findings are (i) a similar shift in energy for the 1 1 + and 2 1 + states by about − 250 keV , as compared with the mirror nucleus S 36 ; (ii) the discovery of an intruder 0 2 + state at 2.83(13) MeV, which appears below the first 2 + state, in contradiction with the situation in S 36 ; and (iii) a tentative 0 3 + state at 4.83(17) MeV, proposed to exhibit a bubble structure with two neutron vacancies in the 2 s 1 / 2 orbit. The inversion between the 0 2 + and 2 1 + states is due to the large mirror energy difference (MED) of − 516 ( 130 ) keV for the former. This feature is reproduced by shell model calculations, using the s d − p f valence space, predicting an almost pure intruder nature for the 0 2 + state, with two protons (neutrons) being excited across the Z = 20 magic closure in Ca 36 ( S 36 ). This mirror system has the largest MEDs ever observed, if one excludes the few cases induced by the effect of the continuum.},

These line operators are shown to satisfy first-order chiral evolution equations, in which a smooth variation of the path is given by a factorized product of two line operators. We argue that this equation together with the spectrum of boundary operators are sufficient to uniquely determine the expectation values of these operators. We demonstrate this by bootstrapping the two-point function of the displacement operator on a straight line.

With string theory, it is the only other solution to duality constraints explicitly known and it constitutes an important data point in the modern S -matrix bootstrap. Yet, its basics properties are essentially unknown. In this Letter, we fill this gap and derive the conditions of positivity and the low energy expansion of the amplitude. On the positivity side, we discover that the amplitude switches from a regime where it is positive in all dimensions to a regime with critical dimensions, which connects to the known d = 26 , 10 when the deformation is removed. Incidentally, we find that the Veneziano amplitude can be extended to massive scalars of masses up to m 2 = 1 / 3 , where it has critical dimension 6.3. On the low-energy side, we compute the first few couplings of the theory in terms of q -deformed analogs of the standard Riemann zeta values of the string expansion. We locate their location in the EFT-hedron, and find agreement with a recent conjecture that theories with accumulation points populate this space. We also discuss their relation to low spin dominance. Finally, we comment on the length of the Coon parton.},

Using tools from scattering amplitudes and effective field theory, we calculate the radiated J μ ν due to the scattering of two spinless particles to third order in Newton’s constant G , but to all orders in velocity.

  abstract     = {Many classes of extended scalar-tensor theories predict that dynamical instabilities can take place at high energies, leading to the formation of scalarized neutron stars. Depending on the theory parameters, stars in a scalarized state can form a solution-space branch that shares a lot of similarities with the so-called mass twins in general relativity appearing for equations of state containing first-order phase transitions. Members of this scalarized branch have a lower maximum mass and central energy density compared to Einstein ones. In such cases, a scalarized star could potentially overaccrete beyond the critical mass limit, thus triggering a gravitational phase transition where the star sheds its scalar hair and migrates over to its nonscalarized counterpart. Such an event resembles, but is distinct from, a nuclear or thermodynamic phase transition. We dynamically track a gravitational transition by first constructing hydrostatic, scalarized equilibria for realistic equations of state, and then allowing additional material to fall onto the stellar surface. The resulting bursts of monopolar radiation are dispersively stretched to form a quasicontinuous signal that persists for decades, carrying strains of order ≳ 10 − 22 ( kpc / L ) 3 / 2 Hz − 1 / 2 at frequencies of ≲ 300 Hz , detectable with the existing interferometer network out to distances of L ≲ 10 kpc , and out to a few hundred kpc with the inclusion of the Einstein Telescope. Electromagnetic signatures of such events, involving gamma-ray and neutrino bursts, are also considered.},

Here, we present for the first time the direct measurement of up to 11.5 dB squeezing at 1550 nm over the complete detection bandwidth of future ground-based GWDs ranging from 10 kHz down to below 1 Hz. Furthermore, we directly observe a quantum shot-noise reduction of up to ( 13.5 ± 0.1 ) dB at megahertz frequencies. This allows us to derive a precise constraint on the absolute quantum efficiency of the photodiode used for balanced homodyne detection. These results hold important insight regarding the quantum noise reduction efficiency in future GWDs, as well as for quantum information and cryptography, where low decoherence of nonclassical states of light is also of high relevance.},

This was done with ultrasensitive differential electrostatic accelerometers onboard a drag-free satellite. The mission lasted two and a half years, cumulating five months worth of science free-fall data, two-thirds with a pair of test masses of different compositions—titanium and platinum alloys—and the last third with a reference pair of test masses of the same composition—platinum. We summarize the data analysis, with an emphasis on the characterization of the systematic uncertainties due to thermal instabilities and on the correction of short-lived events which could mimic a WEP violation signal.

The current generated by this random rotation is rectified by an electronic device (demon), such that only positive current passes. Eventually, work can be produced. The advantage of such a macroscopic setup is to allow measurement of all the observables with time: useful power (work), heat taken from the bath, and finally the efficiency of the equivalent heat engine.

  abstract     = {Monitored quantum circuits (MRCs) exhibit a measurement-induced phase transition between area-law and volume-law entanglement scaling. MRCs with a conserved charge additionally exhibit two distinct volume-law entangled phases that cannot be characterized by equilibrium notions of symmetry-breaking or topological order, but rather by the nonequilibrium dynamics and steady-state distribution of charge fluctuations. These include a charge-fuzzy phase in which charge information is rapidly scrambled leading to slowly decaying spatial fluctuations of charge in the steady state, and a charge-sharp phase in which measurements collapse quantum fluctuations of charge without destroying the volume-law entanglement of neutral degrees of freedom. By taking a continuous-time, weak-measurement limit, we construct a controlled replica field theory description of these phases and their intervening charge-sharpening transition in one spatial dimension. We find that the charge fuzzy phase is a critical phase with continuously evolving critical exponents that terminates in a modified Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to the short-range correlated charge-sharp phase. We numerically corroborate these scaling predictions also hold for discrete-time projective-measurement circuit models using large-scale matrix-product state simulations, and discuss generalizations to higher dimensions.},

This tight bound well captures the divergent behavior associated with the additional cost of a highly irreversible process, which scales differently from a nearly irreversible process. We also find an optimal dynamics which saturates the equality of the bound. We demonstrate the validity of this bound via discrete one-bit and coarse-grained bit systems.

We propose an electronic implementation of an autonomous Maxwell’s demon that indeed stops working in the regular macroscopic limit as the dynamics becomes deterministic. However, we find that if the power supplied to the demon is scaled up appropriately, the deterministic limit is avoided and the demon continues to work. The price to pay is a decreasing thermodynamic efficiency. Our Letter suggests that novel strategies may be found in nonequilibrium settings to bring to the macroscale nontrivial effects so far only observed at microscopic scales.},

We demonstrate that the quantum-fluctuating interface delimiting a large bubble can be studied as an effective one-dimensional system through a “holographic” mapping. For the considered model, the emergent interface excitations map to an integrable chain of fermionic particles. We discuss how this integrability is broken by geometric features of the bubbles and by corrections in inverse powers of the ferromagnetic coupling, and provide a lower bound to the timescale after which the bubble is ultimately expected to melt. Remarkably, we demonstrate that a symmetry-breaking longitudinal field gives rise to a robust ergodicity breaking in two dimensions, a phenomenon underpinned by Stark many-body localization of the emergent fermionic excitations of the interface.},

Here, we propose to overcome this obstacle by producing and detecting a particular type of entanglement encoded in the Nambu spinor or electron-hole components of quasiparticles excited in quantum Hall edge states. Because of the opposite charge of electrons and holes, the detection of the Nambu spinor translates into a charge-current measurement, which eliminates the need for beam splitters and assures a high detection rate. Conveniently, the spinor correlation function at fixed effective polarizations derives from a single current-noise measurement, with the polarization directions of the detector easily adjusted by coupling the edge states to a voltage gate and a superconductor, both having been realized in experiments. We show that the violation of Bell inequality occurs in a large parameter region.

Free operations in resource theories can be enhanced by allowing for a catalyst system that assists the transformation and is returned unchanged, but potentially correlated, with the target state. While this has been an active area of recent research, very little is known about the necessary properties of such catalysts. Here, we prove fundamental limits applicable to a large class of correlated catalytic transformations by showing that a small residual correlation between a catalyst and target state implies that the catalyst needs to be highly resourceful. In fact, the resource required diverge in the limit of vanishing residual correlation. In addition, we establish that in imperfect catalysis a small error generally implies a highly resourceful embezzling catalyst. We develop our results in a general resource theory framework and discuss its implications for the resource theory of athermality, the resource theory of coherence, and entanglement theory.},

Quantum computing provides an alternative to the perturbation paradigm, yet state-of-the-art quantum processors with tens of noisy qubits are of limited practical utility. Here, we introduce perturbative quantum simulation, which combines the complementary strengths of the two approaches, enabling the solution of large practical quantum problems using limited noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. The use of a quantum processor eliminates the need to identify a solvable unperturbed Hamiltonian, while the introduction of perturbative coupling permits the quantum processor to simulate systems larger than the available number of physical qubits. We present an explicit perturbative expansion that mimics the Dyson series expansion and involves only local unitary operations, and show its optimality over other expansions under certain conditions. We numerically benchmark the method for interacting bosons, fermions, and quantum spins in different topologies, and study different physical phenomena, such as information propagation, charge-spin separation, and magnetism, on systems of up to 48 qubits only using an 8 + 1 qubit quantum hardware. We demonstrate our scheme on the IBM quantum cloud, verifying its noise robustness and illustrating its potential for benchmarking large quantum processors with smaller ones.},

In distributed computation, for instance, exploiting entanglement can reduce the number of communicated bits or increase the probability to obtain a correct answer. Entanglement-assisted classical communication protocols usually consist of two successive rounds: first, a Bell test round, in which the parties measure their local shares of the entangled state, and then a communication round, where they exchange classical messages. Here, we go beyond this standard approach and investigate adaptive uses of entanglement: we allow the receiver to wait for the arrival of the sender’s message before measuring their share of the entangled state. We first show that such adaptive protocols improve the success probability in random access codes. Second, we show that once adaptive measurements are used, an entanglement-assisted bit becomes a strictly stronger resource than a qubit in prepare-and-measure scenarios. We briefly discuss the extension of these ideas to scenarios involving quantum communication and we identify resource inequalities.},

So far, quantum-enhanced sensitivity has been achieved by exploiting the superposition principle. This enhancement has been obtained for particular forms of entangled states, adaptive measurement basis change, critical many-body systems, and steady state of periodically driven systems. Here, we introduce a different approach to obtain quantum-enhanced sensitivity in a many-body probe through utilizing the nature of quantum measurement and its subsequent wave function collapse without demanding prior entanglement. Our protocol consists of a sequence of local measurements, without reinitialization, performed regularly during the evolution of a many-body probe. As the number of sequences increases, the sensing precision is enhanced beyond the standard limit, reaching the Heisenberg bound asymptotically. The benefits of the protocol are multifold as it uses a product initial state and avoids complex initialization (e.g., prior entangled states or critical ground states) and allows for remote quantum sensing.},

We analyze this protocol in the framework of dynamical resource theories, which capture the resource character of operations that can create and detect coherence. This allows us to derive a lower and an upper bound on the success probability of the protocol, which depend on rigorously defined measures of coherence as a dynamical resource. We compare these bounds with the classical limit of the protocol and conclude that within the fixed structure that we consider, coherence is the quantum resource that determines its performance by bounding the success probability from below and above.

This representation is equivalent to Spekkens’ epistemically restricted toy theory, which is consequently singled out as the unique noncontextual ontological model for the stabilizer subtheory. Strikingly, the principle of noncontextuality is powerful enough (at least in this setting) to single out one particular classical realist interpretation. Our result explains the practical utility of Gross’s representation by showing that (in the setting of the stabilizer subtheory) negativity in this particular representation implies generalized contextuality. Since negativity of this particular representation is a necessary resource for universal quantum computation in the state injection model, it follows that generalized contextuality is also a necessary resource for universal quantum computation in this model. In all even dimensions, we prove that there does not exist any nonnegative and diagram-preserving quasiprobability representation of the stabilizer subtheory, and, hence, that the stabilizer subtheory is contextual in all even dimensions.},

By continuous measurement of a time evolving meter observable, we infer the evolution of the entangled systems and, ultimately, the state and dynamics of the system of interest. The photon number in a cavity field is thus resolved by simulated monitoring of the Rabi oscillations of a resonantly coupled two-level system, and we propose to regard this as a practical extension of quantum nondemolition measurements with applications in quantum metrology and quantum computing.},

These systems are called quasifree and quadratic, respectively. We find that steady states of one-dimensional systems with finite-range interactions necessarily have exponentially decaying Green’s functions. For the quasifree case without quadratic Lindblad operators, we show that fermionic systems with finite-range interactions are noncritical for any number of spatial dimensions and provide bounds on the correlation lengths. Quasifree bosonic systems can be critical in D &gt; 1 dimensions. Last, we address the question of phase transitions in quadratic systems and find that, without symmetry constraints beyond invariance under single-particle basis and particle-hole transformations, all gapped Liouvillians belong to the same phase.},

We illustrate this decomposition on simple models of noisy logical computations, and then apply it to the analysis of patterns of neural activity in the retina as it responds to complex dynamic visual scenes. We find that neural activity breaks detailed balance even when the visual inputs do not, and that this irreversibility arises primarily from interactions between pairs of neurons.},

We show that surface band bending can be used to ionize such near-surface Te to spin-active Te + state, and that optical illumination can be used further to control the Te donor charge state. We examine spin activation yield, spin linewidth, and relaxation ( T 1 ) and coherence times ( T 2 ) and show how a zero-field 3.5 GHz “clock transition” extends spin coherence times to over 1 ms, which is about an order of magnitude longer than other near-surface spin systems.},

Such spin-induced ferroelectricity is very common in double-perovskite systems and can coexist with ferromagnetism or ferrimagnetism above room temperature. We explain its origin by modifying the spin-dependent p − d hybridization mechanism.

After experimentally validating the strong-coupling approach at ± 4 electrons / moiré unit cell, we consider the spatial features of the STM signal for 14 different many-body correlated states and assess the possibility of Kekulé distortion (KD) emerging at the graphene lattice scale. Remarkably, we find that coupling the two opposite graphene valleys in the intervalley-coherent (IVC) TBG insulators does not always result in KD. As an example, we show that the Kramers IVC state and its nonchiral U(4) rotations do not exhibit any KD, while the time-reversal-symmetric IVC state does. Our results, obtained over a large range of energies and model parameters, show that the STM signal and Chern number of a state can be used to uniquely determine the nature of the TBG ground state.},

We theoretically predict that mechanical forces markedly reduce the coercivity of metastable ferroelectricity, thus greatly bolstering flexoelectricity-driven mechanical polarization switching. As predicted, we experimentally confirm the mechanical polarization switching via an unusually low mechanical force (100 nN) in metastable ferroelectric CaTiO 3 . Furthermore, the use of low mechanical forces narrows the width of mechanically writable nanodomains to sub-10 nm, suggesting an ultrahigh data storage density of ≥ 1 Tbit cm − 2 .

We show that the thermovoltages are due to the magnetization from canted spins in LuFeO 3 . Furthermore, in contrast to the challenges of generating, manipulating, and detecting spin current in collinear AFs, the vector SSE in LuFeO 3 is readily viable in zero magnetic field and can be controlled by a small magnetic field of about 150 Oe at room temperature.

This zero-field splitting could crucially alter the coupling between tunnel-coupled quantum dots, the basic building blocks of state-of-the-art spin-based quantum processors, with profound implications for semiconducting quantum computers. We develop an analytical model linking the zero-field splitting to the Rashba spin-orbit interaction that is cubic in momentum. Such interactions naturally emerge in hole nanostructures, where they can also be tuned by external electric fields, and we find them to be particularly large in silicon and germanium, resulting in a significant zero-field splitting in the μ eV range. We confirm our analytical theory by numerical simulations of different quantum dots, also including other possible sources of zero-field splitting. Our findings are applicable to a broad range of current architectures encoding spin qubits and provide a deeper understanding of these materials, paving the way toward the next generation of semiconducting quantum processors.},

By developing a semiclassical quantization method and taking account of superlattice induced Bragg reflection, we prove that magic zeros arise from the simultaneous quantization of two distinct k -space orbits. For instance, we show the chiral model of TBG has flat bands at special fields for any twist angle in the n th Landau level for | n | &gt; 1 . The flat bands at magic zeros provide a new setting for exploring crystalline fractional quantum Hall physics.},

  abstract     = {Hole-conjugate states of the fractional quantum Hall effect host counterpropagating edge channels which are thought to exchange charge and energy. These exchanges have been the subject of extensive theoretical and experimental works; in particular, it is yet unclear if the presence of integer quantum Hall edge channels stemming from fully filled Landau levels affects heat equilibration along the edge. In this Letter, we present heat transport measurements in quantum Hall states of graphene demonstrating that the integer channels can strongly equilibrate with the fractional ones, leading to markedly different regimes of quantized heat transport that depend on edge electrostatics. Our results allow for a better comprehension of the complex edge physics in the fractional quantum Hall regime.},

Thereby, suspended and charge neutral graphene emerged, and the intercalated Pb formed plumbene honeycomb lattices, which are rotated by ± 7.5 ° with respect to graphene. Along with this twist, a proximity-induced modulation of the hopping parameter in graphene opens a band gap of around 30 meV at the Fermi energy, giving rise to a metal-insulator transition. Moreover, the edges of the intercalated plumbene layers revealed edge states within the gap of the conduction bands at around 1 eV as expected for charge neutral plumbene.},

By building up a realistic tight-binding model for the elemental Te crystal in terms of a symmetry-adapted basis, we identify the microscopic origin of the chirality and essential couplings among polar and axial vectors with the same time-reversal properties. Based on this microscopic model, we elucidate quantitatively that an interband process, driven by nearest-neighbor spin-dependent imaginary hopping, is the key factor in the electric-field induced rotation and its inverse response. From the symmetry point of view, these couplings and responses are characteristic and common to any chiral material, leading to a possible experimental approach to achieve absolute enantioselection by simultaneously applied electric and rotation fields, or a magnetic field and electric current, and so on, as a conjugate field of the chirality.},

By a careful control of the vertical potential confining the charged particles as well as the strength of the ion wake charge interactions with the dust particles, we are able to steer the system toward a crystalline phase that exhibits a square lattice configuration. The transition occurs when the vertical confinement strength is slightly reduced below a critical value leading to a buckling of the monodisperse hexagonal 2D dust crystal to form a narrowly separated bilayer state (a quasi-2D state). Some theoretical insights into the transition process are provided through molecular dynamics simulations carried out for the parameters relevant to our experiment.},

When a uniform vertical magnetic field B i is applied along the rotation axis, the measured radial magnetic field B r on the inner cylinder increases linearly with a small magnetic Reynolds number R m due to the magnetization of the residue Ekman circulation. Onset of the axisymmetric SMRI is identified from the nonlinear increase of B r beyond a critical R m in both experiments and nonlinear numerical simulations. The axisymmetric SMRI exists only at sufficiently large R m and intermediate B i , a feature consistent with theoretical predictions. Our simulations further show that the axisymmetric SMRI causes the velocity and magnetic fields to contribute an outward flux of axial angular momentum in the bulk region, just as it should in accretion disks.},

This regime is present at long wavelengths and energy per particle small enough that equipartition is not reached on a fast timescale. In this range, we prove that the driving mechanism to thermalization is the formation of a shock that can be predicted using a pair of generalized Burgers equations. We perform a perturbative calculation at small energy per particle, proving that the energy spectrum of the chain E k decays as a power law, E k ∼ k − ζ ( t ) , on an extensive range of wave numbers k . We predict that ζ ( t ) takes first the value 8 / 3 at the Burgers shock time, and then reaches a value close to 2 within two shock times. The value of the exponent ζ = 2 persists for several shock times before the system eventually relaxes to equipartition. During this wide time window, an exponential cutoff in the spectrum is observed at large k , in agreement with previous results. Such a scenario turns out to be universal, i.e., independent of the parameters characterizing the system and of the initial condition, once time is measured in units of the shock time.},

Its impact is particularly illustrating in non-Hermitian quasicrystals where the interplay between non-Hermiticity and quasiperiodicity results in the concurrence of the delocalization-localization transition, the parity-time (PT)-symmetry breaking, and the onset of the non-Hermitian skin effects. Here, we experimentally simulate non-Hermitian quasicrystals using photonic quantum walks. Using dynamic observables, we demonstrate that the system can transit from a delocalized, PT-symmetry broken phase that features non-Hermitian skin effects, to a localized, PT-symmetry unbroken phase with no non-Hermitian skin effects. The measured critical point is consistent with the theoretical prediction through a spectral winding number, confirming the topological origin of the phase transition. More interestingly, we also provide the first experimental evidence for mobility edges which are induced by non-Hermiticity.

  abstract     = {Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a property of Hamiltonian equilibrium states which, in the thermodynamic limit, retain a finite average value of an order parameter even after a field coupled to it is adiabatically turned off. In the case of quantum spin models with continuous symmetry, we show that this adiabatic process is also accompanied by the suppression of the fluctuations of the symmetry generator—namely, the collective spin component along an axis of symmetry. In systems of S = 1 / 2 spins or qubits, the combination of the suppression of fluctuations along one direction and of the persistence of transverse magnetization leads to spin squeezing—a much sought-after property of quantum states, both for the purpose of entanglement detection as well as for metrological uses. Focusing on the case of X X Z models spontaneously breaking a U(1) [or even SU(2)] symmetry, we show that the adiabatically prepared states have nearly minimal spin uncertainty; that the minimum phase uncertainty that one can achieve with these states scales as N − 3 / 4 with the number of spins N ; and that this scaling is attained after an adiabatic preparation time scaling linearly with N . Our findings open the door to the adiabatic preparation of strongly spin-squeezed states in a large variety of quantum many-body devices including, e.g., optical-lattice clocks.},

Based on a partial reconstruction technique, we find evidence of a structure near the thresholds for D s + D * − and D s * + D − production in the K S 0 recoil-mass spectrum, which we refer to as the Z c s ( 3985 ) 0 . Fitting with a Breit-Wigner line shape, we find the mass of the structure to be ( 3992.2 ± 1.7 ± 1.6 ) MeV / c 2 and the width to be ( 7. 7 − 3.8 + 4.1 ± 4.3 ) MeV , where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second are systematic. The significance of the Z c s ( 3985 ) 0 signal is found to be 4.6 σ including both the statistical and systematic uncertainty. We report the Born cross section multiplied by the branching fraction at different energy points. The mass of the Z c s ( 3985 ) 0 is close to that of the Z c s ( 3985 ) + . Assuming SU(3) symmetry, the cross section of the neutral channel is consistent with that of the charged one. Hence, we conclude that the Z c s ( 3985 ) 0 is the isospin partner of the Z c s ( 3985 ) + .},

The decay widths for different helicity configurations are evaluated up to QCD next-to-leading order within the nonrelativistic QCD framework. We find that the QCD corrections notably mitigate the renormalization scale dependence of the decay widths for all the processes. The branching fraction of ϒ → J / ψ + χ c 1 is obtained as 3.73 − 2.06 − 1.19 + 5.10 + 0.10 × 10 − 6 , which agrees well with the Belle measurement, i.e., Br ( ϒ → J / ψ + χ c 1 ) = ( 3.90 ± 1.21 ± 0.23 ) × 10 − 6 . For the other processes, our results of the branching fractions are compatible with the upper limits given by the Belle experiments, except for ϒ ( 2 S ) → J / ψ + χ c 1 , where some tension exists between theory and experiment. Having the polarized decay widths, we study the J / ψ polarization, which turns out to be independent of any nonperturbative parameters. Further, according to our calculation, it is promising to measure all the processes at Super B factory thanks to the high luminosity.},

We discuss in detail the origin of such linear polarization by applying Wigner’s little group transformation. We show that the unique cos 2 ϕ angular correlation only exists in the boosted regime but not in the top quark rest frame. We construct an experimental observable for such correlation based on the transverse energy deposition asymmetry in the top jet that does not require the reconstruction of W decay products. The degree of this asymmetry can be used to measure the longitudinal polarization of the top quark, which is an important probe of new physics that couples to the top sector, and can discriminate a boosted top quark jet from its background events, such as QCD jets. A numerical simulation is also performed and found to agree well with the analytic prediction of the standard model.},

This enhancement arises since the charged mesons are focused and their three-body decays do not suffer from helicity suppression in the same way as their usual two-body decays. As a realistic application, we attempt to explain the MiniBooNE low energy excess utilizing this overlooked mechanism, uniquely realizing dark-sector interpretations as plausible solutions to the excess. As proof of the principle, we consider two well-motivated classes of dark-sector models, models of vector-portal dark matter and models of long-lived (pseudo)scalar. We argue that the model parameter values to accommodate the excess are consistent with existing limits and that they can be tested at current and future accelerator-based neutrino experiments.},

  abstract     = {One of the primary reasons behind the difficulty in observing the Unruh effect is that for achievable acceleration scales the finite temperature effects are significant only for the low frequency modes of the field. Since the density of field modes falls for small frequencies in free space, the field modes which are relevant for the thermal effects would be less in number to make an observably significant effect. In this Letter, we investigate the response of an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a massless scalar field which is confined in a long cylindrical cavity. The density of field modes inside such a cavity shows a resonance structure , i.e., it rises abruptly for some specific cavity configurations. We show that an accelerating detector inside the cavity exhibits a nontrivial excitation and de-excitation rates for small accelerations around such resonance points. If the cavity parameters are adjusted to lie in a neighborhood of such resonance points, the (small) acceleration-induced emission rate can be made much larger than the already observable inertial emission rate. We comment on the possibilities of employing this detector-field-cavity system in the experimental realization of the Unruh effect, and argue that the necessity of extremely high acceleration can be traded off in favor of precision in cavity manufacturing for realizing noninertial field theoretic effects in laboratory settings.},

From calculations of oscillator and entanglement entropy evolution, we find the three systems give equivalent dynamics for sufficiently weak oscillator-spin couplings but deviate significantly for intermediate couplings.

Here we exploit a superconducting platform to answer this question in the case of a quantum gate realized by a resonant drive field. During the gate, the superconducting qubit becomes entangled with the microwave drive pulse so that there is a quantum superposition between energy flows. We measure the energy change in the drive field conditioned on the outcome of a projective qubit measurement. We demonstrate that the drive’s energy change associated with the measurement backaction can exceed by far the energy that can be extracted by the qubit.

In this Letter, we theoretically elucidate that dissipation drastically alters universal particle-number-fluctuation dynamics associated with surface-roughness growth in one-dimensional free fermions and bosons. In a system under dephasing that causes loss of spatial coherence, we numerically find that a universality class of surface-roughness dynamics changes from the ballistic class to a class with the Edwards-Wilkinson scaling exponents and an unconventional scaling function. We provide the analytical derivation of the diffusion equation from the dephasing Lindblad equation via a renormalization-group technique and succeed in explaining the drastic change. Furthermore, we numerically find the same change of the universality class under a more nontrivial dissipation, i.e., symmetric incoherent hopping.},

The transport cost is minimized over the set of all bipartite coupling states ρ A B such that both of its reduced density matrices ρ A and ρ B of dimension N are fixed. We show that, selecting the quantum cost matrix to be proportional to the projector on the antisymmetric subspace, the minimal transport cost leads to a semidistance between ρ A and ρ B , which is bounded from below by the rescaled Bures distance and from above by the root infidelity. In the single-qubit case, we provide a semianalytic expression for the optimal transport cost between any two states and prove that its square root satisfies the triangle inequality and yields an analog of the Wasserstein distance of the order of 2 on the set of density matrices. We introduce an associated measure of proximity of quantum states, called swap fidelity, and discuss its properties and applications in quantum machine learning.},

  abstract     = {Causality is fundamental to science, but it appears in several different forms. One is relativistic causality, which is tied to a spacetime structure and forbids signaling outside the future. A second is an operational notion of causation that considers the flow of information between physical systems and interventions on them. In [V. Vilasini and R. Colbeck, General framework for cyclic and fine-tuned causal models and their compatibility with space-time, Phys. Rev. A 106 , 032204 (2022) .], we propose a framework for characterizing when a causal model can coexist with relativistic principles such as no superluminal signaling, while allowing for cyclic and nonclassical causal influences and the possibility of causation without signaling. In a theory without superluminal causation, both superluminal signaling and causal loops are not possible in Minkowski spacetime. Here we demonstrate that if we only forbid superluminal signaling, superluminal causation remains possible and show the mathematical possibility of causal loops that can be embedded in a Minkowski spacetime without leading to superluminal signaling. The existence of such loops in the given spacetime could in principle be operationally verified using interventions. This establishes that the physical principle of no superluminal signaling is not by itself sufficient to rule out causal loops between Minkowski spacetime events. Interestingly, the conditions required to rule out causal loops in a spacetime depend on the dimension. Whether such loops are possible in three spatial dimensions remains an important open question.},

Herein, we study the dynamics of individual polar skyrmions at the nanoscale via in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy. By monitoring the electric-field-driven creation, annihilation, shrinkage, and expansion of topological structures in real space, we demonstrate the reversible transformation among skyrmion bubbles, elongated skyrmions, and monodomains. The underlying mechanism and interactions are discussed in conjunction with phase-field simulations. The electrical manipulation of nanoscale polar skyrmions allows the tuning of their dielectric permittivity at the atomic scale, and the detailed knowledge of their phase transition behaviors provides fundamentals for their applications in nanoelectronics.},

The observation of magnetic contrast across domain walls and step edges confirms that the antiferromagnetic order persists to the surface layers. The magnetic field dependence of the MFM images reveals that the surface magnetic layer undergoes a first-order spin-flip transition at a magnetic field that is lower than the bulk transition, in excellent agreement with a revised Mills model. Our analysis suggests no reduction of the order parameter in the surface magnetic layer, implying robust ferromagnetism in the single-layer limit. The direct visualization of surface spin-flip transition not only opens up exploration of surface metamagnetic transitions in layered antiferromagnets, but also provides experimental support for realizing quantized transport in ultrathin films of MnBi 4 Te 7 and other natural superlattice topological magnets.},

We show that the circular geometry twists the spin-wave fields with spiral phase dislocations carrying quantized orbital angular momentum (OAM). Meanwhile, the confluence and splitting scattering of twisted magnons off the gyrating vortex core (VC) generates a frequency comb consisting of discrete and equally spaced spectral lines, dubbed as twisted magnon frequency comb (TMFC). It is found that the mode spacing of the TMFC is equal to the gyration frequency of the VC and the OAM quantum numbers between adjacent spectral lines differ by one. By applying a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of a thick nanodisk, we observe a magnonic Penrose superradiance inside the cone vortex state, which mimics the amplification of particles scattered from a rotating black hole. It is demonstrated that the higher-order modes of TMFC are significantly amplified while the lower-order ones are trapped within the VC gyrating orbit which manifests as the ergoregion. These results suggest a promising way to generate twisted magnons with large OAM and to drastically improve the flatness of the magnon comb.},

Being formulated directly in the thermodynamic limit, the diagrammatic series is bound to diverge and is not resummable at the transition due to the nonanalyticity of physical observables. This enables the detection of the transition with controlled error bars from an analysis of the series coefficients alone, avoiding the challenge of evaluating physical observables near the transition. We demonstrate this technique by the example of the Néel transition in the 3D Hubbard model. At half filling and higher temperatures, the method matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art finite-size techniques, but surpasses it at low temperatures and allows us to map the phase diagram in the doped regime, where finite-size techniques struggle from the fermion sign problem. At low temperatures and sufficient doping, the transition to an incommensurate spin density wave state is observed.},

Recently, the possibility of generating spin current through a photogalvanic effect of magnons was pointed out theoretically. However, neither a candidate material nor a general formula for calculating the photogalvanic spin current in materials is known so far. In this Letter, we develop a general formula for the photogalvanic spin current through a magnetic resonance process. This mechanism involves a one-magnon excitation process in contrast to the two-particle processes studied in earlier works. Using the formula, we show that GHz and THz waves create a large photogalvanic spin current in the antiferromagnetic phase of bilayer CrI 3 and CrBr 3 . The large spin current arises from an optical process involving two magnon bands, which is a contribution unknown to date. This spin current appears only in the antiferromagnetic ordered phase and is reversible by controlling the order parameter. These results open a route to material design for the photogalvanic effect of magnetic excitations.},

  abstract     = {We present a spectroscopic method which utilizes virtual photons to selectively measure the electronic structure of the topmost atomic layer. These virtual photons are created when incident positrons transition from vacuum states to bound surface states on the sample surface and can transfer sufficient energy to excite electrons into the vacuum. The short interaction range of the virtual photons restricts the penetration depth to approximately the Thomas-Fermi screening length. Measurements and analysis of the kinetic energies of the emitted electrons made on a single layer of graphene deposited on Cu and on the clean Cu substrate show that the ejected electrons originate exclusively from the topmost atomic layer. Moreover, we find that the kinetic energies of the emitted electrons reflect the density of states at the surface. These results demonstrate that this technique will be a complementary tool to existing spectroscopic techniques in determining the electronic structure of 2D materials and fragile systems due to the absence of subsurface contributions and probe-induced surface damage.},

Here, we discover an alternative pathway for controlling surface reactions by tuning the mechanical stiffness of the underlying material. We find that in addition to the typically assumed surface electronic contribution right at the reactive site, the contribution from the deformation of the bulk region plays a vital role in controlling surface reactions. The underlying mechanism is an elastic relaxation of the solid, which depends on the material’s stiffness and can be modified by tuning bulk stoichiometry. The effect of bulk stiffness on surface reactions has been demonstrated by considering hydrogen scission reaction and oxygen incorporation reaction during corrosion of amorphous SiC in water and air, respectively. Our results imply that tuning of bulk stiffness by modifying stoichiometry can provide an effective method for controlling surface reactions.},

We characterize both peaks and elucidate how they relate to the different stages of the drop impact process. The time at which the second peak appears coincides with the formation of a Worthington jet, emerging through flow focusing. Even low-velocity impacts can lead to a surprisingly high second peak in the normal force, even larger than the first one, namely when the Worthington jet becomes singular due to the collapse of an air cavity in the drop.},

Using the momentum-state lattice of quantum gas of Cs atoms to synthesize a nonlinear AA model, we provide experimental evidence for a mobility edge induced by interactions. By identifying the extended-to-localized transition of different energy eigenstates, we construct a mobility-edge phase diagram. The location of a mobility edge in the low- or high-energy region is tunable via repulsive or attractive interactions. Our observation is in good agreement with the theory and supports an interpretation of such interaction-induced mobility edge via a generalized AA model. Our Letter also offers new possibilities to engineer quantum transport and phase transitions in disordered systems.},

We propose a new optical enantiodetection method to determine the enantiomeric excess via two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy of the chiral mixture driven by three electromagnetic fields. The quantities of left- and right-handed chiral molecules are reflected by the intensities of different peaks on the 2D spectrum, separated by the chirality-dependent frequency shifts resulting from the relative strong electric-dipole interactions between the chiral molecules and the driving fields.

A study of the Mg 24 ( α , α ′ ) Mg 24 reaction has identified several 0 + states in Mg 24 , close to the C 12 + C 12 threshold, which predominantly decay to Ne 20 ( ground state ) + α . These states were not observed in Ne 20 ( α , α 0 ) Ne 20 resonance scattering suggesting that they may have a dominant C 12 + C 12 cluster structure. Given the very low angular momentum associated with sub-barrier fusion, these states may play a decisive role in C 12 + C 12 fusion in analogy to the Hoyle state in helium burning.

For the first time, resonance structure is observed in the cross section line shape of e + e − → π + π − ψ 2 ( 3823 ) with significances exceeding 5 σ . A fit to data with two coherent Breit-Wigner resonances modeling the s -dependent cross section yields M ( R 1 ) = 4406.9 ± 17.2 ± 4.5 MeV / c 2 , Γ ( R 1 ) = 128.1 ± 37.2 ± 2.3 MeV , and M ( R 2 ) = 4647.9 ± 8.6 ± 0.8 MeV / c 2 , Γ ( R 2 ) = 33.1 ± 18.6 ± 4.1 MeV . Though weakly disfavored by the data, a single resonance with M ( R ) = 4417.5 ± 26.2 ± 3.5 MeV / c 2 , Γ ( R ) = 245 ± 48 ± 13 MeV is also possible to interpret data. This observation deepens our understanding of the nature of the vector charmoniumlike states. The mass of the ψ 2 ( 3823 ) state is measured as ( 3823.12 ± 0.43 ± 0.13 ) MeV / c 2 , which is the most precise measurement to date.},

  abstract     = {Lots of charmonium-like structures have been observed in the last two decades. Most of them have quantum numbers that can be formed by a pair of charm and anticharm quarks, thus it is difficult to unambiguously identify the exotic ones among them. In this Letter, by exploiting heavy quark spin symmetry, we present a robust prediction of the hadronic molecular scenario, where the ψ ( 4230 ) , ψ ( 4360 ) and ψ ( 4415 ) are identified as D D ¯ 1 , D * D ¯ 1 , and D * D ¯ 2 * bound states, respectively. We show that a flavor-neutral charmonium-like exotic state with quantum numbers J P C = 0 − − , denoted as ψ 0 ( 4360 ) , should exist as a D * D ¯ 1 bound state. The mass and width of the ψ 0 ( 4360 ) are predicted to be ( 4366 ± 18 ) MeV and less than 10 MeV, respectively. The ψ 0 ( 4360 ) is significant in two folds: no 0 − − hadron has been observed so far, and a study of this state will enlighten the understanding of the mysterious vector mesons between 4.2 and 4.5 GeV, as well as the nature of previously observed exotic Z c and P c states. We propose that such an exotic state can be searched for in e + e − → η ψ 0 ( 4360 ) and uniquely identified by measuring the angular distribution of the outgoing η meson.},

To this aim, we calculate three-loop diagrams with two | Δ B | = 1 current-current operators analytically. In the matching between | Δ B | = 1 and | Δ B | = 2 effective theories, we regularize the infrared divergences dimensionally and take into account all relevant evanescent operators. Further elements of the calculation are the two-loop renormalization matrix Z i j for the | Δ B | = 2 operators and the O ( α s 2 ) corrections to the finite renormalization that ensures the 1 / m b suppression of the operator R 0 at two-loop order. Our theoretical prediction reads Δ Γ s / Δ M s = ( 4.33 ± 0.93 ) × 10 − 3 if expressed in terms of the bottom mass in the MS ¯ scheme and Δ Γ s / Δ M s = ( 4.20 ± 0.95 ) × 10 − 3 for the use of the potential-subtracted mass.

The analysis is based on the data collected during ∼ 6.2 years of smooth operations aboard the International Space Station and covers a broader energy range with respect to the previous proton flux measurement by CALET, with an increase of the available statistics by a factor of ∼ 2.2 . Above a few hundred GeV we confirm our previous observation of a progressive spectral hardening with a higher significance (more than 20 sigma). In the multi-TeV region we observe a second spectral feature with a softening around 10 TeV and a spectral index change from − 2.6 to − 2.9 consistently, within the errors, with the shape of the spectrum reported by DAMPE. We apply a simultaneous fit of the proton differential spectrum which well reproduces the gradual change of the spectral index encompassing the lower energy power-law regime and the two spectral features observed at higher energies.},

The majority of Sun-produced axions escape to infinity, but a small fraction of the flux is produced with speeds below the escape velocity. Over time, this process populates a basin of slow-moving axions trapped on bound orbits. These axions can decay to two photons, yielding an observable signature. We place the first limits on this solar basin of axions using recent quiescent solar observations made by the NuSTAR x-ray telescope. We compare three different methodologies for setting constraints, and obtain world-leading limits for axions with masses between 5 and 30 keV, in some cases improving on stellar cooling bounds by more than an order of magnitude in coupling.},

  abstract     = {Indefinite causal order (ICO) is playing a key role in recent quantum technologies. Here, we experimentally study quantum thermodynamics driven by ICO on nuclear spins using the nuclear magnetic resonance system. We realize the ICO of two thermalizing channels to exhibit how the mechanism works, and show that the working substance can be cooled or heated albeit it undergoes thermal contacts with reservoirs of the same temperature. Moreover, we construct a single cycle of the ICO refrigerator based on the Maxwell’s demon mechanism, and evaluate its performance by measuring the work consumption and the heat energy extracted from the low-temperature reservoir. Unlike classical refrigerators in which the coefficient of performance (COP) is perversely higher the closer the temperature of the high-temperature and low-temperature reservoirs are to each other, the ICO refrigerator’s COP is always bounded to small values due to the nonunit success probability in projecting the ancillary qubit to the preferable subspace. To enhance the COP, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a general framework based on the density matrix exponentiation (DME) approach, as an extension to the ICO refrigeration. The COP is observed to be enhanced by more than 3 times with the DME approach. Our Letter demonstrates a new way for nonclassical heat exchange, and paves the way towards construction of quantum refrigerators on a quantum system.},

We also provide a simple diagrammatic tool for calculation and treat illustrative examples.

Allowing the surface to evolve via relaxational dynamics leads to a theory linking nematic defect dynamics, cellular division rates, and Gaussian curvature. Regions of large positive (negative) curvature and positive (negative) growth are colocalized with the presence of positive (negative) defects. In an ex-vivo setting of cultured murine neural progenitor cells, we show that our framework is consistent with the observed cell accumulation at positive defects and depletion at negative defects. In an in-vivo setting, we show that the defect configuration consisting of a bound + 1 defect state, which is stabilized by activity, surrounded by two − 1 / 2 defects can create a stationary ring configuration of tentacles, consistent with observations of a basal marine invertebrate Hydra .},

While bioassays address the molecular characterization of cell contractility, the mechanical characterization of the active forces in cells remains challenging. Here by confronting theoretical analysis and experiments, we calculated both the resistive and the active components of the intracellular stresses that build up following cell adhesion. We obtained a linear relationship between the divergence of the passive stress and the traction forces, which we show is the consequence of the cell adhering and applying forces on the surface only through very localized adhesion points (whose size is inferior to our best resolution, of 400 nm). This entails that there are no measurable forces outside of these active point sources, and also that the passive stresses and active stresses inside cells are proportional.},

  abstract     = {We determine the kinetic phase diagram for nucleation and growth of crystal phases in a suspension of charged colloids. Exploiting the seeding approach in extensive simulations, we calculate nucleation barrier heights for face-centered cubic (fcc) and body-centered cubic (bcc) phases for varying screening lengths and supersaturations. We determine for the entire metastable fluid region the crystal polymorph with the lowest nucleation barrier, and find a regime close to the triple point where metastable bcc can form due to a lower nucleation barrier, even though fcc is the stable phase. For higher supersaturation, we find that the difference in barrier heights decreases and we observe a mix of hexagonal close-packed, fcc, and bcc structures in the growth of crystalline seeds as well as in spontaneously formed crystals. Our kinetic phase diagram rationalizes the different crystallization mechanisms observed in previous work.},

We then drive the particle with a periodic force. When the forcing period is set at twice the transition mean time, a statistical synchronization between particle motion and forcing phase marks the onset of a stochastic resonance mechanism. Comparisons between experimental results and predictions from the Fick-Jacobs theory and Brownian dynamics simulation reveal significant hydrodynamic effects, which change both resonant amplification and noise level.

We use scaling analysis and computer simulations to examine stretching of a fractal polymer chain around a disc in 2D (or a cylinder in 3D) of radius R . We reveal that the typical excursions of the polymer away from the surface and curvature-induced correlation length scale as Δ ∼ R β and S * ∼ R 1 / z , respectively, with the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) growth β = 1 / 3 and dynamic exponents z = 3 / 2 . Although probability distribution of excursions does not belong to KPZ universality class, the KPZ scaling is independent of the fractal dimension of the polymer and, thus, is universal across classical polymer models, e.g., SAW, randomly branching polymers, crumpled unknotted rings. Additionally, our Letter establishes a mapping between stretched polymers in curved geometry and the Balagurov-Vaks model of random walks among traps.},

The quantum coherence effect was observed in vanadium intermetallic compounds which adopt the A 15 crystal structure, and whose members include all technologically pertinent superconductors. Furthermore, the extreme sensitivity of the entangled states to the local structural and electronic environments emerges through the quadrupolar interaction with the electric field gradient due to the charge distribution at the nuclear ( I &gt; 1 2 ) sites.

While it is commonly assumed that the spin polarization of the spin Hall current is uniform, asymmetric local crystal potential generally allows the spin polarization to be noncollinear in space. Based on microscopic considerations, we demonstrate that such noncollinear spin Hall currents can be observed, for example, in layered Kagome Mn 3 X ( X = Ge , Sn) compounds. Moreover, by referring to atomistic spin dynamics simulations we show that noncollinear spin currents can be used to switch the chiral spin texture of Mn 3 X in a deterministic way even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Our theoretical prediction can be readily tested in experiments, which will open a novel route toward electric control of complex spin structures in noncollinear antiferromagnets.},

The Ce 3 + local moments on the pyrochlore lattice are described by pseudospin- 1 / 2 degrees of freedom, whose components transform as dipolar and octupolar moments under symmetry operations. In principle, there exist four possible quantum spin ice regimes, depending on whether the Ising component is in the dipolar or octupolar channel, and two possible flux configurations of the emergent gauge field. In this Letter, using exact diagonalization and molecular dynamics, we investigate the equal-time and dynamical spin structure factors in all four quantum spin ice regimes using quantum and classical calculations. Contrasting the distinct signatures of quantum and classical results for the four possible quantum spin ice regimes and elucidating the role of quantum fluctuations, we show that the quantum structure factor computed for the π -flux octupolar quantum spin ice regime is most compatible with the neutron scattering results on Ce 2 Zr 2 O 7 .},

The dominant intrinsic origin is found to originate entirely from the gapped nodal chains without the entanglement of any other trivial bands. The side-jump mechanism is predicted to be negligibly small, but intrinsic skew scattering enhances the intrinsic Hall and Nernst signals significantly, leading to large values of respective conductivities.

However, the heterostructure was metallic with a nonzero longitudinal conductance, which contradicts the common belief that quantized Hall conductance is usually observed in insulators. In this work, we systematically study the surface transport of a semimagnetic topological insulator with both gapped and gapless Dirac surfaces in the presence of dephasing process. In particular, we reveal that the HQHC is directly related to the half-quantized chiral current along the edge of a strongly dephasing metal. The Hall conductance keeps a half-quantized value for large dephasing strengths, while the longitudinal conductance varies with Fermi energies and dephasing strengths. Furthermore, we evaluate both the conductance and resistance as a function of the temperature, which is consistent with the experimental results. Our results not only provide the microscopic transport mechanism of the HQHC, but also are instructive for the probe of the HQHC in future experiments.},

A prominent example is the orbital-selective Mott transition (OSMT), which is characterized by the coexistence of localized electrons in some orbitals, and itinerant electrons in other orbitals. The state-of-the-art theoretical description of the OSMT in two- and three-dimensional systems is based on local nonperturbative approximations to electronic correlations provided by dynamical mean-field theory or slave spin method. In this work we go beyond this local picture and focus on the effect of spatial collective electronic fluctuations on the OSMT. To this aim, we consider a half-filled Hubbard-Kanamori model on a cubic lattice with two orbitals that have different bandwidths. We show that strong magnetic fluctuations that are inherent in this system prevent the OSMT and favor the Néel transition that occurs at the same critical temperature for both orbitals.},

Recently, there is great interest in multiorbital systems where this transition can be restricted to certain orbitals, leading to an orbital-selective Mott phase (OSMP). Theoretically, the OSMP is widely studied for kinetically decoupled orbitals, but the effect of interorbital hopping remains unclear. Here, we show how nonlocal interorbital hopping leads to local hybridization in single-site dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). Under fairly general circumstances, this implies that, at zero temperature, the OSMP, involving the Mott-insulating state of one orbital, is unstable against interorbital hopping to a different, metallic orbital. We further show that the coherence scale below which all electrons are itinerant is very small and gets exponentially suppressed even if the interorbital hopping is not overly small. Within this framework, the OSMP with interorbital hopping may thus reach down to extremely low temperatures T , but not to T = 0 . Accordingly, it is part of a coherence-incoherence crossover and not a quantum critical point. We present analytical arguments supported by numerical results using the numerical renormalization group as a DMFT impurity solver. We also compare our findings with previous slave-spin studies.},

Although central to our understanding of electronic properties of materials, direct characterization and manipulation of range and strength of the intervalley scattering induced by an individual atomic defect have so far been elusive. Using scanning tunneling microscope, we visualize and control intervalley scattering from an individual monovacancy in graphene. By directly imaging the affected range of monovacancy-induced intervalley scattering, we demonstrate that it is inversely proportional to the energy; i.e., it is proportional to the wavelength of massless Dirac fermions. A giant electron-hole asymmetry of the intervalley scattering is observed because the monovacancy is charged. By further charging the monovacancy, the bended electronic potential around the monovacancy softens the scattering potential, which, consequently, suppresses the intervalley scattering of the monovacancy.},

To establish this, we make a detailed comparison with the spectral functions that we obtain using the newly developed momentum-space numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion method, which yields electronic correlation functions directly in real time. We crosscheck these conclusions with our path integral quantum Monte Carlo and exact diagonalization results, as well as with the available numerically exact results from the literature.},

When the confining walls have atomic granularity, unique structural phases are expected, of relevance in nanotribology, porous materials, or intercalation compounds where, e.g., electronic states can emerge accordingly. The interlayer’s own order is frustrated by the competing interactions exerted by the two confining surfaces. We revisit the concept of orientational ordering, introduced by Novaco and McTague to describe the twist of incommensurate monolayers on crystalline surfaces. We predict a two-way twist of the monolayer as its density increases. We discover such a behavior in alkali atom monolayers (sodium, cesium) confined between graphene and an iridium surface, using scanning tunneling microscopy and electron diffraction.},

Here, we show that the universal quartic law of nonphononic excitations also holds in disordered crystals featuring finite long-range order, which is absent in their glassy counterparts. We thus establish that the degree of universality of the quartic law extends beyond structural glasses quenched from a melt. We further find that disordered crystals, whose level of disorder can be continuously controlled, host many more quasilocalized excitations than expected based on their degree of mechanical disorder—quantified by the relative fluctuations of the shear modulus—as compared to structural glasses featuring a similar degree of mechanical disorder. Our results are related to glasslike anomalies experimentally observed in disordered crystals. More broadly, they constitute an important step toward tracing the essential ingredients necessary for the emergence of universal nonphononic excitations in disordered solids.},

Current levels of beam mispointing, imbalance, target offset, and asymmetry from polarized crossed-beam energy transfer degrade yields by more than 40\%.

Does the unavoidable discrete sampling of a continuous correlated stochastic process change its EV distribution? We explore this question for correlated random variables modeled via Langevin dynamics for a particle in a potential field. For potentials growing at infinity faster than linearly and for long measurement times, we find that the EV distribution of the discretely sampled process diverges from that of the full continuous dataset and converges to that of independent and identically distributed random variables drawn from the process’s equilibrium measure. However, for processes with sublinear potentials, the long-time limit is the EV statistics of the continuously sampled data. We treat processes whose equilibrium measures belong to the three EV attractors: Gumbel, Fréchet, and Weibull. Our Letter shows that the EV statistics can be extremely sensitive to the sampling rate of the data.},

This Letter proposes an innovative scheme to coherently control collective emission rates via a self-interference mechanism in a nonlinear waveguide setting. The self-interference is made possible by photon backward scattering incurred by quantum scatterers in a waveguide working as quantum switches. Whether the interference is constructive or destructive is found to depend strongly on the distance between the scatterers and the emitters. The interference between two propagation pathways of the same photon leads to controllable superradiance and subradiance, with their collective decay rates much enhanced or suppressed (also leading to hyperradiance or population trapping). Furthermore, the self-interference mechanism is manifested by an abrupt change in the emission rates in real time. An experimental setup based on superconducting transmission line resonators and transmon qubits is further proposed to realize controllable collective emission rates.},

In this Letter, we first show theoretically that the SLP process in fact supports two phase-matching conditions and we then utilize the result to experimentally demonstrate simultaneous SLP trapping of two optical pulses for the duration from 0.8 to 2.0 μ s . The characteristic dissipation time, obtained by the release efficiency measurement from the SLP trapping state, is 1.22 μ s , which corresponds to an effective Q factor of 2.9 × 10 9 .

  abstract     = {We reveal a wealth of nonlinear and recoil effects in the interaction between individual low-energy electrons ( ≲ 100 eV ) and samples comprising a discrete number of states. Adopting a quantum theoretical description of combined free-electron and two-level systems, we find a maximum achievable excitation probability of 100\%, which requires specific conditions relating to the coupling strength and the transition symmetry, as we illustrate through calculations for dipolar and quadrupolar modes. Strong recoil effects are observed when the kinetic energy of the probe lies close to the transition threshold, although the associated probability remains independent of the electron wave function even when fully accounting for nonlinear interactions with arbitrarily complex multilevel samples. Our work reveals the potential of free electrons to control localized excitations and delineates the boundaries of such control.},

  abstract     = {While non-Hermitian Hamiltonians have been experimentally realized in cold atom systems, it remains an outstanding open question of how to experimentally measure their complex energy spectra in momentum space for a realistic system with boundaries. The existence of non-Hermitian skin effects may make the question even more difficult to address given the fact that energy spectra for a system with open boundaries are dramatically different from those in momentum space; the fact may even lead to the notion that momentum-space band structures are not experimentally accessible for a system with open boundaries. Here, we generalize the widely used radio-frequency spectroscopy to measure both real and imaginary parts of complex energy spectra of a non-Hermitian quantum system for either bosonic or fermionic atoms. By weakly coupling the energy levels of a non-Hermitian system to auxiliary energy levels, we theoretically derive a formula showing that the decay of atoms on the auxiliary energy levels reflects the real and imaginary parts of energy spectra in momentum space. We further prove that measurement outcomes are independent of boundary conditions in the thermodynamic limit, providing strong evidence that the energy spectrum in momentum space is experimentally measurable. We finally apply our non-Hermitian absorption spectroscopy protocol to the Hatano-Nelson model and non-Hermitian Weyl semimetals to demonstrate its feasibility.},

Our crucial realization is that the two-Higgs-doublet model can provide a light mediator through which the DM can annihilate into standard model leptons, avoiding indirect detection constraints. The DM mass is predicted to be very close to the mass of the leptons, which can potentially be identified from DM annihilation into gamma rays. Because of the sizable couplings to muons required to reproduce the DM relic abundance, this framework naturally favors a resolution to the ( g − 2 ) μ anomaly. Furthermore, by embedding this setup to the Zee model, we show that the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations is inherently connected to the observed relic abundance of DM. All new physics involved in our framework lies at or below the electroweak scale, making it testable at upcoming colliders, beam-dump experiments, and future sub-GeV gamma-ray telescopes.},

  abstract     = {The W -boson mass, which was recently measured at Fermilab with an unprecedented precision, suggests the presence of new multiplets beyond the standard model (SM). One of the minimal extensions of the SM is to introduce an additional scalar doublet in which the non-SM scalars can enhance W -boson mass via the loop corrections. On the other hand, with a proper discrete symmetry, the lightest new scalar in the doublet can be stable and play the role of a dark matter particle. We show that the inert two Higgs doublet model can naturally handle the new W -boson mass without violating other constraints and that the preferred dark matter mass is between 54 and 74 GeV. We identify three feasible parameter regions for the thermal relic density: the S A coannihilation, the Higgs resonance, and the S S → W W * annihilation. We find that the first region can be fully tested by the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider, the second region will be tightly constrained by direct detection experiments, and the third region could yield detectable GeV γ -ray and antiproton signals in the Galaxy that may have been observed by the Fermi Large Area Telescope and the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer AMS-02 experiment.},

Here we show that in odd-diffusive systems, which are characterized by diffusion tensors with antisymmetric elements, collisions surprisingly can enhance the self-diffusion. In these systems, due to an inherent curving effect, the motion of particles is facilitated, instead of hindered by collisions leading to a mutual rolling effect. Using a geometric model, we analytically predict the enhancement of the self-diffusion coefficient with increasing density. This counterintuitive behavior is demonstrated in the archetypal odd-diffusive system of Brownian particles under Lorentz force. We validate our findings by many-body Brownian dynamics simulations in dilute systems.},

However, it is unclear which of these features are responsible for this enhancement. To address this issue, we investigate phase transitions in free-fermionic topological systems that exhibit neither symmetry-breaking nor long-range entanglement. We analytically demonstrate that quantum enhanced sensing is possible using topological edge states near the phase boundary. Remarkably, such enhancement also endures for ground states of such models that are accessible in solid state experiments. We illustrate the results with 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain and a 2D Chern insulator which are both experimentally accessible. While neither symmetry-breaking nor long-range entanglement are essential, gap closing remains as the major candidate for the ultimate source of quantum enhanced sensing. In addition, we also provide a fixed and simple measurement strategy that achieves near-optimal precision for sensing using generic edge states irrespective of the parameter value. This paves the way for development of topological quantum sensors which are expected to also be robust against local perturbations.},

For the Sycamore quantum supremacy circuit with 53 qubits and 20 cycles, we have generated 1 × 10 6 uncorrelated bitstrings s which are sampled from a distribution P ^ ( s ) = | ψ ^ ( s ) | 2 , where the approximate state ψ ^ has fidelity F ≈ 0.0037 . The whole computation has cost about 15 h on a computational cluster with 512 GPUs. The obtained 1 × 10 6 samples, the contraction code and contraction order are made public.

Such a symmetry-preserving protocol would benefit from topological protection to errors in the preparation. We answer this question in the positive by providing a Hamiltonian in one higher dimension whose finite-time evolution is a unitary that acts trivially in the bulk, but pumps the desired cluster state to the boundary. Examples are given for both the 1D cluster state protected by a global symmetry, and various 2D cluster states protected by subsystem symmetries.

Remarkably, some processes, termed causally nonseparable, are incompatible with a definite causal order. We explore a form of certification of causal nonseparability in a semi-device-independent scenario where the involved parties receive trusted quantum inputs, but whose operations are otherwise uncharacterized. Defining the notion of causally nonseparable distributed measurements, we show that certain causally nonseparable processes that cannot violate any causal inequality, including the canonical example of the quantum switch, can generate noncausal correlations in such a scenario. Moreover, by imposing some further natural structure to the untrusted operations, we show that all bipartite causally nonseparable process matrices can be certified with trusted quantum inputs.},

  abstract     = {We theoretically analyze recent experiments [Semeghini et al. , Science 374 , 1242 (2021) ] demonstrating the onset of a topological spin liquid using a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays. In the experiment, robust signatures of topological order emerge in out-of-equilibrium states that are prepared using a quasiadiabatic state preparation protocol. We show theoretically that the state preparation protocol can be optimized to target the fixed point of the topological phase—the resonating valence bond state of hard dimers—in a time that scales linearly with the number of atoms. Moreover, we provide a two-parameter variational manifold of tensor network states that accurately describe the many-body dynamics of the preparation process. Using this approach we analyze the nature of the nonequilibrium state, establishing the emergence of topological order.},

They are the building blocks of many functional structures that often operate simultaneously to facilitate, for example, nutrient uptake and movement of cells. However, identifying how qualitatively distinct actin patterns can coexist remains a challenge. Using bifurcation theory of a mass conserved activator-inhibitor system, we uncover a generic mechanism of how different actin waves—traveling waves and excitable pulses—organize and simultaneously emerge. Live-cell imaging experiments indeed reveal that narrow, planar, and fast-moving excitable pulses may coexist with ring-shaped macropinocytic actin waves in the cortex of motile amoeboid cells.},

In epitaxy, such strain-mediated effects get further compounded when a misfit strain exists due to lattice mismatch between the growing film and substrate. Here, we carry out particle-resolved imaging of heteroepitaxial growth of multilayer colloidal films where the particles interact via a short-range attraction. Surprisingly, although the misfit strain relaxed systematically with film thickness, the adcolloid diffusivity was nonmonotonic. We show that this nonmonotonicity stems from the competition between the spatial extent of self-induced in-layer strain and the short interaction range. Importantly, we provide direct evidence for long-ranged strain-mediated interactions between adsorbates and show that it alters the growing film’s morphology.},

One important feature of hyperbolic lattices is that their translation group is nonabelian, permitting high-dimensional irreducible representations (irreps), in contrast to abelian translation groups in Euclidean lattices. Here we introduce a general framework to construct wave eigenstates of high-dimensional irreps of infinite hyperbolic lattices, thereby generalizing Bloch’s theorem, and discuss its implications on unusual mode counting and degeneracy, as well as bulk-edge correspondence in hyperbolic lattices. We apply this method to a mechanical hyperbolic lattice, and characterize its band structure and zero modes of high-dimensional irreps.},

In this Letter, we show that the problem can be solved by considering nonlinear elasticity in an exact form without resorting to any approximation in terms of geometric quantities. In this way, we are able to consider different effects that have been unwieldy or not viable to include in the past, such as a finite line tension, explicit dependence on the Poisson ratio, or the determination of the particle positions for the entire lattice. Several geometries with rotational symmetry are solved explicitly. Comparison with linear elasticity reveals an agreement that extends beyond its strict range of applicability. Implications for the problem of the characterization of virus assembly are also discussed.},

In solid-state conductors, Ohm’s law emerges due to electron scattering processes that relax the electrical current. Here, we use nitrogen-vacancy center magnetometry to directly image the local breakdown of Ohm’s law in a narrow constriction fabricated in a high mobility graphene monolayer. Ohmic flow is visible at room temperature as current concentration on the constriction edges, with flow profiles entirely determined by sample geometry. However, as the temperature is lowered below 200 K, the current concentrates near the constriction center. The change in the flow pattern is consistent with a crossover from diffusive to viscous electron transport dominated by electron-electron scattering processes that do not relax current.},

Using field-angle-resolved magnetoresistance experiments for fields rotated in the basal plane we investigate the field-angle dependence of the upper critical field ( H c 2 ), which directly reflects the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter. We observe a sixfold nodal symmetry superposed on a twofold symmetry. This agrees with theoretical predictions of a nodal topological superconducting phase near H c 2 , together with a nematic superconducting state.

Here, on the basis of both numerical and analytical nonperturbative renormalization group analyses, we reveal breakdown of previous perturbative arguments and defy the common wisdom that the transition always occurs at the quantum resistance R Q = h / ( 4 e 2 ) . We find that renormalization group flows in nonperturbative regimes induce nonmonotonic renormalization of the charging energy and lead to a qualitatively different phase diagram, where the insulator phase is strongly suppressed to the deep charge regime (Cooper pair box), while the system is always superconducting in the transmon regime. We identify a previously overlooked dangerously irrelevant term as an origin of the failure of conventional understandings. Our predictions can be tested in recent experiments realizing high-impedance long superconducting waveguides and would provide a solution to the long-standing controversy about the fate of dissipative quantum phase transition in the resistively shunted Josephson junction.},

The nonthermal distribution of the hot carriers generated by plasmon damping is accounted for on equal footing with thermal carriers at a given temperature in the electron-molecule scattering. We found that the nonthermal electrons in the high energy region can, albeit in much smaller populations, provide an efficient and dominant channel for photodissociation especially in the low-temperature and quantum plasmon regime. Our model captures the wavelength dependence and reproduces the enhancement factors observed by experiments for oxygen dissociation on silver nanoparticles.

  abstract     = {Physically, one tends to think of non-Hermitian systems in terms of gain and loss: the decay or amplification of a mode is given by the imaginary part of its energy. Here, we introduce an alternative avenue to the realm of non-Hermitian physics, which involves neither gain nor loss. Instead, complex eigenvalues emerge from the amplitudes and phase differences of waves backscattered from the boundary of insulators. We show that for any strong topological insulator in a Wigner-Dyson class, the reflected waves are characterized by a reflection matrix exhibiting the non-Hermitian skin effect. This leads to an unconventional Goos-Hänchen effect: due to non-Hermitian topology, waves undergo a lateral shift upon reflection, even at normal incidence. Going beyond systems with gain and loss vastly expands the set of experimental platforms that can access non-Hermitian physics and show signatures associated with non-Hermitian topology.},

For instance, the emission rate of quantum emitters placed near resonators with EPs is enhanced (compared to the free-space emission rate) by a factor that scales quadratically with the resonance quality factor. Here, we verify the theory of spontaneous emission at EPs by measuring photoluminescence from photonic-crystal slabs that are embedded with a high-quantum-yield active material. While our experimental results verify the theoretically predicted enhancement, they also highlight the practical limitations on the enhancement due to material loss.

While many questions remain unanswered, experiments have found the highest critical temperatures in layered two-dimensional materials. However, to what extent the remarkable stability of these strongly correlated 2D superfluids is affected by their reduced dimensionality is still an open question. Here, we use dilute gases of ultracold fermionic atoms as a model system to directly observe the influence of dimensionality on the stability of strongly interacting fermionic superfluids. We find that the superfluid gap follows the same universal function of the interaction strength regardless of dimensionality, which suggests that there is no inherent difference in the stability of two- and three-dimensional fermionic superfluids. Finally, we compare our data to results from solid state systems and find a similar relation between the interaction strength and the gap for a wide range of two- and three-dimensional superconductors.},

Here, we propose several tuning knobs, accessible in current experimental platforms, that allow one to further control the range and shape of the mediated interactions, extending the existing quantum simulation toolbox. In particular, we include an additional optical lattice for the fermionic mediator, as well as anisotropic traps to change its dimensionality in a continuous manner. This allows us to interpolate between power-law and exponential decays, introducing an effective cutoff for the interaction range, as well as to tune the relative interaction strengths at different distances. Finally, we show how our approach allows one to investigate frustrated regimes that were not previously accessible, where symmetry-protected topological phases as well as chiral spin liquids emerge.},

We perform a first systematic study of the renormalization property of the quasi-TMDPDFs by calculating the relevant matrix elements in a pion state at five lattice spacings ranging from 0.03 fm to 0.12 fm. We demonstrate that the square root of the Wilson loop combined with the short distance hadron matrix element provides a successful method to remove all ultraviolet divergences of the quasi-TMD operator, and thus provides the necessary justification to perform a continuum limit calculation of TMDPDFs. In contrast, the popular regularization independent momentum subtraction renormalization (RI/MOM) scheme fails to eliminate all linear divergences.},

This framework uses the Donsker-Varadhan representation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence—parametrized with a novel Gaussian ansatz—to enable a simultaneous extraction of the maximum likelihood values, uncertainties, and mutual information in a single training. We demonstrate our framework by extracting jet energy corrections and resolution factors from a simulation of the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. By leveraging the high-dimensional feature space inside jets, we improve upon the nominal CMS jet resolution by upward of 15\%.},

  abstract     = {Gravitational waves (GWs) from inspiraling neutron stars afford us a unique opportunity to infer the as-of-yet unknown equation of state of cold hadronic matter at supranuclear densities. During the inspiral, the dominant matter effects arise due to the star’s response to their companion’s tidal field, leaving a characteristic imprint in the emitted GW signal. This unique signature allows us to constrain the cold neutron star equation of state. At GW frequencies above ≳ 800 Hz , however, subdominant tidal effects known as dynamical tides become important. In this Letter, we demonstrate that neglecting dynamical tidal effects associated with the fundamental ( f ) mode leads to large systematic biases in the measured tidal deformability of the stars and hence in the inferred neutron star equation of state. Importantly, we find that f -mode dynamical tides will already be relevant for Advanced LIGO’s and Virgo’s fifth observing run ( ∼ 2025 )—neglecting dynamical tides can lead to errors on the neutron radius of O ( 1 km ) , with dramatic implications for the measurement of the equation of state. Our results demonstrate that the accurate modeling of subdominant tidal effects beyond the adiabatic limit will be crucial to perform accurate measurements of the neutron star equation of state in upcoming GW observations.},

  abstract     = {Solitons are commonly known as waves that propagate without dispersion. Here, we show that they can occur for driven overdamped Brownian dynamics of hard spheres in periodic potentials at high densities. The solitons manifest themselves as periodic sequences of different assemblies of particles moving in the limit of zero noise, where transport of single particles is not possible. They give rise to particle currents at even low temperature that appear in bandlike structures around certain hard-sphere diameters. At high temperatures, the bandlike structures are washed out by the noise, but the particle transport is still dominated by the solitons. All these predicted features should occur in a broad class of periodic systems and are amenable to experimental tests.},

Here, we show that measurements can stabilize quantum entanglement within open quantum systems. Specifically, in random unitary circuits with dephasing at the boundary, we find both numerically and analytically that projective measurements performed at a small nonvanishing rate result in a steady state with an L 1 / 3 power-law scaling entanglement negativity within the system. Using an analytical mapping to a statistical mechanics model of directed polymers in a random environment, we show that the power-law negativity scaling can be understood as Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations due to the random measurement locations. Further increasing the measurement rate leads to a phase transition into an area-law negativity phase, which is of the same universality as the entanglement transition in monitored random circuits without decoherence.},

With its unprecedented energy resolution and ultralow backgrounds, Majorana also searches for rare event signatures from beyond standard model physics in the low energy region below 100 keV. In this Letter, we test the continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) model, one of the mathematically well-motivated wave function collapse models aimed at solving the long-standing unresolved quantum mechanical measurement problem. While the CSL predicts the existence of a detectable radiation signature in the x-ray domain, we find no evidence of such radiation in the 19–100 keV range in a 37.5 kg-y enriched germanium exposure collected between December 31, 2015, and November 27, 2019, with the Demonstrator . We explored both the non-mass-proportional (n-m-p) and the mass-proportional (m-p) versions of the CSL with two different assumptions: that only the quasifree electrons can emit the x-ray radiation and that the nucleus can coherently emit an amplified radiation. In all cases, we set the most stringent upper limit to date for the white CSL model on the collapse rate, λ , providing a factor of 40–100 improvement in sensitivity over comparable searches. Our limit is the most stringent for large parts of the allowed parameter space. If the result is interpreted in terms of the Diòsi-Penrose gravitational wave function collapse model, the lower bound with a 95\% confidence level is almost an order of magnitude improvement over the previous best limit.},

A representative example is the predicted formation of localized pseudo-Landau levels (PLLs) with kagome lattice in tiny-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with θ &lt; 0.3 ° when the graphene layers are subjected to different electrostatic potentials. However, this was shown only for the model of rigidly rotated TBG, which is not realized in reality due to an interfacial structural reconstruction. It is believed that the interfacial structural reconstruction strongly inhibits the formation of the PLLs. Here, we systematically study electronic properties of the TBG with 0.075 ° ≤ θ &lt; 1.2 ° and demonstrate, unexpectedly, that the PLLs are quite robust for all the studied TBG. The structural reconstruction suppresses the formation of the emergent kagome lattice in the tiny-angle TBG. However, for the TBG around the magic angle, the sample-wide electronic kagome lattices with tunable lattice constants are directly imaged by using a scanning tunneling microscope. Our observations open a new direction to explore exotic correlated phases in moiré systems.},

Reaching much larger lattice sizes and lower temperatures than previously possible, we determine systematically the finite-temperature phase diagram of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions for interaction strengths ranging from BCS to crossover to BEC regimes. The evolutions of the pairing wave functions and the fermion and Cooper pair momentum distributions with temperature are accurately characterized. In the crossover regime, we find that the contact has a nonmonotonic temperature dependence, first increasing as temperature is lowered, and then showing a slight decline below the BKT transition temperature to approach the ground-state value from above.},

  abstract     = {Ab initio calculations of the phonon-induced band structure renormalization are currently based on the perturbative Allen-Heine theory and its many-body generalizations. These approaches are unsuitable to describe materials where electrons form localized polarons. Here, we develop a self-consistent, many-body Green’s function theory of band structure renormalization that incorporates localization and self-trapping. We show that the present approach reduces to the Allen-Heine theory in the weak-coupling limit, and to total energy calculations of self-trapped polarons in the strong-coupling limit. To demonstrate this methodology, we reproduce the path-integral results of Feynman and diagrammatic Monte Carlo calculations for the Fröhlich model at all couplings, and we calculate the zero point renormalization of the band gap of an ionic insulator including polaronic effects.},

Because of the large moiré unit cell, TBG offers the unprecedented opportunity to observe reentrant Hofstadter phases in laboratory-strength magnetic fields near 25 T. This Letter is devoted to magic angle TBG at 2 π flux where the magnetic translation group commutes. We use a newly developed gauge-invariant formalism to determine the exact single-particle band structure and topology. We find that the characteristic TBG flat bands reemerge at 2 π flux, but, due to the magnetic field breaking C 2 z T , they split and acquire Chern number ± 1 . We show that reentrant correlated insulating states appear at 2 π flux driven by the Coulomb interaction at integer fillings, and we predict the characteristic Landau fans from their excitation spectrum.},

Following the Lawson criterion, an ignited plasma is one where the fusion heating power is high enough to overcome all the physical processes that cool the fusion plasma, creating a positive thermodynamic feedback loop with rapidly increasing temperature. In inertially confined fusion, ignition is a state where the fusion plasma can begin “burn propagation” into surrounding cold fuel, enabling the possibility of high energy gain. While “scientific breakeven” (i.e., unity target gain) has not yet been achieved (here target gain is 0.72, 1.37 MJ of fusion for 1.92 MJ of laser energy), this Letter reports the first controlled fusion experiment, using laser indirect drive, on the National Ignition Facility to produce capsule gain (here 5.8) and reach ignition by nine different formulations of the Lawson criterion.},

  abstract     = {Unlike crystalline solids or ideal gases, transport properties remain difficult to describe from a microscopic point of view in liquids, whose dynamics result from complex energetic and entropic contributions at the atomic scale. Two scenarios are generally proposed: one represents the dynamics in a fluid as a series of energy-barrier crossings, leading to Arrhenius-like laws, while the other assumes that atoms rearrange themselves by collisions, as exemplified by the free volume model. To assess the validity of these two views, we computed, using molecular dynamics simulations, the transport properties of the Lennard-Jones fluid and tested to what extent the Arrhenius equation and the free volume model describe the temperature dependence of the viscosity and of the diffusion coefficient at fixed pressure. Although both models reproduce the simulation results over a wide range of pressure and temperature covering the liquid and supercritical states of the Lennard-Jones fluid, we found that the parameters of the free volume model can be estimated directly from local structural parameters, also obtained in the simulations. This consistency of the results gives more credibility to the free volume description of transport properties in liquids.},

For gently deposited droplets, capillary-inertial spreading is halted at the onset of contact line freezing, yielding a 1 / 7 scaling law for the arrested diameter. At low impact velocities ( We ≲ 100 ), inertial effects result in a 1 / 2 scaling law. At higher impact velocities ( We &gt; 100 ), inertio-viscous spreading can spill over the frozen base of the droplet until its velocity matches that of a kinetic freeze front caused by local undercooling, resulting in a 1 / 5 scaling law.},

When the electromagnetic force applied to the liquid metal is large enough, the corresponding volume injection of angular momentum produces a turbulent flow characterized by a time-averaged Keplerian rotation rate Ω ¯ ∼ r − 3 / 2 . Two contributions to the local angular momentum transport are identified: one from the poloidal recirculation induced by the presence of boundaries and the other from turbulent fluctuations in the bulk. The latter produces efficient angular momentum transport independent of the molecular viscosity of the fluid and leads to Kraichnan’s prediction Nu Ω ∝ Ta . In this so-called ultimate regime, the experiment, therefore, provides a configuration analogous to accretion disks, allowing the prediction of accretion rates induced by Keplerian turbulence.},

Through numerical investigations with an asymmetric Reuleaux triangle microcavity (ARTM), we find that the eigenvalue difference of paired modes can approach near-zero regardless of nonorthogonality of the modes. In this case, for a definite verification of EPs in experiments, wave function coalescence should be confirmed. For this, we suggest the method of exploiting correlation of far-field patterns (FFPs), which is directly related to spatial mode patterns. In an ARTM, we demonstrate that the FFP correlation of paired modes can be used to confirm wave function coalescence when an eigenvalue difference approaches near zero.},

We show that the chiral spiral configuration persists at finite N and T = 0 for any μ &gt; 0 . Our analysis is based on nonabelian bosonization, that relates the model to a U ( N ) 1 Wess-Zumino-Witten model deformed by current-current interactions. In this description, the appearance of the inhomogeneous phase is surprisingly simple.

The external sources encode the leaks of gravitational radiation at null infinity. The Ward identities of this theory are shown to reproduce those of the 2D celestial CFT after relating Carrollian to celestial operators. This suggests a new set of interplays between gravity in asymptotically flat spacetime, sourced conformal Carrollian field theory and celestial CFT.},

Some of them exploit the response of the Moon to GWs, others follow the design of current laser-interferometric GW detectors, which directly measure the gravitational strain with suspended optics. All of these ideas emerged since the Moon offers an extremely quiet geophysical environment compared to Earth, but at the same time, one must realize that even the quiet lunar environment sets limits to the sensitivity of lunar GW detectors. In this Letter, we compare the proposed mission concepts in terms of their response to GWs and evaluate how they are affected by the lunar seismic background. We discuss available mitigation strategies. From these analyses, we infer the prime observation band of each detector concept.},

The recent detection of very high energy (0.1–100 TeV) gamma rays from G 106.3 + 2.7 may be explained either by the decay of neutral pions or inverse Compton scattering by relativistic electrons. We report an analysis of 12 years of Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data that shows that the GeV-TeV gamma-ray spectrum is much harder and requires a different total electron energy than the radio and x-ray spectra, suggesting it has a distinct, hadronic origin. The nondetection of gamma rays below 10 GeV implies additional constraints on the relativistic electron spectrum. A hadronic interpretation of the observed gamma rays is strongly supported. This observation confirms the long-sought connection between Galactic PeVatrons and SNRs. Moreover, it suggests that G 106.3 + 2.7 could be the brightest member of a new population of SNRs whose gamma-ray energy flux peaks at TeV energies. Such a population may contribute to the cosmic-ray knee and be revealed by future very high energy gamma-ray detectors.},

In this Letter we extend this connection to multipartite quantum systems where entanglement appears in different forms with genuine entanglement being the most exotic one. We propose thermodynamic quantities that capture a signature of genuineness in multipartite entangled states. Instead of entropy, these quantities are defined in terms of energy—particularly the difference between global and local extractable works (ergotropies) that can be stored in quantum batteries. Some of these quantities suffice as faithful measures of genuineness and to some extent distinguish different classes of genuinely entangled states. Along with scrutinizing properties of these measures we compare them with the other existing genuine measures, and argue that they can serve the purpose in a better sense. Furthermore, the generality of our approach allows us to define suitable functions of ergotropies capturing the signature of k nonseparability that characterizes qualitatively different manifestations of entanglement in multipartite systems.},

In Markovian open quantum dynamics, the precision can not be improved by using entangled probes although the measurement time is effectively shortened.

Up to n = 7 qubits, we demonstrate that the precision has been improved by a factor of n 1 / 4 , which is consistent with the theoretical prediction.

We highlight our algorithm for special classes of models, including Anderson localization in one-dimensional transverse field X Y model, where O ( n 2 ) -gate circuits naturally emerge. Compared to product formulas with significantly larger gate counts, our algorithm drastically improves simulation precision. In addition to providing exact circuits for a broad set of spin and fermionic models, our algorithm provides broad analytic and numerical insight into optimal Hamiltonian simulations.},

While the NHSE and its intriguing impact on band topology and dynamics have been observed in classical or photonic systems, their demonstration in a quantum gas system remains elusive. Here we report the experimental realization of a dissipative Aharonov-Bohm chain—non-Hermitian topological model with NHSE—in the momentum space of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate. We identify signatures of the NHSE in the condensate dynamics, and perform Bragg spectroscopy to resolve topological edge states against a background of localized bulk states. Our Letter sets the stage for further investigation on the interplay of many-body statistics and interactions with the NHSE, and is a significant step forward in the quantum control and simulation of non-Hermitian physics.},

We propose a multiplicative shot-noise model that can capture the behaviors of a broad range of such natural phenomena, and analytically derive an approximation that accurately predicts its statistics. We apply our results to study the effects of a multiplicative synaptic plasticity rule that was recently extracted from measurements in physiological conditions. Using mean-field theory analysis and network simulations, we investigate how this rule shapes the connectivity and dynamics of recurrent spiking neural networks. The multiplicative plasticity rule is shown to support efficient learning of input stimuli, and it gives a stable, unimodal synaptic-weight distribution with a large fraction of strong synapses. The strong synapses remain stable over long times but do not “run away.” Our results suggest that the multiplicative shot-noise offers a new route to understand the tradeoff between flexibility and stability in neural circuits and other dynamic networks.},

Nonetheless, the characteristics of these networks are to a large extent poorly understood. Here, force networks formed in continuous and discontinuous shear thickening dense suspensions (CST and DST, respectively) are studied. We first show the evolution of the network formation and its topological heterogeneities as the applied stress increases. Subsequently, we identify force communities and coarse grain the suspension into a cluster network, and show that cluster-level dynamics are responsible for stark differences between the CST and DST behavior. Our results suggest that the force clusters formed in the DST regime are considerably more constrained in their motion, while CST clusters are loosely connected to their surrounding clusters.},

Zeeman-splitting measurements under magnetic fields up to 28.5 T were performed on single, one-layer-thick WS 2 microbubbles. The strain of the bubbles causes a hybridization of k -space direct and indirect excitons resulting in a sizable decrease in the modulus of the g factor of the ground-state exciton.

[ Nature 514 , 343 (2014) ] has shown the existence of highly excited exciton states in a regime, where the correspondence principle is applicable and quantum mechanics turns into classical mechanics; however, any interpretation of exciton spectra based on a classical approach to excitons is still missing. Here, we close this gap by computing and comparing quantum mechanical and semiclassical recurrence spectra of cuprous oxide. We show that the quantum mechanical recurrence spectra exhibit peaks, which, by application of semiclassical theories and a scaling transformation, can be directly related to classical periodic exciton orbits. The application of semiclassical theories to exciton physics requires the detailed analysis of the classical exciton dynamics, including three-dimensional orbits, which strongly deviate from hydrogenlike Keplerian orbits. Our findings illuminate important aspects of excitons in semiconductors by directly relating the quantum mechanical band structure splittings of excitons to the corresponding classical exciton dynamics.},

  abstract     = {The transfer and control of angular momentum is a key aspect for spintronic applications. Only recently, it was shown that it is possible to transfer angular momentum from the spin system to the lattice on ultrashort timescales. To contribute to the understanding of angular momentum transfer between spin and lattice degrees of freedom we present a scheme to calculate fully relativistic spin-lattice coupling parameters from first principles. In addition to the dipole-dipole interactions often discussed in the literature, these parameters give, in particular, access to the spin-lattice effects controlled by spin-orbit coupling. By treating changes in the spin configuration and atomic positions at the same level, closed expressions for the atomic spin-lattice coupling parameters can be derived in a coherent manner up to any order. Analyzing the properties of these parameters, in particular their dependence on spin-orbit coupling, we find that even in bcc Fe the leading term for the angular momentum exchange between the spin system and the lattice is a Dzyaloshiskii-Moriya-type interaction, which is due to the symmetry breaking distortion of the lattice.},

Through micromagnetic simulations, we explore this behavior and demonstrate that the deviations result from increasingly complex magnetization reversal at small lattice spacing, induced by interisland interactions, and depending critically on details of the island shapes.

The condensation occurs at the kinetically favorable negative mass extrema ( K and K ′ valleys) of the valence band. Considering attractive polariton-polariton interaction allows us to generate a spatially extended condensate. The symmetry breaking occurring during the condensate buildup leads to the formation of valley-polarized domains. This process can either be spontaneous, following the Kibble-Zurek scenario, or triggered, leading to a controlled spatial distribution of valley-polarized domains. The selection of a single valley breaks time-reversal symmetry, and the walls separating domains exhibit a reconfigurable topologically protected chiral current. This current emerges as a result of the interplay between the nontrivial valley topology and the condensation-induced symmetry breaking.},

  abstract     = {Spin qubits in silicon and germanium quantum dots are promising platforms for quantum computing, but entangling spin qubits over micrometer distances remains a critical challenge. Current prototypical architectures maximize transversal interactions between qubits and microwave resonators, where the spin state is flipped by nearly resonant photons. However, these interactions cause backaction on the qubit that yields unavoidable residual qubit-qubit couplings and significantly affects the gate fidelity. Strikingly, residual couplings vanish when spin-photon interactions are longitudinal and photons couple to the phase of the qubit. We show that large and tunable spin-photon interactions emerge naturally in state-of-the-art hole spin qubits and that they change from transversal to longitudinal depending on the magnetic field direction. We propose ways to electrically control and measure these interactions, as well as realistic protocols to implement fast high-fidelity two-qubit entangling gates. These protocols work also at high temperatures, paving the way toward the implementation of large-scale quantum processors.},

Epitaxially grown thin films of the alkali-doped fulleride K 3 + x C 60 , for example, exhibit intriguing phenomena, including Mott transitions and superconductivity, depending on dimensionality and doping. Surprisingly, in the trilayer case, a strong electron-hole doping asymmetry has been observed in the superconducting phase, which is absent in the three-dimensional bulk limit. Using density-functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory, we show that this doping asymmetry results from a substantial charge reshuffling from the top layer to the middle layer. While the nominal filling per fullerene is close to n = 3 , the top layer rapidly switches to an n = 2 insulating state upon hole doping, which implies a doping asymmetry of the superconducting gap. The interlayer charge transfer and layer-selective metal-insulator transition result from the interplay between crystal field splittings, strong Coulomb interactions, and an effectively negative Hund coupling. This peculiar charge reshuffling is absent in the monolayer system, which is an n = 3 Mott insulator, as expected from the nominal filling.},

We measure the mechanical properties of ceramics and single crystals using nanoindentation, and we find that elasticity and plasticity vary strongly with moderate illumination. For instance, the elastic stiffness of ZnO can increase by greater than 40\% due to blue illumination of intensity 1.4 mW / cm 2 . Above-band-gap illumination (e.g., uv light) has the strongest effect, and the relative effect of subband gap illumination varies between samples—a clear sign of defect-mediated processes. We show giant optomechanical effects can be tuned by materials processing, and that processing dependence can be understood within a framework of point defect equilibrium. The photoplastic effect can be understood by a long-established theory of charged dislocation motion. The photoelastic effect requires a new theoretical framework which we present using density functional theory to study the effect of point defect ionization on local lattice structure and elastic tensors. Our results update the longstanding but lesser-studied field of semiconductor optomechanics, and suggest interesting applications.},

Here we present Floquet quadrupole phases in driven nonlinear photonic crystals that are protected by space-time screw symmetries [8]. We start by illustrating space-time symmetries by tracking the trajectory of instantaneous optical axes of the driven media. Our Floquet quadrupole phase is then confirmed in two independent ways: symmetry indices at high-symmetry momentum points and calculations of the nested Wannier bands. Our Letter presents a general framework to analyze symmetries in driven optical materials and paves the way to further exploring symmetry-protected topological phases in Floquet systems and their optoelectronic applications.},

The thermalization to the Rayleigh-Jeans distribution is driven by the nonlinearity. On the other hand, the structural disorder is responsible for a relaxation toward the homogeneous equilibrium distribution (particle equipartition), which thus inhibits thermalization (energy equipartition). On the basis of the wave turbulence theory, we derive a kinetic equation that accounts for the presence of strong disorder. The theory unveils the interplay of disorder and nonlinearity. It unexpectedly reveals that a nonequilibrium process of condensation and thermalization can take place in the regime where disorder effects dominate over nonlinear effects. We validate the theory by numerical simulations of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation and the derived kinetic equation, which are found in quantitative agreement without using any adjustable parameter. Experiments realized in multimode optical fibers with an applied external stress evidence the process of thermalization in the presence of strong disorder.},

  abstract     = {Synchronization and frequency locking between remote mechanical oscillators are of scientific and technological importance. The key challenges are to align the oscillation frequencies and realize strong nonlinear interaction of both oscillators to a common carrier capable of long-distance transmission. Here, we experimentally realize the all-optical synchronization between two different optomechanical systems, a microsphere and a microdisk. The mechanical oscillation of the microsphere induced by the radiation pressure is loaded onto the pump laser via the optomechanical interaction, which is directly transmitted through a 5-km-long single-mode fiber to excite the mechanical oscillation of the microdisk. By finely tuning both the optical and mechanical frequencies of the two microresonators, the oscillation of the microdisk is injection locked to the microsphere, resulting in a synchronized phase relation of the two systems. Our results push a step forward the long-distance synchronization network using optomechanical microresonators.},

  abstract     = {Entanglement of light and multiple vibrations is a key resource for multichannel quantum information processing and memory. However, entanglement generation is generally suppressed, or even fully destroyed, by the dark-mode (DM) effect induced by the coupling of multiple degenerate or near-degenerate vibrational modes to a common optical mode. Here we propose how to generate optomechanical entanglement via DM breaking induced by synthetic magnetism. We find that at nonzero temperature, light and vibrations are separable in the DM-unbreaking regime but entangled in the DM-breaking regime. Remarkably, the threshold thermal phonon number for preserving entanglement in our simulations has been observed to be up to 3 orders of magnitude stronger than that in the DM-unbreaking regime. The application of the DM-breaking mechanism to optomechanical networks can make noise-tolerant entanglement networks feasible. These results are quite general and can initiate advances in quantum resources with immunity against both dark modes and thermal noise.},

The derivation relies on a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation which allows us to eliminate the bosonic degrees of freedom after self-consistently determining their state as a function of the coupled quantum system. We apply this formalism to the dissipative Dicke model and derive a Lindblad master equation for the atomic spins, which includes the coherent and dissipative interactions mediated by the bosonic mode. This master equation accurately predicts the Dicke phase transition and gives the correct steady state. In addition, we compare the dynamics using exact diagonalization and numerical integration of the master equation with the predictions of semiclassical trajectories. We finally test the performance of our formalism by studying the relaxation of a NOON state and show that the dynamics captures quantum metastability.},

This fundamental tenet has remained experimentally challenging and is yet to be tested in the laboratory. We present proof of concept and detailed theoretical analysis of an experimental setup for precision measurements of the quantum vacuum signal generated by the collision of a brilliant x-ray probe with a high-intensity pump laser. The signal features components polarized parallel and perpendicularly to the incident x-ray probe. Our proof-of-concept measurements show that the background can be efficiently suppressed by many orders of magnitude which should not only facilitate a detection of the perpendicularly polarized component of the nonlinear vacuum response, but even make the parallel polarized component experimentally accessible for the first time. Remarkably, the angular separation of the signal from the intense x-ray probe enables precision measurements even in the presence of pump fluctuations and alignment jitter. This provides direct access to the low-energy constants governing light-by-light scattering.},

Over the last two decades, a number of hints pointing to a sterile neutrino have emerged, many of which are pointing near m 4 ∼ 1 eV . Here, we show how MicroBooNE data can be used to search for electron neutrino disappearance using each of their four analysis channels. We find a hint for oscillations with the highest single channel significance of 2.4 σ (using the Feldman-Cousins approach) coming from the Wire-Cell analysis and a simplified treatment of the experimental systematics. The preferred parameters are sin 2 ( 2 θ 14 ) = 0.3 5 − 0.16 + 0.19 and Δ m 41 2 = 1.2 5 − 0.39 + 0.74 eV 2 . This region of parameter space is in good agreement with existing hints from source experiments, is at a similar frequency but higher mixing than indicated by reactor antineutrinos, and is at the edge of the region allowed by solar neutrino data. Existing unanalyzed data from MicroBooNE could increase the sensitivity to the &gt; 3 σ level.},

Unlike in the infinite-temperature case, when we impose energy constraints at finite temperature, the phase diagrams for the logarithmic negativity and the mutual information become distinct. In particular, we identify a regime where the negativity is extensive but the mutual information is subextensive, indicating a large amount of bound entanglement . When applied to evaporating black holes, these results imply that there is quantum entanglement within the Hawking radiation long before the Page time, although this entanglement may not be distillable into Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs.

This is based both on a graviton-condensate description of a black hole as well as on a correspondence between black holes and generic objects with maximal entropy compatible with unitarity, so-called saturons. We show that due to vorticity, a Q -ball-type saturon of a calculable renormalizable theory obeys the same extremality bound on the spin as the black hole. Correspondingly, a black hole with extremal spin emerges as a graviton condensate with vorticity. This offers a topological explanation for the stability of extremal black holes against Hawking evaporation. Next, we show that in the presence of mobile charges, the global vortex traps a magnetic flux of the gauge field. This can have macroscopically observable consequences. For instance, the most powerful jets observed in active galactic nuclei can potentially be accounted for. As a signature, such emissions can occur even without a magnetized accretion disk surrounding the black hole. The flux entrapment can provide an observational window to various hidden sectors, such as millicharged dark matter.},

The LBG sample consists of 1 473 106 objects with the median redshift of z ∼ 4 that are identified in a total area of 305 deg 2 observed by the Hyper Suprime-Cam Strategic Survey Program survey. After careful investigations of systematic uncertainties, such as contamination from foreground galaxies and cosmic infrared background, we obtain the significant detection of the CMB lensing signal at 5.1 σ that is dominated by 2-halo term signals of the LBGs. Fitting a simple model consisting of the Navarro-Frenk-White profile and the linear-bias model, we obtain the typical halo mass of M h = 2. 9 − 2.5 + 9.5 × 10 11 h − 1 M ⊙ . Combining the CMB lensing and galaxy-galaxy clustering signals on the large scales, we demonstrate the first cosmological analysis at z ∼ 4 that constrains ( Ω m 0 , σ 8 ) . We find that our constraint on σ 8 is roughly consistent with the Planck cosmology, while this σ 8 constraint is lower than the Planck cosmology over the 1 σ level. This study opens up a new window for constraining cosmological parameters at high redshift by the combination of CMB and high- z galaxies, as well as studying the interplay between galaxy evolution and large-scale structure at such high redshift, by upcoming CMB and optical and near-infrared imaging surveys.},

We extend our previous analyses in two main ways: we include data from the Virgo detector and we allow for more unequal mass systems, with mass ratio q ≥ 0.1 . We do not report any gravitational-wave candidates. The most significant trigger has a false alarm rate of 0.14 yr − 1 . This implies an upper limit on the merger rate of subsolar binaries in the range [ 220 − 24200 ] Gpc − 3 yr − 1 , depending on the chirp mass of the binary. We use this upper limit to derive astrophysical constraints on two phenomenological models that could produce subsolar-mass compact objects. One is an isotropic distribution of equal-mass primordial black holes. Using this model, we find that the fraction of dark matter in primordial black holes in the mass range 0.2 M ⊙ &lt; m PBH &lt; 1.0 M ⊙ is f PBH ≡ Ω PBH / Ω DM ≲ 6\% . This improves existing constraints on primordial black hole abundance by a factor of ∼ 3 . The other is a dissipative dark matter model, in which fermionic dark matter can collapse and form black holes. The upper limit on the fraction of dark matter black holes depends on the minimum mass of the black holes that can be formed: the most constraining result is obtained at M min = 1 M ⊙ , where f DBH ≡ Ω DBH / Ω DM ≲ 0.003\% .

  abstract     = {It was pointed out in a recent paper that the observed cooling rate of old, cold neutron stars (NS) can provide an upper limit on the transition rate of neutron to mirror neutron ( n − n ′ ). This limit is so stringent that it would preclude any discovery of n → n ′ oscillation in the current round of terrestrial searches for the process. Motivated by this crucially important conclusion, we critically analyze this suggestion and note an interesting new effect present in nearly exact mirror models for n → n ′ oscillation, which significantly affects this bound. The new element is the β decay n ′ → p ′ + e ′ + ν ¯ e ′ , which creates a cloud of mirror particles n ′ , p ′ , e ′ , and D ′ inside the NS core. The e ′ can “rob” the energy generated by the n → n ′ transition via e − e ′ scattering enabled by the presence of a (minute) millicharge in mirror particles. This energy is emitted as unobserved mirror photons via fast mirror bremsstrahlung leading to a relaxation of this upper limit.},

  abstract     = {We explore the use of the mass spectrum of neutron stars and black holes in gravitational-wave compact binary sources as a cosmological probe. These standard siren sources provide direct measurements of luminosity distance. In addition, features in the mass distribution, such as mass gaps or peaks, will redshift and thus provide independent constraints on their redshift distribution. We argue that the entire mass spectrum should be utilized to provide cosmological constraints. For example, we find that the mass spectrum of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA events introduces at least five independent mass “features”: the upper and lower edges of the pair instability supernova (PISN) gap, the upper and lower edges of the neutron star–black hole gap, and the minimum neutron star mass. We find that although the PISN gap dominates the cosmological inference with current detectors (second generation, 2G), as shown in previous work, it is the lower mass gap that will provide the most powerful constraints in the era of Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope (third generation, 3G). By using the full mass distribution, we demonstrate that degeneracies between mass evolution and cosmological evolution can be broken, unless an astrophysical conspiracy shifts all features of the full mass distribution simultaneously following the (nontrivial) Hubble diagram evolution. We find that this self-calibrating “spectral siren” method has the potential to provide precision constraints of both cosmology and the evolution of the mass distribution, with 2G achieving better than 10\% precision on H ( z ) at z ≲ 1 within a year and 3G reaching ≲ 1\% at z ≳ 2 within one month.},

The precession rate decays as the square of the inverse distance to the source and is proportional to a suitable Noether current for dual asymptotic symmetries at null infinity. Integrating the rate over time yields a net rotation—a “gyroscopic memory”—whose angle reproduces the known spin memory effect but also contains an extra contribution due to the generator of gravitational electric-magnetic duality. The angle’s order of magnitude for the first Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory signal is estimated to be Φ ∼ 10 − 35 arc sec near Earth, but the effect may be substantially larger for supermassive black hole mergers.},

Here, we study a model that is expected to exhibit an ergodic to nonergodic transition in the thermodynamic limit upon tuning the coupling between an ergodic quantum dot and distant particles with spin- 1 / 2 . The model is effectively zero dimensional; however, a variant of the model was proposed by De Roeck and Huveneers to describe the avalanche mechanism of ergodicity breaking transition in one-dimensional disordered spin chains. We show that exact numerical results based on the spectral form factor calculation accurately agree with theoretical predictions, and hence unambiguously confirm existence of the ergodicity breaking transition in this model. We benchmark specific properties that represent hallmarks of the ergodicity breaking transition in finite systems.},

  abstract     = {Quantum computers built with superconducting artificial atoms already stretch the limits of their classical counterparts. While the lowest energy states of these artificial atoms serve as the qubit basis, the higher levels are responsible for both a host of attractive gate schemes as well as generating undesired interactions. In particular, when coupling these atoms to generate entanglement, the higher levels cause shifts in the computational levels that lead to unwanted Z Z quantum crosstalk. Here, we present a novel technique to manipulate the energy levels and mitigate this crosstalk with simultaneous off-resonant drives on coupled qubits. This breaks a fundamental deadlock between qubit-qubit coupling and crosstalk. In a fixed-frequency transmon architecture with strong coupling and crosstalk cancellation, additional cross-resonance drives enable a 90 ns CNOT with a gate error of ( 0.19 ± 0.02 )\% , while a second set of off-resonant drives enables a novel CZ gate. Furthermore, we show a definitive improvement in circuit performance with crosstalk cancellation over seven qubits, demonstrating the scalability of the technique.

Loophole-free Bell tests not only deepen understanding of quantum mechanics, but are also important foundations for device-independent (DI) tasks in quantum information. High-dimensional quantum systems offer a significant advantage over qubits for closing the detection loophole. In the symmetric scenario, a detection efficiency as low as 61.8\% can be tolerated using four-dimensional states and a four-setting Bell inequality [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 104 , 060401 (2010) ]. For the first time, we show that four-dimensional entangled photons violate a Bell inequality while closing the detection loophole in experiment. The detection efficiency of the four-dimensional entangled source is about 71.7\%, and the fidelity of the state is 0.995 ± 0.001 . Combining the technique of multicore fibers, the realization of loophole-free high-dimensional Bell tests and high-dimensional quantum DI technologies are promising.},

Recent investigations reveal that our physical world’s nonlocality is at least tripartite; i.e., genuinely tripartite nonlocal correlations in nature cannot be reproduced by any causal theory involving bipartite nonclassical resources and unlimited shared randomness. Here, by allowing the fair sampling assumption and postselection, we experimentally demonstrate such genuine tripartite nonlocality in a network under strict locality constraints that are ensured by spacelike separating all relevant events and employing fast quantum random number generators and high-speed polarization measurements. In particular, for a photonic quantum triangular network we observe a locality-loophole-free violation of the Bell-type inequality by 7.57 standard deviations for a postselected tripartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state of fidelity ( 93.13 ± 0.24 )\% , which convincingly disproves the possibility of simulating genuine tripartite nonlocality by bipartite nonlocal resources with globally shared randomness.},

In this paper, we realize a room temperature ultrafast polaritonic switch where the Bose-Einstein condensate population can be depleted at the hundred femtosecond timescale with high extinction ratios. This is achieved by applying an ultrashort optical control pulse, inducing parametric scattering within the photon part of the polariton condensate via a four-wave mixing process. Using a femtosecond angle-resolved spectroscopic imaging technique, the erasure and revival of the polariton condensates can be visualized. The condensate depletion and revival are well modeled by an open-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation including parametric scattering process. This pushes the speed frontier of all-optical controlled polaritonic switches at room temperature towards the THz regime.},

However, experimental access to ground states in the geometrically frustrated systems has proven difficult, limiting studies and applications of novel properties and functionalities from the low energy states. Here, we introduce a convenient approach to control the competing diploar interactions between the neighboring nanomagnets, allowing us to tailor the vertex degeneracy of the ground states. We achieve this by tuning the length of selected nanobar magnets in the spin ice lattice. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by realizing multiple low energy microstates in a kagome artificial spin ice, particularly the hardly accessible long range ordered ground state—the spin crystal state. Our strategy can be directly applied to other artificial spin systems to achieve exotic phases and explore new emergent collective behaviors.},

At filling factor ν = 2 (two holes per moiré unit cell), Coulomb interaction can stabilize a Z 2 topological insulator by opening a charge gap. At ν = 1 , the interaction induces three classes of competing states, spin density wave states, an in-plane ferromagnetic state, and a valley polarized state, which undergo first-order phase transitions tuned by an out-of-plane displacement field. The valley polarized state becomes a Chern insulator for certain displacement fields. Moreover, we predict a topological charge density wave forming a honeycomb lattice with ferromagnetism at ν = 2 / 3 . Future directions on this versatile system hosting a rich set of quantum phases are discussed.},

The distinct nature of the PLLs enables one to realize novel electronic states beyond what is feasible with real LLs. Here, we show that it is possible to realize exotic electronic states through the coupling of zeroth PLLs in strained graphene. In our experiment, nanoscale strained structures embedded with PLLs are generated along a one-dimensional (1D) channel of suspended graphene monolayer. Our results demonstrate that the zeroth PLLs of the strained structures are coupled together, exhibiting a serpentine pattern that snakes back and forth along the 1D suspended graphene monolayer. These results are verified theoretically by large-scale tight-binding calculations of the strained samples. Our result provides a new approach to realizing novel quantum states and to engineering the electronic properties of graphene by using localized PLLs as building blocks.},

In solid-state materials, fractional quantum Hall phases continue to attract attention as hosts of emergent geometrical excitations analogous to gravitons, resulting from the nonperturbative interactions between the electrons. However, the direct observation of such excitations remains a challenge. Here, we identify a quasi-one-dimensional model that captures the geometric properties and graviton dynamics of fractional quantum Hall states. We then simulate geometric quench and the subsequent graviton dynamics on the IBM quantum computer using an optimally compiled Trotter circuit with bespoke error mitigation. Moreover, we develop an efficient, optimal-control-based variational quantum algorithm that can efficiently simulate graviton dynamics in larger systems. Our results open a new avenue for studying the emergence of gravitons in a new class of tractable models on the existing quantum hardware.},

Here, we develop a low-energy effective model underlying HOTI states in 2D quasicrystals for all possible rotational symmetries. By implementing a novel Fourier transform developed recently for quasicrystals and approximating the long-wavelength behavior by their large-scale average, we construct an effective k · p Hamiltonian to capture the band inversion at the center of a pseudo-Brillouin zone. We show that an in-plane Zeeman field can induce mass kinks at the intersection of adjacent edges of a 2D quasicrystal topological insulators and generate corner modes (CMs) with fractional charge, protected by rotational symmetries. Our model predictions are confirmed by numerical tight-binding calculations. Furthermore, when the quasicrystal is proximitized by an s -wave superconductor, Majorana CMs can also be created by tuning the field strength and chemical potential. Our work affords a generic approach to studying the low-energy physics of quasicrystals, in association with topological excitations and fractional statistics.},

The coupling to the bath preserves the global SO(3) spin symmetry. Using large-scale, approximation-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that any finite coupling to the bath suffices to stabilize long-range antiferromagnetic order. This is in stark contrast to the isolated Heisenberg chain where spontaneous breaking of the SO(3) symmetry is forbidden by the Mermin-Wagner theorem. A linear spin-wave theory analysis confirms that the memory of the bath and the concomitant retarded interaction stabilize the order. For the Heisenberg chain, the ohmic bath is a marginal perturbation so that exponentially large system sizes are required to observe long-range order at small couplings. Below this length scale, our numerics is dominated by a crossover regime where spin correlations show different power-law behaviors in space and time. We discuss the experimental relevance of this crossover phenomena.},

Nonetheless, significant questions remain. In particular, the temperature evolution and demise of the CDW state has not been extensively studied, and little is known about the coexistence of the CDW with superconductivity at low temperatures. We report an x-ray scattering study of CsV 3 Sb 5 over a broad range of temperatures from 300 to ∼ 2 K , below the onset of its superconductivity at T c ∼ 2.9 K . Order parameter measurements of the 2 × 2 × 2 CDW structure show an unusual and extended linear temperature dependence onsetting at T * ∼ 160 K , much higher than the susceptibility anomaly associated with CDW order at T CDW = 94 K . This implies strong CDW fluctuations exist to ∼ 1.7 × T CDW . The CDW order parameter is observed to be constant from T = 16 to 2 K, implying that the CDW and superconducting order coexist below T c , and, at ambient pressure, any possible competition between the two order parameters is manifested at temperatures well below T c , if at all. Anomalies in the temperature dependence in the lattice parameters coincide with T CDW for c ( T ) and with T * for a ( T ) .},

Usually, the rotation follows the same direction as the SAM due to momentum conservation. It is counterintuitive to observe the reversal of optical torque acting on an ordinary dielectric nanoparticle illuminated by an elliptically or circularly polarized light wave. Here, we demonstrate that negative optical torques, which are opposite to the direction of SAM, can ubiquitously emerge when elliptically polarized light waves are impinged on dielectric nanoparticles obliquely. Intriguingly, the rotation can be switched between clockwise and counterclockwise directions by controlling the incident angle of light.

Unfortunately, this coupling property is usually sensitive to the working wavelength and structure features that hinder the broadband and robust functions. Here, we report a new strategy utilizing an artificial gauge field (AGF) to engineer the coupling dispersion and realize a dispersionless coupling among waveguides with periodically bending modulation. The AGF-induced dispersionless coupling is experimentally verified in a silicon waveguide platform, which already has well-established broadband and robust routing functions (directional coupling and splitting), suggesting potential applications in integrated photonics. As examples, we further demonstrate a three-level-cascaded AGF waveguide network to route broadband light to desired ports with an overwhelming advantage over the conventional ones in comparison.

  abstract     = {We present experimental results on optical trapping of Yb-doped β -NaYF subwavelength-thickness high-aspect-ratio hexagonal prisms with a micron-scale radius. The prisms are trapped in vacuum using an optical standing wave, with the normal vector to their face oriented along the beam propagation direction, yielding much higher trapping frequencies than those typically achieved with microspheres of similar mass. This platelike geometry simultaneously enables trapping with low photon-recoil-heating, high mass, and high trap frequency, potentially leading to advances in high frequency gravitational wave searches in the Levitated Sensor Detector, currently under construction. The material used here has previously been shown to exhibit internal cooling via laser refrigeration when optically trapped and illuminated with light of suitable wavelength. Employing such laser refrigeration methods in the context of our work may enable higher trapping intensity and thus higher trap frequencies for gravitational wave searches approaching the several hundred kilohertz range.},

In turn, this light-driven motion can give rise to ponderomotive correlations in the electromagnetic field. In optomechanical systems, cavities are often employed to enhance these correlations up to the point where they generate quantum squeezing of light. In free-space scenarios, where no cavity is used, observation of squeezing remains possible but challenging due to the weakness of the interaction, and has not been reported so far. Here, we measure the ponderomotively squeezed state of light scattered by a nanoparticle levitated in a free-space optical tweezer. We observe a reduction of the optical fluctuations by up to 25\% below the vacuum level, in a bandwidth of about 15 kHz. Our results are explained well by a linearized dipole interaction between the nanoparticle and the electromagnetic continuum. These ponderomotive correlations open the door to quantum-enhanced sensing and metrology with levitated systems, such as force measurements below the standard quantum limit.},

  abstract     = {Constructing new topological materials is of vital interest for the development of robust quantum applications. However, engineering such materials often causes technological overhead, such as large magnetic fields, spin-orbit coupling, or dynamical superlattice potentials. Simplifying the experimental requirements has been addressed on a conceptual level—by proposing to combine simple lattice structures with Floquet engineering—but there has been no experimental implementation. Here, we demonstrate topological pumping in a Floquet-Bloch band using a plain sinusoidal lattice potential and two-tone driving with frequencies ω and 2 ω . We adiabatically prepare a near-insulating Floquet band of ultracold fermions via a frequency chirp, which avoids gap closings en route from trivial to topological bands. Subsequently, we induce topological pumping by slowly cycling the amplitude and the phase of the 2 ω drive. Our system is well described by an effective Shockley model, establishing a novel paradigm to engineer topological matter from simple underlying lattice geometries. This approach could enable the application of quantized pumping in metrology, following recent experimental advances on two-frequency driving in real materials.},

Interactions between polarized electrons and unpolarized nucleons proportional to g V N g A e σ → · v → and g A N g A e σ → · v → × r → are two such examples, where σ → is the spin of the electrons, r → and v → are position and relative velocity between the polarized electrons and nucleons, g V N / g A N is the vector or axial-vector coupling constant of the nucleon, and g A e is the axial-vector coupling constant of the electron. Such interactions involving a vector or axial-vector coupling g V N / g A N at one vertex and an axial-vector coupling g A e at the polarized electron vertex can be induced by the exchange of spin-1 bosons. We report new experimental upper limits on such exotic spin-velocity-dependent interactions of the electron with nucleons from dedicated experiments based on a recently proposed scheme. We rotationally modulated two ∼ 6 Kg source masses at a frequency of 20 Hz. We used four identical atomic magnetometers in an array form to increase the statistics and cancel the common-mode noise. We applied a data processing method based on high precision numerical integration for the four harmonic frequencies of the signal. We reverse the rotation direction of the source masses to flip the signal due to the new interactions; thus, we can apply the [ + 1 , − 3 , + 3 , − 1 ] weighting method to remove possible slow drifting. Our constraint on the product of vector and axial-vector couplings is | g V N g A e | &lt; 2.1 × 10 − 34 and on the product of axial-vector and axial-vector couplings is | g A N g A e | &lt; 2.4 × 10 − 22 for an interaction range of 10 m. The new constraints on vector-axial-vector interaction improved by as much as more than 4 orders of magnitude and on axial-axial interaction by as much as 2 orders of magnitude in the corresponding interaction range, respectively.},

We consider power-law decaying spin losses with a Lindbladian spectrum closing at small momenta as ∝ q α , with α a positive tunable exponent directly related to the power-law decay of the spatial profile of losses at long distances, 1 / r ( α + d ) . This yields a class of soft modes asymptotically decoupled from dissipation at small momenta, which are responsible for the emergence of a critical scaling regime ascribable to the nonunitary counterpart of the universality class of long-range interacting Ising models. For α &lt; 1 we find a nonequilibrium critical point ruled by a dynamical field theory described by a Langevin model with coexisting inertial ( ∼ ∂ t 2 ) and frictional ( ∼ ∂ t ) kinetic coefficients, and driven by a gapless Markovian noise with variance ∝ q α at small momenta. This effective field theory is beyond the Halperin-Hohenberg description of dynamical criticality, and its critical exponents differ from their unitary long-range counterparts.

By considering an initial state with particles from different components located at the nearest-neighbor sites in the central region of the lattice, we show that in the dynamical evolution of the system, competing intra- and intercomponent on-site repulsion leads to the formation of on-site intercomponent bound states. We find that when the total number of particles is three, an intercomponent pair is favored in the limit of equal intra- and intercomponent interaction strengths. However, when two bosons from each species are considered, intercomponent pairs and trimer are favored depending on the ratios of the intra- and intercomponent interactions.

However, it is unclear how to implement these codes in practice. Seminal results of Bravyi et al. [ Phys. Rev.

Here we address the complementary question of how many long-range interactions are required to implement a quantum LDPC code with parameters k and d . In particular, in 2D we show that a quantum LDPC code with distance d ∝ n 1 / 2 + ϵ requires Ω ( n 1 / 2 + ϵ ) interactions of length Ω ˜ ( n ϵ ) . Further, a code satisfying k ∝ n with distance d ∝ n α requires Ω ˜ ( n ) interactions of length Ω ˜ ( n α / 2 ) . As an application of these results, we consider a model called a stacked architecture, which has previously been considered as a potential way to implement quantum LDPC codes. In this model, although most interactions are local, a few of them are allowed to be very long. We prove that limited long-range connectivity implies quantitative bounds on the distance and code dimension.},

  abstract     = {Quantum low density parity check (LDPC) codes may provide a path to build low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, as general LDPC codes lack geometric constraints, naïve layouts couple many distant qubits with crossing connections which could be hard to build in hardware and could result in performance-degrading crosstalk. We propose a 2D layout for quantum LDPC codes by decomposing their Tanner graphs into a small number of planar layers. Each layer contains long-range connections which do not cross. For any Calderbank-Shor-Steane code with a degree- δ Tanner graph, we design stabilizer measurement circuits with depth at most ( 2 δ + 2 ) using at most ⌈ δ / 2 ⌉ layers. We observe a circuit-noise threshold of 0.28\% for a positive-rate code family using 49 physical qubits per logical qubit. For a physical error rate of 10 − 4 , this family reaches a logical error rate of 10 − 15 using fourteen times fewer physical qubits than the surface code.},

  abstract     = {The security of quantum key distribution (QKD) usually relies on that the users’ devices are well characterized according to the security models made in the security proofs. In contrast, device-independent QKD—an entanglement-based protocol—permits the security even without any knowledge of the underlying quantum devices. Despite its beauty in theory, device-independent QKD is elusive to realize with current technologies. Especially in photonic implementations, the requirements for detection efficiency are far beyond the performance of any reported device-independent experiments. In this Letter, we report a proof-of-principle experiment of device-independent QKD based on a photonic setup in the asymptotic limit. On the theoretical side, we enhance the loss tolerance for real device imperfections by combining different approaches, namely, random postselection, noisy preprocessing, and developed numerical methods to estimate the key rate via the von Neumann entropy. On the experimental side, we develop a high-quality polarization-entangled photon source achieving a state-of-the-art (heralded) detection efficiency about 87.5\%. Although our experiment does not include random basis switching, the achieved efficiency outperforms previous photonic experiments involving loophole-free Bell tests. Together, we show that the measured quantum correlations are strong enough to ensure a positive key rate under the fiber length up to 220 m. Our photonic platform can generate entangled photons at a high rate and in the telecom wavelength, which is desirable for high-speed generation over long distances. The results present an important step toward a full demonstration of photonic device-independent QKD.},

Even freely growing tissues may exhibit a growth instability depending on the intrinsic proliferation rate. Our main result is an explicit calculation of the cell pressure in a homeostatic state of a confined growing tissue.

For all persistence values, the active fluid undergoes a nonequilibrium glass transition at large density.

These techniques allow us to track all the grains’ translations and 3D rotations with accuracy sufficient to infer sliding and rolling displacements. Our observations reveal unique roles played by 3D rotational motions in granular flows. We find that rotations and contact-point motion dominate the dynamics in the bulk, far from the perturbation’s source. Furthermore, we determine that 3D rotations are irreversible under cyclic compression. Consequently, contact-point sliding, which is dissipative, accumulates throughout the cycle. Using numerical simulations whose accuracy our experiment supports, we discover that much of the dissipation occurs in the bulk, where grains rotate more than they translate. Our observations suggest that the analysis of 3D rotations is needed for understanding granular materials’ unique and powerful ability to absorb and dissipate energy.},

Molecular orbital theory analysis reveals that ferroelastic distortion arises when M − d / X − p and M − d / M − d couplings are both sufficiently weak. We have developed a physically interpretable one-dimensional descriptor that correctly predicts 89\% of ferroelastics or nonferroelastics among the examined MX monolayers. Moreover, we find eleven M X compounds that exhibit strongly coupled ferroelasticity and magnetism driven by strain-controlled magnetocrystalline anisotropy, raising the prospects of developing 2D ferroelasticity-based multiferroics.},

  abstract     = {Magic-angle ( θ = 1.0 5 ° ) twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has shown two seemingly contradictory characters: the localization and quantum-dot-like behavior in STM experiments, and delocalization in transport experiments. We construct a model, which naturally captures the two aspects, from the Bistritzer-MacDonald (BM) model in a first principle spirit. A set of local flat-band orbitals ( f ) centered at the A A -stacking regions are responsible to the localization. A set of extended topological semimetallic conduction bands ( c ), which are at small energetic separation from the local orbitals, are responsible to the delocalization and transport. The topological flat bands of the BM model appear as a result of the hybridization of f and c electrons. This model then provides a new perspective for the strong correlation physics, which is now described as strongly correlated f electrons coupled to nearly free c electrons—we hence name our model as the topological heavy fermion model. Using this model, we obtain the U(4) and U ( 4 ) × U ( 4 ) symmetries of Refs. [1–5] as well as the correlated insulator phases and their energies. Simple rules for the ground states and their Chern numbers are derived. Moreover, features such as the large dispersion of the charge ± 1 excitations [2,6,7], and the minima of the charge gap at the Γ M point can now, for the first time, be understood both qualitatively and quantitatively in a simple physical picture. Our mapping opens the prospect of using heavy-fermion physics machinery to the superconducting physics of MATBG.},

By analyzing the extended Hubbard model for this compound using a combined method of numerical simulations based on the time-dependent Schrödinger equation and the Floquet theory, we observe successive dynamical phase transitions from the charge-ordered insulator to a gapless Dirac semimetal and, eventually, to a Chern insulator phase under irradiation with circularly polarized light. These phase transitions occur as a consequence of two major effects of circularly polarized light, i.e., closing of the charge gap through melting the charge order and opening of the topological gap by breaking the time-reversal symmetry at the Dirac points. We demonstrate that these photoinduced phenomena are governed by charge dynamics of driven correlated Dirac electrons.},

We develop a first-principles method to evaluate the transition dipole matrix between excitonic states and combine it with the density functional theory and GW + BSE calculations. We reveal that in graphane the huge exciton binding energy and the large dipole moments of Wannier-like excitons enable us to induce the dipole trap of the order of meV depth and μ m width.

It is now well studied how chemical bondings determine crystal shapes via dependence of surface energies on surface orientations. Meanwhile, discoveries of topological materials have led us to a new paradigm in surface science, and one can expect that topological surface states may affect surface energies and crystal facets in an unconventional way. Here, we show that the surface energy of glide-symmetric topological crystalline insulators (TCI) depends on the surface orientation in a singular way via the parity of the Miller index. This singular surface energy of the TCI affects equilibrium crystal shapes, resulting in emergence of unique crystal facets of the TCI. This singular dependence of the topological surface states is unique to the TCI protected by the glide symmetry in contrast to a TCI protected by a mirror symmetry. In addition, we show that such singular surface states of the TCI protected by the glide symmetries can be realized in KHgSb with first-principles calculations. Our results provide a basis for designs and manipulations of crystal facets by using symmetry and topology.},

We establish a noncontact method with a circular cavity resonator and detect the real and imaginary parts of the longitudinal and Hall conductivities at a microwave frequency in magnetic fields. The conventional Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations and QH plateaus are observed in the real parts of longitudinal and Hall conductivities, respectively, while periodic structures can be seen in the imaginary parts which are scaled by the QH filling factor. The latter originates from intra-Landau level transitions between different orbital angular momenta. The results demonstrate that the dynamical conductivity measurement provides microscopic information which is not accessible by conventional static methods. The present noncontact method would pave the way to reveal the electron dynamics in other two-dimensional systems such as twisted bilayer graphene.},

Our experiment shows that, for a walker traveling around a closed loop along the boundary in real space, its spin evolves and winds through a great circle on the Bloch sphere, which implies that edge-spin texture has nontrivial winding. This topological spin winding is protected by a chiral-like symmetry emerging for the low-energy Hamiltonian. Our experiment confirms that two-dimensional anomalous Floquet topological systems exhibit topological spin texture on the boundary, which could inspire novel topology-based spintronic phenomena and devices.},

Here, we develop an algorithmic framework that can directly learn the full spectrum of segregation energies for a metal solute atom in a metal polycrystal from ab initio methods, bypassing the need for alloy interatomic potentials. This framework offers a pathway to a comprehensive catalog of GB solute segregation with quantum accuracy, for the entire alloy space.

Here, we report the formation of 2D BHI on gold surfaces with 1D corrugation, using noncontact atomic force microscopy. The hexagonal arrangement of the first wetting layer was visualized on the Au(110)- 1 × 2 surface. Upon depositing more water molecules, the first layer would rearrange and shrink, resulting in the formation of buckled BHI. Such a buckled BHI is hydrophobic despite the appearance of dangling OH, due to the strong interlayer bonding. Furthermore, the BHI is also stable on the Au(100)- 5 × 2 8 surface. This work reveals the unexpected generality of the BHI on corrugated surfaces with nonhexagonal symmetry, thus shedding new light on the microscopic understandings of the low-dimensional ice formation on solid surfaces or under confinement.},

  abstract     = {Kinetic instabilities driven by runaway electrons (REs) have recently received attention in the fusion community as a means to control and diagnose REs in a tokamak. Experiments aimed at studying such kinetic instabilities have been performed at the Frascati Tokamak Upgrade (FTU), where different families of waves have been identified, from wide-band bursting emissions to quasi-monochromatic waves and sharp lines, in the presence of REs with energies from a few to tens of MeV. A specific family of waves with intense kinetic drive was directly observed for the first time, during both the early Ohmic plasma start-up and the current ramp-up. A clear wave frequency scaling with respect to the electron density was demonstrated. This scaling, with the complementary analysis of signals observed at different magnetic fields, allowed the identification of these instabilities as lower-hybrid waves. The relevant analysis shown in this Letter is based on a continuous intrashot detection of the RE-driven wave, which is reported for the first time for this kind of instability. We demonstrated that unstable waves are excited already at the very beginning of a tokamak discharge, opening the way to new possible research on the exploitation of this kind of measurement for monitoring seed REs formation at the early plasma stage, while most diagnostics still have limited capabilities. The conditions for plasma wave dispersion at the early phase of the FTU discharge are very similar to the ones expected during the ITER start-up, when analogous instabilities might, hence, come to light, in case of formation of suprathermal populations.},

The observed HH frequency is around ten times the fundamental rf driving frequency, but lower than the electron plasma frequency. A theory is constructed which indicates that stream plasma interaction-induced instability is the mechanism of HH generation in the collisional regime. The HH frequency and its corresponding growth rate of the HH oscillation amplitude from the theory are in good agreement with kinetic particle-in-cell simulations.},

  abstract     = {That disorder can induce nontrivial topology is a surprising discovery in topological physics. As a typical example, Chern topological Anderson insulators (TAIs) have been realized in photonic systems, where the topological phases exist without symmetry protection. In this Letter, by taking transverse magnetic and transverse electric polarizations as pseudospin degrees of freedom, we theoretically propose a scheme to realize disorder-induced symmetry-protected topological phase transitions in two-dimensional photonic crystals with a combined time-reversal, mirror, and duality symmetry T f = T M z D . In particular, we demonstrate that the disorder-induced symmetry-protected topological phase persists even without pseudospin conservation, thereby realizing a photonic Z 2 TAI, in contrast to a Z -classified quantum spin Hall (QSH) TAI with decoupled spins. By formulating a new scattering approach, we show that the topology of both the QSH and Z 2 TAIs can be manifested by the accumulated spin rotations of the reflected waves from the photonic crystals. Using a transmission structure, we also illustrate the trivialization of a disordered QSH phase with an even integer topological index caused by spin coupling.},

  abstract     = {In periodic systems, nodal lines are loops in the three-dimensional momentum space with each point on them representing a band degeneracy. Nodal lines exhibit rich topological features, as they can take various configurations such as rings, links, chains, and knots. These line nodes are generally protected by mirror or P T symmetry and frequently accompanied by drumhead surface states. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel type of photonic straight nodal lines in a D 2 D metacrystal, which are protected by an unusual rotoinversion time (roto- P T ) symmetry. These nodal lines are located at the central axis and hinges of the Brillouin zone. They appear as quadrupole sources of Berry curvature flux in contrast to the Weyl points, which are monopoles. Interestingly, topological surface states exist at all three cutting surfaces, as guaranteed by π -quantized Zak phases along all three directions. As frequency changes, the surface state equifrequency contours evolve from closed to open and become straight lines at a critical transition frequency, at which diffractionless surface wave propagations are experimentally demonstrated, paving the way toward development of superimaging topological devices.},

The wave packets propagate at the speed of the longitudinal acoustic phonon, creating standing waves up to 0.26 THz for a 6.4 nm thin Au film on mica. The ultrafast lattice displacement can be as large as 5 pm and is precisely controlled by varying the tip-sample distance.

The accurate determination of this radiative capture rate requires the quantitative and predictive description of the fusion probability across the big bang energy window ( 30 keV ≲ E ≲ 400 keV ), where measurements are hindered by low counting rates. We present first-principle (or, ab initio ) predictions of the He 4 ( d , γ ) Li 6 astrophysical S factor using validated nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon interactions derived within the framework of chiral effective field theory. By employing the ab initio no-core shell model with continuum to describe He 4 − d scattering dynamics and bound Li 6 product on an equal footing, we accurately and consistently determine the contributions of the main electromagnetic transitions driving the radiative capture process. Our results reveal an enhancement of the capture probability below 100 keV owing to previously neglected magnetic dipole ( M 1 ) transitions and reduce by an average factor of 7 the uncertainty of the thermonuclear capture rate between 0.002 and 2 GK.},

We propose that the puzzling excited state found above the 1 + scissors state in Gd 156 [ Phys. Rev.

This implies that the conformal field theory (CFT) dual of gravity on a de Sitter space at the leading semiclassical order is given by an SU(2) Wess-Zumino-Witten model in the large central charge limit k → − 2 . We give another evidence for this in the light of known holography for coset CFTs. We also present a higher spin gravity extension of our duality.},

We discuss this phenomenon with a particular focus on reinterpreting the results of axion haloscopes based on lumped-element detectors, which probe GWs in the 100 kHz–100 MHz range. Measurements from ABRACADABRA and SHAFT already place bounds on GWs, although the present strain sensitivity is weak. However, we demonstrate that the sensitivity scaling with the volume of such instruments is significant—faster than for axions—and so rapid progress will be made in the future. With no modifications, DMRadio- m 3 will have a GW strain sensitivity of h ∼ 10 − 20 at 200 MHz. A simple modification of the pickup loop used to readout the induced magnetic flux can parametrically enhance the GW sensitivity, particularly at lower frequencies.},

The algorithm can be deployed to solve complex optimization problems in out-of-equilibrium setups and it returns explicit elementary control sequences realizing optimal transformations. We illustrate this by finding optimal protocols in the context of cooling, work extraction, and catalysis. The same tools also allow one to quantitatively assess the role played by memory effects in the performance of thermodynamic protocols. We obtained exhaustive solutions on a laptop machine for systems with dimension d ≤ 7 , but with heuristic methods one could access much higher d .},

It adversely affects the quality of quantum operations and can be detrimental in scalable quantum information processing. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a practically extensible approach for complete cancellation of residual Z Z interaction between fixed-frequency transmon qubits, which are known for long coherence and simple control. We apply to the intermediate coupler that connects the qubits a weak microwave drive at a properly chosen frequency in order to noninvasively induce an ac Stark shift for Z Z cancellation. We verify the cancellation performance by measuring vanishing two-qubit entangling phases and Z Z correlations. In addition, we implement a randomized benchmarking experiment to extract the idling gate fidelity which shows good agreement with the coherence limit, demonstrating the effectiveness of Z Z cancellation. Our method allows independent addressability of each qubit-qubit connection and is applicable to both nontunable and tunable couplers, promising better compatibility with future large-scale quantum processors.},

For qubit operation in a frequency heralded mode, we observe a 40-fold increase in coherence time without resorting to dynamic nuclear polarization. We also demonstrate active frequency feedback with quantum oscillation visibility, single-shot measurement fidelity, and gate fidelity of 97.7\%, 99\%, and 99.6\%, respectively, showcasing the improvements in the overall capabilities of GaAs-based spin qubits.

  abstract     = {Angular oscillations can provide a useful probe of the superfluid properties of a system. Such measurements have recently been applied to dipolar supersolids, which exhibit both density modulation and phase coherence, and for which robust probes of superfluidity are particularly interesting. So far, these investigations have been confined to linear droplet arrays, which feature relatively simple excitation spectra, but limited sensitivity to the effects of superfluidity. Here, we explore angular oscillations in systems with 2D structure which, in principle, have greater sensitivity to superfluidity. In both experiment and simulation, we find that the interplay of superfluid and crystalline excitations leads to a frequency of angular oscillations that remains nearly unchanged even when the superfluidity of the system is altered dramatically. This indicates that angular oscillation measurements do not always provide a robust experimental probe of superfluidity with typical experimental protocols.},

In contrast to previous studies, we find that the damping and noise correlations possess long-time tails with exponents that depend on the tracer symmetry. For generic tracers, shape asymmetry induces ratchet effects that alter fluctuations and lead to superdiffusion and friction that grows with time when the tracer is dragged at a constant speed. In the singular limit of a completely symmetric tracer, we recover normal diffusion and finite friction. Furthermore, for small symmetric tracers, the active contribution to the friction becomes negative: active particles enhance motion rather than oppose it. These results show that, in low-dimensional systems, the motion of a passive tracer in an active bath cannot be modeled as a persistent random walker with a finite correlation time.},

The desired function often depends on the SOI-generated phase that is accumulated by the wave function of an electron as it passes through the device. This phase, known as the Aharonov-Casher phase, therefore depends on both the device geometry and the SOI strength. Here, we propose a method for directly measuring the Aharonov-Casher phase generated in an SOI-active weak link, based on the Aharonov-Casher-phase dependent anisotropy of its magnetoconductance. Specifically, we consider weak links in which the Rashba interaction is caused by an external electric field, but our method is expected to apply also for other forms of the spin-orbit coupling. Measuring this magnetoconductance anisotropy thus allows calibrating Rashba spintronic devices by an external electric field that tunes the spin-orbit interaction and hence the Aharonov-Casher phase.},

Here we scrutinize this effect for devices composed of narrow zigzag GNRs taking explicitly into account the role of Coulomb repulsion that leads to spin-polarized edge states within mean-field theory. We show that the beam-splitting effect survives the opening of the well-known correlation gap and, more strikingly, that a spin-dependent scattering potential emerges which spin polarizes the transmitted electrons in the two outputs. By studying different ribbons and intersection angles we provide evidence that this is a general feature with edge-polarized nanoribbons. A near-perfect polarization can be achieved by joining several junctions in series. Our findings suggest that GNRs are interesting building blocks in spintronics and quantum technologies with applications for interferometry and entanglement.},

The magnet’s stray field couples to the qubit via a superconducting quantum interference device. We predict a resonant magnon-qubit exchange and a nonlinear radiation-pressure interaction that are both stronger than dissipation rates and tunable by an external flux bias. We additionally demonstrate a quantum control scheme that generates magnon-qubit entanglement and magnonic Schrödinger cat states with high fidelity.},

  abstract     = {The Kitaev model is a fascinating example of an exactly solvable model displaying a spin-liquid ground state in two dimensions. However, deviations from the original Kitaev model are expected to appear in real materials. In this Letter, we investigate the fate of Kitaev’s spin liquid in the presence of disorder—bond defects or vacancies—for an extended version of the model. Considering static flux backgrounds, we observe a power-law divergence in the low-energy limit of the density of states with a nonuniversal exponent. We link this power-law distribution of energy scales to weakly coupled droplets inside the bulk, in an uncanny similarity to the Griffiths phase often present in the vicinity of disordered quantum phase transitions. If time-reversal symmetry is broken, we find that power-law singularities are tied to the destruction of the topological phase of the Kitaev model in the presence of bond disorder alone. However, there is a transition from this topologically trivial phase with power-law singularities to a topologically nontrivial one for weak to moderate site dilution. Therefore, diluted Kitaev materials are potential candidates to host Kitaev’s chiral spin-liquid phase.},

Complete understanding of single-pulse switching is missing due to the lack of an established theory accurately describing the transition to the nonequilibrium reversal path induced by femtosecond laser photoexcitation. In this work, we present general macroscopic theory for the magnetization dynamics of ferrimagnetic materials upon femtosecond laser excitation. Our theory reproduces quantitatively all stages of the switching process observed in experiments. We directly compare our theory to computer simulations using atomistic spin dynamics methods for both GdFeCo and Mn 2 Ru x Ga alloys. We provide explicit expressions for the magnetization relaxation rates in terms of microscopic parameters, which allows us to propose universal criteria for switching in ferrimagnets.},

It is mediated by an orbital degree of freedom but does not require inversion asymmetry or impurity spin-orbit scattering. Analytic and tight-binding models reveal that it originates mainly from k points where bands with different spins and different orbitals are nearly degenerate, and thus it has no counterpart in normal metals. First-principle calculations for centrosymmetric 3 d transition-metal ferromagnets show that the spin swapping conductivity of band structure origin can be comparable in magnitude to the intrinsic spin Hall conductivity of Pt. Our theory generalizes transverse spin currents generated by ferromagnets and emphasizes the important role of the orbital degree of freedom in describing spin-orbit-coupled transport in centrosymmetric materials.},

Motivated by fault-tolerant quantum-computing applications in this setting, we introduce a dynamical anyon-generation protocol that exploits universal edge physics. The setup features holes in the spin liquid, which define energetically cheap locations for non-Abelian anyons, connected by a narrow bridge that can be tuned between spin liquid and topologically trivial phases. We show that modulating the bridge from trivial to spin liquid over intermediate time scales—quantified by analytics and extensive simulations—deposits non-Abelian anyons into the holes with O ( 1 ) probability. The required bridge manipulations can be implemented by integrating the Kitaev material into magnetic tunnel junction arrays that engender locally tunable exchange fields. Combined with existing readout strategies, our protocol reveals a path to topological qubit experiments in Kitaev materials at zero applied magnetic field.},

Here, we theoretically propose that NiAsO 3 and PdSbO 3 , monolayer transitional metal oxides, can realize QAHE with tunable Chern numbers via manipulating their magnetization orientations. When the magnetization lies in the x − y plane and all mirror symmetries are broken, the low-Chern-number (i.e., C = ± 1 ) phase emerges. When the magnetization exhibits nonzero z -direction component, the system enters the high-Chern-number (i.e., C = ± 3 ) phase, even in the presence of canted magnetization. The global band gap can approach the room-temperature energy scale in monolayer PdSbO 3 (23.4 meV), when the magnetization is aligned to z direction. By using Wannier-based tight-binding model, we establish the phase diagram of magnetization induced topological phase transition. Our work provides a high-temperature QAHE system with tunable Chern number for the practical electronic application.},

An exciting example is an anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) Wigner solid (WS), where electrons form an ordered array with an anisotropic lattice structure. Such a state has eluded experiments up to now as its realization is extremely demanding: First, a WS entails very low densities where the Coulomb interaction dominates over the kinetic (Fermi) energy. Attaining such low densities while keeping the disorder low is very challenging. Second, the low-density requirement has to be fulfilled in a material that hosts an anisotropic Fermi sea. Here, we report transport measurements in a clean (low-disorder) 2D electron system with anisotropic effective mass and Fermi sea. The data reveal that at extremely low electron densities, when the r s parameter, the ratio of the Coulomb to the Fermi energy, exceeds ≃ 38 , the current-voltage characteristics become strongly nonlinear at small dc biases. Several key features of the nonlinear characteristics, including their anisotropic voltage thresholds, are consistent with the formation of a disordered, anisotropic WS pinned by the ubiquitous disorder potential.},

Whether these positrons are polarized has not yet been reported, limiting their potential applications. Here, by polarized QED particle-in-cell simulations including electron-positron spin and photon polarization effects, we investigate a typical laser-solid setup that an ultraintense linearly polarized laser irradiates a foil target with micrometer-scale-length preplasmas. We find that once the positron yield becomes appreciable with the laser intensity exceeding 10 24 W / cm 2 , the positrons are obviously polarized. Around 30 nC positrons can acquire &gt; 30\% polarization degree with a flux of 10 12 sr − 1 . The angle-dependent polarization is attributed to the asymmetrical laser fields that positrons undergo near the skin layer of overdense plasmas, where radiative spin flip and radiation reaction play significant roles. The polarization mechanism is robust and could generally appear in future 100-PW-class laser-solid experiments.},

  abstract     = {We have demonstrated the resonant control of the elastic scattering cross sections in the vicinity of Feshbach resonances between Na 23 K 40 molecules and K 40 atoms by studying the thermalization between them. The elastic scattering cross sections vary by more than 2 orders of magnitude close to the resonance, and can be well described by an asymmetric Fano profile. The parameters that characterize the magnetically tunable s -wave scattering length are determined from the elastic scattering cross sections. The observation of resonantly controlled elastic scattering cross sections opens up the possibility to study strongly interacting atom-molecule mixtures and improve our understanding of the complex atom-molecule Feshbach resonances.},

In this study, a simple and highly sensitive optical electric field measurement is demonstrated in high-pressure hydrogen by performing electric-field-induced coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (E-CARS) in the visible region. The minimum detectable electric field is 0.5 V / mm at atmospheric pressure. This method does not require excited or atomic species and shows a considerably higher sensitivity than those demonstrated by the commonly applied E-CARS method in the infrared region and electric-field-induced second-harmonic generation. This method can be applied to various Raman-active molecules.},

The reaction is triggered by a linearly time-dependent transition throughout the Feshbach resonance. Our solution predicts a dependence, with a dynamic phase transition, of the reaction efficiency on the transition rate for both atoms-to-molecule pairing and molecular dissociation processes. We find that for the latter process with a linear energy dispersion of atomic modes, the emerging phase can have a thermalized energy distribution of noninteracting bosons with the temperature defined by the rate of the transition. This provides a simple interpretation of the phase transition in terms of the creation of equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate.},

We show that the strong coupling problem can be circumvented in the framework of the so-called U-DHOST theories, in which the degeneracy is partially broken in such a way that higher-derivative terms are degenerate only in the unitary gauge. In this sense, the scordatura effect is built-in in U-DHOST theories in general. There is an apparent Ostrogradsky mode in U-DHOST theories, but it does not propagate as it satisfies a three-dimensional elliptic differential equation on a spacelike hypersurface. We also clarify how this nonpropagating mode, i.e., the “shadowy” mode shows up at the nonlinear level.},

We also show that, for slowly accelerating black holes, the angular position of images in the gravitational lensing effects does not change significantly. We propose a method to observe the acceleration of these black holes through gravitational lensing.

Here, we report on the first successful 10 dB sensitivity enhancement of a shot-noise limited tabletop Michelson interferometer via squeezed light in the fundamental Gaussian laser mode, where we also implement the balanced homodyne detection scheme that is planned for the third GWD generation. In addition, we achieved a similarly strong quantum noise reduction when the interferometer was operated in higher-order Hermite-Gaussian modes, which are discussed for the GWD thermal noise mitigation. Our results are an important step toward the targeted quantum noise level in future GWDs and, moreover, represent significant progress in the application of nonclassical states in higher-order modes for interferometry, increased spatial resolution, and multichannel sensing.},

Compared with short-range interacting systems, the eigenstate expectation value of a generic local observable is shown to deviate significantly from its microcanonical ensemble average for long-range interacting systems.

Here, we experimentally implement an error-correcting surface code, the distance-three surface code which consists of 17 qubits, on the Zuchongzhi 2.1 superconducting quantum processor. By executing several consecutive error correction cycles, the logical error can be significantly reduced after applying corrections, achieving the repeated error correction of surface code for the first time. This experiment represents a fully functional instance of an error-correcting surface code, providing a key step on the path towards scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing.},

We show that noise with positive temporal correlations corresponds to our single photon undergoing a dynamical regime enabled by the quantum Zeno effect (QZE), whereas noise characterized by negative (anti) correlations corresponds to regimes associated with the anti-Zeno effect (AZE). This is the first step toward a novel noise spectroscopy based on QZE and AZE in single-photon state probing able to extract information on the noise while protecting the probe state, a conceptual paradigm shift with respect to traditional interferometric measurements.},

Up to 25\% spin-valley polarization is observed at pump-probe separations up to 20 μ m . Characteristic spin-valley diffusion lengths of 1 8 ± 3 μ m are revealed at low temperatures.

Symmetry arguments combined with static lattice first-principles calculations suggest an ideal 100\% valley polarization in transition-metal dichalcogenides under circularly polarized light. However, experimental reports of the valley polarization range from 32\% to almost 100\%. Possible explanations for this discrepancy include phonon-mediated transitions, which would place a fundamental limit to valley polarization, and defect-mediated transitions, which could, in principle, be reduced with cleaner samples. We explore the phonon-mediated fundamental limit by performing calculations of phonon-mediated optical absorption for circularly polarized light entirely from the first principles. We also use group theory to reveal the microscopic mechanisms behind the phonon-mediated excitations, discovering contributions from several individual phonon modes and from multiphonon processes. Overall, our calculations show that the phonon-limited valley polarization is around 70\% at room temperature for state-of-the-art valleytronic materials including MoSe 2 , MoS 2 , WS 2 , WSe 2 , and MoTe 2 . This fundamental limit implies that sufficiently pure transition-metal dichalcogenides are ideal candidates for valleytronics applications.},

We demonstrate it here by observing the emergence of a continuously tunable 12-layer spatial spin modulation when distorting the square-lattice planes in the quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnetic Sr 2 Ir O 4 under in situ shear strain. This translation-symmetry-breaking phase is a result of an unusual strain-activated anisotropic interaction which is at the fourth order and competing with the inherent quadratic anisotropic interaction. Such a mechanism of competing anisotropy is distinct from that among the ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and/or the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, and it could be widely applicable and highly controllable in low-dimensional magnets.},

Key for this Letter, the density of topological defects remains small, on the order of 1\% or less, and negligible compared to the density of Faraday loops. This is made possible by replacing the spin degree of freedom used in conventional lattices of interacting nanomagnets by a micromagnetic knob, which can be finely tuned to adjust the vertex energy directly, rather than modifying the two-body interactions.},

Notably, a reversible spin switching between the S = 1 and S = 3 / 2 states is achieved by a gate electrode. We can trace the origin to a strong hybridization between the Fe − d z 2 and B − p z orbitals. Combining density functional theory with nonequilibrium Green’s function formalism, we propose an experimentally feasible three-terminal setup to probe the spin state. Furthermore, we show how the in-plane quantum transport for the BG, which is non–spin polarized, can be modified by FeTPP, yielding a significant transport spin polarization near the Fermi energy ( &gt; 10\% for typical coverage).

To date, such a database for topological superconductors is yet to be achieved because of the lack of information about pairing symmetries of realistic materials. In this Letter, sidestepping this issue, we tackle an alternative problem: the predictions of topological and nodal superconductivity in materials for each single-valued representation of point groups. Based on recently developed symmetry indicators for superconductors, we provide comprehensive mappings from pairing symmetries to the topological or nodal superconducting nature for nonmagnetic materials listed in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database. We quantitatively show that around 90\% of computed materials are topological or nodal superconductors when a pairing that belongs to a one-dimensional nontrivial representation of point groups is assumed. When materials are representation-enforced nodal superconductors, positions and shapes of the nodes are also identified. When combined with experiments, our results will help us understand the pairing mechanism and facilitate realizations of the long-sought Majorana fermions promising for topological quantum computations.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic molecules on surfaces have been widely investigated to reveal delicate interfacial couplings and for potential technological applications. In these endeavors, one prevailing challenge is how to preserve or recover the molecular spins, especially on highly metallic substrates that can readily quench the magnetic moments of the admolecules. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to exploit the semimetallic nature of antimony and observe, surprisingly yet pleasantly, that the spin of Co-phthalocyanine is well preserved on Sb(111), as unambiguously evidenced by the emergent strong Kondo resonance across the molecule. Our first-principles calculations further confirm that the optimal density of states near the Fermi level of the semimetal is a decisive factor, weakening the overall interfacial coupling, while still ensuring sufficiently effective electron-spin scattering in the many-body system. Beyond isolated admolecules, we discover that each of the magnetic moments in a molecular dimer or a densely packed island is distinctly preserved as well, rendering such molecular magnets immense potentials for ultrahigh density memory devices.},

  abstract     = {Within the mature field of Anderson transitions, the critical properties of the integer quantum Hall transition still pose a significant challenge. Numerical studies of the transition suffer from strong corrections to scaling for most observables. In this Letter, we suggest to overcome this problem by using the longitudinal conductance g of the network model as the scaling observable, which we compute for system sizes nearly 2 orders of magnitude larger than in previous studies. We show numerically that the sizable corrections to scaling of g can be accounted for in a remarkably simple form, which leads to an excellent scaling collapse. Surprisingly, the scaling function turns out to be indistinguishable from a Gaussian. We propose a cost-function-based approach and estimate ν = 2.609 ( 7 ) for the localization length exponent, consistent with previous results, but considerably more precise than in most works on this problem. Extending previous approaches for Hamiltonian models, we also confirm our finding using integrated conductance as a scaling variable.},

We identify a network of band crossings comprising topological nodal planes, multifold degeneracies, and Weyl points consistent with the fermion doubling theorem. To confirm these findings, we combined the general analysis of the band topology of SG 198 with Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations and material-specific calculations of the electronic structure and Berry curvature. The observation of two nearly dispersionless Shubnikov–de Haas frequency branches provides unambiguous evidence of four Fermi surface sheets at the R point that reflect the symmetry-enforced orthogonality of the underlying wave functions at the intersections with the nodal planes. Hence, irrespective of the spin-orbit coupling strength, SG 198 features always six- and fourfold degenerate crossings at R and Γ that are intimately connected to the topological charges distributed across the network.},

However, existing results show significant discrepancies on the anisotropic factor, i.e., the ratio between zigzag (ZZ) and armchair (AC) directions, G ZZ / G AC , both qualitatively and quantitatively. Here, we investigate the anisotropic fracture of graphene by atomic steps on cleaved graphite surfaces. Depending on the relation between the peeling direction and local lattice orientation, two categories of steps with different structures and behaviors are observed. In one category are straight steps well aligned with local ZZ directions, while in the other are steps consisting of nanoscale ZZ and AC segments. Combined with an analysis on fracture mechanics, the microscale morphology of steps and statistics of their directions provides a measurement on the anisotropic factor of G ZZ / G AC = 0.9 7 1 , suggesting that the ZZ direction has a slightly lower fracture toughness. The results provide an experimental benchmark for the widely scattered existing results, and offer constraints on future models of graphene fracture.},

  abstract     = {In classical viscous fluids, turbulent eddies are known to be responsible for the rapid spreading of embedded particles. However, in inviscid quantum fluids where the turbulence is induced by a chaotic tangle of quantized vortices, dispersion of the particles can be achieved via a nonclassical mechanism, i.e., their binding to the evolving vortices. However, knowledge on how the vortices diffuse and spread in quantum-fluid turbulence is very limited, especially for the so-called ultraquantum turbulence (UQT) generated by a random tangle of vortices. Here we report a systematic numerical study of the apparent diffusion of vortices in UQT in superfluid helium-4 using the full Biot-Savart simulation. We reveal that the vortices in the superfluid exhibit a universal anomalous diffusion (superdiffusion) at small times, which transits to normal diffusion at large times. This behavior is found to be the result of a generic scaling property of the vortex velocity. Our simulation at finite temperatures also nicely reproduces recent experimental observations. The knowledge obtained from this study may form the base for understanding turbulent transport and universal vortex dynamics in various quantum fluids.},

Regarding the specific possibility of beam spray occurring outside the laser entrance holes of an indirectly driven hohlraum, this shift may be the most concerning feature owing to the high sensitivity of crossed-beam energy transfer to the interacting beam wavelengths in the subsequent overlap region.},

  abstract     = {How the neighbor effect plays its role in the fragmentation of molecular clusters attracts great attention for physicists and chemists. Here, we study this effect in the fragmentation of N 2 O dimer by performing three-body coincidence measurements on the femtosecond timescale. Rotations of bound N 2 O + triggered by neutral or ionic neighbors are tracked. The forbidden dissociation path between B 2 Π and Π 4 is opened by the spin-exchange effect due to the existence of neighbor ions, leading to a new channel of N 2 O + → NO + N + originating from B Π 2 . The formation and dissociation of the metastable product N 3 O 2 + from two ion-molecule reaction channels are tracked in real time, and the corresponding trajectories are captured. Our results demonstrate a significant and promising step towards the understanding of neighbor roles in the reactions within clusters.},

Using efficient lattice Monte Carlo algorithms, we demonstrate how a Hamiltonian model of spin- 1 2 degrees of freedom on a two-dimensional spatial lattice reproduces both the infrared sector for arbitrary θ , as well as the ultraviolet physics of asymptotic freedom. Furthermore, as a model of qubits on a two-dimensional square lattice with only nearest-neighbor interactions, it is naturally suited for studying the physics of θ vacua and asymptotic freedom on near-term quantum devices. Our construction generalizes to θ vacua in all C P ( N − 1 ) models, solving a long-standing sign problem.},

For the first time, a four-particle cumulant method is used to extract the second Fourier coefficient of the azimuthal distribution ( v 2 ) of D 0 mesons as a function of event centrality and the D 0 transverse momentum. The ratios of the four-particle v 2 values to previously measured two-particle cumulant results provide direct experimental access to event-by-event fluctuations of charm quark azimuthal anisotropies. These ratios are also found to be comparable to those of inclusive charged particles in the event. However, hints of deviations are seen in the most central and peripheral collisions. To investigate the origin of flow fluctuations in the charm sector, these measurements are compared to a model implementing fluctuations of charm quark energy loss via collisional or radiative processes in the quark-gluon plasma. These models cannot quantitatively describe the data over the full transverse momentum and centrality ranges, although the calculations with collisional energy loss provide a better description of the data.},

An engineering run with 120 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and 17.9 × 10 20 protons on target (POT) was performed in fall 2019 to study the characteristics of the CCM detector. The operation of this 10-ton detector was strictly light based with a threshold of 50 keV and used coherent elastic scattering off argon nuclei to detect DM. Despite only 1.5 months of accumulated luminosity, contaminated LAr, and nonoptimized shielding, CCM’s first engineering run has already achieved sensitivity to previously unexplored parameter space of light dark matter models with a baryonic vector portal. With an expected background of 115 005 events, we observe 115 005 + 16.5 events which is compatible with background expectations. For a benchmark mediator-to-DM mass ratio of m V B / m χ = 2.1 , DM masses within the range 9 MeV ≲ m χ ≲ 50 MeV are excluded at 90\% C. L. in the leptophobic model after applying the Feldman-Cousins test statistic. CCM’s upgraded run with 200 PMTs, filtered LAr, improved shielding, and 10 times more POT will be able to exclude the remaining thermal relic density parameter space of this model, as well as probe new parameter space of other leptophobic DM models.},

  abstract     = {Rényi entropies, S n , admit a natural generalization in the presence of global symmetries. These “charged Rényi entropies” are functions of the chemical potential μ conjugate to the charge contained in the entangling region and reduce to the usual notions as μ → 0 . For n = 1 , this provides a notion of charged entanglement entropy. In this Letter, we prove that for a general d ( ≥ 3 ) -dimensional conformal field theory, the leading correction to the uncharged entanglement entropy across a spherical entangling surface is quadratic in the chemical potential, positive definite, and universally controlled (up to fixed d -dependent constants) by the coefficients C J and a 2 . These fully characterize, for a given theory, the current correlators ⟨ J J ⟩ and ⟨ T J J ⟩ , as well as the energy flux measured at infinity produced by the insertion of the current operator. Our result is motivated by analytic holographic calculations for a special class of higher-curvature gravities coupled to a ( d − 2 ) form in general dimensions as well as for free fields in d = 4 . A proof for general theories and dimensions follows from previously known universal identities involving the magnetic response of twist operators introduced in A. Belin et al. [ J. High Energy Phys. 12 ( 2013 ) 059 .] and basic thermodynamic relations.},

As a concrete example, we consider a dark matter particle of arbitrary spin that interacts with the standard model via a massive dark photon, accounting for an arbitrary number of light degrees of freedom in the dark sector. We exclude dark matter masses below ∼ 4 MeV at 95\% confidence for all dark matter spins and dark photon masses. These bounds hold regardless of additional new light, inert degrees of freedom in the dark sector, and for dark matter-electron scattering cross sections many orders of magnitude below current experimental constraints. The strength of these constraints will only continue to improve with future CMB experiments.},

These are the first such measurements independent of the cosmic microwave background fluctuations. We perform a consistent analysis that includes all necessary nonlinear corrections generated by NLPNG and vary all relevant cosmological and nuisance parameters in a global fit to the data. Our conservative analysis yields joint limits on the amplitudes of the equilateral and orthogonal shapes, f NL equil = 940 ± 600 and f NL ortho = − 170 ± 170 (both at 68\% CL). These can be used to derive constraints on coefficients of the effective single-field inflationary Lagrangian; in particular, we find that the sound speed of inflaton fluctuations has the bound c s ≥ 0.013 at 95\% CL. Fixing the quadratic galaxy bias and cosmological parameters, the constraints can be tightened to f NL equil = 260 ± 300 and f NL ortho = − 23 ± 120 (68\% CL).},

  abstract     = {Recent experimental observation of weak ergodicity breaking in Rydberg atom quantum simulators has sparked interest in quantum many-body scars—eigenstates which evade thermalization at finite energy densities due to novel mechanisms that do not rely on integrability or protection by a global symmetry. A salient feature of some quantum many-body scars is their subvolume bipartite entanglement entropy. In this Letter, we demonstrate that such exact many-body scars also possess extensive multipartite entanglement structure if they stem from an su(2) spectrum generating algebra. We show this analytically, through scaling of the quantum Fisher information, which is found to be superextensive for exact scarred eigenstates in contrast to generic thermal states. Furthermore, we numerically study signatures of multipartite entanglement in the PXP model of Rydberg atoms, showing that extensive quantum Fisher information density can be generated dynamically by performing a global quench experiment. Our results identify a rich multipartite correlation structure of scarred states with significant potential as a resource in quantum enhanced metrology.},

Considering the rapid growth of available quantum resources that are not fully fault tolerant, it is crucial to develop practical hardware-friendly quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques to suppress unwanted errors. Here, we propose a novel generalized quantum subspace expansion method which can handle stochastic, coherent, and algorithmic errors in quantum computers. By fully exploiting the substantially extended subspace, we can efficiently mitigate the noise present in the spectra of a given Hamiltonian, without relying on any information of noise. The performance of our method is discussed under two highly practical setups: the quantum subspaces are mainly spanned by powers of the noisy state ρ m and a set of error-boosted states, respectively. We numerically demonstrate in both situations that we can suppress errors by orders of magnitude, and show that our protocol inherits the advantages of previous error-agnostic QEM techniques as well as overcoming their drawbacks.},

Integrable models offer the framework to develop this understanding. We communicate the design of interferometric protocols for an integrable model that describes the interaction of bosons in a four-site configuration. Analytic formulas for the quantum dynamics of certain observables are computed. These expose the system’s functionality as both an interferometric identifier, and producer, of NOON states. Being equivalent to a controlled-phase gate acting on 2 hybrid qudits, this system also highlights an equivalence between Heisenberg-limited interferometry and quantum information.

  abstract     = {Although the transport and mixing of proteins and other molecules inside bacteria rely on the diffusion of molecules, many aspects of the molecular diffusion in bacterial cytoplasm remain unclear or controversial, including how the diffusion-temperature relation follows the Stokes-Einstein equation. In this study, we applied single-particle tracking photoactivated localization microscopy to investigate the diffusion of histonelike nucleoid structuring (HNS) proteins and free dyes in bacterial cytoplasm at different temperatures. Although the diffusion of HNS proteins in both live and dead bacteria increased at higher temperatures and appeared to follow the Arrhenius equation, the diffusion of free dyes decreased at higher temperatures, questioning the previously proposed theories based on superthermal fluctuations. To understand the measured diffusion-temperature relations, we developed an alternative model, in which the bacterial cytoplasm is considered as a polymeric network or mesh. In our model, the Stokes-Einstein equation remains valid, while the polymeric network contributes a significant term to the viscosity experienced by the molecules diffusing in bacterial cytoplasm. Our model was successful in predicting the diffusion-temperature relations for both HNS proteins and free dyes in bacteria. In addition, we systematically examined the predicted diffusion-temperature relations with different parameters in the model, and predicted the possible existence of phase transitions.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we revisit the fragile-to-strong transition (FTS) in the simulated BKS silica from the perspective of microscopic dynamics in an effort to elucidate the dynamical behaviors of fragile and strong glass-forming liquids. Softness, which is a machine-learned feature from local atomic structures, is used to predict the microscopic activation energetics and long-term dynamics. The FTS is found to originate from a change in the temperature dependence of the microscopic activation energetics. Furthermore, results suggest there are two diffusion channels with different energy barriers in BKS silica. The fast dynamics at high temperatures is dominated by the channel with small energy barriers ( &lt; ∼ 1 eV ), which is controlled by the short-range order. The rapid closing of this diffusion channel when lowering temperature leads to the fragile behavior. On the other hand, the slow dynamics at low temperatures is dominated by the channel with large energy barriers controlled by the medium-range order. This slow diffusion channel changes only subtly with temperature, leading to the strong behavior. The distributions of barriers in the two channels show different temperature dependences, causing a crossover at ∼ 3100 K . This transition temperature in microscopic dynamics is consistent with the inflection point in the configurational entropy, suggesting there is a fundamental correlation between microscopic dynamics and thermodynamics.},

We find that this probability at the nearest neighbor cell is remarkably greater than those at cells with larger separations, implying an effective attraction between the tracers. This effective attraction weakens sharply as the background lattice constant increases. Furthermore, we clarify that the lattice-mediated effective attraction originates from the minimization of free energy increase from deformation of the crystalline background due to the presence of diffusing tracers.},

Its mechanism differs from the familiar, inertia-driven turbulence in Newtonian fluids and is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the dynamics of purely elastic pressure-driven channel flows of dilute polymer solutions are organized by exact coherent structures that take the form of two-dimensional traveling waves. Our results demonstrate that no linear instability is required to sustain such traveling wave solutions and that their origin is purely elastic in nature. We show that the associated stress profiles are characterized by thin, filamentlike arrangements of polymer stretch, which is sustained by a solitary pair of vortices. We discuss the implications of the traveling wave solutions for the transition to elastic turbulence in straight channels and propose ways for their detection in experiments.},

Here we show that the resolving power can be roughly doubled with a simple bilayer design without needing to place the device on a membrane, avoiding a significant increase in fabrication complexity. Based on modeling of the phonon propagation, we find that the majority of the improvement comes from the inability of high energy phonons to enter the additional layer due to the lack of available phonon states.},

  abstract     = {Bardeen-Schrieffer-Cooper (BCS) and Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) occur at opposite limits of a continuum of pairing interaction strength between fermions. A crossover between these limits is readily observed in a cold atomic Fermi gas. Whether it occurs in other systems such as the high temperature superconducting cuprates has remained an open question. We uncover here unambiguous evidence for a BCS-BEC crossover in the cuprates by identifying a universal magic gap ratio 2 Δ / k B T c ≈ 6.5 (where Δ is the pairing gap and T c is the transition temperature) at which paired fermion condensates become optimally robust. At this gap ratio, corresponding to the unitary point in a cold atomic Fermi gas, the measured condensate fraction N 0 and the height of the jump δ γ ( T c ) in the coefficient γ of the fermionic specific heat at T c are strongly peaked. In the cuprates, δ γ ( T c ) is peaked at this gap ratio when Δ corresponds to the antinodal spectroscopic gap, thus reinforcing its interpretation as the pairing gap. We find the peak in δ γ ( T c ) also to coincide with a normal state maximum in γ , which is indicative of a pairing fluctuation pseudogap above T c .},

Depending on the surface termination, the semi-infinite uncorrelated system is either band insulating or exhibits a metallic surface state. For realistic values of the on-site and inter-site interactions, a Mott gap opens in the surface state, but it is smaller than the gap originating from the bilayer structure. Our results are consistent with recent scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements for different terminating layers, and with our own photoemission measurements, which indicate the coexistence of spatial regions with different gaps in the electronic spectrum. By comparison to exact diagonalization data, we clarify the interplay between Mott insulating and band insulating behavior in this archetypal layered system.},

The valence transition in the elemental metal europium (Eu) still has remained as a matter of debate. Using resonant x-ray emission scattering and x-ray diffraction, we pressurize the states of 4 f electrons in Eu and study its valence and structure transitions up to 160 GPa. We provide compelling evidence for a valence transition around 80 GPa, which coincides with a structural transition from a monoclinic ( C 2 / c ) to an orthorhombic phase ( P n m a ). We show that the valence transition occurs when the pressure-dependent energy gap between 4 f and 5 d electrons approaches the Coulomb interaction. Our discovery is critical for understanding the electrodynamics of Eu, including magnetism and high-pressure superconductivity.},

Here, we report laser-driven shock experiments on fluid molecular nitrogen up to 800 GPa and 4.0 g / cm 3 . Line-imaging velocimetry measurements and impedance matching method with a quartz reference yield shock equation of state data of initially precompressed nitrogen. Comparison with numerical simulations using path integral Monte Carlo and density functional theory molecular dynamics reveals clear signatures of chemical dissociation and the onset of L -shell ionization. Combining data along multiple shock Hugoniot curves starting from densities between 0.76 and 1.29 g / cm 3 , our study documents how pressure and density affect these changes in chemical bonding and provides benchmarks for future theoretical developments in this regime, with applications for planetary interior modeling, high energy density science, and inertial confinement fusion research.},

Typically, single-mode lasing is attainable close to threshold, but increasing the pump power gives rise to multiple lasing peaks due to inter-modal gain competition. We propose a laser with the opposite behavior: multimode lasing occurs at low output powers, but pumping beyond a certain value produces a single lasing mode, with all other candidate modes experiencing negative effective gain. This phenomenon arises in a lattice of coupled optical resonators with non-fine-tuned asymmetric couplings, and is caused by an interaction between nonlinear gain saturation and the non-Hermitian skin effect. The single-mode lasing is observed in both frequency domain and time domain simulations. It is robust against on-site disorder, and scales up to large lattice sizes. This finding might be useful for implementing high-power laser arrays.},

While initial proposals and experiments focused on enhanced sensitivities neglecting noise, subsequent studies revealed issues with EP sensors in noisy environments. Here we propose a single-mode Kerr-nonlinear resonator for exceptional sensing in noisy environments. Based on the resonator’s dynamic hysteresis, we define a signal that displays a square-root singularity reminiscent of an EP. However, our sensor has crucial fundamental and practical advantages over EP sensors: the signal-to-noise ratio increases with the measurement speed, the square-root singularity is easily detected through intensity measurements, and both sensing precision and information content of the signal are enhanced around the singularity. Our sensor also overcomes the fundamental trade-off between precision and averaging time characterizing all linear sensors. All these unconventional features open up new opportunities for fast and precise sensing using hysteretic resonators.},

The resonance energy at E res = 211 ( 40 ) keV is consistent with a proton signal observed by Ayyad et al. in the β -delayed proton decay of Be 11 . By comparison to a distorted wave Born approximation calculation, a 0.27(6) spectroscopic factor is extracted and a tentative ( ℓ = 0 ) character is assigned for this resonance. The significant cross section in the proton-transfer ( d , n ) reaction, as well as the observation of its proton-decay signal, point to the threshold-resonance character of this state. The position of this state, its structure, and strong coupling to the s -wave continuum represent an ideal case to study quantum near-threshold many-body dynamics of unstable states. The presence of this state is an important step toward understanding the excessively large beta-delayed proton-decay branch of Be 11 .},

This resonance was previously inferred in the β -delayed proton emission of the neutron halo nucleus Be 11 . The good agreement between both experimental results serves as a ground to confirm the existence of such exotic decay and the particular behavior of weakly bound nuclei coupled to the continuum. R -matrix analysis shows a sizable partial decay width for both, proton and α ( Γ α = 11 keV ) emission channels.},

This contribution is subject to a set of positivity bounds, derived from the fundamental principles of quantum field theory, such as unitarity, locality, analyticity and Lorentz invariance. These positivity bounds are thus applicable to the most direct observable: the diphoton cross section. This unique feature provides a clear, robust, and unambiguous test of these principles. We estimate the capability of various future lepton colliders in probing the dimension-eight operators and testing the positivity bounds in this channel. We show that positivity bounds can lift certain flat directions among the effective operators and significantly change the perspectives of a global analysis. We also discuss the positivity bounds of the Z γ / Z Z processes which are related to the γ γ ones, but are more complicated due to the massive Z boson.},

The discovery of CLFV in upcoming experiments would indicate that CLFV processes must have been efficient in the early Universe at relatively low temperatures. In this Letter, we point out that such efficient CLFV interactions open up new ways of creating the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. First, we quote the two-loop corrections from charged-lepton Yukawa interactions to the chemical transport in the standard model plasma, which imply that nonzero lepton flavor asymmetries summing up to B − L = 0 are enough to generate the baryon asymmetry. Then, we describe two scenarios of what we call leptoflavorgenesis , where efficient CLFV processes are responsible for the generation of primordial lepton flavor asymmetries that are subsequently converted to a baryon asymmetry by weak sphaleron processes. Here, the conversion factor from lepton flavor asymmetry to baryon asymmetry is suppressed by charged-lepton Yukawa couplings squared, which provides a natural explanation for the smallness of the observed baryon-to-photon ratio.},

At the same time, recent findings suggest that hydrodynamics could serve as a universal attractor even when the deformation gradients are large and that dissipative transport coefficients, such as viscosity, could still display a universal behavior far from equilibrium. Motivated by these observations, we consider the real-time dissipative dynamics of several holographic models under large shear deformations. In all the cases considered, we observe that at late time both the viscosity-entropy density ratio and the dimensionless ratio between energy density and entropy density approach a constant value. Whenever the shear rate in units of the energy density is small at late time, these values coincide with the expectations from near equilibrium hydrodynamics. Surprisingly, even when this is not the case, and the system at late time is far from equilibrium, the viscosity-to-entropy ratio approaches a constant which decreases monotonically with the dimensionless shear rate and can be parametrically smaller than the hydrodynamic result.},

  abstract     = {Superconducting qubits provide a promising path toward building large-scale quantum computers. The simple and robust transmon qubit has been the leading platform, achieving multiple milestones. However, fault-tolerant quantum computing calls for qubit operations at error rates significantly lower than those exhibited in the state of the art. Consequently, alternative superconducting qubits with better error protection have attracted increasing interest. Among them, fluxonium is a particularly promising candidate, featuring large anharmonicity and long coherence times. Here, we engineer a fluxonium-based quantum processor that integrates high qubit coherence, fast frequency tunability, and individual-qubit addressability for reset, readout, and gates. With simple and fast gate schemes, we achieve an average single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.97\% and a two-qubit gate fidelity of up to 99.72\%.

  abstract     = {The laws of quantum physics endow superior performance and security for information processing: quantum sensing harnesses nonclassical resources to enable measurement precision unmatched by classical sensing, whereas quantum cryptography aims to unconditionally protect the secrecy of the processed information. Here, we present the theory and experiment for entanglement-enhanced covert sensing, a paradigm that simultaneously offers high measurement precision and data integrity by concealing the probe signal in an ambient noise background so that the execution of the protocol is undetectable with a high probability. We show that entanglement offers a performance boost in estimating the imparted phase by a probed object, as compared to a classical protocol at the same covertness level. The implemented entanglement-enhanced covert sensing protocol operates close to the fundamental quantum limit by virtue of its near-optimum entanglement source and quantum receiver. Our work is expected to create ample opportunities for quantum information processing at unprecedented security and performance levels.},

They reveal what sort of information about a quantum system can be simultaneously recorded in different parts of its environment. Specifically, independent agents who monitor environment fragments can eavesdrop only on amplified and redundantly disseminated—hence, effectively classical—information about the decoherence-resistant pointer observable. We also show that the emergence of classical objectivity is signaled by a distinctive scaling of the conditional mutual information, bypassing hard numerical optimizations. Our results validate the core idea of quantum Darwinism: objective classical reality does not need to be postulated and is not accidental, but rather a compelling emergent feature of quantum theory that otherwise—in the absence of decoherence and amplification—leads to “quantum weirdness.” In particular, a lack of consensus between agents that access environment fragments is bounded by the information deficit, a measure of the incompleteness of the information about the system.},

However, the underlying particle-scale dynamics leading to such striking, reversible transition of the bulk remains unknown. Here, we study transient stress relaxation behaviour of SJ states formed by a well-characterized dense suspension under a step strain perturbation. We observe a strongly nonexponential relaxation that develops a sharp discontinuous stress drop at short time for high enough peak-stress values. High resolution boundary imaging and normal stress measurements confirm that such stress discontinuity originates from the localized plastic events, whereas system spanning dilation controls the slower relaxation process. We also find an intriguing correlation between the nature of transient relaxation and the steady-state shear jamming phase diagram obtained from the Wyart-Cates model.},

We introduce a general and compact analytical formalism for modeling the interaction of a short-pulsed metamaterial with an electromagnetic wave packet. Specifically, we elucidate the role of local and nonlocal effects, as well as the time-reversal symmetry breaking, and we show how they can be harnessed to perform elementary analog computing, such as first and second derivatives. Our theory validated against full-wave numerical simulations suggests a novel route for manipulating electromagnetic waves without relying on long, periodic temporal modulations.

The acoustic wave induces a longitudinal and a giant synthetic Hall voltage in the absence of external magnetic fields. The superposition of a synthetic Hall potential and a conventional Hall voltage can annihilate the sample’s transverse potential at large external magnetic fields. Surface acoustic waves thus provide a promising and facile avenue for the exploitation of gauge fields in large planar graphene systems.},

We investigate strategies for driving fluctuating few-particle clusters to an arbitrary target shape in minimum time with or without an external field. This question is recast into a first passage problem, solved numerically, and discussed within a high temperature expansion. Without field, large-enough low-energy target shapes exhibit an optimal temperature at which they are reached in minimum time. We then compute the optimal way to set an external field to minimize the time to reach the target, leading to a gain of time that grows when increasing cluster size or decreasing temperature. This gain can shift the optimal temperature or even create one. Our results could apply to clusters of atoms at equilibrium, and colloidal or nanoparticle clusters under thermo- or electrophoresis.},

Here, we reveal reciprocity constraints on reflection. We determine the sets of all attainable reflection coefficients of n -port scattering matrices with prescribed singular values, both with and without assuming reciprocity. Their difference establishes reciprocity constraints and nonreciprocal behaviors. As an application, we examine the conditions for all-zero reflections. Our results deepen the understanding of reciprocity in optics.},

We argue that, for strong spin interactions, single lattice dislocations are forbidden by magnetic frustration. This leads to a melting scenario in which a tetratic phase, containing free dislocation pairs and bound disclinations, separates the solid from the liquid. We demonstrate this phase numerically in a system of hard spheres confined between parallel plates, where spins are represented by the heights of the spheres. In the tetratic phase, the spins are shown to be as antiferromagnetically ordered as allowed by their spatial configuration.},

The ripple amplitude above which magnetic drag overcomes turbulent viscosity is obtained. The synergetic impact of ripple on the turbulent toroidal Reynolds stress is explored.

Four radiographs captured the temporal evolution of the MRTI. We introduce a novel unfold technique to analyze the experimental radiographs and compare the results to simulations and to a weakly nonlinear model. We find good quantitative agreement with simulations using the radiation magnetohydrodynamics code hydra . Spectral analysis of the MRTI time evolution obtained from the simulations shows evidence of harmonic generation, mode coupling, and the onset of an inverse-cascade process. The experiments provide a benchmark for future work on the MRTI and motivate the development of new analytical theories to better understand this instability.},

Indeed, we observe the formation and growth of ice crystals along the substrate during the drop spreading, and show that their velocity equals the contact line velocity when the drop stops.

  abstract     = {The novel physics of twisted bilayer graphene has motivated extensive studies of magic-angle flat bands hosted by moiré structures in electronic, photonic, and acoustic systems. On the other hand, bound states in the continuum (BICs) have also attracted great attention in recent years because of their potential applications in the field of designing superior optical devices. Here, we combine these two independent concepts to construct a new optical state in a twisted bilayer photonic crystal slab, which is called as moiré quasi-BIC, and numerically demonstrate that such an exotic optical state possesses dual characteristics of moiré flat bands and quasi-BICs. To illustrate the mechanism for the formation of moiré flat bands, we develop an effective model at the center of the Brillouin zone and show that moiré flat bands could be fulfilled by balancing the interlayer coupling strength and the twist angle around the band edge above the light line. Moreover, by decreasing the twist angle of moiré photonic crystal slabs with flat bands, it is shown that the moiré flat-band mode at the Brillouin center gradually approaches a perfect BIC, where the total radiation loss from all diffraction channels is significantly suppressed. To clarify the advantage of moiré quasi-BICs, enhanced second-harmonic generation (SHG) is numerically proven with a wide-angle optical source. The efficiency of SHG assisted by designed moiré quasi-BICs can be greatly improved compared with that based on dispersive quasi-BICs with similar quality factors.},

In this Letter, we explore the possibility to realize strong collective coupling and CQED effects with ensembles of NV spins at room temperature. Our calculations show that thermal excitation of the individual NV spins leads to population of collective Dicke states with low symmetry and a reduced collective coupling to the microwave resonators. Optical pumping can be applied to counteract the thermal excitation of the NV centers and to prepare the spin ensemble in Dicke states with high symmetry. The resulting strong coupling with high-quality resonators enables the study of intriguing CQED effects across the weak-to-strong coupling regime, and may have applications in quantum sensing and quantum information processing.},

Prior measurements of the Be 7 ( d , p ) Be * 8 reaction could not account for the individual contributions of the different excited states involved, particularly at higher energies close to the Q value of the reaction. We carried out an experiment at HIE-ISOLDE, CERN to study this reaction at E c . m . = 7.8 MeV , populating excitations up to 22 MeV in Be 8 for the first time. The angular distributions of the several excited states have been measured and the contributions of the higher excited states in the total cross section at the relevant big-bang energies were obtained by extrapolation to the Gamow window using the talys code. The results show that by including the contribution of the 16.63 MeV state, the maximum value of the total S factor inside the Gamow window comes out to be 167 MeV b as compared to earlier estimate of 100 MeV b. However, this still does not account for the lithium discrepancy.},

Large-scale shell-model (LSSM) calculations are performed to understand the microscopic structure of the excited states and the configuration mixing between them; experimental ρ 2 values in Ca 40 and neighboring isotopes are well reproduced by the LSSM calculations. The unusually small ρ 2 ( E 0 ; 0 3 + → 0 1 + ) value is due to destructive interference in the mixing of shape-coexisting structures, which are based on several different multiparticle-multihole excitations. This observation goes beyond the usual treatment of E 0 strengths, where two-state shape mixing cannot result in destructive interference.},

  abstract     = {The study of nuclei and antinuclei production has proven to be a powerful tool to investigate the formation mechanism of loosely bound states in high-energy hadronic collisions. The first measurement of the production of H Λ 3 in p -Pb collisions at s NN = 5.02 TeV is presented in this Letter. Its production yield measured in the rapidity interval − 1 &lt; y &lt; 0 for the 40\% highest-multiplicity p -Pb collisions is d N / d y = [ 6.3 ± 1.8 ( stat ) ± 1.2 ( syst ) ] × 10 − 7 . The measurement is compared with the expectations of statistical hadronization and coalescence models, which describe the nucleosynthesis in hadronic collisions. These two models predict very different yields of the hypertriton in charged particle multiplicity environments relevant to small collision systems such as p -Pb, and therefore the measurement of d N / d y is crucial to distinguish between them. The precision of this measurement leads to the exclusion with a significance larger than 6.9 σ of some configurations of the statistical hadronization model, thus constraining the theory behind the production of loosely bound states at hadron colliders.},

DVCS is sensitive to the generalized parton distributions of the nucleon, which provide a three-dimensional description of its internal constituents. Using the exact analytic expression of the DVCS cross section for all possible polarization states of the initial and final electron and nucleon, and final state photon, we present the first experimental extraction of all four helicity-conserving Compton form factors (CFFs) of the nucleon as a function of x B , while systematically including helicity flip amplitudes.

The outstanding precision of the LHC demands very accurate theoretical predictions with a full account of fiducial experimental cuts. In this Letter we present a state-of-the-art calculation of the fiducial cross section and of differential distributions for this process at third order in the strict fixed-order expansion in the strong coupling, as well as including the all-order resummation of logarithmic corrections. Together with these results, we present a detailed study of the subtraction technique used to carry out the calculation for different sets of experimental cuts, as well as of the sensitivity of the fiducial cross section to infrared physics. We find that residual theory uncertainties are reduced to the percent level and that the robustness of the predictions can be improved by a suitable adjustment of fiducial cuts.},

However, it has long been expected mathematically that, when electromagnetic or gravitational waves travel through vacuum in a curved spacetime, the waves develop tails that travel more slowly. The associated signal has been thought to be undetectably weak. Here we demonstrate that gravitational waves are efficiently scattered by the curvature sourced by ordinary compact objects—stars, white dwarfs, neutron stars, and planets—and certain candidates for dark matter, populating the interior of the null cone. The resulting gravitational glint should imminently be detectable, and be recognizable (for all but planets) as briefly delayed echoes of the primary signal emanating from extremely near the direction of the primary source. This opens the prospect for using Gravitational Detection and Ranging to map the Universe and conduct a comprehensive census of massive compact objects, and ultimately to explore their interiors.},

The measurements, however, inevitably distort the information. The characterization of the discrepancy is an important subject in quantum information science, which plays a key role in understanding the difference between the structures of quantum and classical informations. Here we analyze the difference in terms of the Fisher information metric and present a framework that can provide analytical bounds on the discrepancy under hierarchical quantum measurements. Specifically, we present a set of analytical bounds on the difference between the quantum and classical Fisher information metric under hierarchical p -local quantum measurements, which are measurements that can be performed collectively on at most p copies of quantum states. The results can be directly transformed to the precision limit in multiparameter quantum metrology, which leads to characterizations of the trade-off among the precision of different parameters. The framework also provides a coherent picture for various existing results by including them as special cases.},

For two arbitrary-dimensional systems, we show how to compute tight corrections to a family of standard entanglement witnesses due to any given level of measurement inaccuracy.

Here, we report the first experimental realization of multiparticle entanglement self-testing closing the locality loophole in a photonic system, and the detection loophole in a superconducting system, respectively. We certify three-party and four-party GHZ states with at least 0.84(1) and 0.86(3) fidelities in a device-independent way.

However, to date, the nature of these “featureless” correlated states with zero Chern numbers are still elusive and lack a characteristic experimental signature. Thus, an experimental probe to identify the characters of these featureless CI and DW states is urgently needed. In this Letter, we theoretically study the correlated insulators and density wave states at different integer and fractional fillings of the flat bands in magic-angle TBG based on extended unrestricted Hartree-Fock calculations including the Coulomb screening effects from the remote bands. We further investigate the nonlinear optical response of the various correlated states and find that the nonlinear optical conductivities can be used to identify the nature of these CI and DW states at most of the fillings. Therefore, we propose that a nonlinear optical response can serve as a promising experimental probe for unveiling the nature of the CI and DW states observed in magic-angle TBG.},

Selective excitation of the lower polariton at a frequency of ∼ 2 5 THz and at a finite in-plane momentum k ‖ leads to the emergence of a narrowband maximum in the probe reflectivity at k ‖ = 0 . A quantum mechanical model identifies the underlying microscopic process as stimulated coherent polariton-polariton scattering.

Toward this goal, characterizing the spin-orbit torques (SOTs) associated with AFM–heavy-metal (HM) interfaces is important. Here we report the full angular dependence of the harmonic Hall voltages in a predominantly easy-plane AFM, epitaxial c -axis oriented α − Fe 2 O 3 films, with an interface to Pt. By modeling the harmonic Hall signals together with the α − Fe 2 O 3 magnetic parameters, we determine the amplitudes of fieldlike and dampinglike SOTs. Out-of-plane field scans are shown to be essential to determining the dampinglike component of the torques. In contrast to ferromagnetic–heavy-metal heterostructures, our results demonstrate that the fieldlike torques are significantly larger than the dampinglike torques, which we correlate with the presence of a large imaginary component of the interface spin-mixing conductance. Our work demonstrates a direct way of characterizing SOTs in AFM-HM heterostructures.},

  abstract     = {A chiral spin soliton lattice (CSL), one of the representative systems of a magnetic superstructure, exhibits reconfigurability in periodicity over a macroscopic length scale. Such coherent and tunable characteristics of the CSL lead to an emergence of elementary excitation of the CSL as phononlike modes due to translational symmetry breaking and bring a controllability of the dispersion relation of the CSL phonon. Using a broadband microwave spectroscopy technique, we directly found that higher-order magnetic resonance modes appear in the CSL phase of a chiral helimagnet CrNb 3 S 6 , which is ascribed to the CSL phonon response. The resonance frequency of the CSL phonon can be tuned between 16 and 40 GHz in the vicinity of the critical field, where the CSL period alters rapidly. The frequency range of the CSL phonon is expected to extend over 100 GHz as extrapolated on the basis of the theoretical model. The present results indicate that chiral helimagnets could work as materials useful for broadband signal processing in the millimeter-wave band.},

The twofold AMR exhibits a strong dependence on the current orientation, whereas the fourfold term only depends on the magnetization direction in the crystal and is independent of the current orientation. First-principles calculations reveal that the fourfold AMR arises from the relaxation time anisotropy due to the variation of the density of states near the Fermi energy under rotation of the magnetization. This relaxation time anisotropy is a universal property in ferromagnetic metals and determines other anisotropic physical properties that are observable in experiment.},

One of the challenges in this endeavor is to understand their intrinsic lifetime, ℏ / Λ , which is expected to be limited by the inelastic coupling with the continuum thus leading to decoherence. Here we use shot-noise scanning tunneling microscopy to reveal that electron tunneling into superconducting 2 H − NbSe 2 mediated by YSR states is not Poissonian, but ordered as a function of time, as evidenced by a reduction of the noise. Moreover, our data show the concomitant transfer of charges e and 2 e , indicating that incoherent single particle and coherent Andreev processes operate simultaneously. From the quantitative agreement between experiment and theory we obtain Λ = 1 μ eV ≪ k B T demonstrating that shot noise can probe energy scales and timescales inaccessible by conventional spectroscopy whose resolution is thermally limited.},

In one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological systems, quantized topological Thouless pumps directly reveal this principle and provide a sound mathematical foundation. Symmetry-protected higher-order topological phases of matter (HOSPTs) also feature a bulk-boundary correspondence, but its connection to quantized charge transport remains elusive. Here, we show that quantized Thouless pumps connecting C 4 -symmetric HOSPTs can be described by a tuple of four Chern numbers that measure quantized bulk charge transport in a direction-dependent fashion. Moreover, this tuple of Chern numbers allows to predict the sign and value of fractional corner charges in the HOSPTs. We show that the topologically nontrivial phase can be characterized by both quadrupole and dipole configurations, shedding new light on current debates about the multipole nature of the HOSPT bulk. By employing corner-periodic boundary conditions, we generalize Restas’s theory to HOSPTs. Our approach provides a simple framework for understanding topological invariants of general HOSPTs and paves the way for an in-depth description of future dynamical experiments.},

One of the most special configurations in such systems is the earring nodal link, composing of a nodal chain linking with an isolated nodal line. Such earring nodal links have not been observed in real systems. We designed phononic crystals with earring nodal links, and experimentally observed two different kinds of earring nodal links by measuring the band structures. We found that the order of the nodal chain and line can be switched after band inversion but their link cannot be severed.

Here, by using precession nanodiffraction mapping in the transmission electron microscope, the atomic density and strain distribution of an individual shear band is quantitatively mapped at 2 nm resolution. We demonstrate that shear bands exhibit density alternation from the atomic scale to the submicron scale and complex strain fields exist, causing shear band segmentation and deflection. The atomic scale density alternation reveals the autocatalytic generation of shear transformation zones, while the density alternation at submicron scale results from the progressive propagation of shear band front and extends to the surrounding matrix, forming oval highly strained regions with density consistently higher ( ∼ 0.2\% ) than the encapsulated shear band segments. Through combination with molecular dynamic simulations, a complete picture for shear band formation and propagation is established.},

In particular, the use of three spin states in two spatial dimensions would allow the simulation of synthetic magnetic fields of high spatial uniformity, which would lead to ultranarrow Chern bands that support robust fractional quantum Hall states.},

Rev. Lett. 102 , 115002 (2009) ]. Here we present a hypothesis that low n , pressure driven ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities that are nondisruptive, can break magnetic surfaces in the central region and thereby flatten the electron temperature profiles. We demonstrate this mechanism in a 3D resistive MHD simulation of a NSTX discharge. By varying the toroidal magnetic field strength, and/or the heating power, we show that there is a critical value of β , above which the central temperature profile no longer peaks on axis.},

  abstract     = {The efficiency of high-order harmonic generation from a relativistic laser interacting with solid targets depends greatly on surface plasma distribution. The usual method of enhancing efficiency involves tuning the plasma scale length carefully by improving the laser contrast. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that efficient harmonics can be achieved directly by compressing large-scale surface plasma via the radiation pressure of a circularly polarized normally incident prepulse. The harmonic generation efficiency obtained by this method is comparable to that obtained with optimized plasma scale length by high-contrast lasers. Our scheme does not rely on high-contrast lasers and is robust and easy to implement. Thus, it may pave a way for the development of intense extreme ultraviolet sources and future applications with high repetition rates.},

  abstract     = {Thouless pump provides robust ways to realize quantized transport of waves and particles, and it casts the static 2D quantum Hall effect onto 1D dynamic systems where one of the momentum dimensions is replaced by the evolution time or path parameter. In the past few decades, various types of Abelian Thouless pump have been achieved theoretically and experimentally. However, the study of non-Abelian Thouless pump is scarce, which tells us that the order of two evolution loops with the same base point cannot be changed, and there has been no experimental observation of non-Abelian Thouless pump. Here we report the observation of a non-Abelian Thouless pump in coupled acoustic waveguide array. The non-Abelian property originates from the noncommutative combination of two different ℤ 3 pump cycles that traverse across multiple band degeneracies in the parameter space in a three-band system. Moreover, we can pump a specific initial state to any state on any lattice site by applying these two ℤ 3 pump cycles multiple times in a well-designed sequence. Our study paves the way for exploring and utilizing non-Abelian dynamical effects in classical wave systems and may offer different recipes for quantum walking, quantum optics, and quantum computation.},

  abstract     = {Wave frequency is a critical parameter for applications ranging from structural health monitoring, noise control, and medical imaging to quantum of energy in matter. Frequency conversion is an inevitable wave phenomenon in nonlinear or time-modulated media. However, frequency conversion in linear media holds the promise of breaking limits imposed by the physics laws of wave diffraction such as Snell’s law and Rayleigh criterion. In this Letter, we physically introduce a linear active metalayer in a structural beam that can convert the wave frequency of an flexural incidence into arbitrary frequencies of transmitted waves, which is underpinned by time modulation of sensing signals and insensitive to incident amplitude. The active element, involving piezoelectric components and time-modulated transfer function, breaks energy conservation such that the generated harmonics can be fully decoupled, making the frequency conversion linear and independent. By leveraging the time-modulated unit, phase-gradient and frequency-gradient metalayers are proposed for frequency-converted wave steering and dynamic beam steering, respectively. The linear active metalayer proposed herein suggests a promising solution to fully control time-domain signals of flexural waves, in stark contrast with existing elastic metasurfaces, regardless of being passive or active.},

Within the experimental uncertainty, the rotational constant B He of the in-droplet D 2 molecule, determined by Fourier analysis, is the same as B gas for an isolated D 2 molecule.

However, the measured excitation probability of 1.0(3)\% is far beyond the theoretical expectation. In order to understand the inconsistency between theory and experiment, we produce the Mo 93 m nuclei using the C 12 ( Kr 86 , 5 n ) reaction at a beam energy of 559 MeV and transport the reaction residues to a detection station far away from the target area employing a secondary beam line. The isomer depletion is expected to occur during the slowdown process of the ions in the stopping material. In such a low γ -ray background environment, the signature of isomer depletion is not observed, and an upper limit of 2 × 10 − 5 is estimated for the excitation probability. This is consistent with the theoretical expectation. Our findings shed doubt on the previously reported NEEC phenomenon and highlight the necessity and feasibility of further experimental investigations for reexamining the isomer depletion under low γ -ray background.},

We present a new approach for computing perturbative corrections in projection QMC calculations. We demonstrate the method by computing nuclear ground state energies up to second order for a realistic chiral interaction. We calculate the binding energies of several light nuclei up to O 16 by expanding the Hamiltonian around the Wigner SU(4) limit and find good agreement with data. In contrast to the natural ordering of the perturbative series, we find remarkably large second-order energy corrections. This occurs because the perturbing interactions break the symmetries of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. Our method is free from the sign problem and can be applied to QMC calculations for many-body systems in nuclear physics, condensed matter physics, ultracold atoms, and quantum chemistry.},

Proposals to extend existing safeguards technologies and practices are complicated by the need for civilian international inspectors to gain access to the interior of the submarine and the reactor compartment, which raises national security concerns. In this Letter we show that implementing safeguards on submarine propulsion reactors using a low-energy antineutrino reactor-off method, between submarine patrols, can by-pass the need for onboard access all together. We find that, using inverse beta decay, detectors can achieve a timely and high level of assurance that a submarine’s nuclear core has not been diverted (detector mass of around 100 kg) nor its enrichment level changed (detector mass of around 10 tons).},

  abstract     = {We argue that quiver gauge theories with SU ( N ) gauge groups give rise to lattice gauge theories with matter possessing fractonic properties, where the lattice is the quiver itself. This idea extends a recent proposal by Razamat. This class of theories exhibit a Z N 1-form global symmetry that can be used to classify their phases. The order parameter of this transition is the expectation value of Wilson loops, which correspond to mesonic operators in the underlying quiver gauge theory. We discuss how this perspective naturally fits with the deconstruction of a higher dimensional theory.},

  abstract     = {Recent attempts at the construction of holography for asymptotically flat spacetime have taken two different routes. Celestial holography, involving a two dimensional (2D) conformal field theory (CFT) dual to 4D Minkowski spacetime, has generated novel results in asymptotic symmetry and scattering amplitudes. A different formulation, using Carrollian CFTs, has been principally used to provide some evidence for flat holography in lower dimensions. Understanding of flat space scattering has been lacking in the Carroll framework. In this Letter, using ideas from Celestial holography, we show that 3D Carrollian CFTs living on the null boundary of 4D flat space can potentially compute bulk scattering amplitudes. Three-dimensional Carrollian conformal correlators have two different branches, one depending on the null time direction and one independent of it. We propose that it is the time-dependent branch that is related to bulk scattering. We construct an explicit field theoretic example of a free massless Carrollian scalar that realizes some desired properties.},

We intuitively explain and illustrate the phenomena by performing a three-mode single-photon interferometric experiment, where one arm carries the signal and two noisy reference arms have fluctuating phases. We show that the source of the observed sensitivity improvement is the reduction of correlations between these fluctuations and comment on the impact of the effect when moving from the single-photon quantum level to the classical regime.

  abstract     = {Non-Gaussian states are essential for many optical quantum technologies. The so-called optical quantum state synthesizer (OQSS), consisting of Gaussian input states, linear optics, and photon-number resolving detectors, is a promising method for non-Gaussian state preparation. However, an inevitable and crucial problem is the complexity of the numerical simulation of the state preparation on a classical computer. This problem makes it very challenging to generate important non-Gaussian states required for advanced quantum information processing. Thus, an efficient method to design OQSS circuits is highly desirable. To circumvent the problem, we offer a scheme employing a backcasting approach, where the circuit of OQSS is divided into some sublayers, and we simulate the OQSS backwards from final to first layers. Moreover, our results show that the detected photon number by each detector is at most 2, which can significantly reduce the requirements for the photon-number resolving detector. By virtue of the potential for the preparation of a wide variety of non-Gaussian states, the proposed OQSS can be a key ingredient in general optical quantum information processing.},

We provide nonperturbative bounds for the skeletal area-law coefficient of a large family of quantum states. We then explore skeletal scaling for the toric code, conformal bosons and Dirac fermions, Lifshitz critical points, and Fermi liquids. We discover signatures including skeletal topological EE, novel corner terms, and strict area-law scaling for metals. These findings suggest that skeletal entropy serves as a measure for the range of entanglement.

Here, we show that allowing correlation among multiple catalysts can offer arbitrary power in the manipulation of quantum coherence. We prove that any state transformation can be accomplished with an arbitrarily small error by covariant operations with catalysts that may create a correlation within them while keeping their marginal states intact. This presents a new type of embezzlement-like phenomenon, in which the resource embezzlement is attributed to the correlation generated among multiple catalysts. We extend our analysis to general resource theories and provide conditions for feasible transformations assisted by catalysts that involve correlation, putting a severe restriction on other quantum resources for showing this anomalous enhancement, as well as characterizing achievable transformations in relation to their asymptotic state transformations. Our results provide not only a general overview of the power of correlation in catalysts but also a step toward the complete characterization of the resource transformability in quantum thermodynamics with correlated catalysts.},

The lower bound of the violation is 2.24 ± 0.01 in 11 dimensions, exceeding the bound ( V &lt; 2 ) of two-setting criteria. Hence, a higher strength of steering has been revealed. Moreover, we demonstrate the method for enhancing the noise robustness without increasing dimension, alternatively, by increasing measurement settings. Using the entanglement in 11 dimensions, we experimentally retrieve steering nonlocality with 63.4 ± 1.4\% isotropic noise fraction, surpassing the 50\% limitation of two-setting criteria.

The bridge is a few-body boundary-driven spin chain exploiting quantum effects to gain an enhanced sensitivity to an unknown coupling. The sensitivity is explained by a drop in population of an entangled Bell state due to destructive interference as the controllable coupling approaches the unknown coupling. A simple criterion for the destructive interference is found, and an approximate expression for the width of the drop is derived. The sensitivity to the unknown coupling is quantified using the quantum Fisher information, and we show that the state of the bridge can be measured indirectly through the spin current. Our results are robust toward calibration errors and generic in the sense that several of the current state-of-the-art quantum platforms could be used as a means of realization. The quantum Wheatstone bridge may thus find use in fields such as sensing and metrology using near-term quantum devices.},

Creep is common for many other amorphous materials such as many metals and polymers. The slow motion of creep is challenging to understand, probe, and control. We probe the creep properties of packings of soft spheres with a sinking ball viscometer. We find that in our granular packings, creep persists up to large strains and has a power law form, with diffusive dynamics. The creep amplitude is exponentially dependent on both applied stress and the concentration of hydrogel, suggesting that a competition between driving and confinement determines the dynamics. Our results provide insights into the mechanical properties of soft solids and the scaling laws provide a clear benchmark for new theory that explains creep, and provide the tantalizing prospect that creep can be controlled by a boundary stress.},

Compared to linear polymers, the entanglements between ring polymers do not act as effective cross-links. As a result, the stretchability of cross-linked ring polymers is determined by the maximum extension of polymer strands between cross-links, rather than between trapped entanglements as in cross-linked linear polymers.

The high excitonic and photonic quality of the interaction system stems from our integrated nanofabrication approach simultaneously with the hBN encapsulation and the maximized local cavity field amplitude within the MoS 2 monolayer. We observe a nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the cavity-trion interaction strength, consistent with the nonlocal light-matter interactions in which the extent of the center-of-mass (c.m.) wave function is comparable to the cavity mode volume in space. Our approach can be generalized to other optically active 2D materials, opening the way toward harnessing novel light-matter interaction regimes for applications in quantum photonics.},

When optically pumped with a ring-shaped nonresonant laser, the trapped condensate experiences intricate high-order mode competition and fractures into two distinct trap levels. The resulting mode interference leads to robust condensate density beatings with periodic appearance of orderly arranged phase singularities.

Here, we analyze the exciton band structure that arises from a periodic modulation of the valley Zeeman effect. Despite long-range electron-hole exchange interactions, we find a sizable splitting in the energy of the bright circularly polarized exciton Umklapp resonances, which serves as a direct optical probe of magnetic order. We first analyze quantum moiré magnets realized by periodic ordering of electron spins in Mott-Wigner states of transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers or twisted bilayers: we show that spin valley–dependent exciton-electron interactions allow for probing the spin-valley order of electrons and demonstrate that it is possible to observe unique signatures of ferromagnetic order in a triangular lattice and both ferromagnetic and Néel order in a honeycomb lattice. We then focus on semiclassical moiré magnets realized in twisted bilayers of ferromagnetic materials: we propose a detection scheme for moiré magnetism that is based on interlayer exchange coupling between spins in a moiré magnet and excitons in a transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer.},

Recent experiments used an STM tip to manipulate the exchange coupling between an Fe adatom and the FeTe 0.55 Se 0.45 superconductor possessing a Z 2 nontrivial band structure with topological surface states. As the tip moves close to the single Fe adatom, the energy of the in-gap state modulates and exhibits a zero-energy crossing followed by an unusual return to zero energy, which cannot be understood by coupling the magnetic impurity to the superconducting topological surface Dirac cone. Here, we numerically and analytically study the YSR states in superconductors with nontrivial Z 2 bands and show the emergence of the two zero-energy crossings as a function of the exchange coupling between the magnetic impurity and the bulk states. We analyze the role of the topological surface states and compare in-gap states to systems with trivial Z 2 bands.

We found that longitudinal and transverse conductance fluctuations, generated by varying the external magnetic field within a microscopic model, are multifractal and lead to distributions of conductance increments (magnetoconductance) with heavy tails (intermittency) and signatures of a hierarchical structure (cascade) in the corresponding stochastic process, akin to Kolmogorov’s theory of fluid turbulence. We confirm this picture by interpreting the stochastic process of the conductance increments in the framework of H theory, which is a continuous-time stochastic approach that incorporates the basic features of Kolmogorov’s theory. The multifractal analysis of the conductance “time series,” combined with the H -theory formalism, provides strong support for the overall characterization of mesoscopic fluctuations in the quantum Hall transition as a multifractal stochastic phenomenon with multiscale hierarchy, intermittency, and cascade effects.},

Unique properties of quantum semiconductor superlattices allow us to investigate high-frequency phenomena induced by the Bragg reflections and negative differential velocity of the miniband electrons. Effects of parametric gain in the superlattices at different strengths of dissipation have been earlier discussed in a number of theoretical works, but their experimental demonstrations are so far absent. Here, we report on the first observation of the dissipative parametric generation in a subcritically doped GaAs / AlGaAs superlattice subjected to a dc bias and a microwave pump. We argue that the dissipative parametric mechanism originates from a periodic variation of the negative differential velocity. It enforces excitation of slow electrostatic waves in the superlattice that provide a significant enhancement of the gain coefficient. This work paves the way for a development of a miniature solid-state parametric generator of GHz-THz frequencies operating at room temperature.},

Additionally, we propose a way of extracting the noise power spectral density in a frequency band only bounded by the range of the qubit-cavity detuning and with an exponentially decaying error due to finite measurement times.

Unlike the Chern-Simons axion term, this magnetoelectric response term is gauge independent and nonquantized, and manifests in the systems breaking the symmetries of the time reversal, inversion, and mirror. In particular, we propose the antiferromagnetic material Mn 2 Bi 2 Te 5 as a material candidate to observe dynamical magnetoelectric current, in which a large magnetoelectric response term β ξ ( ω ) originates from band inversion.},

Each layer of amorphous graphite is a monolayer of amorphous graphene including pentagons and heptagons in addition to hexagons, and the planes are separated by about 3.1 Å . The layering transition has been studied using various structural and dynamical analyses. The transition is unique as one of partial ordering (long range order of planes and galleries, but topological disorder in the planes). The planes are quite flat, even though monolayer amorphous graphene puckers near pentagonal sites. Interplane cohesion is due partly to non-Van der Waals interactions. The structural disorder has been studied closely, especially the consequences of disorder to electronic transport. It is expected that the transition elucidated here may be salient to other layered materials.},

The disagreement is even more prominent for higher-order moments of the acceleration. Instead, starting from a known exact relation, we relate the scaling of acceleration variance to that of Eulerian fourth-order velocity gradient and velocity increment statistics.

  abstract     = {We study experimentally the dissipative dynamics of ultracold bosonic gases in a dynamic disorder potential with tunable correlation time. First, we measure the heating rate of thermal clouds exposed to the dynamic potential and present a model of the heating process, revealing the microscopic origin of dissipation from a thermal, trapped cloud of bosons. Second, for Bose-Einstein condensates, we measure the particle loss rate induced by the dynamic environment. Depending on the correlation time, the losses are either dominated by heating of residual thermal particles or the creation of excitations in the superfluid, a notion we substantiate with a rate model. Our results illuminate the interplay between superfluidity and time-dependent disorder and on more general grounds establish ultracold atoms as a platform for studying spatiotemporal noise and time-dependent disorder.},

  abstract     = {Detection of weak electromagnetic waves and hypothetical particles aided by quantum amplification is important for fundamental physics and applications. However, demonstrations of quantum amplification are still limited; in particular, the physics of quantum amplification is not fully explored in periodically driven (Floquet) systems, which are generally defined by time-periodic Hamiltonians and enable observation of many exotic quantum phenomena such as time crystals. Here we investigate the magnetic-field signal amplification by periodically driven Xe 129 spins and observe signal amplification at frequencies of transitions between Floquet spin states. This “Floquet amplification” allows us to simultaneously enhance and measure multiple magnetic fields with at least one order of magnitude improvement, offering the capability of femtotesla-level measurements. Our findings extend the physics of quantum amplification to Floquet spin systems and can be generalized to a wide variety of existing amplifiers, enabling a previously unexplored class of “Floquet spin amplifiers”.},

  abstract     = {The Baksan Experiment on Sterile Transitions (BEST) was designed to investigate the deficit of electron neutrinos ν e observed in previous gallium-based radiochemical measurements with high-intensity neutrino sources, commonly referred to as the “gallium anomaly,” which could be interpreted as evidence for oscillations between ν e and sterile neutrino ( ν s ) states. A 3.414-MCi Cr 51 ν e source was placed at the center of two nested Ga volumes and measurements were made of the production of Ge 71 through the charged current reaction, Ga 71 ( ν e , e − ) Ge 71 , at two average distances. The measured production rates for the inner and the outer targets, respectively, are [ 54.9 − 2.4 + 2.5 ( stat ) ± 1.4 ( syst ) ] and [ 55.6 − 2.6 + 2.7 ( stat ) ± 1.4 ( syst ) ] atoms of Ge 71 / d . The ratio ( R ) of the measured rate of Ge 71 production at each distance to the expected rate from the known cross section and experimental efficiencies are R in = 0.79 ± 0.05 and R out = 0.77 ± 0.05 . The ratio of the outer to the inner result is 0.97 ± 0.07 , which is consistent with unity within uncertainty. The rates at each distance were found to be similar, but 20\%–24\% lower than expected, thus reaffirming the anomaly. These results are consistent with ν e → ν s oscillations with a relatively large Δ m 2 ( &gt; 0.5 eV 2 ) and mixing sin 2 2 θ ( ≈ 0.4 ).},

In this work, we report on Light A ′ Multilayer Periodic Optical SNSPD Target, a proof-of-concept experiment searching for dark photon dark matter in the eV mass range, via coherent absorption in a multilayer dielectric haloscope. Using a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD), we achieve efficient photon detection with a dark count rate of ∼ 6 × 10 − 6 counts / s .

Generalized twisted CFT spectra are numerically obtained through exact diagonalization of the transfer matrix, and the conformal towers are separated in the spectra through their identification with the topological sectors. It is further argued that our model can be obtained through an orbifold procedure from a larger lattice model with input Z ( H 3 ) , which is the simplest modular tensor category that does not admit an algebraic construction. This provides a counterexample for the conjecture that all rational CFT can be constructed from standard methods.},

We show that, depending on the helicities of the phonons involved in the scattering process, the scattering amplitude may in fact vanish like a fractional power of the soft momentum. This is a peculiarity of the 4-point amplitude, which can be traced back to (1) the (spontaneous or explicit) breaking of Lorentz invariance, and (2) the approximately collinear kinematics arising when one of the phonons becomes soft.

The hyperentropic condition replaces the noncompactness assumption in Penrose’s theorem, so our theorem is applicable even in a closed universe.

The strength of all three periodicities changes with time and rigidity. In the entire time period, we found that below ∼ 7 GV the helium flux exhibits larger time variations than the proton flux, and above ∼ 7 GV the helium to proton flux ratio is time independent. Remarkably, below 2.4 GV a hysteresis between the helium to proton flux ratio and the helium flux was observed at greater than the 7 σ level.

However, on-the-fly calculations of these waveforms have not yet overcome the high dimensionality of the parameter space. To confront this challenge, we present a user-ready EMRI waveform model for generic (eccentric and inclined) orbits in Kerr spacetime, using an analytical self-force approach. Our model accurately covers all EMRIs with arbitrary inclination and black hole spin, up to modest eccentricity ( ≲ 0.3 ) and separation ( ≳ 2 – 10 M from the last stable orbit). In that regime, our waveforms are accurate at the leading “adiabatic” order, and they approximately capture transient self-force resonances that significantly impact the gravitational wave phase. The model fills an urgent need for extensive waveforms in ongoing data-analysis studies, and its individual components will continue to be useful in future science-adequate waveforms.},

In this work, we use the lens of thermodynamic geometry to explore the full space of thermodynamic cycles with continuously varying bath temperature in search of optimally shaped cycles acting in the slow-driving regime. We apply classical isoperimetric inequalities to derive a universal geometric bound on the efficiency of any irreversible thermodynamic cycle and explicitly construct efficient heat engines operating in finite time that nearly saturate this bound for a specific model system. Given the bound, these optimal cycles perform more efficiently than all other thermodynamic cycles operating as heat engines in finite time, including notable cycles, such as those of Carnot, Stirling, and Otto. For example, in comparison to recent experiments, this corresponds to orders of magnitude improvement in the efficiency of engines operating in certain time regimes. Our results suggest novel design principles for future mesoscopic heat engines and are ripe for experimental investigation.},

  abstract     = {In an ordinary quantum algorithm the gates are applied in a fixed order on the systems. The introduction of indefinite causal structures allows us to relax this constraint and control the order of the gates with an additional quantum state. It is known that this quantum-controlled ordering of gates can reduce the query complexity in deciding a property of black-box unitaries with respect to the best algorithm in which the gates are applied in a fixed order. However, all tasks explicitly found so far require unitaries that either act on unbounded dimensional quantum systems in the asymptotic limit (the limiting case of a large number of black-box gates) or act on qubits, but then involve only a few unitaries. Here we introduce tasks (i) for which there is a provable computational advantage of a quantum-controlled ordering of gates in the asymptotic case and (ii) that require only qubit gates and are therefore suitable to demonstrate this advantage experimentally. We study their solutions with the quantum n -switch and within the quantum circuit model and find that while the n -switch requires to call each gate only once, a causal algorithm has to call at least 2 n − 1 gates. Furthermore, the best known solution with a fixed gate ordering calls O [ n log 2 ( n ) ] gates.},

  abstract     = {Most implementations of quantum gate operations rely on external control fields to drive the evolution of the quantum system. Generating these control fields requires significant efforts to design the suitable control Hamiltonians. Furthermore, any error in the control fields reduces the fidelity of the implemented control operation with respect to the ideal target operation. Achieving sufficiently fast gate operations at low error rates remains therefore a huge challenge. In this Letter, we present a novel approach to overcome this challenge by eliminating, for specific gate operations, the time-dependent control fields entirely. This approach appears useful for maximizing the speed of the gate operation while simultaneously eliminating relevant sources of errors. We present an experimental demonstration of the concept in a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond at room temperature.},

These results fueled a controversial discussion whether the “generic” response identified by photon correlation spectroscopy, or rather the nonuniversal dielectric response, reflect the liquid’s structural relaxation. The present study employs physical aging and oscillatory shear rheology to directly access the structural relaxation of a nonassociating glass-forming liquid and reveals that collective equilibrium fluctuations of simple liquids and not single-particle dynamics govern their structural relaxation. The present results thus challenge recent views that the glassy response of polar supercooled liquids can generically be decomposed into a Debye-type, supramolecular response and a single-particle dynamics with the latter reflecting the “true” structural relaxation. Furthermore, the current findings underscore the pivotal role dielectric spectroscopy plays in glass science as one of the rare molecular-level reorientation techniques that senses dynamical cooperativity directly.},

Since magnetic skyrmions are now established in insulating materials, where the magnetoelectric multipoles govern the linear magnetoelectric response, our classification provides a recipe for manipulating the magnetic properties of skyrmions using applied electric fields. We apply our formalism to skyrmions and antiskyrmions of different helicities, as well as to magnetic bimerons, which are topologically, but not geometrically, equivalent to skyrmions. We show that the nonzero components of the magnetoelectric multipole and magnetoelectric response tensors are uniquely determined by the topology, helicity, and geometry of the spin texture. Therefore, we propose straightforward linear magnetoelectric response measurements as an alternative to Lorentz microscopy for characterizing insulating skyrmionic textures.},

Different from internal ones, spatial symmetries act nonlocally in momentum space and enforce global constraints on both band degeneracies and topological quantities at different locations. In deriving general constraints on band degeneracies and topological invariants, we demonstrate that non-Hermitian spatial symmetries are on an equal footing with, but are essentially different from Hermitian ones. First, we discover the nonlocal Hermitian conjugate pair of exceptional or normal band degeneracies that are enforced by non-Hermitian spatial symmetries. Remarkably, we find that these pairs lead to the symmetry-enforced violation of the Fermion doubling theorem in the long-time limit. Second, with the topological constraints, we unravel that a certain exceptional manifold is only compatible with and stabilized by non-Hermitian spatial symmetries but is intrinsically incompatible with Hermitian spatial symmetries. We illustrate these findings using two three-dimensional models of a non-Hermitian Weyl semimetal and an exceptional unconventional Weyl semimetal. Experimental cold-atom realizations of both models are also proposed.},

  abstract     = {Using atomic force microscopy, we have shown that friction on graphene / h − BN superlattice structures may exhibit unusual moiré-scale stick slip in addition to the regular ones observed at the atomic scale. Such dual-scale slip instability will lead to unique length-scale dependent energy dissipation when the different slip mechanisms are sequentially activated. Assisted by an improved theoretical model and comparative experiments, we find that accumulation and unstable release of the in-plane strain of the graphene layer is the key mechanism underlying the moiré-scale behavior. This work highlights the distinct role of the internal state of the van der Waals interfaces in determining the rich dynamics and energy dissipation of layer-structured materials.},

While several techniques can access surface composition, obtaining information on the depth distribution is challenging. We develop a noninvasive, polarization-resolved, surface-specific sum-frequency generation spectroscopy providing quantitative depth information. We demonstrate the technique on formic acid molecules at the air-water interface. With increasing molar fraction from 2.5\% to 10\%, the formic acid molecules shift, on average, ∼ 0.9 Å into the bulk. The consistency with the simulation data manifests that the technique allows for probing the Ångstrom-scale depth profile.},

Unlike the conventional topological insulators that demand bulk gap closings at transition points, the higher-order band topology can be changed without bulk closure and exhibits as an obstruction of higher-dimensional boundary states. Here, we report the first experimental realization of three-dimensional surface-obstructed topological insulators with using acoustic crystals. Our acoustic measurements demonstrate unambiguously the emergence of one-dimensional topological hinge states in the middle of the bulk and surface band gaps, as a direct manifestation of the higher-order band topology. Together with comparative measurements for the trivial and phase-transition-point insulators, our experimental data conclusively evidence the unique bulk-boundary physics for the surface-obstructed band topology. That is, the topological phase transition is determined by the closure of the surface gap, rather than by closing the bulk gap. Our study might spur on new activities to deepen the understanding of such elusive topological phases.},

The geometry of surfaces has been shown to influence dynamics and play a functional role, yet a comprehensive understanding is still elusive. Here, we report for the first time that a static Turing pattern on a flat surface can propagate on a curved surface, as opposed to previous studies, where the pattern is presupposed to be static irrespective of the surface geometry. To understand such significant changes on curved surfaces, we investigate reaction-diffusion systems on axisymmetric curved surfaces. Numerical and theoretical analyses reveal that both the symmetries of the surface and pattern participate in the initiation of pattern propagation. This study provides a novel and generic mechanism of pattern propagation that is caused by surface curvature, as well as insights into the general role of surface geometry.},

By studying a non-Hermitian Haldane model, we find that the topological edge modes are localized on a special type of corner, while the bulk modes remain extended. Such an effect originates from the interplay between gain, loss, and the chiral edge currents induced by the nonlocal flux, which can be characterized by considering the properties of the edge sites as a one-dimensional chain. We establish a relation between the skin-topological effect and the P T symmetries belonging to different edges. Moreover, we discover the P T phase transition with the emergence of exceptional points between pairs of skin-topological modes.

Here, we have overcome this limitation through nanoengineered solid samples, which enable direct control over amplitude and phase patterns of nonlinearly generated extreme-ultraviolet pulses. We demonstrate experimental configurations and emitting structures that yield spatially patterned beam profiles, increased conversion efficiencies, and tailored polarization states. Furthermore, we use the emitted patterns to reconstruct height profiles, probe the near-field confinement in nanostructures below the diffraction limit of the fundamental radiation, and to image complex structures through coherent diffractive emission from these structures. Our results pave the way for introducing sub-fundamental-wavelength resolution imaging, direct manipulation of beams through nanoengineered samples, and metrology of nanostructures into the extreme-ultraviolet spectral range.},

Both analytical and numerical calculations show good agreement between our scheme and real-space two-level giant atoms. In particular, the symmetry of the model in momentum space can be broken by tuning the phase of the external field applied on the atom, enabling chiral interactions between the atom and the frequency lattice. We further demonstrate the possibility of simulating cascaded interaction and directional excitation transfer in the frequency dimension by directly extending our model to involve more such effective giant atoms.},

Here, we study the two sounds in the opposite regime of a highly compressible fluid, using an ultracold K 39 Bose gas in a three-dimensional box trap. We excite the longest-wavelength mode of our homogeneous gas, and observe two distinct resonant oscillations below the critical temperature, of which only one persists above it. In a microscopic mode-structure analysis, we find agreement with the hydrodynamic theory, where first and second sound involve density oscillations dominated by, respectively, thermal and condensed atoms.

The measurement reveals that aluminum and oxygen atoms remain in their original positions by ∼ 20 fs after the intensity maximum of the pump pulse, followed by directional atomic displacements at the fixed unit cell parameters. By comparing the experimental results and theoretical simulations, we interpret that electron excitation and relaxation triggered by the pump pulse modify the potential energy surface and drives the directional atomic displacements. Our results indicate that high-resolution x-ray structural analysis with the accuracy of 0.01 Å is feasible even with intense x-ray pulses by making the pulse duration shorter than the timescale needed to complete electron excitation and relaxation processes, which usually take up to a few tens of femtoseconds.},

  abstract     = {The first full angular analysis and an updated measurement of the decay-rate C P asymmetry of the D 0 → π + π − μ + μ − and D 0 → K + K − μ + μ − decays are reported. The analysis uses proton-proton collision data collected with the LHCb detector at center-of-mass energies of 7, 8, and 13 TeV. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 9 fb − 1 . The full set of C P -averaged angular observables and their C P asymmetries are measured as a function of the dimuon invariant mass. The results are consistent with expectations from the standard model and with C P symmetry.},

We note that ALPs decay radiatively into photons, and show that for a large subset of the parameter space ostensibly probed by these experiments, the lifetime of the ALPs is shorter than the age of the Universe. Such ALPs cannot consistently make up the dark matter, which significantly affects the interpretation of published limits from GERDA, Edelweiss-III, SuperCDMS, and Majorana. Moreover, constraints from x-ray and γ -ray astronomy exclude a wide range of the ALP-electron coupling, and supersede all current laboratory limits on dark matter ALPs in the 6 keV to 1 MeV mass range. These conclusions are rather model independent, and can only be avoided at the expense of significant fine-tuning in theories where the ALP has additional couplings to other particles.},

From the null detection of a signal by XENON1T, MiniBooNE, and Borexino, we derive limits on dark matter-nucleus spin-independent and spin-dependent cross sections which, depending on the modelization of the source, improve on other currently available bounds for light dark matter candidates of 1 up to 5 orders of magnitude.},

  abstract     = {Gravitational waves (GWs) are an exciting new probe of physics beyond the standard models of gravity and particle physics. One interesting possibility is provided by the so-called “gravitational atom,” wherein a superradiant instability spontaneously forms a cloud of ultralight bosons around a rotating black hole. The presence of these boson clouds affects the dynamics of black hole binary inspirals and their associated GW signals. In this Letter, we show that the binary companion can induce transitions between bound and unbound states of the cloud, effectively “ionizing” it, analogous to the photoelectric effect in atomic physics. The orbital energy lost in this process can overwhelm the losses due to GW emission, so that ionization drives the inspiral rather than merely perturbing it. We show that the ionization power contains sharp features that lead to distinctive “kinks” in the evolution of the emitted GW frequency. These discontinuities are a unique signature of the boson cloud, and observing them would not only constitute a detection of the ultralight boson itself, but also provide direct information about its mass and the state of the cloud.},

In the strong dispersive limit, we find that thermal light is capable of performing quantum measurements with comparable efficiency to coherent light, both being outperformed by single-photon light.

Leveraging the entangling power of quantum circuits, the EQ-GAN converges to the Nash equilibrium by performing entangling operations between both the generator output and true quantum data. In the first multiqubit experimental demonstration of a fully quantum GAN with a provably optimal Nash equilibrium, we use the EQ-GAN on a Google Sycamore superconducting quantum processor to mitigate uncharacterized errors, and we numerically confirm successful error mitigation with simulations up to 18 qubits. Finally, we present an application of the EQ-GAN to prepare an approximate quantum random access memory and for the training of quantum neural networks via variational datasets.},

Wielded correctly, though, noncommutation can boost precision. A recent foundational result relates a metrological advantage with negative quasiprobabilities—quantum extensions of probabilities—engendered by noncommuting operators. We crystallize the relationship in an equation that we prove theoretically and observe experimentally. Our proof-of-principle optical experiment features a filtering technique that we term partially postselected amplification (PPA). Using PPA, we measure a wave plate’s birefringent phase. PPA amplifies, by over two orders of magnitude, the information obtained about the phase per detected photon. In principle, PPA can boost the information obtained from the average filtered photon by an arbitrarily large factor. The filter’s amplification of systematic errors, we find, bounds the theoretically unlimited advantage in practice. PPA can facilitate any phase measurement and mitigates challenges that scale with trial number, such as proportional noise and detector saturation. By quantifying PPA’s metrological advantage with quasiprobabilities, we reveal deep connections between quantum foundations and precision measurement.},

  abstract     = {The study of entanglement in multipartite quantum states plays a major role in quantum information theory and genuine multipartite entanglement signals one of its strongest forms for applications. However, its characterization for general (mixed) states is a highly nontrivial problem. We introduce a particularly simple subclass of multipartite states, which we term pair-entangled network (PEN) states, as those that can be created by distributing exclusively bipartite entanglement in a connected network. We show that genuine multipartite entanglement in a PEN state depends on both the level of noise and the network topology and, in sharp contrast to the case of pure states, it is not guaranteed by the mere distribution of mixed bipartite entangled states. Our main result is a markedly drastic feature of this phenomenon: the amount of connectivity in the network determines whether genuine multipartite entanglement is robust to noise for any system size or whether it is completely washed out under the slightest form of noise for a sufficiently large number of parties. This latter case implies fundamental limitations for the application of certain networks in realistic scenarios, where the presence of some form of noise is unavoidable. To illustrate the applicability of PEN states to study the complex phenomenology behind multipartite entanglement, we also use them to prove superactivation of genuine multipartite nonlocality for any number of parties.},

  abstract     = {In quantum many-body dynamics admitting a description in terms of noninteracting quasiparticles, the Feynman-Vernon influence matrix (IM), encoding the effect of the system on the evolution of its local subsystems, can be analyzed exactly. For discrete dynamics, the temporal entanglement (TE) of the corresponding IM satisfies an area law, suggesting the possibility of an efficient representation of the IM in terms of matrix-product states. A natural question is whether integrable interactions, preserving stable quasiparticles, affect the behavior of the TE. While a simple semiclassical picture suggests a sublinear growth in time, one can wonder whether interactions may lead to violations of the area law. We address this problem by analyzing quantum quenches in a family of discrete integrable dynamics corresponding to the real-time Trotterization of the interacting XXZ Heisenberg model. By means of an analytical solution at the dual-unitary point and numerical calculations for generic values of the system parameters, we provide evidence that, away from the noninteracting limit, the TE displays a logarithmic growth in time, thus violating the area law.

Intercellular competition is indispensable in multicellular organisms because it weeds out senescent cells, thereby increasing the organism’s fitness and delaying aging. In this Letter, we describe the growth dynamics of multicellular organisms in the presence of intercellular competition and show that the lifespan of organisms can be extended and the onset of cancer can be delayed if cells alternate between competition (a fair strategy) and noncompetitive growth, or cooperation (a losing strategy). This effect recapitulates the weak form of the game-theoretic Parrondo’s paradox, whereby strategies that are individually fair or losing achieve a winning outcome when alternated. We show in a population model that periodic and stochastic switching between competitive and cooperative cellular strategies substantially extends the organism lifespan and reduces cancer incidence, which cannot be achieved simply by optimizing the competitive ability of the cells. These results indicate that cells could have evolved to optimally mix competitive and cooperative strategies, and that periodic intercellular competition could potentially be exploited and tuned to delay aging.},

However, the formation of hyperuniform states has been recently predicted in nonequilibrium fluids formed by chiral particles performing circular motion with the same handedness. Here we report evidence of hyperuniformity realized in a chiral active fluid comprised of pear-shaped Quincke rollers of arbitrary handedness. We show that hyperuniformity and large density fluctuations, triggered by dynamic clustering, coexist in this system at different length scales. The system loses its hyperuniformity as the curvature of particles’ motion increases, transforming them into localized spinners. Our results experimentally demonstrate a novel hyperuniform active fluid and provide new insights into an interplay between chirality, activity, and hyperuniformity.},

However, a comprehensive understanding of mesoscopic transport in submicron QAH devices has not yet been established. Here we fabricated miniaturized QAH devices with channel widths down to 600 nm, where the QAH features are still preserved. A backscattering channel is formed in narrow QAH devices through percolative hopping between 2D compressible puddles. Large resistance fluctuations are observed in narrow devices near the coercive field, which is associated with collective interference between intersecting paths along domain walls when the device geometry is smaller than the phase coherence length L ϕ . Through measurement of size-dependent breakdown current, we confirmed that the chiral edge states are confined at the physical boundary with its width on the order of Fermi wavelength.},

  abstract     = {In superconductors that lack inversion symmetry, the flow of supercurrent can induce a nonvanishing magnetization, a phenomenon which is at the heart of nondissipative magnetoelectric effects, also known as Edelstein effects. For electrons carrying spin and orbital moments, a question of fundamental relevance deals with the orbital nature of magnetoelectric effects in conventional spin-singlet superconductors with Rashba coupling. Remarkably, we find that the supercurrent-induced orbital magnetization is more than 1 order of magnitude greater than that due to the spin, giving rise to a colossal magnetoelectric effect. The induced orbital magnetization is shown to be sign tunable, with the sign change occurring for the Fermi level lying in proximity of avoiding crossing points in the Brillouin zone. In the presence of superconducting phase inhomogeneities, a modulation of the Edelstein signal on the scale of the superconducting coherence length appears, leading to domains with opposite orbital moment orientations. These hallmarks are robust to real-space self-consistent treatment of the superconducting order parameter. The orbital-dominated magnetoelectric phenomena, hence, have clear-cut marks for detection both in the bulk and at the edge of the system and are expected to be a general feature of multiorbital superconductors with inversion symmetry breaking.},

Here, we report on a detailed magnetotransport study of a MATBG device in external magnetic fields of up to B = 3 1 T , corresponding to one magnetic flux quantum per moiré unit cell Φ 0 . At Φ 0 , we observe reentrant correlated insulators at a flat band filling factors of ν = + 2 and of ν = + 3 , and interaction-driven Fermi-surface reconstructions at other fillings, which are identified by new sets of Landau levels originating from these. These experimental observations are supplemented by theoretical work that predicts a new set of eight well-isolated flat bands at Φ 0 , of comparable band width, but with different topology than in zero field. Overall, our magnetotransport data reveal a qualitatively new Hofstadter spectrum in MATBG, which arises due to the strong electronic correlations in the reentrant flat bands.},

Placed on a periodically structured dielectric substrate, the spatial modulation of the Coulomb interaction leads to the formation of exciton Bloch states with real-space valley pseudospin texture displayed in a mesoscopic supercell. We find this spatial valley texture in the exciton Bloch function is pattern locked to the propagation direction, enabling nano-optical excitation of directional exciton flow through the valley selection rule. The left-right directionality of the injected exciton current is controlled by the circular polarization of excitation, while the angular directionality is controlled by the excitation location, exhibiting a vortex pattern in a supercell. The phenomenon is reminiscent of the chiral light-matter interaction in nanophotonics structures, with the role of the guided electromagnetic wave now replaced by the valley-orbit coupled exciton Bloch wave in a uniform monolayer, which points to new excitonic devices with nonreciprocal functionalities.},

However, the prospects are obscured by the grand challenge of effectively modulating the very large number of conduction electrons in three-dimensional metallic structures. Here we propose the concept of nanoscopic electron reservoir (NER) for direct electro plasmonic and electro-optic modulation. A NER is a few-to-ten-nanometer size metal feature on a metal host and supports a localized plasmon mode. We provide a general guideline to construct highly electrically susceptible NERs and theoretically demonstrate pronounced direct electrical tuning of the plasmon mode by exploiting the nonclassical effects of conduction electrons. Moreover, we show the electro-plasmonic tuning can be efficiently translated into modulation of optical scattering by utilizing the antenna effect of the metal host for the NER. Our work extends the landscape of electro plasmonic modulation and opens appealing new opportunities for quantum plasmonics.},

The vdW Fe N GeTe 2 ( N = 3 , 4, 5; FGT) family is exceptional, owing to its vast tunability of magnetic properties. In particular, a ferromagnetic ordering temperature ( T C ) above room temperature at N = 5 (F5GT) is observed. Here, our study shows that, by nickel (Ni) substitution of iron in F5GT, a record high T C = 478 ( 6 ) K is achieved. Importantly, pervasive, beyond room-temperature ferromagnetism exists in almost the entire doping range of the phase diagram of Ni-F5GT. We argue that this striking observation in Ni-F5GT can be possibly due to several contributing factors, including increased 3D magnetic couplings due to the structural alterations.},

  abstract     = {Moiré materials formed in two-dimensional semiconductor heterobilayers are quantum simulators of Hubbard-like physics with unprecedented electron density and interaction strength tunability. Compared to atomic scale Hubbard-like systems, electrons or holes in moiré materials are less strongly attracted to their effective lattice sites because these are defined by finite-depth potential extrema. As a consequence, nonlocal interaction terms like interaction-assisted hopping and intersite exchange are more relevant. We theoretically demonstrate the possibility of tuning the strength of these coupling constants to favor unusual states of matter, including spin liquids, insulating ferromagnets, and superconductors.},

In this work, we show that in antiparallelly aligned magnetic multilayers, the long-range, chiral dipolar interaction between propagating magnons generates bulk bands with nonzero Chern integers and magnonic surface states carrying chiral spin currents. The surface states are highly localized and can be easily toggled between nontrivial and trivial phases through an external magnetic field. The realization of chiral surface spin currents in this dipolarly coupled heterostructure represents a magnonic implementation of the coupled wire model that has been extensively explored in electronic systems.

  abstract     = {The plateau-to-plateau transition in quantum Hall effect under high magnetic fields is a celebrated quantum phase transition between two topological states. It can be achieved by either sweeping the magnetic field or tuning the carrier density. The recent realization of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators with tunable Chern numbers introduces the channel degree of freedom to the dissipation-free chiral edge transport and makes the study of the quantum phase transition between two topological states under zero magnetic field possible. Here, we synthesized the magnetic topological insulator ( TI ) / TI pentalayer heterostructures with different Cr doping concentrations in the middle magnetic TI layers using molecular beam epitaxy. By performing transport measurements, we found a potential plateau phase transition between C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states under zero magnetic field. In tuning the transition, the Hall resistance monotonically decreases from h / e 2 to h / 2 e 2 , concurrently, the longitudinal resistance exhibits a maximum at the critical point. Our results show that the ratio between the Hall resistance and the longitudinal resistance is greater than 1 at the critical point, which indicates that the original chiral edge channel from the C = 1 QAH state coexists with the dissipative bulk conduction channels. Subsequently, these bulk conduction channels appear to self-organize and form the second chiral edge channel in completing the plateau phase transition. Our study will motivate further investigations of this novel Chern number change-induced quantum phase transition and advance the development of the QAH chiral edge current-based electronic and spintronic devices.},

The presence of nontrivial domain-wall states is interpreted with a concept of valley Chern number, which is well defined only in the limit of small band gap. Here, we propose a new visual angle to track the intricate valley topology in classical systems. Benefiting from the controllability of our acoustic metacrystals, we construct Weyl points in synthetic three-dimensional momentum space through introducing an extra structural parameter (rotation angle here). As such, the two-dimensional valley-projected band topology can be tracked with the strictly quantized topological charge in three-dimensional Weyl crystal, which features open surface arcs connecting the synthetic Weyl points and gapless chiral surface states along specific Weyl paths. All theoretical predictions are conclusively identified by our acoustic experiments. Our findings may promote the development of topological valley physics, which is less well defined yet under hot debate in multiple physical disciplines.},

The cumulant expansion for the one-electron Green’s function has been successful in describing shake-up effects but ignores atomic multiplets. More complete methods, such as dynamic mean-field theory can be computationally demanding. Here, we show that separating the dynamic Coulomb interactions into local and longer-range parts with ab initio parameters yields a combined multiplet-plus-cumulant approach that accounts for both local atomic multiplets and satellite excitations. The approach is illustrated in transition metal oxides and explains the multiplet peaks, charge-transfer satellites, and distributed background features observed in XPS experiment.},

Exploiting their longitudinal flexibility, pyrenylene chains are indeed able to lower diffusion energy barriers via on-surface directional locking and molecular strain. The resulting ultralow friction reaches values on the order of tens of pN reported so far only for rigid chains sliding on an incommensurate surface. Therefore, we demonstrate how molecular flexibility can be harnessed to realize complex nanomotion while retaining a superlubric character.

Our experimental system enables us to observe both the amplitude and the phase of these wave packets. For low steepness waves, the propagation dynamics is in the linear regime, and these waves unfold a Talbot carpet. By increasing the steepness of the waves and the corresponding nonlinear response, the waves follow the Akhmediev breather solution, where the higher frequency periodic patterns at the fractional Talbot distance disappear. Further increase in the wave steepness leads to deviations from the Akhmediev breather solution and to asymmetric breaking of the wave function. Unlike the periodic revival that occurs in the linear regime, here the wave crests exhibit self acceleration, followed by self deceleration at half the Talbot distance, thus completing a smooth transition of the periodic pulse train by half a period. Such phenomena can be theoretically modeled by using the Dysthe equation.},

Previously, dispersion was ignored in spin-momentum locking, resulting in anomalies contradicting the apparent physical reality. Here, we formulate four dispersive spin-momentum equations, revealing in theory that transverse spin is locked with kinetic momentum. Moreover, in dispersive metal or magnetic materials spin-momentum locking obeys the left-hand screw rule. In addition to dispersion, structural features can affect substantially this locking. Remarkably, an extraordinary spin originating from coupling polarization ellipticities is uncovered that depends on the symmetry of the field modes. We further identify the properties of this spin-momentum locking with diverse photonic topological lattices by engineering their rotational symmetry akin to that in solid-state physics. The concept of spin-momentum locking based on photon flow properties translates easily to other classical wave fields.},

Recently discovered higher-order topological phases further extend the concept of topological protection enabling versatile control over localization in multiple dimensions. Motivated by the recent advances in quantum technologies such as large coherently operating qubit ensembles, we predict and investigate the higher-order topological phase of photon pairs emerging due to effective photon-photon interaction and described by the extended version of Bose-Hubbard model. Being feasible for state-of-the-art experimental capabilities, the designed model provides an interesting example of interaction-induced topological transitions in the few-particle two-dimensional system.},

In this respect, we demonstrate that a pseudo-Hermitian configuration can always be driven into thermal equilibrium when a proper nonlinear operator is paired with the linear Hamiltonian of the system. We show that, in this case, the system will thermodynamically settle into an irregular pattern that does not resemble any known statistical distribution. Interestingly, this stable equilibrium response is associated with a Rayleigh-Jeans law when viewed within an appropriately transformed space that displays unitary dynamics. By considering a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain, our results indicate that the thermodynamic equilibrium will always favor the edge modes instead of the ground state, in stark contrast to conventional nonlinear Hermitian configurations. Moreover, non-Hermitian lattices are shown to exhibit unusually high heat capacities, potentially acting as optical heat reservoirs to other Hermitian systems, by employing only a small number of sites and low power levels.},

We develop a general theory to characterize and optimize this process and reveal that such a high fidelity is enabled by an interesting two-photon scattering dynamics: while the first emitter gives rise to a complex multimode field, the second emitter recombines the field amplitudes, and the net two-photon scattering induces a self-time reversal of the input pulse mode. The presented scheme can be employed to construct logic elements for propagating photons, such as a deterministic nonlinear-sign gate with a fidelity ≳ 0.9995 .},

However, due to differences in local environment, solid-state emitters typically feature a range of distinct transition frequencies, which makes it challenging to create optically mediated entanglement between arbitrary emitter pairs. We propose and demonstrate an efficient method for entangling emitters with optical transitions separated by many linewidths. In our approach, electro-optic modulators enable a single photon to herald a parity measurement on a pair of spin qubits. We experimentally demonstrate the protocol using two silicon-vacancy centers in a diamond nanophotonic cavity, with optical transitions separated by 7.4 GHz. Working with distinguishable emitters allows for individual qubit addressing and readout, enabling parallel control and entanglement of both colocated and spatially separated emitters, a key step toward scaling up quantum information processing systems.},

  abstract     = {The Duffing oscillator is a nonlinear extension of the ubiquitous harmonic oscillator and as such plays an outstanding role in science and technology. Experimentally, the system parameters are determined by a measurement of its response to an external excitation. When changing the amplitude or frequency of the external excitation, a sudden jump in the response function reveals the nonlinear dynamics prominently. However, this bistability leaves part of the full response function unobserved, which limits the precise measurement of the system parameters. Here, we exploit the often unknown fact that the response of a Duffing oscillator with nonlinear damping is a unique function of its phase. By actively stabilizing the oscillator’s phase we map out the full response function. This phase control allows us to precisely determine the system parameters. Our results are particularly important for characterizing nanoscale resonators, where nonlinear effects are observed readily and which hold great promise for next generation of ultrasensitive force and mass measurements. We demonstrate our approach experimentally with an optically levitated particle in high vacuum.},

By periodically modulating the amplitude of a checkerboard optical lattice, the two lowest isolated bands are hybridized such that the single particle energy displays a continuum of nearly degenerate minima that lie along a circle in reciprocal space. The moatlike structure is confirmed by observing a zero group velocity at nonzero quasimomentum and we directly observe the effect of the modified dispersion on the trajectory of the center of mass position of the condensate. We measure the lifetime of condensates loaded into different moat bands at different quasimomenta and compare to theoretical predictions based on a linear stability analysis of Bogoliubov excitations. We find that the condensate decay increases rapidly as the quasimomentum is decreased below the radius of the moat minimum, and argue that such dynamical instability is characteristic of moatlike dispersions, including spin-orbit coupled systems. The ground state of strongly interacting bosons in such degenerate energy landscapes is expected to be highly correlated, and our work represents a step toward realizing fractional quantum Hall-like states of bosons in an optical lattice.},

The observed dependences of loss rates on temperature and barrier height show characteristic behavior of repulsive traps and indicate strongly suppressed average ac Stark shifts. Within the trap, we find that Λ -enhanced gray molasses cooling is effective, producing similar minimum temperatures as those obtained in free space. By combining in-trap laser cooling with dynamical reshaping of the trap, we also present a method that allows highly efficient and rapid transfer from molecular magneto-optical traps into conventional attractive optical traps, which has been an outstanding challenge for experiments to date. Notably, our method could allow nearly lossless transfer over millisecond timescales.},

The theory has one dimensionless coupling which formally runs to a Landau pole in the ultraviolet. We show that many properties of the system are universal in the double fine-tuning limit. The ratio of the mean-square matter radius and charge radius is found to be ⟨ r m 2 ⟩ / ⟨ r c 2 ⟩ = A f ( ε n / B ) , where A is the mass number of the core and f is a function of the ratio ε n / B which we find explicitly. In particular, when B ≫ ε n , ⟨ r m 2 ⟩ / ⟨ r c 2 ⟩ = 2 3 A . The shape of the E 1 dipole strength function also depends only on the ratio ε n / B and is derived in explicit analytic form.

  abstract     = {Black hole (BH) spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful approach to extracting spacetime information from gravitational wave (GW) observed signals. Yet, quasinormal mode (QNM) spectral instability under small scale perturbations has been recently shown to be a common classical general relativistic phenomenon [J. L. Jaramillo et al. , Phys. Rev. X 11 , 031003 (2021) ]. This requires assessing its impact on the BH QNM spectrum, in particular on BH QNM overtone frequencies. We conclude (i) perturbed BH QNM overtones are indeed potentially observable in the GW waveform, providing information on small-scale environment BH physics, and (ii) their detection poses a challenging data analysis problem of singular interest for LISA astrophysics. We adopt a twofold approach, combining theoretical results from scattering theory with a fine-tuned data analysis on a highly accurate numerical GW ringdown signal. The former introduces a set of effective parameters (partially relying on a BH Weyl law) to characterize QNM instability physics. The latter provides a proof of principle demonstrating that the QNM spectral instability is indeed accessible in the time-domain GW waveform, though certainly requiring large signal-to-noise ratios. Particular attention is devoted to discussing the patterns of isospectrality loss under QNM instability, since the disentanglement between axial and polar GW parities may already occur within the near-future detection range.},

We focus on dark photons emitted in the 10 ms–1 s after the merger, and show how they can lead to bright transient γ -ray signals. The signal will be approximately isotropic, and for much of the interesting parameter space will be close to thermal, with an apparent temperature of ∼ 100 keV . These features can distinguish the dark photon signal from the expected short γ -ray bursts produced in neutron star mergers, which are beamed in a small angle and nonthermal. We calculate the expected signal strength and show that for dark photon masses in the 1–100 MeV range it can easily lead to total luminosities larger than 10 46 ergs for much of the unconstrained parameter space. This signal can be used to probe a large fraction of the unconstrained parameter space motivated by freeze-in dark matter scenarios with interactions mediated by a dark photon in that mass range. We also comment on future improvements when proposed telescopes and midband gravitational detectors become operational.},

It is well known that the crowding effect produced by these reflecting surfaces slows the dispersion of Brownian tracers. Here, using a general adsorption desorption model with surface diffusion, we show analytically that making surfaces or obstacles attractive can accelerate dispersion. In particular, we show that this enhancement of diffusion can exist even when the surface diffusion constant is smaller than that in the bulk. Even more remarkably, this enhancement effect occurs when the effective diffusion constant, when restricted to surfaces only, is lower than the effective diffusivity with purely reflecting boundaries. We give analytical formulas for this intriguing effect in periodic arrays of spheres as well as undulating microchannels. Our results are confirmed by numerical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations.},

In contrast to previous literature, our formulation is based on bosonic codes, well-studied tools in continuous-variable quantum computation. Particularly, we use the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code to represent multiqubit states and consider the resource theory for the Wigner negativity. Our techniques are useful in finding resource lower bounds for different applications as state conversion and gate synthesis. The analytical expression of our magic measure allows us to extend current analysis limited to small dimensions, easily addressing systems of up to 12 qubits.},

  abstract     = {Simulating quantum dynamics beyond the reach of classical computers is one of the main envisioned applications of quantum computers. The most promising quantum algorithms to this end in the near term are the simplest, which use the Trotter formula and its higher-order variants to approximate the dynamics of interest. The approximation error of these algorithms is often poorly understood, even in the most basic and topical cases where the target Hamiltonian decomposes into two realizable terms: H = H 1 + H 2 . Recent studies have reported anomalously low approximation error with unexpected scaling in such cases, which they attribute to quantum interference between the errors from different steps of the algorithm. Here, we provide a simpler picture of these effects by relating the Trotter formula to its second-order variant for such H = H 1 + H 2 cases. Our method generalizes state-of-the-art error bounds without the technical caveats of prior studies, and elucidates how each part of the total error arises from the underlying quantum circuit. We compare our bound to the true error numerically, and find a close match over many orders of magnitude in the simulation parameters. Our findings further reduce the required circuit depth for the least experimentally demanding quantum simulation algorithms, and illustrate a useful method for bounding simulation error more broadly.},

Remarkably, the far-field rate of synchronization is maximized at an intermediate value of elastic compliance, with surprising implications for bacteria.},

We consider two example mechanisms with shape-space singularities and find that they are more likely to be found in configurations near the singularities than others.

These changes appear beyond a length scale that diverges in the q → ∞ limit, so that the Vicsek-model phenomenology is observed in finite systems for weak enough anisotropy, i.e., sufficiently high q .

Leveraging known solutions of the partial differential equations, we present an illuminating agreement between theory and experiment across kirigami designs.

  abstract     = {The Elliott-Yafet theory of spin relaxation in nonmagnetic metals predicts proportionality between spin and momentum relaxation times for scattering centers such as phonons. Here, we test this theory in Al nanowires over a very large thickness range (8.5–300 nm), finding that the Elliott-Yafet proportionality “constant” for phonon scattering in fact exhibits a large, unanticipated finite-size effect. Supported by analytical and numerical modeling, we explain this via strong phonon-induced spin relaxation at surfaces and interfaces, driven in particular by enhanced spin-orbit coupling.},

Supercurrent enhancement by a magnetic field has been observed in the InAs nanowire Josephson junctions and assigned to a topological transition. In this work we observe a similar phenomenon but discuss the nontopological origin by considering the trapping of quasiparticles by vortices that penetrate the superconductor under a finite magnetic field. This assignment is supported by the observed hysteresis of the switching current when sweeping up and down the magnetic field. Our experiment shows the importance of quasiparticles in superconducting devices with a magnetic field, which can provide important insights for the design of qubits using superconductors.},

  abstract     = {The Berry phase plays an important role in determining many physical properties of quantum systems. However, tuning the energy spectrum of a quantum system via Berry phase is comparatively rare because the Berry phase is usually a fixed constant. Here, we report the realization of an unusual valley-polarized energy spectra via continuously tunable Berry phases in Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene quantum dots. In our experiment, the Berry phase of electron orbital states is continuously tuned from about π to 2 π by perpendicular magnetic fields. When the Berry phase equals π or 2 π , the electron states in the two inequivalent valleys are energetically degenerate. By altering the Berry phase to noninteger multiples of π , large and continuously tunable valley-polarized energy spectra are realized. Our result reveals the Berry phase’s essential role in valleytronics and the observed valley splitting, on the order of 10 meV at a magnetic field of 1 T, is about 100 times larger than Zeeman splitting for spin, shedding light on graphene-based valleytronics.},

Under the resonance condition, intense Stokes and anti-Stokes Raman scattering can be observed for the phonon modes of a two-monolayer (ML) ZnO on an Ag(111) surface, enabling us to monitor local heating at the nanoscale. It is revealed that the local heating originates mainly from inelastic electron tunneling through the electronic resonance when the bias voltage exceeds the conduction band edge of the 2-ML ZnO. When the bias voltage is lower than the conduction band edge, the local heating arises from two different contributions, namely direct optical excitation between the interface state and the conduction band of 2-ML ZnO or injection of photoexcited electrons from an Ag tip into the conduction band. These optical heating processes are promoted by localized surface plasmon excitation. Simultaneous mapping of tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy for 2-ML ZnO including an atomic-scale defect demonstrates visualizing a correlation between the heating efficiency and the local density of states, which further allows us to analyze the local electron-phonon coupling strength with ∼ 2 nm spatial resolution.},

Yet to date, convincing evidence of topological edge states in stanene remains to be seen, let alone the coexistence of these two ingredients, owing to the bottleneck of growing high-quality stanene films. Here we fabricate one- to five-layer stanene films on the Bi(111) substrate and observe the robust edge states using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. We also measure distinct superconducting gaps on different-layered stanene films. Our first-principles calculations further show that hydrogen passivation plays a decisive role as a surfactant in improving the quality of the stanene films, while the Bi substrate endows the films with nontrivial topology. The coexistence of nontrivial topology and intrinsic superconductivity renders the system a promising candidate to become the simplest topological superconductor based on a single-element system.},

In particular, in a ferromagnet having a large local moment due to Hund’s coupling (Hund’s ferromagnet), the Fermi surface expands even above the Curie temperature ( T C ) as if a spin polarization occurred. Behind this phenomenon, effective “Hund’s physics” works in momentum space, originating from ferromagnetic fluctuations in the strong-coupling regime. The resulting significantly momentum-dependent (spatially nonlocal) electron correlations induce an electronic structure reconstruction involving a Fermi surface volume change and a redistribution of the momentum-space occupation.

  abstract     = {A theory of electronic friction is developed using the exact factorization of the electronic-nuclear wave function. No assumption is made regarding the electronic bath, which can be made of independent or interacting electrons, and the nuclei are treated quantally. The ensuing equation of motion for the nuclear wave function is a nonlinear Schrödinger equation including a friction term. The resulting friction kernel agrees with a previously derived mixed quantum-classical result by Dou et al. , [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 119 , 046001 (2017) ], except for a pseudomagnetic contribution in the latter that is here removed. More specifically, it is shown that the electron dynamics generally washes out the gauge fields appearing in the adiabatic dynamics. However, these are fully re-established in the typical situation where the electrons respond rapidly on the slow time scale of the nuclear dynamics (Markov limit). Hence, we predict Berry’s phase effects to be observable also in the presence of electronic friction. Application to a model vibrational relaxation problem proves that the proposed approach represents a viable way to account for electronic friction in a fully quantum setting for the nuclear dynamics.},

We find that the dimensionless combination ω τ n , with ω the scan frequency of the time-dependent potential and τ n the relaxation timescale of the stack-electrode model, governs the CV curves and capacitance: the capacitance is scan-rate independent for ω τ n ≪ 1 and scan-rate dependent for ω τ n ≫ 1 . With a single fit parameter and all other model parameters dictated by experiments, our model reproduces experimental CV curves over a wide range of ω . Meanwhile, the influence of the pore size distribution on the charging dynamics is investigated to explain the experimental data.},

The method is used to verify global stability of 2D plane Couette flow at Reynolds numbers above the the energy stability threshold found by Orr in 1907 [The stability or instability of the steady motions of a perfect liquid and of a viscous liquid. Part II: A viscous liquid, Proc. R. Ir. Acad. Sect. A 27 , 69 (1907)]. This is the first global stability result for any flow that surpasses the energy method.},

  abstract     = {The utility of all parametric nonlinear optical processes is hampered by phase-matching requirements. Quasi-phase-matching, birefringent phase matching, and higher-order-mode phase matching have all been developed to address this constraint, but the methods demonstrated to date suffer from the inconvenience of only being phase matched for a single, specific arrangement of beams, typically copropagating, resulting in cumbersome experimental configurations and large footprints for integrated devices. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that these phase-matching requirements may be satisfied in a parametric nonlinear optical process for multiple, if not all, configurations of input and output beams when using low-index media. Our measurement constitutes the first experimental observation of direction-independent phase matching for a medium sufficiently long for phase matching to be relevant. We demonstrate four-wave mixing from spectrally distinct co- and counterpropagating pump and probe beams, the backward generation of a nonlinear signal, and excitation by an out-of-plane probe beam. These results explicitly show that the unique properties of low-index media relax traditional phase-matching constraints, which can be exploited to facilitate nonlinear interactions and miniaturize nonlinear devices, thus adding to the established exceptional properties of low-index materials.},

The chiral interaction between the resonator mode and the QE can break the time-reversal symmetry without the magneto-optical effect and an external or synthetic magnetic field. As a result, nonreciprocal single-photon edge states, band gaps, and flat bands appear. By using such a chiral QE coupled-resonator optical waveguide system, including a finite number of unit cells and working in the nonreciprocal band gap, we achieve frequency-multiplexed single-photon circulators with high fidelity and low insertion loss. The chiral QE-light interaction can also protect one-way propagation of single photons against backscattering. Our work opens a new door for studying unconventional photonic band structures without electronic counterparts in condensed matter and exploring its applications in the quantum regime.},

We predict this process to occur for any atom number and any atom-light coupling strength. These findings are supported by measurements performed with cold cesium atoms coupled to the evanescent field of an optical nanofiber. We experimentally observe the evolution of the state of the ensemble passing through the first two subradiant states, leading to sudden, temporary switch-offs of the optical power emitted into the nanofiber. Our results contribute to the fundamental understanding of collective atom-light interaction and apply to all physical systems, whose description involves timed Dicke states.},

Our systematic study of large lattice sizes, hosting nearly 500 atoms, provides strong evidence of the stability of the FFLO state in this regime, as well as a high-accuracy characterization of its properties. Our results for the density correlation function reveal the existence of density order in the system, suggesting the possibility of an intricate coexistence of long-range orders in the ground state.

Our approach is based on utilizing the full information of the thermodynamic potentials at the high-density limit together with thermodynamic stability and causality. This requires considering the pressure as a function of chemical potential p ( μ ) instead of the commonly used pressure as a function of energy density p ( ε ) . The results can be used to propagate the perturbative quantum chromodynamics calculations reliable around 40 n s to lower densities in the most conservative way possible. We constrain the EOS starting from only a few times the nuclear saturation density n ≳ 2.2 n s , and at n = 5 n s we exclude at least 65\% of otherwise allowed area in the ε − p plane. This provides information complementary to astrophysical observations that should be taken into account in any complete statistical inference study of the EOS. These purely theoretical results are independent of astrophysical neutron-star input, and hence, they can also be used to test theories of modified gravity and beyond the standard model physics in neutron stars.},

  abstract     = {We present the first systematic feasibility study of accessing generalized parton distributions of the pion at an electron-ion collider through deeply virtual Compton scattering. Relying on state-of-the-art models for pion GPDs, we show that quarks and gluons interfere destructively, modulating the expected event rate and maximizing it when parton content is generated via radiation from valence dressed quarks. Moreover, gluons are found to induce a sign inversion for the beam-spin asymmetry in every model studied, being a clear signal for pinning down the regime of gluon superiority.},

The hadronic transport UrQMD model reproduces our C 4 / C 2 in the measured acceptance. Compared to higher energy results and the transport model calculations, the suppression in C 4 / C 2 is consistent with fluctuations driven by baryon number conservation and indicates an energy regime dominated by hadronic interactions.

Pursuing this question requires developing the precision test of the CGC formalism. By systematically implementing the threshold resummation, we significantly improve the stability of the next-to-leading-order calculation in CGC for forward rapidity hadron productions in p p and p A collisions, especially in the high p T region, and obtain reliable descriptions of all existing data measured at RHIC and the LHC across all p T regions. Consequently, this technique can pave the way for the precision studies of the CGC next-to-leading-order predictions by confronting them with a large amount of precise data.},

H Λ 3 and H Λ 4 , being the two simplest bound states composed of hyperons and nucleons, are cornerstones in the field of hypernuclear physics. Their lifetimes are measured to be 221 ± 15 ( stat ) ± 19 ( syst ) ps for H Λ 3 and 218 ± 6 ( stat ) ± 13 ( syst ) ps for H Λ 4 . The p T -integrated yields of H Λ 3 and H Λ 4 are presented in different centrality and rapidity intervals. It is observed that the shape of the rapidity distribution of H Λ 4 is different for 0\%–10\% and 10\%–50\% centrality collisions. Thermal model calculations, using the canonical ensemble for strangeness, describes the H Λ 3 yield well, while underestimating the H Λ 4 yield. Transport models, combining baryonic mean-field and coalescence ( jam ) or utilizing dynamical cluster formation via baryonic interactions ( phqmd ) for light nuclei and hypernuclei production, approximately describe the measured H Λ 3 and H Λ 4 yields. Our measurements provide means to precisely assess our understanding of the fundamental baryonic interactions with strange quarks, which can impact our understanding of more complicated systems involving hyperons, such as the interior of neutron stars or exotic hypernuclei.},

By inelastic diffraction, we mean a process in which the two hard jets—a quark-antiquark pair generated by the decay of the virtual photon—are accompanied by a softer gluon jet, emitted by the quark or the antiquark. This process can be described as the elastic scattering of an effective gluon-gluon dipole. The cross section takes a factorized form, between a hard factor and a unintegrated (“Pomeron”) gluon distribution describing the transverse momentum imbalance between the hard dijets. The dominant contribution comes from the black disk limit and leads to a dijet imbalance of the order of the target saturation momentum Q s evaluated at the rapidity gap. Integrating out the dijet imbalance, we obtain a collinear factorization where the initial condition for the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi evolution is set by gluon saturation.},

This is simply a Brownian motion with a Poissonian resetting rate r to the origin which is constrained to start and end at the origin at time t f . We unveil a surprising general mechanism that enhances fluctuations of a Brownian bridge, by introducing a small amount of resetting. This is verified for different observables, such as the mean-square displacement, the hitting probability of a fixed target and the expected maximum. This mechanism, valid for a Brownian bridge in arbitrary dimensions, leads to a finite optimal resetting rate that minimizes the time to search a fixed target. The physical reason behind an optimal resetting rate in this case is entirely different from that of resetting Brownian motions without the bridge constraint. We also derive an exact effective Langevin equation that generates numerically the trajectories of a resetting Brownian bridge in all dimensions via a completely rejection-free algorithm.},

Here, we establish such a physical principle for energy consumption in order to achieve a certain level of measurement precision in quantum metrology, and show that it is intrinsically determined by the erasure of quantum Fisher information. The principle provides a powerful tool to investigate the advantage of quantum resources, not only in measurement precision but also in energy efficiency.

In experimental and computational packings of wooden sticks, we identify prominent features of their response to cyclic oedometric compression: nonlinear stiffness, transient plasticity, and eventually repeatable velocity-independent hysteresis. We trace these features to their micromechanic origins, identified in characteristic appearance, disappearance, and displacement of internal contacts.},

  abstract     = {Double-helix structures, such as DNA, are formed in nature to realize many unique functions. Inspired by this, researchers are pursuing strategies to design such structures from polymers. A key question is whether the double helix can be formed from the self-folding of a single polymer chain without specific interactions. Here, using Langevin dynamics simulation and theoretical analysis, we find that a stable double-helix phase can be achieved by the self-folding of single semiflexible polymers as a result of the cooperation between local structure and nonlocal attraction. The critical temperature of double-helix formation approximately follows T cri ∼ ln ( k θ ) and T cri ∼ ln ( k τ ) , where k θ and k τ are the polymer bending and torsion stiffness, respectively. Furthermore, the double helix can exhibit major and minor grooves due to symmetric break for better packing. Our results provide a novel guide to the experimental design of the double helix.},

We propose that the quantum capacitance arising in electronic two-level systems (the dual of Josephson inductance) can provide an alternative dissipationless nonlinear element for parametric amplification. We experimentally demonstrate phase-sensitive parametric amplification using a QD-reservoir electron transition in a CMOS nanowire split-gate transistor embedded in a 1.8 GHz superconducting lumped-element microwave cavity, achieving parametric gains of − 3 to + 3 dB , limited by Sisyphus dissipation. Using a semiclassical model, we find an optimized design within current technological capabilities could achieve gains and bandwidths comparable to JPAs, while providing complementary specifications with respect to integration in semiconductor platforms or operation at higher magnetic fields.},

Based on the effective Hamiltonian model as well as first-principles calculations, we propose a general thin-film design method to stabilize the functional BiFeO 3 ( BFO ) -type structure, which is a common metastable structure in widespread CTO-type perovskite oxides. It is found that the improper antiferroelectricity in CTO-type perovskite and ferroelectricity in BFO-type perovskite have distinct dependences on mechanical and electric boundary conditions, both of which involve oxygen octahedral rotation and tilt. The above difference can be used to stabilize the highly polar BFO-type structure in many CTO-type perovskite materials.},

Owing to their unique attributes and facile experimental tunability, EPs potentially enable strong nonlinearities, condensation, and superfluidity at room temperature. However, the diffraction limit of light and the momentum content of fast electron probes preclude the characterization of EPs in nanoscale structured cavities exhibiting energy-momentum dispersion. Here we present fully relativistic analytical theory and companion numerical simulations showing that these limitations can be overcome to measure EPs in periodic nanophotonic cavities on their natural energy, momentum, and length scales via lattice electron energy gain spectroscopy. With the combined high momentum resolution of light and nanoscale spatial resolution of focused electron beams, lattice electron energy gain spectroscopy can expose deeply subwavelength EP features using currently available monochromated, aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopes.},

The efficient method to detect an AFM order parameter, known as the Néel vector, by electric means is critical to realize concepts of AFM spintronics. Here, we demonstrate that noncollinear AFM metals, such as Mn 3 Sn , exhibit a momentum dependent spin polarization which can be exploited in AFM tunnel junctions to detect the Néel vector. Using first-principles calculations, we predict a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect as high as 300\% in AFM tunnel junctions with Mn 3 Sn electrodes, where the junction resistance depends on the relative orientation of their Néel vectors and exhibits four nonvolatile resistance states. We argue that the spin-split band structure and the related TMR effect can also be realized in other noncollinear AFM metals like Mn 3 Ge , Mn 3 Ga , Mn 3 Pt , and Mn 3 GaN . Our work provides a robust method for detecting the Néel vector in noncollinear antiferromagnets via the TMR effect, which may be useful for their application in AFM spintronic devices.},

The Casimir term changes the interpretation of fluctuation effects occurring at wetting transitions so that, for example, mean-field predictions are no longer obtained when interfacial fluctuations are ignored. While the Casimir contribution does not alter the surface phase diagram, it significantly increases the adsorption near a first-order wetting transition and changes completely the predicted critical singularities of tricritical wetting, including the nonuniversality occurring in 3D arising from interfacial fluctuations. Using the numerical renormalization group, we show that, for critical wetting, the asymptotic regime is extremely narrow with the growth of the parallel correlation length characterized by an effective exponent in quantitative agreement with Ising model simulations, resolving a long-standing controversy.},

Unlike in 1D, the 2D roton modes have little in common with the supersolid configuration. We develop a finite-temperature stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii theory that includes beyond-mean-field effects to explore the formation process in 2D and find that evaporative cooling directly into the supersolid phase—hence bypassing the first-order roton instability—can produce a robust supersolid in a circular trap. Importantly, the resulting supersolid is stable at the final nonzero temperature. We then experimentally produce a 2D supersolid in a near-circular trap through such an evaporative procedure. Our work provides insight into the process of supersolid formation in 2D and defines a realistic path to the formation of large two-dimensional supersolid arrays.},

Here we show that the second-order Josephson coupling can induce an exotic superconducting phase in a bilayer system. By using tensor-network methods, the partition function of the 2D classical model is expressed as a product of 1D quantum transfer operator, whose eigenequation can be solved by an algorithm of matrix product states rigorously. From the singularity shown by the entanglement entropy of the 1D quantum analog, various phase transitions can be accurately determined. Below the BKT phase transition, an interlayer Ising long-range order is established at T Ising , and the phase coherence of both intralayers and interlayers is locked together. For two identical layers, the Ising transition coincides with the BKT transition at a multicritical point. For two inequivalent layers, however, there emerges an intermediate quasi-long-range order phase ( T Ising &lt; T &lt; T BKT ), where the vortex-antivortex bindings occur in the layer with the larger intralayer coupling, but only half-vortex pairs with topological strings exist in the other layer, corresponding to the phase coherence of pairs of Cooper pairs. So our study provides a promising way to realize the charge- 4 e superconductivity in a bilayer system.},

Using a direct-drive implosion with polar illumination and imposed field, we observed that magnetization produces a significant increase in the implosion oblateness (a 2.5 × larger P 2 amplitude in x-ray self-emission images) compared with reference experiments with identical drive but with no field applied. The implosions produce strongly magnetized electrons ( ω e τ e ≫ 1 ) and ions ( ω i τ i &gt; 1 ) that, as shown using simulations, restrict the cross field heat flow necessary for lateral distribution of the laser and shock heating from the implosion pole to the waist, causing the enhanced mode-two shape.},

  abstract     = {The new hohlraum experimental platform and the quasi-3D simulation model are developed to enable the study of the indirect drive experiment using the six-cylinder-port hohlraum for the first time. It is also the first implosion experiment for the six laser-entrance-hole hohlraum to effectively use all the laser beams of the laser facility that is primarily designed for the cylindrical hohlraum. The experiments performed at the 100 kJ Laser Facility produce a peak hohlraum radiation temperature of ∼ 2 2 2 eV for ∼ 8 0 kJ and 2 ns square laser pulse. The inferred x-ray conversion efficiency η ∼ 87\% is similar to the cylindrical hohlraum and higher than the octahedral spherical hohlraum at the same laser facility, while the low laser backscatter is similar to the outer cone of the cylindrical hohlraum. The hohlraum radiation temperature and M -band ( &gt; 1.6 keV ) flux can be well reproduced by the quasi-3D simulation. The variations of the yield-over-clean and the hot spot shape can also be semiquantitatively explained by the calculated major radiation asymmetry of the quasi-3D simulation. Our work demonstrates the capability for the study of the indirect drive with the six-cylinder-port hohlraum at the cylindrically configured laser facility, which is essential for numerically assessing the laser energy required by the ignition-scale six-cylinder-port hohlraum.},

The supersaturation is achieved by either a formerly dissolved bubble or by heating locally the surface below the boiling temperature. The experiments are conducted in a thin film of water; one side of the water film is in contact with a gold coated substrate that is heated by a continuous laser through plasmonic heating. For nucleation of a bubble, the pressure at the heated spot is reduced by a transient rarefaction wave. The experimental findings suggest that the local gas supersaturation is responsible to nucleate cavitation and thus connects the phase transitions of cavitation and boiling. Additionally, the pressure waves in the liquid gap are studied numerically.},

We show that the twisted stack with electrostatic control can function as arbitrary-birefringent wave-plate or arbitrary polarizer with tunable degree of non-normality, which in turn give access to plethora of polarization transformers including rotators, pseudorotators, symmetric and ambidextrous polarizers.

Compared with plane waves, localized electromagnetic emitters are more general sources in modern nanophotonics. As a typical example, manipulating the emission direction of a quantum dot is of vital importance for the investigation of on-chip quantum optics and quantum information processing. Herein, we introduce the concept of transverse Kerker effect for dipole sources utilizing a subwavelength dielectric antenna, where the radiative power of magnetic, electric, and more general chiral dipole emitters can be dominantly redirected along their dipole moments with nearly suppression of radiation perpendicular to the dipole moments. This type of transverse Kerker effect is also associated with Purcell enhancement mediated by electromagnetic multipolar resonances induced in the dielectric antenna. Analytical conditions of transverse Kerker effect are derived for the magnetic, electric, and chiral dipole emitters. We further provide microwave experiment validation for the magnetic dipole emitter. Our results provide new physical mechanisms to manipulate the emission properties of localized electromagnetic source which might facilitate the on-chip quantum optics and beyond.},

By introducing the intrinsic spatial differentiation into heralded single-photon microscopy imaging technique, it makes the structure of pure-phase object clearly visible at low photon level, avoiding any biophysical damages to living cells. Based on the polarization entanglement, the switch between dark-field imaging and bright-field imaging is remotely controlled in the heralding arm.

We argue that in a quasi two-dimensional geometry, a conformal window remains at weak interactions. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we verify the conformal symmetry by computing the energy spectrum of mesoscopic particle ensembles in a harmonic trap, which separates into conformal towers formed by so-called primary states and their center-of-mass and breathing-mode excitations, the latter having excitation energies at precisely twice the harmonic oscillator energy. In addition, using Metropolis importance sampling, we compute the hyperradial distribution function of the many-body wave functions, which are predicted by the conformal symmetry in closed analytical form. The weakly interacting Fermi gas constitutes a system where the nonrelativistic conformal symmetry can be revealed using elementary methods, and our results are testable in current experiments on mesoscopic Fermi gases.},

  abstract     = {The quantum null energy condition (QNEC) is a lower bound on the energy-momentum tensor in terms of the variation of the entanglement entropy of a subregion along a null direction. To gain insights into quantum thermodynamics of many-body systems, we study if the QNEC restricts irreversible entropy production in quenches driven by energy-momentum inflow from an infinite memoryless bath in two-dimensional holographic theories. We find that an increase in both entropy and temperature, as implied by the Clausius inequality of classical thermodynamics, is necessary but not sufficient to not violate QNEC in quenches leading to transitions between thermal states with momentums that are dual to Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli geometries. For an arbitrary initial state, we can determine the lower and upper bounds on the increase of entropy (temperature) for a fixed increase in temperature (entropy). Our results provide explicit instances of quantum lower and upper bounds on irreversible entropy production whose existence has been established in literature. We also find monotonic behavior of the nonsaturation of the QNEC with time after a quench, and analytically determine their asymptotic values. Our study shows that the entanglement entropy of an interval of length l always thermalizes in time l / 2 with an exponent 3 / 2 . Furthermore, we determine the coefficient of initial quadratic growth of entanglement analytically for any l , and show that the slope of the asymptotic ballistic growth of entanglement for a semi-infinite interval is twice the difference of the entropy densities of the final and initial states. We determine explicit upper and lower bounds on these rates of growth of entanglement.},

This phenomenon has important implications for gravitational wave astronomy, black hole formation scenarios, testing general relativity, and galaxy evolution. We consider the gravitational wave signal from the binary black hole merger GW200129_065458 (henceforth referred to as GW200129), which has been shown to exhibit strong evidence of orbital precession. Using numerical relativity surrogate models, we constrain the kick velocity of GW200129 to v f ∼ 154 2 − 1098 + 747 km / s or v f ≳ 698 km / s (one-sided limit), at 90\% credibility. This marks the first identification of a large kick velocity for an individual gravitational wave event. Given the kick velocity of GW200129, we estimate that there is a less than 0.48\% (7.7\%) probability that the remnant black hole after the merger would be retained by globular (nuclear star) clusters. Finally, we show that kick effects are not expected to cause biases in ringdown tests of general relativity for this event, although this may change in the future with improved detectors.},

If the binary orbit is observed nearly edge-on, we find a distinct feature in the light curve imprinted by the relativistic shadow around the background (“source”) BH. We study this feature by ray tracing in a binary model and predict that 1\% of the current binary candidates could show this feature. Our BH tomography method proposed here could make it possible to extract BH shadows that are spatially unresolvable by high-resolution very long base line interferometry (VLBI).},

It is often assumed that the ETH reduces to random matrix theory (RMT) below the Thouless energy scale. We show that this conventional picture is not self-consistent. We prove that the energy scale at which the RMT behavior emerges has to be parametrically smaller than the inverse timescale of the slowest thermalization mode coupled to the operator of interest. We argue that the timescale marking the onset of the RMT behavior is the same timescale at which the hydrodynamic description of transport breaks down.},

It is hard to prevent such kinds of attacks because side channels may exist in many dimensions of the emitted photons. Here we report an experimental realization of a side-channel-secure quantum key distribution protocol which is not only measurement-device independent, but also immune to all side-channel attacks to the photons emitted from Alice’s and Bob’s labs.

However, it is challenging to synthesize Hamiltonians that have more than two spins in a single term. Here we synthesize m -body spin-exchange Hamiltonians with m up to 5 in a superconducting quantum circuit by simultaneously exciting multiple independent qubits with time-energy correlated photons generated from a qudit. The dynamic evolution of the m -body interaction is governed by the Rabi oscillation between two m -spin states, in which the states of each spin are different. We demonstrate the scalability of our approach by comparing the influence of noises on the three-, four- and five-body interaction and building a many-body Mach-Zehnder interferometer which potentially has a Heisenberg-limit sensitivity. This study paves a way for quantum simulation involving many-body interaction Hamiltonians such as lattice gauge theories in quantum circuits.},

In this Letter, we present classical sampling algorithms for single-photon and Gaussian input states that take advantage of a graph structure of a linear-optical circuit. The algorithms’ complexity grows as so-called treewidth, which is closely related to the connectivity of a given linear-optical circuit. Using the algorithms, we study approximated simulations for local Haar-random linear-optical circuits. For equally spaced initial sources, we show that, when the circuit depth is less than the quadratic in the lattice spacing, the efficient simulation is possible with an exponentially small error. Notably, right after this depth, photons start to interfere each other and the algorithms’ complexity becomes subexponential in the number of sources, implying that there is a sharp transition of its complexity. Finally, when a circuit is sufficiently deep enough for photons to typically propagate to all modes, the complexity becomes exponential as generic sampling algorithms. We numerically implement a likelihood test with a recent Gaussian boson sampling experiment and show that the treewidth-based algorithm with a limited treewidth renders a larger likelihood than the experimental data.},

While decoherence generally suppresses these dynamical signatures, the nonlinear non-Hermitian evolution with balanced gain and loss (BGL) in an energy-dephasing scenario can enhance manifestations of quantum chaos. In the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and random matrix Hamiltonians, BGL increases the span of the ramp, lowering the dip as well as the value of the plateau, providing an experimentally realizable physical mechanism for spectral filtering. The chaos enhancement due to BGL is optimal over a family of filter functions that can be engineered with fluctuating Hamiltonians.},

However, binary mixtures often form amorphous or metastable phases instead of the thermodynamically stable phase. Here we show that in binary mixtures of differently sized spherical particles, an excess of the smaller component can promote—and, in some cases, may be necessary for—the self-assembly of a binary cocrystal. Using computer simulations, we identify two mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon. First, excess small particles act like plasticizers and enable systems to reach a greater supersaturation before kinetic arrest occurs. Second, they can disfavor competing structures that may interfere with the growth of the target structure. We find the phase behavior of simulated mixtures of nearly hard spheres closely matches published experimental results. We demonstrate the generality of our findings for mixtures of particles of arbitrary shape by presenting a binary mixture of hard shapes that only self-assembles with an excess of the smaller component.},

  abstract     = {Brillouin light spectroscopy is used to measure the elastic moduli of spherical polymer-grafted nanoparticle (GNP) melts as a function of chain length at fixed grafting density ( 0.47 chains / nm 2 ) and nanoparticle radius (8 nm). While the moduli follow a rule of mixtures (Wood’s law) for long chains, they display enhanced elasticity and anomalous dissipation for graft chains &lt; 1 0 0 kDa . GNP melts with long polymers at high σ have a dry zone near the GNP core, surrounded by a region where the grafts can interpenetrate with chain fragments from adjacent GNPs. We propose that the departures from Wood’s law for short chains are due to the effectively larger silica volume fraction in the region where sound propagates—this is caused by the short, interpenetrated chain fragments being pushed out of the way. We thus conclude that transport mechanisms (of gas, ions, sound, thermal phonons) in GNP melts are radically different if interpenetrated chain segments can be “pushed out of the way” or not. This provides a facile new means for manipulating the properties of these materials.},

For the first time, here we report on the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) for the oxide 2DEG. Spin polarized electrons are selectively excited by circular polarized light from the in-gap states of SrTiO 3 to 2DEG and are converted into electric current via the mechanism of spin-momentum locking arising from Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Moreover, the CPGE can be effectively modified by the density and distribution of oxygen vacancies.

Here we report on the discovery of pressure-induced superconductivity in KMn 6 Bi 5 , which becomes the first ternary Mn-based superconductor. At ambient pressure, the quasi-one-dimensional KMn 6 Bi 5 is an antiferromagnetic metal with T N ≈ 75 K . By measuring resistance and ac magnetic susceptibility under hydrostatic pressures up to 14.2 GPa in a cubic anvil cell apparatus, we find that its antiferromagnetic transition can be suppressed completely at a critical pressure of P c ≈ 1 3 GPa , around which bulk superconductivity emerges and displays a superconducting dome with the maximal T c onset = 9.3 K achieved at about 14 GPa. The close proximity of superconductivity to a magnetic instability in the temperature-pressure phase diagram of KMn 6 Bi 5 and an unusually large μ 0 H c 2 ( 0 ) exceeding the Pauli paramagnetic limit suggests an unconventional magnetism-mediated paring mechanism. In contrast to the binary MnP, the flexibility of the crystal structure and chemical compositions in the ternary A Mn 6 Bi 5 ( A = alkali metal) can open a new avenue for finding more Mn-based superconductors.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a new class of out-of-equilibrium noninteracting topological phases: the topological space-time crystals. These are time-dependent quantum systems that do not have discrete spatial translation symmetries but instead are invariant under discrete space-time translations. Similar to the Floquet-Bloch systems, the space-time crystals can be described by a frequency-domain-enlarged Hamiltonian, which is used to classify topologically distinct space-time crystals. We show that these space-time crystals can be engineered from conventional crystals with an additional time-dependent drive that behaves like a traveling wave moving across the crystal. Interestingly, we are able to construct 1D and 2D examples of topological space-time crystals based on tight-binding models that involve only one orbital, in contrast to the two-orbital minimal models for any previously discovered static or Floquet topological phases with crystalline structures.},

This has been thoroughly investigated in the context of quantum Hall phases, and time-reversal invariant topological insulators. Here we study the edge of a 2D, topologically trivial insulating phase, as a function of the strength of the electronic interactions and the steepness of the confining potential. For sufficiently smooth confining potentials, alternating compressible and incompressible stripes appear at the edge. Our findings signal the emergence of gapless edge modes which may give rise to finite conductance at the edge. This would suggest a novel scenario of a nontopological metal-insulator transition in clean 2D systems. The incompressible stripes appear at commensurate fillings and may exhibit broken translational invariance along the edge in the form of charge density wave ordering. These are separated by structureless compressible stripes.},

  abstract     = {There is great current interest in multicomponent superhydrides due to their unique quantum properties under pressure. A remarkable example is the ternary superhydride Li 2 MgH 16 computationally identified to have an unprecedented high superconducting critical temperature T c of ∼ 470 K at 250 GPa. However, the very high synthesis pressures required remains a significant hurdle for detailed study and potential applications. In this Letter, we evaluate the feasibility of synthesizing ternary Li-Mg superhydrides by the recently proposed pressure-potential ( P 2 ) method that uniquely combines electrochemistry and applied pressure to control synthesis and stability. The results indicate that it is possible to synthesize Li-Mg superhydrides at modest pressures by applying suitable electrode potentials. Using pressure alone, no Li-Mg ternary hydrides are predicted to be thermodynamically stable, but in the presence of electrode potentials, both Li 2 MgH 16 and Li 4 MgH 24 can be stabilized at modest pressures. Three polymorphs are predicted as ground states of Li 2 MgH 16 below 300 GPa, with transitions at 33 and 160 GPa. The highest pressure phase is superconducting, while the two at lower pressures are not. Our findings point out the potentially important role of the P 2 method in controlling phase stability of complex multicomponent superhydrides.},

  abstract     = {Lattice regularization of chiral fermions has been a long-standing problem in physics. In this Letter, we present the density matrix renormalization group simulation of the 3-4-5-0 model of ( 1 + 1 ) D chiral fermions with an anomaly-free chiral U(1) symmetry, which contains two left-moving and two right-moving fermions carrying U(1) charges 3,4 and 5,0, respectively. Following the Wang-Wen chiral fermion model, we realize the chiral fermions and their mirror partners on the opposite boundaries of a thin strip of ( 2 + 1 ) D lattice model of multilayer Chern insulator, whose finite width implies the quantum system is effectively ( 1 + 1 ) D . By introducing two sets of carefully designed six-fermion local interactions to the mirror sector only, we demonstrate that the mirror fermions can be gapped out by the interaction beyond a critical strength without breaking the chiral U(1) symmetry, via the symmetric mass generation mechanism. We show that the interaction-driven gapping transition is in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class. We determine the evolution of Luttinger parameters before the transition, which confirms that the transition happens exactly at the point when the interaction term becomes marginal. As the mirror sector is gapped after the transition, we check that the fermions in the light chiral fermion sector remain gapless, which provides the desired lattice regularization of chiral fermions.},

Time-resolved measurement of the Kr He β spectra, absolutely calibrated by a simultaneous time-integrated measurement, allows inference of the electron density and temperature through observing Stark broadening and the relative intensities of dielectronic satellites. By matching the calculated hot spot emission using a collisional-radiative code to experimental observations, the hot spot size and areal density are determined.

In contrast, in simulations coupling micro-meso scales, the RSAE amplitude and EP transport decrease drastically at the initial saturation but later increases to the experimental levels in the quasisteady state with bursty dynamics due to regulation by thermal ion temperature gradient (ITG) microturbulence. The quasisteady state EP transport is larger for a stronger microturbulence.

In contrast with horizontally trapped equatorial waves induced by the traditional component of the Coriolis force perpendicular to the surface, we find vertically trapped modes that propagate along interfaces between regions with distinct stratification properties.

As examples, this general method is used to characterize fractional extensions to two physically relevant, pervasive integrable nonlinear equations: the Korteweg–deVries and nonlinear Schrödinger equations.

Remarkably, this insight can be used to circumvent the material requirement of working with refractive indices below unity, which limits the applications of transformation optics. We apply our approach to design a broadband unidirectional dielectric cloak, which relies on nonconformal coordinate transformations to tailor the non-Hermitian refractive index profile around a cloaked object.

Here, we put forward a system based on a magnetized epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) medium, and we show that strong coupling between magnetic excitations (magnons) and light can be achieved close to the ENZ frequency due to a drastic enhancement of the magneto-optical response. We adopt a phenomenological approach to quantize the electromagnetic field inside a dispersive magnetic medium in order to obtain the frequency-dependent coupling between magnons and photons. We predict that, in the epsilon-near-zero regime, the single-magnon single-photon coupling can be comparable to the magnon frequency for a small magnetic volume and perfect mode overlap. For state-of-the-art illustrative values, this would correspond to achieving the single-magnon strong coupling regime, where the coupling rate is larger than all the decay rates. Finally, we show that the nonlinear energy spectrum intrinsic to this coupling regime can be probed via the characteristic multiple magnon sidebands in the photon power spectrum.},

  abstract     = {Similar to an electron in a solid, an impurity in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is dressed by excitations from the medium, forming a polaron quasiparticle with modified properties. This impurity can also undergo chemical recombination with atoms from the BEC, a process resonantly enhanced when universal three-body Efimov bound states cross the continuum. To study the interplay between these phenomena, we use a Gaussian state variational method able to describe both Efimov physics and arbitrarily many excitations of the BEC. We show that the polaron cloud contributes to bound state formation, leading to a shift of the Efimov resonance to smaller interaction strengths. This shifted scattering resonance marks the onset of a polaronic instability towards the decay into large Efimov clusters and fast recombination, offering a remarkable example of chemistry in a quantum medium.},

We investigate the possibility of a comparable nondipole time delay in tunneling ionization and decode the emerged time delay signal. With the here newly developed Coulomb-corrected nondipole molecular strong-field approximation, we derive and analyze the photoelectron momentum distribution, the signature of nondipole effects, and the role of the degeneracy of the molecular orbitals. We show that the ejected electron momentum shifts and interference fringes efficiently imprint both the molecule structure and laser parameters. The corresponding nondipole time delay value significantly deviates from that in single-photon ionization. In particular, when the two-center interference in the molecule is destructive, the time delay is independent of the bond length. We also identify the double-slit interference in tunneling ionization of atoms with nonzero angular momentum via a nondipole momentum shift.},

We show that these preexisting correlations can be probed in deep inelastic scattering experiments at high energy. Specifically, we consider diffractive dijet plus a third jet production. The azimuthal dependence displays a peak at the zero relative angle between the transverse momentum imbalance of the photon-going dijet and the transverse momentum of the hadron-going jet. Our calculations explicitly show that the peak originates from Bose enhancement. Comparing electron-proton to electron-nucleus collisions, we demonstrate that the nuclear target enhances the relative strength of the peak.

  abstract     = {Collider experiments often exploit information about the quantum numbers of final state hadrons to maximize their sensitivity, with applications ranging from the use of tracking information (electric charge) for precision jet substructure measurements, to flavor tagging for nucleon structure studies. For such measurements, perturbative calculations in terms of quarks and gluons are insufficient, and nonperturbative track functions describing the energy fraction of a quark or gluon converted into a subset of hadrons (e.g., charged hadrons) must be incorporated. Unlike fragmentation functions, track functions describe correlations between hadrons and therefore satisfy complicated nonlinear evolution equations whose structure has so far eluded calculation beyond the leading order. In this Letter, we develop an understanding of track functions and their interplay with energy flow observables beyond the leading order, allowing them to be used in state-of-the-art perturbative calculations for the first time. We identify a shift symmetry in the evolution of their moments that fixes their structure, and we explicitly compute the evolution of the first three moments at next-to-leading order, allowing for the description of up to three-point energy correlations. We then calculate the two-point energy correlator on charged particles at O ( α s 2 ) , illustrating explicitly that infrared singularities in perturbation theory are absorbed by moments of the track functions and also highlighting how these moments seamlessly interplay with modern techniques for perturbative calculations. Our results extend the boundaries of traditional perturbative QCD, enabling precision perturbative predictions for energy flow observables sensitive to the quantum numbers of hadronic states.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy dark matter (FDM) made of ultralight bosonic particles is a viable alternative to cold dark matter with clearly distinguishable small-scale features in collapsed structures. On large scales, it behaves gravitationally like cold dark matter deviating only by a cutoff in the initial power spectrum and can be studied using N -body methods. In contrast, wave interference effects near the de Broglie scale result in new phenomena unique to FDM. Interfering modes in filaments and halos yield a stochastically oscillating granular structure which condenses into solitonic cores during halo formation. Investigating these highly nonlinear wave phenomena requires the spatially resolved numerical integration of the Schrödinger equation. In previous papers we introduced a hybrid zoom-in scheme that combines N -body methods to model the large-scale gravitational potential around and the mass accretion onto pre-selected halos with simulations of the Schrödinger-Poisson equation to capture wave-like effects inside these halos. In this work, we present a new, substantially improved reconstruction method for the wave function inside of previously collapsed structures. We demonstrate its capabilities with a deep zoom-in simulation of a well-studied sub- L * -sized galactic halo from cosmological initial conditions. With a particle mass of m = 2.5 × 10 − 22 eV and halo mass M vir = 1.7 × 10 11 M ⊙ in a ( 60 h − 1 comoving Mpc ) 3 cosmological box, it reaches an effective resolution of 20 comoving pc. This pushes the values of m and M accessible to simulations significantly closer to those relevant for studying galaxy evolution in the allowed range of FDM masses.},

Schematically, it postulates that off-diagonal matrix elements are random numbers and the observables can be described by random matrix theory (RMT). To what extent a RMT description applies, more precisely at which energy scale matrix elements of physical operators become truly uncorrelated, is, however, not fully understood. We study this issue by introducing a novel numerical approach to probe correlations between matrix elements for Hilbert-space dimensions beyond those accessible by exact diagonalization. Our analysis is based on the evaluation of higher moments of operator submatrices, defined within energy windows of varying width. Considering nonintegrable quantum spin chains, we observe that matrix elements remain correlated even for narrow energy windows corresponding to timescales of the order of thermalization time of the respective observables. We also demonstrate that such residual correlations between matrix elements are reflected in the dynamics of out-of-time-ordered correlation functions.},

In stark contrast to the sensing of loss parameters, the average photon number N and number of input modes M of the probe are found to be equivalent and interchangeable resources for optimal gain sensing. All pure-state probes whose reduced state on the input modes to the amplifier is diagonal in the multimode number basis are proven to be quantum optimal under the same gain-independent measurement. We compare the best precision achievable using classical probes to the performance of an explicit photon-counting-based estimator on quantum probes and show that an advantage exists even for single-photon probes and inefficient photodetection.

Here, we analyze the gradient scaling (and hence the trainability) for a recently proposed architecture that we call dissipative QNNs (DQNNs), where the input qubits of each layer are discarded at the layer’s output. We find that DQNNs can exhibit barren plateaus, i.e., gradients that vanish exponentially in the number of qubits. Moreover, we provide quantitative bounds on the scaling of the gradient for DQNNs under different conditions, such as different cost functions and circuit depths, and show that trainability is not always guaranteed.

We introduce fermion-parity-based computation (FPBC): a measurement-based scheme, modeled on Pauli-based computation, that uses efficient classical processing to virtually increase the number of available MZMs and which, given magic state inputs, operates without transformations. FPBC requires all MZM parities to be measurable, but this conflicts with constraints in proposed MZM hardware. We thus introduce a design in which all parities are directly measurable and which is hence well suited for FPBC.

  abstract     = {We investigate the quantum metrological power of typical continuous-variable (CV) quantum networks. Particularly, we show that most CV quantum networks provide an entanglement to quantum states in distant nodes that enables one to achieve the Heisenberg scaling in the number of modes for distributed quantum displacement sensing, which cannot be attained using an unentangled probe state. Notably, our scheme only requires local operations and measurements after generating an entangled probe using the quantum network. In addition, we find a tolerable photon-loss rate that maintains the quantum enhancement. Finally, we numerically demonstrate that even when CV quantum networks are composed of local beam splitters, the quantum enhancement can be attained when the depth is sufficiently large.},

  abstract     = {Twin-field quantum key distribution (TFQKD) promises ultralong secure key distribution which surpasses the rate distance limit and can reduce the number of the trusted nodes in long-haul quantum network. Tremendous efforts have been made toward implementation of TFQKD, among which, the secure key with finite size analysis can distribute more than 500 km in the lab and in the field. Here, we demonstrate the sending-or-not-sending TFQKD experimentally, achieving a secure key distribution with finite size analysis over a 658 km ultra-low-loss optical fiber. Meanwhile, in a TFQKD system, any phase fluctuation due to temperature variation and ambient variation during the channel must be recorded and compensated, and all this phase information can then be utilized to sense the channel vibration perturbations. With our quantum key distribution system, we recovered the external vibrational perturbations generated by artificial vibroseis on both the quantum and frequency calibration link, and successfully located the perturbation position in the frequency calibration fiber with a resolution better than 1 km. Our results not only set a new distance record of quantum key distribution, but also demonstrate that the redundant information of TFQKD can be used for remote sensing of the channel vibration, which can find applications in earthquake detection and landslide monitoring besides secure communication.},

An integrated quantum memory for polarization qubits is a useful building block for large-scale integrated quantum networks. However, on-demand storing polarization qubits in an integrated quantum memory is a long-standing challenge due to the anisotropic absorption of solids and the polarization-dependent features of microstructures. Here we demonstrate a reliable on-demand quantum memory for polarization qubits, using a depressed-cladding waveguide fabricated in a Eu 151 3 + : Y 2 SiO 5 crystal. The site-2 Eu 151 3 + ions in Y 2 SiO 5 crystal provides a near-uniform absorption for arbitrary polarization states and a new pump sequence is developed to prepare a wideband and enhanced absorption profile. A fidelity of 99.4 ± 0.6\% is obtained for the qubit storage process with an input of 0.32 photons per pulse, together with a storage bandwidth of 10 MHz. This reliable integrated quantum memory for polarization qubits reveals the potential for use in the construction of integrated quantum networks.},

Quantitative studies of bioflim growth have typically focused on unconfined expansion above solid or semisolid surfaces, leading to exponential radial growth. This geometry does not accurately reflect the natural or biomedical contexts in which biofilms grow in confined spaces. Here, we consider one of the simplest confined geometries: a biofilm growing laterally in the space between a solid surface and an overlying elastic sheet. A poroelastic framework is utilized to derive the radial growth rate of the biofilm; it reveals an additional self-similar expansion regime, governed by the Poisson’s ratio of the matrix, leading to a finite maximum radius, consistent with our experimental observations of growing Bacillus subtilis biofilms confined by polydimethylsiloxane.},

By combining theory and experiment, we analyze the mean-square displacement (MSD) of the chromatin loci, and demonstrate that MSD-vs-time relationships in various nuclei collapse into a single master curve by normalizing them with the mesh size and the corresponding time scale. This enables us to identify the onset of the entangled dynamics with the size of tube diameter of chromatin polymer in the C. elegans embryo. Our dynamical scaling analysis predicts the transition between unentangled and entangled dynamics of chromatin polymers, the quantitative formula for MSD as a function of nuclear size and timescale, and provides testable hypotheses on chromatin mobility in other cell types and species.},

However, at high densities, motile topological defects, unique to active liquids of elongated particles, hindered dynamical arrest. Most remarkably, for the highest activity, we observed intermittent dynamics due to the jamming-unjamming of these defects for the first time.},

The mechanisms that govern the transmission of mechanical forces in epithelia and the collective response of the tissue to bulk shear deformations remain, however, poorly understood. Using a minimal cell-based computational model, we investigate the constitutive relation of confluent tissues under simple shear deformation. We show that an initially undeformed fluidlike tissue acquires finite rigidity above a critical applied strain. This is akin to the shear-driven rigidity observed in other soft matter systems. Interestingly, shear-driven rigidity can be understood by a critical scaling analysis in the vicinity of the second order critical point that governs the liquid-solid transition of the undeformed system. We further show that a solidlike tissue responds linearly only to small strains and but then switches to a nonlinear response at larger stains, with substantial stiffening. Finally, we propose a mean-field formulation for cells under shear that offers a simple physical explanation of shear-driven rigidity and nonlinear response in a tissue.},

We assign these dips to excited state level anticrossings, which occur at magnetic fields that strongly depend on the effective, local strain environment of the NV center. Our results offer new insights into the structure of the NVs’ excited states and a new tool for their effective characterization.

Here we demonstrate how noncollinear-spin polarized density-functional theory can be used to determine the flexomagnetic coupling coefficients in real systems. By focusing on monolayer CrI 3 , we find a crossover as a function of curvature between a magnetization normal to the surface to a cycloidal state, which we rationalize in terms of effective anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya contributions to the magnetic energy. Our results reveal an unexpectedly large impact of spin-orbit interactions on the curvature-induced anisotropy, which we discuss in the context of existing phenomenological models.},

A simple model of nearest-neighbor Heisenberg antiferromagnetic and dipolar interactions accounts quantitatively for all observations, including an unusual 2- k magnetic ground state. We show that the relative strength of dipolar interactions is crucial to selecting this particular ground state.

SV exhibits a strong and symmetric Friedel oscillation (FO) pattern, while SV − shows an asymmetric FO pattern with local perturbation amplitude reduced by one order of magnitude and a faster decay rate. The enhanced passivation by forming SV − can be attributed to its weak dipolelike perturbation, consistent with density-functional theory numerical calculations. Therefore, self-passivated SV − is electrically benign and acts as a much weaker scattering center, which may hold the key to further enhance the charge mobility of black phosphorus and its analogs.},

Bulk nonreciprocal responses usually stem from relativistic corrections and are always very small. Here we report our discovery that ZrTe 5 crystals in proximity to a topological quantum phase transition present gigantic magnetochiral anisotropy, which is the largest ever observed to date. We argue that a very low carrier density, inhomogeneities, and a torus-shaped Fermi surface induced by breaking of inversion symmetry in a Dirac material are central to explain this extraordinary property.},

Contrary to common belief, we demonstrate that many aspects of orbital dynamics are qualitatively different from spin dynamics because the algebraic properties of the orbital and spin angular momentum operators are different. This difference generates interesting orbital responses, which do not have spin counterparts. For instance, the orbital angular momentum expectation values may oscillate even without breaking neither the time-reversal nor the inversion symmetry. Our quantum Boltzmann approach reproduces the previous result on the orbital Hall effect and reveals additional orbital dynamics phenomena, whose detection schemes are discussed briefly. Our work will be useful for the experimental differentiation of the orbital dynamics from the spin dynamics.},

This is analyzed by comparing the effects of periodic magnetic fields and strain-induced pseudomagnetic fields that, respectively, break and preserve time-reversal symmetry. In the former case, a Chern classification of the superlattice minibands with zero total magnetic flux enforces single counterpropagating modes traversing each bulk gap on opposite boundaries of a nanoribbon. For the pseudomagnetic field, pairs of counterpropagating modes migrate to the same boundary where they provide well-developed valley-helical transport channels on a single zigzag edge.

  abstract     = {We consider a family of twisted graphene multilayers consisting of n -untwisted chirally stacked layers, e.g., A B , A B C , etc, with a single twist on top of m -untwisted chirally stacked layers. Upon neglecting both trigonal warping terms for the untwisted layers and the same sublattice hopping between all layers, the resulting models generalize several remarkable features of the chiral model of twisted bilayer graphene (CTBG). In particular, they exhibit a set of magic angles which are identical to those of CTBG at which a pair of bands (i) are perfectly flat, (ii) have Chern numbers in the sublattice basis given by ± ( n , − m ) or ± ( n + m − 1 , − 1 ) depending on the stacking chirality, and (iii) satisfy the trace condition, saturating an inequality between the quantum metric and the Berry curvature, and thus realizing ideal quantum geometry. These are the first higher Chern bands that satisfy (iii) beyond fine-tuned models or combinations of Landau levels. We show that ideal quantum geometry is directly related to the construction of fractional quantum Hall model wave functions. We provide explicit analytic expressions for the flatband wave functions at the magic angle in terms of the CTBG wave functions. We also show that the Berry curvature distribution in these models can be continuously tuned while maintaining perfect quantum geometry. Similar to the study of fractional Chern insulators in ideal C = 1 bands, these models pave the way for investigating exotic topological phases in higher Chern bands for which no Landau level analog is available.},

We also explicitly demonstrate a generic “wave function exchange” mechanism that generates the high Chern numbers of these ideal flatbands. The ideal band geometries and high Chern numbers of the flatbands imply the possibility of hosting exotic fractional Chern insulators which do not have analogues in continuum Landau levels.

Our analytical calculation reveals that single-particle observables, such as squared particle displacements, display divergent fluctuations around the dynamical (or mode-coupling) transition, due to the emergence of nontrivial correlations between displacements along different directions. This effect notably gives rise to a divergent non-Gaussian parameter, α 2 . The d → ∞ local dynamics therefore becomes quite rich upon approaching the glass transition. The finite- d remnant of this phenomenon further provides a long sought-after, first-principle explanation for the growth of α 2 around the glass transition that is not based on multiparticle correlations .},

We describe the Fermi superfluid through the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory and investigate the role of the pairing gap on quasiparticle properties revealed by the two spectroscopies. The energy cost for pair breaking prevents Anderson’s orthogonality catastrophe that occurs in a noninteracting Fermi gas and allows the existence of polaron quasiparticles in the exactly solvable heavy impurity limit. Hence, we rigorously confirm the remarkable features such as dark continuum, molecule-hole continuum, and repulsive polaron. For a magnetic impurity scattering at finite temperature, we predict additional resonances related to the subgap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound state, whose positions can be used to measure the superfluid pairing gap. For a nonmagnetic scattering at zero temperature, we surprisingly find undamped repulsive polarons. These exact results might be readily observed in quantum gas experiments with Bose-Fermi mixtures that have a large-mass ratio.},

We first derive the focal velocity and the characteristic length of the focal spot in terms of the focal length and an energy chirp. We then demonstrate using multidimensional particle-in-cell simulations that a wake driven by a superluminally propagating flying focus of an electron beam can generate GeV-level electron bunches with ultralow normalized slice emittance ( ∼ 30 nm rad ), high current ( ∼ 17 kA ), low slice energy spread ( ∼ 0.1\% ), and therefore high normalized brightness ( &gt; 10 19 A / m 2 / rad 2 ) in a plasma of density ∼ 10 19 cm − 3 . The injection process is highly controllable and tunable by changing the focal velocity and shaping the drive beam current.

Second, in order to mitigate the damping of the transverse wake component across the density gradients at the plasma exit, the ratio of the relativistic electron cyclotron and plasma frequencies must be chosen slightly above unity, but not too large, lest the wake be degraded. Such conditions lead the outgoing THz wave to surpass in amplitude the electrostatic wakefield induced in a similar, yet unmagnetized plasma.},

With spin-resolved QED Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate the consequent helicity transfer from laser photons to the electron beam with a degree up to 10\%, along with an electron radial polarization up to 65\% after multiple photon emissions in a femtosecond timescale.

  abstract     = {Building upon the bulk-boundary correspondence in topological phases of matter, disclinations have recently been harnessed to trap fractionally quantized density of states (DOS) in classical wave systems. While these fractional DOS have associated states localized to the disclination’s core, such states are not protected from deconfinement due to the breaking of chiral symmetry, generally leading to resonances which, even in principle, have finite lifetimes and suboptimal confinement. Here, we devise and experimentally validate in acoustic lattices a paradigm by which topological states bind to disclinations without a fractional DOS but which preserve chiral symmetry. The preservation of chiral symmetry pins the states at the midgap, resulting in their protected maximal confinement. The integer DOS at the defect results in twofold degenerate states that, due to symmetry constraints, do not gap out. Our study provides a fresh perspective about the interplay between symmetry protection in topological phases and topological defects, with possible applications in classical and quantum systems alike.},

Abrupt changes in time of the electromagnetic properties of a material have also been shown to replace spatial boundaries, supporting highly unusual wave-matter interactions in so-called time metamaterials. Here, we introduce nonreciprocity for temporal boundaries, demonstrating Faraday polarization rotation in a magnetoplasma with material properties abruptly switched in time. Our findings open new opportunities for time metamaterials, yielding new avenues for nonreciprocity with broad applicability for wave engineering.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of parity-time ( PT ) symmetry has greatly enriched our study of symmetry-enabled non-Hermitian physics, but the realization of quantum PT symmetry faces an intrinsic issue of unavoidable symmetry-breaking Langevin noises. Here we construct a quantum pseudo-anti- PT (pseudo- APT ) symmetry in a two-mode bosonic system without involving Langevin noises. We show that the spontaneous pseudo- APT symmetry breaking leads to an exceptional point, across which there is a transition between different types of quantum squeezing dynamics; i.e., the squeezing factor increases exponentially (oscillates periodically) with time in the pseudo- APT -symmetric (broken) region. Such dramatic changes of squeezing factors and quantum dynamics near the exceptional point are utilized for ultraprecision quantum sensing. These exotic quantum phenomena and sensing applications can be experimentally observed in two physical systems: spontaneous wave mixing nonlinear optics and atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. Our Letter offers a physical platform for investigating exciting APT symmetry physics in the quantum realm, paving the way for exploring fundamental quantum non-Hermitian effects and their quantum technological applications.},

We realize this milestone experiment with an ultracold gas of dysprosium atoms, the cyclic dimension being encoded in the electronic spin and the axial field controlled by the phases of laser-induced spin-orbit couplings.

The experimental data clearly agree with the theoretical prediction, and the results encourage the use of precisely tailored laser fields to coherently control the strong-field excitation process.

The chiral molecule 1-indanol is cooled to low rotational temperatures (1–2 K) and a selected rotational level in the electronic and vibrational ground state of the most abundant conformer is depleted via optical pumping on the S 1 ← S 0 transition. Further downstream, three consecutive microwave pulses with mutually perpendicular polarizations and with a well-defined duration and phase are applied. The population in the originally depleted rotational level is subsequently monitored via laser-induced fluorescence detection. This scheme enables a quantitative comparison of experiment and theory for the transfer efficiency in what is the simplest enantiomer-specific state transfer triangle for any chiral molecule, that is, the one involving the absolute ground state level, | J K a K c ⟩ = | 0 00 ⟩ . Moreover, this scheme improves the enantiomer enrichment by over an order of magnitude compared to previous works. Starting with a racemic mixture, a straightforward extension of this scheme allows one to create a molecular beam with an enantiomer-pure rotational level, holding great prospects for future spectroscopic and scattering studies.},

Several aspects of nuclear fission are not properly understood, in particular the formation of the neck between the nascent fragments, and the subsequent mechanism of scission into two or more independent fragments. Using an implementation of time-dependent density functional theory, based on a relativistic energy density functional and including pairing correlations, we analyze the final phase of the process of induced fission of Pu 240 , and show that the timescale of neck formation coincides with the assembly of two α -like clusters. Because of its much larger binding energy, the dynamical synthesis of He 4 in the neck predominates over other light clusters, e.g., H 3 and He 6 . At the instant of scission the neck ruptures exactly between the two α -like clusters, which separate because of the Coulomb repulsion and are eventually absorbed by the two emerging fragments. The mechanism of light charged clusters formation at scission could also be linked to ternary fission.},

The main contribution to P z comes from elliptic flow-induced vorticity and can be characterized by the second Fourier sine coefficient P z , s 2 = ⟨ P z sin ( 2 φ − 2 Ψ 2 ) ⟩ , where φ is the hyperon azimuthal emission angle and Ψ 2 is the elliptic flow plane angle. We report the measurement of P z , s 2 for different collision centralities and in the 30\%–50\% centrality interval as a function of the hyperon transverse momentum and rapidity. The P z , s 2 is positive similarly as measured by the STAR Collaboration in Au-Au collisions at s N N = 200 GeV , with somewhat smaller amplitude in the semicentral collisions. This is the first experimental evidence of a nonzero hyperon P z in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC. The comparison of the measured P z , s 2 with the hydrodynamic model calculations shows sensitivity to the competing contributions from thermal and the recently found shear-induced vorticity, as well as to whether the polarization is acquired at the quark-gluon plasma or the hadronic phase.},

  abstract     = {We revisit the problem of extending the phase space of diffeomorphism-invariant theories to account for embeddings associated with the boundary of subregions. We do so by emphasizing the importance of a careful treatment of embeddings in all aspects of the covariant phase space formalism. In so doing we introduce a new notion of the extension of field space associated with the embeddings which has the important feature that the Noether charges associated with all extended corner symmetries are in fact integrable, but not necessarily conserved. We give an intuitive understanding of this description. We then show that the charges give a representation of the extended corner symmetry via the Poisson bracket, without central extension.},

As special limits it contains several systems such as Dyson’s log-gas ( k → 0 + ), the Calogero-Moser model ( k = 2 ), the 1D one-component plasma ( k = − 1 ), and the hard-rod gas ( k → ∞ ). Despite its growing importance, only large- N field theory and average density profile are known for general k . In this Letter, we study the fluctuations in the system by looking at the statistics of the gap between successive particles. This quantity is analogous to the well-known level-spacing statistics which is ubiquitous in several branches of physics. We show that the variance goes as N − b k and we find the k dependence of b k via direct Monte Carlo simulations. We provide supporting arguments based on microscopic Hessian calculation and a quadratic field theory approach. We compute the gap distribution and study its system size scaling.

Here we develop an information-theoretic origin for the committor and show how selecting transition paths from a long ergodic equilibrium trajectory induces entropy production which exactly equals the information that system dynamics provide about the reactivity of trajectories. This equality of entropy production and dynamical information generation also holds at the level of arbitrary individual coordinates, providing parallel measures of the coordinate’s relevance to the reaction, each of which is maximized by the committor.},

In this work, we derive the generalized fluctuation theorem under quantum jumps with continuous measurement and feedback. The essence for the derivation is to newly introduce the operationally meaningful information, which we call quantum-classical-transfer (QC-transfer) entropy. QC-transfer entropy can be naturally interpreted as the quantum counterpart of transfer entropy that is commonly used in classical time series analysis. We also verify our theoretical results by numerical simulation and propose an experiment-numerics hybrid verification method. Our work reveals a fundamental connection between quantum thermodynamics and quantum information, which can be experimentally tested with artificial quantum systems such as circuit quantum electrodynamics.},

When the speed of quantum annealing is sufficiently slow, the system evolves following the instantaneous thermal equilibrium. This quasistatic and isothermal evolution, however, fails near the end of annealing because the relaxation time grows infinitely, therefore yielding excess energy from the thermal equilibrium. We develop a phenomenological theory based on this picture and derive a scaling relation of the excess energy after annealing. The theoretical results are numerically confirmed using a novel non-Markovian method that we recently proposed based on a path-integral representation of the reduced density matrix and the infinite time evolving block decimation. In addition, we discuss crossovers from weak to strong coupling as well as from the adiabatic to quasistatic regime, and propose experiments on the D-Wave quantum annealer.},

A typical situation for QST based on teleportation is one in which two remote communication partners (Alice and Bob) are far from the entanglement source (Charlie). Because of the atmospheric turbulence, it is challenging to implement the Bell-state measurement after photons propagate in atmospheric channels. In previous long-distance free-space experiments, Alice and Charlie always perform local Bell-state measurement before the entanglement distribution process is completed. Here, by developing a highly stable interferometer to project the photon into a hybrid path-polarization dimension and utilizing the satellite-borne entangled photon source, we demonstrate proof-of-principle QST at the distance of over 1200 km assisted by prior quantum entanglement shared between two distant ground stations with the satellite Micius . The average fidelity of transferred six distinct quantum states is 0.82 ± 0.01 , exceeding the classical limit of 2 / 3 on a single copy of a qubit.},

In this Letter, we explore this notion in the context of quantum reference frame (QRF) covariance, in which this partitioning is subject to a symmetry constraint. We demonstrate that different reference frame perspectives induce different sets of subsystem observable algebras, which leads to a gauge-invariant, frame-dependent notion of subsystems and entanglement. We further demonstrate that subalgebras which commute before imposing the symmetry constraint can translate into noncommuting algebras in a given QRF perspective after symmetry imposition. Such a QRF perspective does not inherit the distinction between subsystems in terms of the corresponding tensor factorizability of the kinematical Hilbert space and observable algebra. Since the condition for this to occur is contingent on the choice of QRF, the notion of subsystem locality is frame dependent.},

The lack of a renormalized theory of critical brain dynamics, however, so far limits insights into this form of biological information processing to mean-field results. These methods neglect a key feature of critical systems: the interaction between degrees of freedom across all length scales, required for complex nonlinear computation. We present a renormalized theory of a prototypical neural field theory, the stochastic Wilson-Cowan equation. We compute the flow of couplings, which parametrize interactions on increasing length scales. Despite similarities with the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang model, the theory is of a Gell-Mann–Low type, the archetypal form of a renormalizable quantum field theory. Here, nonlinear couplings vanish, flowing towards the Gaussian fixed point, but logarithmically slowly, thus remaining effective on most scales. We show this critical structure of interactions to implement a desirable trade-off between linearity, optimal for information storage, and nonlinearity, required for computation.},

We demonstrate that FnGD strengthens on approaching the glass transition, by identifying distinct timescales for Fickianity, τ F , and for restoring of Gaussianity, τ G &gt; τ F , as well as their associated length scales, ξ F and ξ G . We find τ G ∝ τ F γ with γ ≃ 1.8 for both systems. In the deep FnGD regime, the displacement distributions display exponential tails. We show that, in simulations, the time-dependent decay lengths l ( t ) at different temperatures all collapse onto a power-law master curve [ l ( t ) / ( ξ G ) ] ∝ ( t / τ G ) α , with α = 0.33 . A similar collapse, if less sharp, is also found in experiments, seemingly with the same exponent α .

We determine the analog of the current-phase relation in various circumstances and show how it can be accessed in experiments on dynamic magnetization. In particular, concentrating on the magnetic hysteresis and the ferromagnetic resonance response, we show how the spin supercurrent affects the nonequilibrium dynamics of magnetization which depends on a competition between spin supercurrent mediated static exchange contribution and a dynamic spin pumping contribution.

  abstract     = {The strong coupling between excitons and single plasmonic nanocavities enables plexcitonic states in nanoscale systems at room temperature. Here we demonstrate the strong coupling of surface plasmon modes of metal nanowires and excitons in monolayer semiconductors, with Rabi splitting manifested in both scattering and photoluminescence (PL) spectra. By utilizing the propagation properties of surface plasmons on the nanowires, the PL emitted through the scattering of plasmon-exciton hybrid modes is extracted. The analytically calculated scattering and PL spectra well reproduce the experimental results. These findings unify the scattering and PL spectra in the plexcitonic system and eliminate the ambiguities of PL emission, shedding new light on understanding the rich spectral phenomena in the plasmon-exciton strong coupling regime.},

  abstract     = {Phonon-assisted luminescence is a key property of defect centers in semiconductors, and can be measured to perform the readout of the information stored in a quantum bit, or to detect temperature variations. The investigation of phonon-assisted luminescence usually employs phenomenological models, such as that of Huang and Rhys, with restrictive assumptions that can fail to be predictive. In this work, we predict luminescence and study exciton-phonon couplings within a rigorous many-body perturbation theory framework, an analysis that has never been performed for defect centers. In particular, we study the optical emission of the negatively charged boron vacancy in 2D hexagonal boron nitride, which currently stands out among defect centers in 2D materials thanks to its promise for applications in quantum information and quantum sensing. We show that phonons are responsible for the observed luminescence, which otherwise would be dark due to symmetry. We also show that the symmetry breaking induced by the static Jahn-Teller effect is not able to describe the presence of the experimentally observed peak at 1.5 eV.},

  abstract     = {A broken interfacial inversion symmetry in ultrathin ferromagnet/heavy metal ( FM / HM ) bilayers is generally believed to be a prerequisite for accommodating the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and for stabilizing chiral spin textures. In these bilayers, the strength of the DMI decays as the thickness of the FM layer increases and vanishes around a few nanometers. In the present study, through synthesizing relatively thick films of compositions CoPt or FePt, CoCu or FeCu, FeGd and FeNi, contributions to DMI from the composition gradient-induced bulk magnetic asymmetry (BMA) and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) are systematically examined. Using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy, both the sign and amplitude of DMI in films with controllable direction and strength of BMA, in the presence and absence of SOC, are experimentally studied. In particular, we show that a sizable amplitude of DMI ( ± 0.15 mJ / m 2 ) can be realized in CoPt or FePt films with BMA and strong SOC, whereas negligible DMI strengths are observed in other thick films with BMA but without significant SOC. The pivotal roles of BMA and SOC are further examined based on the three-site Fert-Lévy model and first-principles calculations. It is expected that our findings may help to further understand the origin of chiral magnetism and to design novel noncollinear spin textures.},

These distortions couple strongly to the orbital degrees of freedom and, in principle, it should be possible to tune the superexchange and the magnetic transition with strain. We investigate the representative system ( Y , La , Ca ) TiO 3 , which exhibits low crystallographic symmetry and no structural instabilities. From magnetic susceptibility measurements of the Curie temperature, we demonstrate direct, reversible, and continuous control of ferromagnetism by influencing the TiO 6 octahedral tilts and rotations with uniaxial strain. The relative change in T C as a function of strain is well described by ab initio calculations, which provides detailed understanding of the complex interactions among structural, orbital, and magnetic properties in rare-earth titanates. The demonstrated manipulation of octahedral distortions opens up far-reaching possibilities for investigations of electron-lattice coupling, competing ground states, and magnetic quantum phase transitions in a wide range of quantum materials.},

Through renormalization group methods designed for weak and intermediate coupling, we investigate the nature of the superconducting instability in hole-doped Sn / Si ( 111 ) . We find that the extended Hubbard nature of interactions is crucial to yield triplet pairing, which is f -wave ( p -wave) for moderate (higher) hole doping.

This distinct type of clathrate metal hydrides was first proposed for alkaline-earth-metal hydride CaH 6 that, however, has long eluded experimental synthesis, impeding an understanding of pertinent physics. Here, we report successful synthesis of CaH 6 and its measured superconducting critical temperature T c of 215 K at 172 GPa, which is evidenced by a sharp drop of resistivity to zero and a characteristic decrease of T c under a magnetic field up to 9 T. An estimate based on the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model gives a giant zero-temperature upper critical magnetic field of 203 T. These remarkable benchmark superconducting properties place CaH 6 among the most outstanding high- T c superhydrides, marking it as the hitherto only clathrate metal hydride outside the family of rare earth and actinide hydrides. This exceptional case raises great prospects of expanding the extraordinary class of high- T c superhydrides to a broader variety of compounds that possess more diverse material features and physics characteristics.},

In this work, we find a nontrivial spin texture, spin antivortex, can appear at certain momenta on the Γ − K line in a 2D monolayer Pb on top of SiC. Different from spin vortex due to the band degeneracy in the Rashba model, the existence of this spin antivortex is guaranteed by the Poincaré-Hopf theorem and thus topologically stable. Accompanied with this spin antivortex, a Lifshitz transition of Fermi surfaces occurs at certain momenta on the K − M line, and both phenomena are originated from the anticrossing between the j = 1 / 2 and j = 3 / 2 bands. A rapid variation of the response coefficients for both the current-induced spin polarization and spin Hall conductivity is found when the Fermi energy is tuned around the spin antivortex. Our work demonstrates the monolayer Pb as a potentially appealing platform for spintronic applications.},

The symmetry-selective measurements for the Dirac bands reveal their linearly dispersive behavior across the Dirac point which was termed as the anomalous region in earlier studies. No gap is observed even after boron substitution that reduced the carrier concentration significantly from 3.7 × 10 13 cm − 2 in SiC-graphene to 0.8 × 10 13 cm − 2 (5\% doping). The anomalies at the Dirac point are attributed to the spectral width arising from the lifetime and momentum broadening in the experiments. The substitution of boron at the graphitic sites leads to a band renormalization and a shift of the Dirac point towards the Fermi level. The internal symmetries appear to be preserved in SiC-graphene even after significant boron substitutions. These results suggest that SiC-graphene is a good platform to realize exotic science as well as advanced technology where the carrier properties like concentration, mobility, etc., can be tuned keeping the Dirac fermionic properties protected.},

Our measurements are performed in two cylindrical samples of aspect ratios Γ = diameter / height = 0.5 and 1 filled with the eutectic alloy GaInSn. The reconstruction of the three-dimensional flow pattern by 17 ultrasound Doppler velocimetry sensors detecting the velocity profiles along their beam lines in different planes reveals a clear breakdown of coherence of the large-scale circulation for Γ = 0.5 . As a consequence, the scaling laws for heat and momentum transfer inherit a dependence on the aspect ratio. We show that this breakdown of coherence is accompanied with a reduction of the Reynolds number Re. The scaling exponent β of the power law Nu ∝ Ra β crosses eventually over from β = 0.221 to 0.124 when the liquid metal flow at Γ = 0.5 reaches Ra ≳ 2 × 10 8 and the coherent large-scale flow is completely collapsed.},

  abstract     = {The ability to control the chirality of physical devices is of great scientific and technological importance, from investigations of topologically protected edge states in condensed matter systems to wavefront engineering, isolation, and unidirectional communication. When dealing with large networks of oscillators, the control over the chirality of the bulk states becomes significantly more complicated and requires complex apparatus for generating asymmetric coupling or artificial gauge fields. Here we present a new approach for a precise control over the chirality of the bulk state of a triangular array of hundreds of symmetrically coupled lasers, by introducing a weak non-Hermitian complex potential, requiring only local on-site control of loss and frequency. In the unperturbed network, lasing supermodes with opposite chirality (staggered vortex and staggered antivortex) are equally probable. We show that by tuning the complex potential to an exceptional point, a nearly pure chiral lasing supermode is achieved. While our approach is applicable to any oscillators network, we demonstrate how the inherent nonlinearity of the lasers effectively pulls the network to the exceptional point, making the chirality extremely resilient against noise and imperfections.},

The second new phenomenon is that the Unruh effect can be stimulated, a phenomenon that arises since not only rotating-wave terms can be stimulated (as in conventional stimulated emission) but also counter-rotating terms.

  abstract     = {We demonstrate that stimulated microwave optical sideband generation using parametric frequency conversion can be utilized as a powerful technique for coherent state detection in atomic physics experiments. The technique has advantages over traditional absorption or polarization rotation-based measurements and enables the isolation of signal photons from probe photons. We outline a theoretical framework that accurately models sideband generation using a density matrix formalism. Using this technique, we demonstrate a novel intrinsic magnetic gradiometer that detects magnetic gradient fields between two spatially separated vapor cells by measuring the frequency of the beat note between sidebands generated within each cell. The sidebands are produced with high efficiency using parametric frequency conversion of a probe beam interacting with Rb 87 atoms in a coherent superposition of magnetically sensitive hyperfine ground states. Interference between the sidebands generates a low-frequency beat note whose frequency is determined by the magnetic field gradient between the two vapor cells. In contrast to traditional gradiometers the intermediate step of measuring the magnetic field experienced by the two vapor cells is unnecessary. We show that this technique can be readily implemented in a practical device by demonstrating a compact magnetic gradiometer sensor head with a sensitivity of 25 fT / cm / Hz with a 4.4 cm baseline, while operating in a noisy laboratory environment unshielded from Earth’s field.},

  abstract     = {Frustration occurs when a system cannot find a lowest-energy configuration due to conflicting constraints. We show that a frustrated superradiant phase transition occurs when the ground-state superradiance of cavity fields due to local light-matter interactions cannot simultaneously minimize the positive photon hopping energies. We solve the Dicke trimer model on a triangle motif with both negative and positive hopping energies and show that the latter results in a sixfold degenerate ground-state manifold in which the translational symmetry is spontaneously broken. In the frustrated superradiant phase, we find that two sets of diverging time and fluctuation scales coexist, one governed by the mean-field critical exponent and another by a novel critical exponent. The latter is associated with the fluctuation in the difference of local order parameters and gives rise to site-dependent photon number critical exponents, which may serve as an experimental probe for the frustrated superradiant phase. We provide a qualitative explanation for the emergence of unconventional critical scalings and demonstrate that they are generic properties of the frustrated superradiant phase at the hand of a one-dimensional Dicke lattice with an odd number of sites. The mechanism for the frustrated superradiant phase transition discovered here applies to any lattice geometries where the antiferromagnetic ordering of neighboring sites are incompatible and therefore our work paves the way toward the exploration of frustrated phases of coupled light and matter.},

  abstract     = {The O 18 ( α , γ ) Ne 22 reaction is an essential part of a reaction chain that produces the Ne 22 ( α , n ) Mg 25 neutron source for both the weak and main components of the slow neutron-capture process. At temperatures of stellar helium burning, the astrophysically relevant resonances in the O 18 ( α , γ ) Ne 22 reaction that dominate the reaction rate occur at α particle energies E lab of 472 and 569 keV. However, previous experiments have shown the strengths of these two resonances to be very weak, and only upper limits or partial resonance strengths could be obtained. This Letter reports the first direct measurement of the total resonance strength for the 472- and 569-keV resonances, 0.26 ± 0.05 and 0.63 ± 0.30 μ eV , respectively. New resonance strengths for the resonances at α particle energies of 662.1, 749.9, and 767.6 keV are also provided. These results were achieved in an experiment optimized for background suppression and detection efficiency. The experiment was performed at the Sanford Underground Research Facility, in the 4850-foot underground cavity dedicated to the Compact Accelerator System for Performing Astrophysical Research. The experimental end station used the γ -summing High EffiCiency TOtal absorption spectrometeR. Compared to previous works, the results decrease the stellar reaction rate by as much as ≈ 4 6 − 11 + 6\% in the relevant temperature range of stellar helium burning.},

Here, we describe a protocol to achieve the external control of the isomeric nuclear decay by using electron vortex beams whose wave function has been especially designed and reshaped on demand. Recombination of these electrons into the isomer’s atomic shell can lead to the controlled release of the stored nuclear energy. On the example of Mo 93 m , we show theoretically that the use of tailored electron vortex beams increases the depletion by 4 orders of magnitude compared to the spontaneous nuclear decay of the isomer. Furthermore, specific orbitals can sustain an enhancement of the recombination cross section for vortex electron beams by as much as 6 orders of magnitude, providing a handle for manipulating the capture mechanism. These findings open new prospects for controlling the interplay between atomic and nuclear degrees of freedom, with potential energy-related and high-energy radiation source applications.},

  abstract     = {The production of J / ψ mesons in heavy-ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider is believed to be dominated by the recombination of charm and anticharm quarks in a hot QCD medium. However, measurements of the elliptic flow ( v 2 ) of J / ψ mesons in these reactions are not well described by existing calculations of J / ψ recombination for transverse momenta p T ≳ 4 GeV . We revisit these calculations in two main aspects. Employing the resonance recombination model, we implement distribution functions of charm quarks transported through the quark-gluon plasma using state-of-the-art Langevin simulations and account for the space-momentum correlations of the diffusing charm and anticharm quarks in a hydrodynamically expanding fireball. This extends the relevance of the recombination processes to substantially larger momenta than before. We also revisit the suppression of primordially produced J / ψ ’s by propagating them through the same hydrodynamic medium, leading to a marked increase of their v 2 over previous estimates. Combining these developments into a calculation of the p T -dependent nuclear modification factor and v 2 of inclusive J / ψ production in semicentral Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC, we find a good description of the experimental results by the ALICE Collaboration. Our results thus resolve the abovementioned v 2 puzzle and imply the relevance of recombination processes for p T ’s of up to ∼ 8 GeV .},

  abstract     = {Using data from 289 numerical relativity simulations of binary neutron star mergers, we identify, for the first time, a robust quasiuniversal relation connecting the postmerger peak gravitational-wave frequency and the value of the density at the center of the maximum mass nonrotating neutron star. This relation offers a new possibility for precision equation-of-state constraints with next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave interferometers. Mock Einstein Telescope observations of fiducial events indicate that Bayesian inferences can constrain the maximum density to ∼ 15\% (90\% credibility level) for a single signal at the minimum sensitivity threshold for a detection. If the postmerger signal is included in a full-spectrum (inspiral-merger-postmerger) analysis of such a signal, the pressure-density function can be tightly constrained up to the maximum density, and the maximum neutron star mass can be measured with an accuracy better than 12\% (90\% credibility level).},

  abstract     = {We analytically compute the full counting statistics of charge transfer in a classical automaton of interacting charged particles. Deriving a closed-form expression for the moment generating function with respect to a stationary equilibrium state, we employ asymptotic analysis to infer the structure of charge current fluctuations for a continuous range of timescales. The solution exhibits several unorthodox features. Most prominently, on the timescale of typical fluctuations the probability distribution of the integrated charge current in a stationary ensemble without bias is distinctly non-Gaussian despite diffusive behavior of dynamical charge susceptibility. While inducing a charge imbalance is enough to recover Gaussian fluctuations, we find that higher cumulants grow indefinitely in time with different exponents, implying singular scaled cumulants. We associate this phenomenon with the lack of a regularity condition on moment generating functions and the onset of a dynamical critical point. In effect, the scaled cumulant generating function does not, irrespectively of charge bias, represent a faithful generating function of the scaled cumulants, yet the associated Legendre dual yields the correct large-deviation rate function. Our findings hint at novel types of dynamical universality classes in deterministic many-body systems.},

When the set of available controls is limited, the exact optimal initial state and the optimal controls are, in general, dependent on the probe time, a feature missing in the unrestricted case. Yet, for time-independent Hamiltonians with restricted controls, the problem can be approximately reduced to the unconstrained case via Floquet engineering. In particular, we find for magnetometry with a time-independent spin chain containing three-body interactions, even when the controls are restricted to one- and two-body interaction, that the Heisenberg scaling can still be approximately achieved. Our results open the door to investigate quantum metrology under a limited set of available controls, of relevance to many-body quantum metrology in realistic scenarios.},

We observe the ground-state quantum phase transition by slowly quenching the coupling strength, and measure the quantum dynamical evolution in various parameter regimes. With the magnetization and the spin-spin correlation as probes, we verify the prediction of the model Hamiltonian by comparing theoretical results in small system sizes with experimental observations.

By measuring the dynamics of local observables, entanglement entropy, and tripartite mutual information, we signal quantum thermalization and information scrambling in the X X ladder. In contrast, we show that the X X chain, as free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice, fails to thermalize to the Gibbs ensemble, and local information does not scramble in the integrable channel.

Intuitively, in the post-quantum GPT setting, a superposition is a set of two binary ensembles of states that are unambiguously distinguishable if the ensemble is revealed before the measurement has occurred, but not if it is revealed after. This notion is important because we show that, just like in quantum theory, superposition in the form of strong incompatibility is sufficient to realize the Bennett-Brassard 1984 protocol for secret key distribution.},

However, accurate incorporation of the dynamic dissociation or association of ionization groups known as charge regulation (CR) is often intractable in theoretical and computational investigations since charge redistribution and configuration need to be evolved self-consistently. Using hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that a dilute suspension of overall charge-neutral zwitterionic Janus nanoparticles shows a conformational transition from an open assembly of string or bundle to compact cluster along with the variation in p H . The behavior under CR is qualitatively different from the commonly employed constant charge condition where the transition is absent. The CR-induced clustering is due to the inhomogeneous and fluctuating charges localized near the equatorial boundary of the Janus particle. These features are enhanced particularly at low salt concentration and high electrostatic coupling strength. Our results indicate the critical role of charge regulation in the spatial self-organization of zwitterionic nanoparticles.},

Inspired by the prospect of the hetero-transition metal dichalcogenide Moiré system’s potential as a solid-state-based quantum simulator, we explore the extended Hubbard model on the triangular lattice using the density matrix renormalization group. Specifically, we explore the two-dimensional phase space spanned by the key tuning parameters in the extended Hubbard model, namely, the kinetic energy strength and the further-range Coulomb interaction strengths. We find competition between Fermi fluid, chiral spin liquid, spin density wave, and charge order. In particular, our finding of the optimal further-range interaction for the chiral correlation presents a tantalizing possibility.},

  abstract     = {The functionality of phonon-based quantum devices largely depends on the efficiency of the interaction of phonons with other excitations. For phonon frequencies above 20 GHz, generation and detection of the phonon quanta can be monitored through photons. The photon-phonon interaction can be enormously strengthened by involving an intermediate resonant quasiparticle, e.g., an exciton, with which a photon forms a polariton. In this work, we discover a giant photoelasticity of exciton-polaritons in a short-period superlattice and exploit it to detect propagating acoustic phonons. We demonstrate that 42 GHz coherent phonons can be detected with extremely high sensitivity in the time domain Brillouin oscillations by probing with photons in the spectral vicinity of the polariton resonance.},

  abstract     = {Triggering and switching magnetic moments is of key importance for applications ranging from spintronics to quantum information. A noninvasive ultrafast control at the nanoscale is, however, an open challenge. Here, we propose a novel laser-based scheme for generating atomic-scale charge current loops within femtoseconds. The associated orbital magnetic moments remain ferromagnetically aligned after the laser pulses have ceased and are localized within an area that is tunable via laser parameters and can be chosen to be well below the diffraction limit of the driving laser field. The scheme relies on tuning the phase, polarization, and intensities of two copropagating Gaussian and vortex laser pulses, allowing us to control the spatial extent, direction, and strength of the atomic-scale charge current loops induced in the irradiated sample upon photon absorption. In the experiment we used He atoms driven by an ultraviolet and infrared vortex-beam laser pulses to generate current-carrying Rydberg states and test for the generated magnetic moments via dichroic effects in photoemission. Ab initio quantum dynamic simulations and analysis confirm the proposed scenario and provide a quantitative estimate of the generated local moments.},

Here, we investigate the micromagnetic structure of screw dislocation lines in cubic chiral magnets using analytical and numerical methods. The far field of these dislocations is universal and classified by an integer strength ν that quantifies its Burgers vector. We demonstrate that a rich variety of dislocation-core structures can be realized even for the same strength ν . In particular, the magnetization at the core can be either smooth or singular. We present a specific example with ν = 1 for which the core is composed of a chain of singular Bloch points. In general, screw dislocations carry a noninteger but finite skyrmion charge so that they can be efficiently manipulated by spin currents and should contribute to the topological Hall effect.},

In contrast to generic Gross-Neveu dynamical mass generation, the quantum critical regime is characterized by large velocity anisotropies, with fixed-point values being approached very slowly. Both experimental and numerical investigations will not be representative of the infrared fixed point, but of a quasiuniversal regime where the drift of the exponents tracks the velocity anisotropy.},

The lattice completely freezes below 50 K, and Br 79 NQR line shapes become twice broader due to increased lattice distortions. Moreover, the frozen lattice exhibits an oscillatory component in the transverse spin echo decay, a typical signature of pairing of nuclear spins by indirect nuclear spin-spin interaction. This indicates that some Br sites form structural dimers via a pair of kagome Cu sites prior to the gradual emergence of spin singlets below ∼ 30 K . Our findings underscore the significant roles played by subtle structural distortions in determining the nature of the disordered magnetic ground state of the kagome lattice.},

  abstract     = {A topological Mott insulator (TMI) with spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking and nonzero Chern number has been discovered in a real-space effective model for twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at 3 / 4 filling in the strong coupling limit [1]. However, the finite temperature properties of such a TMI state remain illusive. In this work, employing the state-of-the-art thermal tensor network and the perturbative field-theoretical approaches, we obtain the finite- T phase diagram and the dynamical properties of the TBG model. The phase diagram includes the quantum anomalous Hall and charge density wave phases at low T , and an Ising transition separating them from the high- T symmetric phases. Because of the proliferation of excitons—particle-hole bound states—the transitions take place at a significantly reduced temperature than the mean-field estimation. The exciton phase is accompanied with distinctive experimental signatures in such as in charge compressibilities and optical conductivities close to the transition. Our work explains the smearing of the many-electron state topology by proliferating excitons and opens an avenue for controlled many-body investigations on finite-temperature states in the TBG and other quantum moiré systems.},

The domain wall creates two evanescent modes at the exceptional zero-energy point, whose superposition is associated with currents flowing in different directions in the two layers. Assuming a toroidal geometry, the effective Josephson current winds around the domain walls, whose direction is determined by the phase difference of the complex coefficients of the superimposed zero-energy modes. Thus, the zero-energy mode is directly linked to a macroscopic current. This result can be understood as an interplay of the conventional Josephson current perpendicular and the edge current parallel to a domain wall in a double layer of two chiral metals. As a realization we suggest the surface of a ring-shaped topological insulator. The duality between electron-electron and electron-hole double layers indicates that this effect should also be observable in excitonic double layers.},

For small strain, the IKS phase, recently proposed as a candidate order at all nonzero integer fillings of the moiré unit cell, is found to be ubiquitous for noninteger doping as well. We demonstrate that the corresponding electronic compressibility and Fermi surface structure are consistent with the “cascade” physics and Landau fans observed experimentally.

We show that the extent of local deviation from the affine (uniform) deformation in the elastic regime is strongly correlated with the plastic behavior of BMGs beyond yield, across chemical compositions and sample history. The results suggest that the propensity for collective local atomic rearrangements under stress promotes plasticity.},

We observed an asymmetry in the spectral line shape of the longitudinal mode that is notably absent from the shear mode, suggesting a time-dependent frequency chirp that is likely driven by photoinduced carrier diffusion. We argue on the basis of symmetry that these acoustic deformations can transiently alter the electronic structure near the Weyl points and support this with model calculations. Our study underscores the benefit of using off-axis crystal orientations when optically exciting acoustic deformations in topological semimetals, allowing one to transiently change their crystal and electronic structures.},

To do so, we consider a pump in a diffusive fluid, which is known to generate a density profile in the form of an electric dipole potential and a current in the form of a dipolar field above the critical point. We demonstrate that while the current retains its form at the critical point, the density profile changes drastically. At criticality, in d &lt; 4 dimensions, the deviation of the density from the average is given by sgn [ cos ( θ ) ] | cos ( θ ) / r ( d − 1 ) | 1 / δ at large distance r from the pump and angle θ with respect to the pump’s orientation. At short distances, there is a crossover to a cos ( θ ) / r d − 3 + η profile. Here δ and η are Ising critical exponents.

  abstract     = {One-dimensional topological pumping of matter waves in two overlaid optical lattices moving with respect to each other is considered in the presence of attractive nonlinearity. It is shown that there exists a threshold nonlinearity level above which the matter transfer is completely arrested. Below this threshold, the transfer of both dispersive wave packets and solitons occurs in accordance with the predictions of the linear theory; i.e., it is quantized and determined by the linear dynamical Chern numbers of the lowest bands. The breakdown of the transport is also explained by nontrivial topology of the bands. In that case, the nonlinearity induces Rabi oscillations of atoms between two (or more) lowest bands. If the sum of the dynamical Chern numbers of the populated bands is zero, the oscillatory dynamics of a matter soliton in space occurs, which corresponds to the transport breakdown. Otherwise, the sum of the Chern numbers of the nonlinearity-excited bands determines the direction and magnitude of the average velocity of matter solitons that remain quantized and admit fractional values. Thus, even in the strongly nonlinear regime the topology of the linear bands is responsible for the evolution of solitons. The transition between different dynamical regimes is accurately described by the perturbation theory for solitons.},

  abstract     = {The cavity electromechanical devices with radiation-pressure interaction induced Kerr-like nonlinearity are promising candidates to generate microwave frequency combs. We construct a silicon-nitride membrane based superconducting cavity electromechanical device and study two mechanical modes synergistic frequency combs. Around the threshold of intracavity field instability, we first show independent frequency combs with tooth spacing equal to each mechanical mode frequency. At the overlap boundaries of these two individual mechanical mode mediated instability thresholds, we observe hybridization of frequency combs based on the cavity field mediated indirect coupling between these two mechanical modes. The spectrum lines turn out to be unequally spaced, but can be recognized in combinations of the coexisting frequency combs. Beyond the boundary, the comb reverts to the single mode case, and which mechanical mode frequency will the tooth spacing be depends on the mode competition. Our work demonstrates mechanical mode competition enabled switchability of frequency comb tooth spacing and can be extended to other devices with multiple nonlinearities.},

  abstract     = {Coherent quantum systems are a key resource for emerging quantum technology. Solid-state spin systems are of particular importance for compact and scalable devices. However, interaction with the solid-state host degrades the coherence properties. The negatively charged silicon vacancy center in diamond is such an example. While spectral properties are outstanding, with optical coherence protected by the defects symmetry, the spin coherence is susceptible to rapid orbital relaxation limiting the spin dephasing time. A prolongation of the orbital relaxation time is therefore of utmost urgency and has been tackled by operating at very low temperatures or by introducing large strain. However, both methods have significant drawbacks: the former requires use of dilution refrigerators and the latter affects intrinsic symmetries. Here, a novel method is presented to prolong the orbital relaxation with a locally modified phonon density of states in the relevant frequency range, by restricting the diamond host to below 100 nm. Subsequently measured coherent population trapping shows an extended spin dephasing time compared to the phonon-limited time in a pure bulk diamond. The method works at liquid helium temperatures of few Kelvin and in the low-strain regime.},

We study a system of V -shaped three-level atoms coherently coupled to the two quadratures of a dissipative cavity. The interplay between the atomic level structure and dissipation makes the phase diagram of the open system drastically different from the closed one. In particular, it leads to the stabilization of a continuous family of dark and nearly dark excited many-body states with inverted atomic populations as the steady states. The multistability of these states can be probed via their distinct fluctuations and excitation spectra, as well as the system’s Liouvillian dynamics which are highly sensitive to ramp protocols. Our model can be implemented experimentally by encoding the two higher-energy modes in orthogonal density-modulated states in a bosonic quantum gas. This implementation offers prospects for potential applications like the realization of quantum optical random walks and microscopy with subwavelength spatial resolution.},

While the reduction of loss is qualitatively explained within the few-body scattering framework, a remaining suppression provides evidence for the long-range Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions mediated by fermions between bosons. Our model based on RKKY interactions quantitatively reproduces the data without free parameters, and predicts one order of magnitude reduction of the three-body loss coefficient in the deeply Fermi-degenerate regime.},

A suitable Gaussian estimator for the clock laser detuning is presented, and an analytic expression for the sensitivity of the protocol is derived. We use this analytic expression to optimize the protocol using available experimental parameters, achieving an improvement of 7.9 dB with respect to the standard quantum limit in terms of clock stability.

  abstract     = {The Rare-RI Ring (R3) is a recently commissioned cyclotronlike storage ring mass spectrometer dedicated to mass measurements of exotic nuclei far from stability at Radioactive Isotope Beam Factory (RIBF) in RIKEN. The first application of mass measurement using the R3 mass spectrometer at RIBF is reported. Rare isotopes produced at RIBF— Sn 127 , In 126 , Cd 125 , Ag 124 , Pd 123 —were injected in R3. Masses of In 126 , Cd 125 , and Pd 123 were measured whereby the mass uncertainty of Pd 123 was improved. This is the first reported measurement with a new storage ring mass spectrometry technique realized at a heavy-ion cyclotron and employing individual injection of the preidentified rare nuclei. The latter is essential for the future mass measurements of the rarest isotopes produced at RIBF. The impact of the new Pd 123 result on the solar r -process abundances in a neutron star merger event is investigated by performing reaction network calculations of 20 trajectories with varying electron fraction Y e . It is found that the neutron capture cross section on Pd 123 increases by a factor of 2.2 and β -delayed neutron emission probability, P 1 n , of Rh 123 increases by 14\%. The neutron capture cross section on Pd 122 decreases by a factor of 2.6 leading to pileup of material at A = 122 , thus reproducing the trend of the solar r -process abundances. The trend of the two-neutron separation energies ( S 2 n ) was investigated for the Pd isotopic chain. The new mass measurement with improved uncertainty excludes large changes of the S 2 n value at N = 77 . Such large increase of the S 2 n values before N = 82 was proposed as an alternative to the quenching of the N = 82 shell gap to reproduce r -process abundances in the mass region of A = 112 – 124 .},

The mapping between the true neutrino energy E ν and reconstructed neutrino energy E ν rec and between the energy transfer ν and reconstructed hadronic energy E had rec are validated by comparing the data and Monte Carlo (MC) predictions. In particular, the modeling of the missing hadronic energy and its associated uncertainties are verified by a new method that compares the E had rec distributions between data and a MC prediction after constraining the reconstructed muon kinematic distributions, energy, and polar angle to those of data.

By using the notions of critical points at infinity, cluster expansion, and Lefschetz thimbles, we show that a third-order effect in semiclassics gives an imaginary ambiguous contribution to the mass gap, which is supposed to be real and unambiguous. This is troublesome for the original analysis, and it is difficult to resolve this issue directly in quantum field theory (QFT). However, we find a new compactification of the Polyakov model to quantum mechanics, by using a background ’t Hooft flux. The compactification has the merit of remembering the monopole instantons of the full QFT within Born-Oppenheimer approximation, while the periodic compactification does not. In the quantum mechanical limit, we prove the resurgent cancellation of the ambiguity in three-instanton sector against ambiguity in the Borel resummation of the perturbation theory around one instanton. Assuming that this result holds in QFT, we provide a large-order asymptotics of perturbation theory around perturbative vacuum and instanton.},

A duality symmetry between Massieu’s and Gibbs’s entropy arises in the limit of infinitely repeated observations, yielding the Gibbs equation and Hill-Gibbs-Duhem equation (HGDE) as a dual pair. If a system has a thermodynamic limit satisfying Callen’s postulate, entropy being an Eulerian function, the symmetry is lost: the HGDE reduces to the Gibbs-Duhem equation. This theory provides a de-mechanized foundation for classical and nanothermodynamics and offers a framework for distilling emergence from large data, free from underlying details.},

Such general bounds are not available for most bosonic lattice gases due to their unbounded local interactions.

The bound is the first to cover a broad class of initial states with positive density including Mott states, which resolves a longstanding open problem. It applies to Bose-Hubbard–type models on any lattice with not too long-ranged hopping. The proof is rigorous and rests on controlling the time evolution of a new kind of adiabatic spacetime localization observable via iterative differential inequalities.},

We experimentally demonstrate a significant benefit of this approach to quantum simulation: the entanglement structure of an infinite system—specifically the half-chain entanglement spectrum—is conveniently encoded within a small register of “bond qubits” and can be extracted with relative ease. Using Honeywell’s model H0 quantum computer equipped with selective midcircuit measurement and reset, we quantitatively determine the near-critical entanglement entropy of a correlated spin chain directly in the thermodynamic limit and show that its phase transition becomes quickly resolved upon expanding the bond-qubit register.},

A standard approach in the literature to assess this is Monte Carlo sampling, which suffers from two major drawbacks. First, it is computationally expensive. Second, it does not reveal the effect that each individual uncertainty parameter has on the state of the system. In this Letter, we evade both these drawbacks by incorporating propagation of uncertainty directly into simulations of quantum dynamics, thereby obtaining a method that is orders of magnitude faster than Monte Carlo simulations and directly provides information on how each uncertainty parameter influences the system dynamics. Additionally, we compare our method to experimental results obtained using the IBM quantum computers.},

Based on this, we are able to demonstrate that the commonly used “doubling” scheme for performing probabilistic entanglement swapping of probabilistically distributed entangled qubit pairs in quantum repeaters does not always produce the best possible raw rate. Focusing on this figure of merit, without considering additional probabilistic elements for error suppression such as entanglement distillation on higher “nesting levels,” our approach reveals that a power-of-two number of segments has no privileged position in quantum repeater theory; the best scheme can be constructed for any number of segments. Moreover, classical communication can be included into our scheme, and we show how this influences the raw waiting time for different numbers of segments, confirming again the optimality of “nondoubling” in some relevant parameter regimes. Thus, our approach provides the minimal possible waiting time of quantum repeaters in a fairly general physical setting.},

  abstract     = {Multipartite entangled states are significant resources for both quantum information processing and quantum metrology. In particular, non-Gaussian entangled states are predicted to achieve a higher sensitivity of precision measurements than Gaussian states. On the basis of metrological sensitivity, the conventional linear Ramsey squeezing parameter (RSP) efficiently characterizes the Gaussian entangled atomic states but fails for much wider classes of highly sensitive non-Gaussian states. These complex non-Gaussian entangled states can be classified by the nonlinear squeezing parameter (NLSP), as a generalization of the RSP with respect to nonlinear observables and identified via the Fisher information. However, the NLSP has never been measured experimentally. Using a 19-qubit programmable superconducting processor, we report the characterization of multiparticle entangled states generated during its nonlinear dynamics. First, selecting ten qubits, we measure the RSP and the NLSP by single-shot readouts of collective spin operators in several different directions. Then, by extracting the Fisher information of the time-evolved state of all 19 qubits, we observe a large metrological gain of 9.89 − 0.29 + 0.28 dB over the standard quantum limit, indicating a high level of multiparticle entanglement for quantum-enhanced phase sensitivity. Benefiting from high-fidelity full controls and addressable single-shot readouts, the superconducting processor with interconnected qubits provides an ideal platform for engineering and benchmarking non-Gaussian entangled states that are useful for quantum-enhanced metrology.},

These currents remain stable well into the BCS regime at sufficiently low temperature. We drive a circulating BCS superfluid into the normal phase and back by changing the interaction strength and find that the probability for quantized superflow to reappear is remarkably insensitive to the time spent in the normal phase and the minimum interaction strength. After ruling out spontaneous current formation for our experimental conditions, we argue that the reappearance of superflow is due to weak damping of normal currents in this limit. These results establish that ultracold fermionic atoms with tunable interactions can be used to create matter-wave circuits similar to those previously created with weakly interacting bosonic atoms.},

A mean-field version of this model, first suggested by Song et al. , [Modelling the scaling properties of human mobility, Nat. Phys. 6 , 818 (2010) ] was shown to well describe human movement data. We show that our generalized model adequately describes empirical movement data of Egyptian fruit bats ( Rousettus aegyptiacus ) when accounting for interindividual variation in the population. We also study the probability of visiting any site a given number of times and derive a mean-field equation. Our analysis yields a remarkable phase transition occurring at preferential returns which scale linearly with past visits. Following empirical evidence, we suggest that this phase transition reflects a trade-off between extensive and intensive foraging modes.},

  abstract     = {In contexts ranging from embryonic development to bacterial ecology, cell populations migrate chemotactically along self-generated chemical gradients, often forming a propagating front. Here, we theoretically show that the stability of such chemotactic fronts to morphological perturbations is determined by limitations in the ability of individual cells to sense and thereby respond to the chemical gradient. Specifically, cells at bulging parts of a front are exposed to a smaller gradient, which slows them down and promotes stability, but they also respond more strongly to the gradient, which speeds them up and promotes instability. We predict that this competition leads to chemotactic fingering when sensing is limited at too low chemical concentrations. Guided by this finding and by experimental data on E. coli chemotaxis, we suggest that the cells’ sensory machinery might have evolved to avoid these limitations and ensure stable front propagation. Finally, as sensing of any stimuli is necessarily limited in living and active matter in general, the principle of sensing-induced stability may operate in other types of directed migration such as durotaxis, electrotaxis, and phototaxis.},

An electron wave function is prepared in two paths that pass on opposite sides of a gold nanoparticle, where plasmons are excited before the paths are recombined to produce electron interference. We show that the measured spectra are consistent with theoretical predictions, specifically that the interference signal formed by inelastically scattered electrons is π out of phase with respect to that formed by elastically scattered electrons. This technique is sensitive to the phase of localized optical modes, because the interference signal amounts to a substantial fraction of the transmitted electrons. Thus, we argue that inelastic interferometric imaging with our scanning electron Mach-Zehnder interferometer provides a new platform for controlling the transverse momentum of free electrons and studying coherent electron-matter interactions at the nanoscale.},

The spin-orbit emergent inductance universally arises in the coexistence of magnetism and the spin-orbit couplings, even with spatially uniform magnetization, allowing its stable operation in wide ranges of temperature and frequency. Revisiting the widely studied systems involving ferromagnets with spatial inversion asymmetry, with the new perspective offered by our work, will lead to opening a new paradigm in the study of spin-orbit physics and the spintronics-based power management in ultrawideband frequency range.},

The low energy spectrum remains linear in momentum and is identical to that of a Hermitian Fermi gas. The fermionic Green’s function decays in a power law fashion for large distances, as expected from gapless excitations, although the exponent is reduced from − 1 due to the quantum Zeno effect. In spite of the gapless nature of the excitations, the ground state entanglement entropy saturates to a finite value, independent of the subsystem size due to the non-Hermitian correlation length intrinsic to the system.

  abstract     = {Fractional entropy is a signature of nonlocal degrees of freedom, such as Majorana zero modes or more exotic non-Abelian anyons. Although direct experimental measurements remain challenging, Maxwell relations provide an indirect route to the entropy through charge measurements. Here we consider multichannel charge-Kondo systems, which are predicted to host exotic quasiparticles due to a frustration of Kondo screening at low temperatures. In the absence of experimental data for the charge occupation, we derive relations connecting the latter to the conductance, for which experimental results have recently been obtained. Our analysis indicates that Majorana and Fibonacci anyon quasiparticles are well developed in existing two- and three-channel charge-Kondo devices, and that their characteristic k B log 2 and k B log [ ( 1 + 5 ) / 2 ] entropies are experimentally measurable.},

For long-range interactions, no such symmetry exists as the strongly interacting system is always many-body localized, independent of the effective disorder strength, and the system is analogous to a pinned Wigner crystal.

Externally introduced chiral enantiomers may couple resonances, but the extremely weak chirality of natural enantiomers largely prevents the system from reaching strong coupling regimes. Whether weak chirality could induce strong coupling between resonant states remains an open question. Here, we realize strong coupling between quasibound states in the continuum of a high- Q metasurface, assisted with externally introduced enantiomers of weak chirality. We establish a chirality-involved Hamiltonian to quantitatively describe the correlation between the coupling strength and the chirality of such systems, which provides an insightful recipe for enhancing the coupling of resonant states further in the presence of quite weak chirality. Consequently, high-sensitivity chiral sensing is demonstrated, in which the circular dichroism signal is enhanced 3 orders higher than the case without strong coupling. Our findings present a distinct strategy for manipulating optical coupling between resonances, revealing opportunities in chiral sensing, topological photonics, and quantum optics.},

However, the dragging of heat is intrinsically elusive, due to the absence of momentum in thermal diffusion. Here, we design a spatiotemporal thermal metamaterial based on heat transfer in porous media to demonstrate the diffusive analog to Fizeau drag. The space-related inhomogeneity and time-related advection enable the diffusive Fizeau drag effect. Thanks to the spatiotemporal coupling, different propagating speeds of temperature fields can be observed in two opposite directions, thus facilitating nonreciprocal thermal profiles. The phenomenon of diffusive Fizeau drag stands robustly even when the direction of advection is perpendicular to the propagation of temperature fields. These results could pave an unexpected way toward realizing the nonreciprocal and directional transport of mass and energy.},

We observe that the individual tunneling events are superradiant in nature and locally resolve them in the lattice by performing real-time, frequency-resolved measurements of the leaking cavity field. The results can be extended to a regime exhibiting a cascade of currents and simultaneous coherences between multiple lattice sites, where numerical simulations provide further understanding of the dynamics.

  abstract     = {The measurement of two-particle angular correlation functions in high-multiplicity e + e − collisions at s = 10.52 GeV is reported. In this study, the 89.5 fb − 1 of hadronic e + e − annihilation data collected by the Belle detector at KEKB are used. Two-particle angular correlation functions are measured in the full relative azimuthal angle ( Δ ϕ ) and three units of pseudorapidity ( Δ η ), defined by either the electron beam axis or the event-shape thrust axis, and are studied as a function of charged-particle multiplicity. The measurement in the thrust axis analysis, with mostly outgoing quark pairs determining the reference axis, is sensitive to the region of additional soft gluon emissions. No significant anisotropic collective behavior is observed with either coordinate analyses. Near-side jet correlations appear to be absent in the thrust axis analysis. The measurements are compared to predictions from various event generators and are expected to provide new constraints to the phenomenological models in the low-energy regime.},

In models where both muons and dark matter carry equal charges under a U ( 1 ) L μ − L τ gauge symmetry, the corresponding Z ′ can both resolve the observed g − 2 anomaly and yield an acceptable dark matter relic abundance, relying on annihilations which take place through the Z ′ resonance. Once the value of ( g − 2 ) μ and the dark matter abundance are each fixed, there is very little remaining freedom in this model, making it highly predictive. We provide a comprehensive analysis of this scenario, identifying a viable range of dark matter masses between approximately 10 and 100 MeV, which falls entirely within the projected sensitivity of several accelerator-based experiments, including NA62, NA 64 μ , M 3 , and DUNE. Furthermore, portions of this mass range predict contributions to Δ N eff which could ameliorate the tension between early and late time measurements of the Hubble constant, and which could be tested by stage 4 CMB experiments.},

This requires that the triplet Higgs must decay dominantly into the leptonic channel. Additionally, this model will be probed at the future 100 TeV collider, upcoming lepton flavor violation experiments such as Mu3e, and neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. Thus, this simple framework provides a unified solution to the three major unknowns of modern physics—inflation, the neutrino masses, and the observed baryon asymmetry—while simultaneously providing unique phenomenological predictions that will be probed terrestrially at upcoming experiments.},

If these symmetries are also spontaneously broken, the would-be Goldstone modes acquire a small mass, or inverse correlation length, and are referred to as pseudo-Goldstones. At nonzero temperature, the effects of dissipation can be captured by hydrodynamics at sufficiently long scales compared to the local equilibrium. Here, we show that, in the limit of weak explicit breaking, locality of hydrodynamics implies that the damping of pseudo-Goldstones is completely determined by their mass and diffusive transport coefficients. We present many applications: superfluids, QCD in the chiral limit, Wigner crystal and density wave phases in the presence of an external magnetic field or not, nematic phases, and (anti)ferromagnets. For electronic density wave phases, pseudo-Goldstone damping generates a contribution to the resistivity independent of the strength of disorder, which can have a linear temperature dependence provided the associated diffusivity saturates a bound. This is reminiscent of the phenomenology of strange metal high- T c superconductors, where charge density waves are observed across the phase diagram.},

Two-loop Feynman integrals are performed in the potential region, yielding conservative results. For spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum we find a conservative scattering angle that is fully consistent with state-of-the-art post-Newtonian results.

Although these relations have been well studied for classical systems, they remain largely unexplored in the quantum regime. In this Letter, we investigate such trade-off relations for Markovian open quantum systems whose underlying dynamics are quantum jumps, such as thermal processes and quantum measurement processes. Specifically, we derive finite-time lower bounds on the relative fluctuation of both dynamical observables and their first passage times for arbitrary initial states. The bounds imply that the precision of observables is constrained not only by thermodynamic quantities but also by quantum coherence. We find that the product of the relative fluctuation and entropy production or dynamical activity is enhanced by quantum coherence in a generic class of dissipative processes of systems with nondegenerate energy levels. Our findings provide insights into the survival of the classical uncertainty relations in quantum cases.},

Here, we demonstrate an experimental method to measure OTOCs at finite temperatures and use the method to study their temperature dependence. These measurements are performed on a digital quantum computer running a simulation of the transverse field Ising model. Our flexible method, based on the creation of a thermofield double state, can be extended to other models and enables us to probe the OTOC’s temperature-dependent decay rate. Measuring this decay rate opens up the possibility of testing the fundamental temperature-dependent bounds on quantum information scrambling.},

This allows us to address the connection between entanglement and operator locality beyond the paradigm of bipartite pure systems.

  abstract     = {Quantum batteries are devices made from quantum states, which store and release energy in a fast and efficient manner, thus offering numerous possibilities in future technological applications. They offer a significant charging speedup when compared to classical batteries, due to the possibility of using entangling charging operations. We show that the maximal speedup that can be achieved is extensive in the number of cells, thus offering at most quadratic scaling in the charging power over the classically achievable linear scaling. To reach such a scaling, a global charging protocol, charging all the cells collectively, needs to be employed. This concludes the quest on the limits of charging power of quantum batteries and adds to other results in which quantum methods are known to provide at most quadratic scaling over their classical counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Figuring out the physical rationale behind natural selection of quantum theory is one of the most acclaimed quests in quantum foundational research. This pursuit has inspired several axiomatic initiatives to derive a mathematical formulation of the theory by identifying the general structure of state and effect space of individual systems as well as specifying their composition rules. This generic framework can allow several consistent composition rules for a multipartite system even when state and effect cones of individual subsystems are assumed to be quantum. Nevertheless, for any bipartite system, none of these compositions allows beyond quantum spacelike correlations. In this Letter, we show that such bipartite compositions can admit stronger-than-quantum correlations in the timelike domain and, hence, indicates pragmatically distinct roles carried out by state and effect cones. We discuss consequences of such correlations in a communication task, which accordingly opens up a possibility of testing the actual composition between elementary quanta.},

Understanding the switching properties of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) domain state is critical for developing AFM spintronics. By utilizing the magneto-optical birefringence effect, we experimentally demonstrate the switching rate of the AFM domain can be enhanced by more than 2 orders of magnitude through applying an alternating square-wave field on a single crystalline Fe / CoO bilayer. The observed extraordinary speed can be much faster than that triggered by a constant field with the same amplitude. The effect can be understood as the efficient suppression of the pinning of AFM domain walls by the strong exchange torque triggered by the reversal of the Fe magnetization, as revealed by spin dynamics simulations. Our finding opens up new opportunities to design the antiferromagnet-based spintronic devices utilizing the ferromagnet-antiferromagnet heterostructure.},

Here, we report a neutron scattering study on the bilayer compound CaK ( Fe 0.96 Ni 0.04 ) 4 As 4 with superconductivity coexisting with a noncollinear spin-vortex crystal magnetic order that preserves the tetragonal symmetry of the Fe-Fe plane. In the superconducting state, two spin resonance modes with odd and even L symmetries due to the bilayer coupling are found similar to the undoped compound CaKFe 4 As 4 but at lower energies. Polarization analysis reveals that the odd mode is c -axis polarized, and the low-energy spin anisotropy can persist to the paramagnetic phase at high temperature, which closely resembles other systems with in-plane collinear and c -axis biaxial magnetic orders. These results provide the missing piece of the puzzle on the SOC effect in iron-pnictide superconductors, and also establish a common picture of c -axis preferred magnetic excitations below T c regardless of the details of magnetic pattern or lattice symmetry.},

The linear drop of ρ s at low temperatures implies the superconductors are clean, but the linear scaling between ρ s (in the zero temperature limit) and the transition temperature T c is a hallmark of the dirty limit in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) framework [I. Bozovic et al. , Nature (London) 536 , 309 (2016) ]. This dichotomy motivated exotic theories beyond the standard BCS theory. We show, however, that such a dichotomy can be reconciled naturally by the role of increasing anisotropic scattering caused by the apical oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, the anisotropic scattering also explains the “missing” Drude weight upon doping in the optical conductivity, as reported in the THz experiment [F. Mahmood et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 122 , 027003 (2019) ]. Therefore, the overdoped cuprates can actually be described consistently by the d -wave BCS theory with the unique anisotropic scattering.},

By performing rigorous first-principles calculations for a prototypical hybrid-perovskite FAPbI 3 (FA: formamidinium), we show that 1\% lattice expansion could already reduce the nonradiative capture coefficient by one order of magnitude. Unexpectedly, the suppressed nonradiative capture is not caused by changes in the band gap or defect transition level due to lattice expansion, but originates from enhanced defect relaxations associated with charge-state transitions in the expanded lattice. These insights not only provide a rationale for the efficiency enhancement by lattice expansion in hybrid perovskites, but also offer a general approach to the manipulation of nonradiative capture via strain engineering in a wide spectrum of optoelectronic materials.},

The latter cooling rate regulates the temperature during the condensate growth, consequently controlling the early coarsening dynamics in the defect formation. We find that the defect number shows a scaling behavior with the latter cooling rate regardless of the initial cooling rate, indicating universal coarsening dynamics in the early stage of condensate growth. Our results demonstrate that early coarsening not only reduces the defect density, but also affects its scaling with the quench rate, which is beyond the Kibble-Zurek mechanism.},

We perform our analysis in two fundamentally distinct long-range and short-range integrable limits which stem from the type of nonintegrable perturbations. Long-range limits result in a single parameter scaling of the Lyapunov spectrum, with the inverse largest Lyapunov exponent being the only diverging control parameter and the rescaled spectrum approaching an analytical function. Short-range limits result in a dramatic slowing down of thermalization which manifests through the rescaled Lyapunov spectrum approaching a non-analytic function. An additional diverging length scale controls the exponential suppression of all Lyapunov exponents relative to the largest one.},

Here, we test the propensity rule for Rb 85 for which the scattering properties are very different from Rb 87 . The Rb 2 molecular product distribution is mapped out in a state-to-state fashion using resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization detection schemes which fully cover all possible molecular spin states. Interestingly, for the experimentally investigated range of binding energies from zero to ∼ 13 GHz × h we observe that the spin-conservation propensity rule also holds for Rb 85 . From these observations and a theoretical analysis we derive an understanding for the conservation of the hyperfine spin state.

The incident photons were produced by the recently upgraded Glasgow-Mainz photon tagging facility and impinged on a cryogenic liquid hydrogen target, with the scattered photons detected in the Crystal Ball/TAPS setup. Using the highest statistics Compton scattering data ever measured on the proton along with two effective field theories (both covariant baryon and heavy-baryon) and one fixed- t dispersion relation model, constraining the fits with the Baldin sum rule, we have obtained the proton electric and magnetic polarizabilities with unprecedented precision: α E 1 = 10.99 ± 0.16 ± 0.47 ± 0.17 ± 0.34 , β M 1 = 3.14 ± 0.21 ± 0.24 ± 0.20 ± 0.35 ; in units of 10 − 4 fm 3 where the errors are statistical, systematic, spin polarizability dependent, and model dependent.},

From this asymmetry the Al 27 neutron radius R n = 2.89 ± 0.12 fm was determined using a many-models correlation technique. The corresponding neutron skin thickness R n − R p = − 0.04 ± 0.12 fm is small, as expected for a light nucleus with a neutron excess of only 1. This result thus serves as a successful benchmark for electroweak determinations of neutron radii on heavier nuclei. A tree-level approach was used to extract the Al 27 weak radius R w = 3.00 ± 0.15 fm , and the weak skin thickness R wk − R ch = − 0.04 ± 0.15 fm .

The data analysis used a novel technique exploiting the mirror symmetry of the two nuclei, which essentially eliminates many theoretical uncertainties in the extraction of the ratio. The results, which cover the Bjorken scaling variable range 0.19 &lt; x &lt; 0.83 , represent a significant improvement compared to previous SLAC and Jefferson Lab measurements for the ratio.

This unique geometry enables enclosure in standard cryostats and high-field solenoids, overcoming limitations of current dish antennas.

  abstract     = {The relative abundance of cosmic ray nickel nuclei with respect to iron is by far larger than for all other transiron elements; therefore it provides a favorable opportunity for a low background measurement of its spectrum. Since nickel, as well as iron, is one of the most stable nuclei, the nickel energy spectrum and its relative abundance with respect to iron provide important information to estimate the abundances at the cosmic ray source and to model the Galactic propagation of heavy nuclei. However, only a few direct measurements of cosmic-ray nickel at energy larger than ∼ 3 GeV / n are available at present in the literature, and they are affected by strong limitations in both energy reach and statistics. In this Letter, we present a measurement of the differential energy spectrum of nickel in the energy range from 8.8 to 240 GeV / n , carried out with unprecedented precision by the Calorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET) in operation on the International Space Station since 2015. The CALET instrument can identify individual nuclear species via a measurement of their electric charge with a dynamic range extending far beyond iron (up to atomic number Z = 40 ). The particle’s energy is measured by a homogeneous calorimeter (1.2 proton interaction lengths, 27 radiation lengths) preceded by a thin imaging section (3 radiation lengths) providing tracking and energy sampling. This Letter follows our previous measurement of the iron spectrum [O. Adriani et al. (CALET Collaboration), Phys. Rev. Lett. 126 , 241101 (2021) .], and it extends our investigation on the energy dependence of the spectral index of heavy elements. It reports the analysis of nickel data collected from November 2015 to May 2021 and a detailed assessment of the systematic uncertainties. In the region from 20 to 240 GeV / n our present data are compatible within the errors with a single power law with spectral index − 2.51 ± 0.07 .},

  abstract     = {The thermodynamic uncertainty relation expresses a seemingly universal trade-off between the cost for driving an autonomous system and precision in any output observable. It has so far been proven for discrete systems and for overdamped Brownian motion. Its validity for the more general class of underdamped Brownian motion, where inertia is relevant, was conjectured based on numerical evidence. We now disprove this conjecture by constructing a counterexample. Its design is inspired by a classical pendulum clock, which uses an escapement to couple the motion of an oscillator to another degree of freedom (a “hand”) driven by an external force. Considering a thermodynamically consistent, discrete model for an escapement mechanism, we first show that the oscillations of an underdamped harmonic oscillator in thermal equilibrium are sufficient to break the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. We then show that this is also the case in simulations of a fully continuous underdamped system with a potential landscape that mimics an escaped pendulum.},

The leading term in system size dependence of participation entropy indicates a model-dependent multifractal scaling of the wave functions at any nonzero measurement rate. The subleading term contains universal information about measurement-induced phase transitions and plays the role of an order parameter, being constant nonzero in the error-correcting phase and vanishing in the quantum Zeno phase. We provide robust numerical evidence investigating a variety of quantum many-body systems and provide an analytical interpretation of this behavior expressing the participation entropy in terms of partition functions of classical statistical models in 2D.},

On the one hand, we obtain an ultimate bound on thermometry precision in the Bayesian setting, valid for arbitrary interactions and measurement schemes, which lower bounds the error with a quadratic (Heisenberg-like) scaling with the number of probes. We develop a simple adaptive strategy that can saturate this limit. On the other hand, we derive a no-go theorem for nonadaptive protocols that does not allow for better than linear (shot-noise-like) scaling even if one has unlimited control over the probes, namely, access to arbitrary many-body interactions.},

The new modes emerge as a result of the propagation of the chaotic behavior of individual grains—here, monodisperse emulsion droplets—to the level of the entire system as the emulsion is focused into a narrow orifice by an external viscous flow. We observe avalanching dynamics and the formation of remarkably stable jets—single-file granular chains—which occasionally break, resulting in a non-Gaussian distribution of cluster sizes. We find that the sequences of droplet rearrangements that lead to the formation of such chains resemble unfolding of cancer cell clusters in narrow capillaries, overall demonstrating that microfluidic emulsion systems could serve to model various aspects of soft granular flows, including also tissue dynamics at the mesoscale.},

We investigate two Josephson-coupled topological quantum wires in the presence of Coulomb interactions, forming a so-called Majorana box qubit. An oscillating gate voltage can induce Floquet Majorana modes in both wires. This allows for the encoding of three qubits in a sector with fixed electron parity. If such a system is prepared by increasing the amplitude of oscillations adiabatically, it is inherently unstable as interactions resonantly create quasiparticles. This can be avoided by using instead a protocol where the oscillation frequency is increased slowly. In this case, one can find a parameter regime where the system remains stable.},

The system is driven out of equilibrium with optically injected excitons that depolarize the electron spins and the subsequent electron spin-valley relaxation is probed in time-resolved experiments. We demonstrate that both the relaxation and light-induced depolarization rates at millikelvin temperatures sensitively depend on the Landau level filling factor: the relaxation is enhanced whenever the electrons form an integer quantum Hall liquid and slows down appreciably at noninteger fillings, while the depolarization rate exhibits an opposite behavior. Our findings suggest that spin-valley dynamics may be used as a tool to investigate the interplay between the effects of disorder and strong interactions in the electronic ground state.},

It is crucial to investigate what impact many-body physics has on extreme nonlinear optical phenomena, with the possibility of controlling material properties by light. However, the effect of competing orders and electron-electron correlations on highly nonlinear optical phenomena has not yet been experimentally clarified. Here, we investigated high-order harmonic generation from the Mott-insulating phase of Ca 2 RuO 4 . Changing the gap energy in Ca 2 RuO 4 as a function of temperature, we observed a strong enhancement of high order harmonic generation at 50 K, increasing up to several hundred times compared to room temperature. We discovered that this enhancement can be well reproduced by an empirical scaling law that depends only on the material gap energy and photon emission energy. Such a scaling law can hardly be explained by the electronic structure change in the single particle model and has not been predicted by previous theoretical studies on HHG in the simple Mott-Hubbard model. Our results suggest that the highly nonlinear optical response of strongly correlated materials is influenced by competition among the multiple degrees of freedom and electron-electron correlations.},

  abstract     = {Deep theoretical understanding of the electrical response of Josephson junctions is indispensable regarding both recent discoveries of new kinds of superconductivity and technological advances such as superconducting quantum computers. Here, we study the microscopic theory of the dc current-biased I − V characteristics of Josephson tunnel junctions. We derive an analytical formula of the I − V characteristics of generic junctions. We identify subharmonics of the I − V characteristics and their underlying mechanism as the feedback effect of intrinsic ac currents generated by voltage pulses in the past. We apply our theory to analytically solve the Werthamer equation and describe various dc current-biased I − V characteristics as a function of softening of the superconducting gap. Strikingly, we identify voltage staircases of the I − V characteristics in a genuine Josephson junction without ac current bias or qubit dynamics. Our general analytical formalism opens new avenues for a microscopic understanding of I − V characteristics of Josephson junctions that have been limited to phenomenological models so far.},

  abstract     = {Recent transport studies have demonstrated the great potential of twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene (TMBG) as a new platform to host moiré flat bands with a higher tunability than twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). However, a direct visualization of the flat bands in TMBG and its comparison with the ones in TBG remain unexplored. Here, via fabricating on a single sample with exactly the same twist angle of ∼ 1.1 3 ° , we present a direct comparative study between TMBG and TBG using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. We observe a sharp density of states peak near the Fermi energy in tunneling spectroscopy, confirming unambiguously the existence of flat electronic bands in TMBG. The bandwidth of this flat-band peak is found to be slightly narrower than that of the TBG, validating previous theoretical predictions. Remarkably, by measuring spatially resolved spectroscopy, combined with continuum model calculation, we show that the flat-band states in TMBG exhibit a unique layer-resolved localization-delocalization coexisting feature, which offers an unprecedented possibility to utilize their cooperation on exploring novel correlation phenomena. Our work provides important microscopic insight of flat-band states for better understanding the emergent physics in graphene moiré systems.},

Such solitons have two types: a low energy branch with positive inertial mass and a higher energy branch with negative inertial mass. Both types become identical at the maximum speed, a new speed bound that is different from speed limits set by the elementary excitations. The physical mass, which accounts for the number density dip, is negative for both types. In a finite one-dimensional system subject to a linear potential, the soliton undergoes oscillations caused by transitions between the two types occurring at the maximum speed.},

The density fluctuation excited at the sharp boundary region with a large pressure gradient does not propagate into the boundary region due to the blocking of turbulence spreading by the large second derivative of the pressure gradient. Once the magnetic fluctuation appears at the boundary, the density fluctuation begins to penetrate the edge stochastic layer and the second derivative of the pressure gradient also decreases. The increase of density fluctuation in this layer results in the broadening and reduction of the peak divertor heat load. It is demonstrated that magnetic fluctuation plays a key role in controlling the turbulence spreading at the boundary of plasma which contributes to the reduction of divertor heat load.},

  abstract     = {We show that the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of a light field can be thermalized in a nonlinear cylindrical multimode optical waveguide. We find that upon thermal equilibrium, the maximization of the optical entropy leads to a generalized Rayleigh-Jeans distribution that governs the power modal occupancies with respect to the discrete OAM charge numbers. This distribution is characterized by a temperature that is by nature different from that associated with the longitudinal electromagnetic momentum flow of the optical field. Counterintuitively and in contrast to previous results, we demonstrate that even under positive temperatures, the ground state of the fiber is not always the most populated in terms of power. Instead, because of OAM, the thermalization processes may favor higher-order modes. A new equation of state is derived along with an extended Euler equation resulting from the extensivity of the entropy itself. By monitoring the nonlinear interaction between two multimode optical wave fronts with opposite spins, we show that the exchange of angular momentum is dictated by the difference in OAM temperatures, in full accord with the second law of thermodynamics. The theoretical analysis presented here is corroborated by numerical simulations that take into account the complex nonlinear dynamics of hundreds of modes. Our results may pave the way toward high-power optical sources with controllable orbital angular momenta, and at a more fundamental level, they may open up opportunities in drawing parallels with other complex multimode nonlinear systems like rotating atomic clouds.},

It is found that all field modes involved in the high harmonic generation process are entangled, and upon performing a quantum operation, lead to the generation of high photon number optical cat states spanning from the far infrared to the extreme ultraviolet spectral region. This provides direct insights into the quantum mechanical properties of the optical field in the intense laser matter interaction.

In most laboratory realizations using this protocol, the Rydberg states are repelled by the trapping laser fields, requiring that the fields be turned off during gate operations. Here we create a quasi-two-level system in a regime of Rydberg excitation blockade for a mesoscopic Rb ensemble of several hundred atoms confined in a magic-wavelength optical lattice. We observe many-body Rabi oscillations between the ground and collective Rydberg state. In addition we use Ramsey interference techniques to obtain the light shifts of both the lower and upper states of the collective qubit. Whereas the coupling producing the Rabi oscillations is enhanced by a factor of N , there is no corresponding enhancement for the light shifts. We derive an effective two-level model which is in good agreement with our observations. Trapped Rydberg qubits and an effective two-level description are expected to have broad applicability for studies of quantum simulation and networking using collective encoding in ensembles of neutral atoms.},

In this Letter, we report the first measurement of J / ψ photoproduction off the deuteron in UPCs at the center-of-mass energy s NN = 200 GeV in d + Au collisions. The differential cross section as a function of momentum transfer − t is measured. In addition, data with a neutron tagged in the deuteron-going zero-degree calorimeter is investigated for the first time, which is found to be consistent with the expectation of incoherent diffractive scattering at low momentum transfer. Theoretical predictions based on the color glass condensate saturation model and the leading twist approximation nuclear shadowing model are compared with the data quantitatively. A better agreement with the saturation model has been observed. With the current measurement, the results are found to be directly sensitive to the gluon density distribution of the deuteron and the deuteron breakup process, which provides insights into the nuclear gluonic structure.},

This generalizes results previously only obtained for ( 0 + 1 )-dimensional comoving flows, notably Bjorken flow. We also demonstrate that the only known nontrivial case of a convergent hydrodynamic gradient expansion at the nonlinear level relies on Bjorken flow symmetries and becomes factorially divergent as soon as these are relaxed. Finally, we show that factorial divergence can be removed using a momentum space cutoff, which generalizes a result obtained earlier in the context of linear response.},

The corresponding gravitational amplitudes obtained via the double copy directly enter the computation of black-hole scattering and gravitational-wave emission. Our construction is based on finding a kinematic algebra for the numerators, which we relate to a quasishuffle Hopf algebra. The BCJ numerators thus obtained have a compact form and intriguing features: gauge invariance is manifest, locality is respected for massless exchange, and they contain poles corresponding to massive exchange. Counting the number of terms in a BCJ numerator for n − 2 gluons gives the Fubini numbers F n − 3 , reflecting the underlying quasishuffle Hopf algebra structure. Finally, by considering an appropriate factorization limit, the massive particles decouple, and we thus obtain a kinematic algebra and all tree-level BCJ numerators for D -dimensional pure Yang-Mills theory.},

In a homogeneous and axially symmetric two-flavor system, all angle modes evolve coherently, and we show that the nonlinear equations of motion are formally equivalent to those of a gyroscopic pendulum. Within this analogy, our main innovation is to identify the elusive characteristic of the lepton-number angle distribution that determines the depth of conversion with the “pendulum spin.” The latter is given by the real part of the eigenfrequency resulting from the linear normal-mode analysis of the neutrino system. This simple analogy allows one to predict the depth of flavor conversion without solving the nonlinear evolution equations. Our approach provides a novel diagnostic tool to explore the physics of nonlinear systems.},

Such results provide insight into what factors contribute to the stability of complex dynamical systems. In this Letter, we study the eigenvalue spectrum of an ensemble of random matrices with correlations between any pair of elements. To this end, we introduce an analytical method that maps the resolvent of the random matrix onto the response functions of a linear dynamical system. The response functions are then evaluated using a path integral formalism, enabling us to make deductions about the eigenvalue spectrum. Our central result is a simple, closed-form expression for the leading eigenvalue of a large random matrix with generalized correlations. This formula demonstrates that correlations between matrix elements that are not diagonally opposite, which are often neglected, can have a significant impact on stability.},

A particularly promising platform implementing quantum optimization algorithms are arrays of trapped neutral atoms, laser coupled to highly excited Rydberg states. However, encoding combinatorial optimization problems in atomic arrays is challenging due to limited interqubit connectivity of the native finite-range interactions. Here, we present a four-body Rydberg parity gate, enabling a direct and straightforward implementation of the parity architecture, a scalable architecture for encoding arbitrarily connected interaction graphs. Our gate relies on adiabatic laser pulses and is fully programmable by adjusting two hold times during operation. We numerically demonstrate implementations of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) for small-scale test problems. Variational optimization steps can be implemented with a constant number of system manipulations, paving the way for experimental investigations of QAOA beyond the reach of numerical simulations.},

However, short quantum coherence time and limited availability of quantum hardware resources in the NISQ hardware strongly restrain the capacity and expressiveness of VQEs. In this Letter, we introduce the variational quantum-neural hybrid eigensolver (VQNHE) in which the shallow-circuit quantum Ansatz can be further enhanced by classical post-processing with neural networks. We show that the VQNHE consistently and significantly outperforms the VQE in simulating ground-state energies of quantum spins and molecules given the same amount of quantum resources. More importantly, we demonstrate that, for arbitrary postprocessing neural functions, the VQNHE only incurs a polynomial overhead of processing time and represents the first scalable method to exponentially accelerate the VQE with nonunitary postprocessing that can be efficiently implemented in the NISQ era.},

In contrast to earlier proposals, we focus on simulating many-electron systems and inspect the competition between charge-density wave order, fermion pairing, and phase separation. In our numerical study, we employ a combination of complementary approaches, based on non-Gaussian variational ansatz states and matrix product states, respectively.

In particular, we consider a lattice model with broken time-reversal symmetry that exhibits both topologically trivial and nontrivial phases. Using a nonperturbative Green function approach, we characterize the nonequilibrium current distribution in different parameter regimes. For both bosonic and fermionic systems, we find chiral edge currents that are robust against coupling to reservoirs and to the presence of defects on the boundary or in the bulk. This robustness not only originates from topological effects at zero temperature but, remarkably, also persists as a result of dissipative symmetries in regimes where band topology plays no role. Chirality of the edge currents implies that energy locally flows against the temperature gradient without any external work input. In the fermionic case, there is also a regime with topologically protected boundary currents, which nonetheless do not circulate around all system edges.},

  abstract     = {Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering, a category of quantum nonlocal correlations describing the ability of one observer to influence another party’s state via local measurements, is different from both entanglement and Bell nonlocality by possessing an asymmetric property. For multipartite EPR steering, the monogamous situation, where two observers cannot simultaneously steer the state of the third party, has been investigated rigorously both in theory and experiment. In contrast to the monogamous situation, the shareability of EPR steering in reduced subsystems allows the state of one party to be steered by two or more observers and thus reveals more configurations of multipartite EPR steering. However, the experimental implementation of such a kind of shareability has still been absent until now. Here, in an optical experiment, we provide a proof-of-principle demonstration of the shareability of EPR steering without the constraint of monogamy in a three-qubit system. Moreover, based on the reduced bipartite EPR steering detection results, we verify the genuine three-qubit entanglement results. This work provides a complementary viewpoint for understanding multipartite EPR steering and has potential applications in many quantum information protocols, such as multipartite entanglement detection, quantum cryptography, and the construction of quantum networks.},

Electric polarization of over 100 μ C / m 2 is induced by the magnetic field owing to the second-order ME effect in the noncentrosymmetric transition metal complex [ Mn III (taa)]. This appearance of electric polarization does not require magnetic order in contrast to the linear ME effect in ME multiferroic materials. The value of the electric polarization is 1 order larger than that induced by the second-order ME effect, which originates from the p – d hybridization. Our calculation, taking into account the single-ion-type magnetic anisotropy originating from the spin-orbit interaction and ferrodistortive intermolecular interaction, verifies that the alignment of the JT distortion by the magnetic field results in the large electric polarization observed. Thus, our results provide a new method to gain strong ME coupling by tuning the atomic displacement using a magnetic field.},

  abstract     = {Nanodiamonds with embedded nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers have emerged as promising magnetic field sensors, as hyperpolarizing agents in biological environments, as well as efficient tools for spin mechanics with levitating particles. These applications currently suffer from random environmental interactions with the diamond which implies poor control of the N-V direction. Here, we predict and report on a strong diamagnetism of a pure spin origin mediated by a population inversion close to a level crossing in the NV center electronic ground state. We show control of the sign of the magnetic susceptibility as well as angle locking of the crystalline axis of a microdiamond along an external magnetic field, with bright perspectives for these applications.},

Importantly, interactions in our model are not only invariant under SU ( 2 ) symmetries of spin and charge like the Hubbard model, but they also preserve an Ising-like electron spin-charge flip symmetry. From unbiased fermion bag Monte Carlo simulations with up to 2304 sites, we show that the massive fermion phase spontaneously breaks this Ising symmetry, picking either antiferromagnetism or superconductivity, and that the transition at which both orders are simultaneously quantum critical belongs to a new “chiral spin-charge symmetric” universality class. We explain our observations using effective potential and renormalization group calculations within the framework of a continuum field theory.},

The transversal heat current of magnons caused by a thermal gradient is calculated for an antiferromagnet on a honeycomb lattice. An applied magnetic field drives the system from the antiferromagnetic phase via a spin-flop phase into the field-polarized phase. In addition to these magnetic phase transitions, we find topological phase transitions within the spin-flop phase. Both types of transitions manifest themselves in prominent and distinguishing features in the thermal conductivity, which changes by several orders of magnitude. The variation of temperature provides a tool to discern experimentally the two types of phase transitions. We include numerical results for the van der Waals magnet MnPS 3 .},

Here, we demonstrate this novel idea by exploiting a projective translation symmetry and constructing a variety of Möbius-twisted topological phases. Experimentally, we realize two Möbius insulators in acoustic crystals for the first time: a two-dimensional one of first-order band topology and a three-dimensional one of higher-order band topology. We observe unambiguously the peculiar Möbius edge and hinge states via real-space visualization of their localiztions, momentum-space spectroscopy of their 4 π periodicity, and phase-space winding of their projective translation eigenvalues. Not only does our work open a new avenue for artificial systems under the interplay between gauge and crystalline symmetries, but it also initializes a new framework for topological physics from projective symmetry.},

So far, we seem to have a complete theory of topological phases from internal symmetries as well as crystallographic symmetry groups. However, an intrinsic element, i.e., the gauge symmetry in physical systems, has been overlooked in the current framework. Here, we show that the algebraic structure of crystal symmetries can be projectively enriched due to the gauge symmetry, which subsequently gives rise to new topological physics never witnessed under ordinary symmetries. We demonstrate the idea by theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and experimental realization of a topological acoustic lattice with projective translation symmetries under a Z 2 gauge field, which exhibits unique features of rich topologies, including a single Dirac point, Möbius topological insulator, and graphenelike semimetal phases on a rectangular lattice. Our work reveals the impact when gauge and crystal symmetries meet together with topology and opens the door to a vast unexplored land of topological states by projective symmetries.},

We provide compelling theoretical evidence that the localization of a single quasiparticle of the fractional quantum Hall state at filling factor ν = n / ( 2 n + 1 ) has a striking quantitative correspondence to the localization of a single electron in the ( n + 1 )th Landau level. By analogy to the dramatic experimental manifestations of Anderson localization in integer quantum Hall effect, this leads to predictions in the fractional quantum Hall regime regarding the existence of extended states at a critical energy, and the nature of the divergence of the localization length as this energy is approached. Within a mean field approximation, these results can be extended to situations where a finite density of quasiparticles is present.},

  abstract     = {In condensed matter systems, the electronic degrees of freedom are often entangled to form complex composites, known as hidden orders, which give rise to unusual properties, while escaping detection in conventional experiments. Here we demonstrate the existence of hidden k -space magnetoelectric multipoles in nonmagnetic systems with broken space-inversion symmetry. These k -space magnetoelectric multipoles are reciprocal to the real-space charge dipoles associated with the broken inversion symmetry. Using the prototypical ferroelectric PbTiO 3 as an example, we show that their origin is a spin asymmetry in momentum space resulting from the broken space inversion symmetry associated with the ferroelectric polarization. In PbTiO 3 , the k -space spin asymmetry corresponds to a pure k -space magnetoelectric toroidal moment, which can be detected using magnetic Compton scattering, an established tool for probing magnetism in ferromagnets or ferrimagnets with a net spin polarization, which has not been exploited to date for nonmagnetic systems. In particular, the k -space magnetoelectric toroidal moment combined with the spin-orbit interaction manifest in an antisymmetric magnetic Compton profile that can be reversed using an electric field. Our work suggests an experimental route to directly measuring and tuning hidden k -space magnetoelectric multipoles via specially designed magnetic Compton scattering measurements.},

Following this trend, does a quantum system necessarily become “more chaotic” when quantum fluctuations are reduced? Moreover, how do symmetry breaking and associated nontrivial dynamics influence the interplay of quantum mechanics and chaos? We explore these questions by computing λ L ( ℏ , T ) in the quantum spherical p -spin glass model, where ℏ can be continuously varied. We find that quantum fluctuations, in general, make paramagnetic phase less and the replica symmetry-broken spin glass phase more chaotic. We show that the approach to the classical limit could be nontrivial, with nonmonotonic dependence of λ L on ℏ close to the dynamical glass transition temperature T d . Our results in the classical limit ( ℏ → 0 ) naturally describe chaos in supercooled liquid in structural glasses. We find a maximum in λ L ( T ) substantially above T d , concomitant with the crossover from simple to slow glassy relaxation. We further show that λ L ∼ T α , with the exponent α varying between 2 and 1 from quantum to classical limit, at low temperatures in the spin glass phase.},

The Hausdorff dimension of the fractal can be probed through correlation functions at finite temperature.

Simulations of poorly ionized plasmas confirm the rapid damping of the instability by proton-neutral collisions predicted by linear fluid theory calculations.

Additionally, these films permit angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements of the electronic structure, which are found to be in good agreement with theory.

By leveraging a new laboratory facility, particle pairs with small initial separations can be tracked over four decades of separation in time and five decades of separation in squared displacement, thereby observing the full range of dispersion scaling laws. The results show that the classical Richardson cubic scaling will be reached not for an initial separation asymptotically close to zero but at a critical value, and this value does not appear to depend on the Reynolds number, providing an effective way to study universal dispersion dynamics. Additionally, the results agree well with the prediction based on the multifractal model and may help reconcile different reported scaling laws from laboratory experiments and field studies.},

Here, by comparing with molecular-gas-dynamics simulations, we show that the Navier-Stokes equations do not describe turbulent gas flows in the dissipation range because they neglect thermal fluctuations. We investigate decaying turbulence produced by the Taylor-Green vortex and find that in the dissipation range the molecular-gas-dynamics spectra grow quadratically with wave number due to thermal fluctuations, in agreement with previous predictions, while the Navier-Stokes spectra decay exponentially. Furthermore, the transition to quadratic growth occurs at a length scale much larger than the gas molecular mean free path, namely in a regime that the Navier-Stokes equations are widely believed to describe. In fact, our results suggest that the Navier-Stokes equations are not guaranteed to describe the smallest scales of gas turbulence for any positive Knudsen number.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear Thouless pumps for bosons exhibit quantized pumping via soliton motion, despite the lack of a meaningful notion of filled bands. However, the theoretical underpinning of this quantization, as well as its relationship to the Chern number, has thus far been lacking. Here we show that, for low-power solitons, transport is dictated by the Chern number of the band from which the soliton bifurcates. We do this by expanding the discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation (equivalently, the Gross-Pitaevskii equation) in the basis of Wannier states, showing that a soliton’s position is dictated by that of the Wannier state throughout the pump cycle. Furthermore, we describe soliton pumping in two dimensions.},

Atomic arrays are well suited to store quantum information, and entanglement can be created using highly-excited Rydberg states. Typically, isolating pairs during gate operation is difficult because Rydberg interactions feature long tails at large distances. Here, we engineer distance-selective interactions that are strongly peaked in distance through off-resonant laser coupling of molecular potentials between Rydberg atom pairs. Employing quantum gas microscopy, we verify the dressed interactions by observing correlated phase evolution using many-body Ramsey interferometry. We identify atom loss and coupling to continuum modes as a limitation of our present scheme and outline paths to mitigate these effects, paving the way towards the creation of large-scale entanglement.},

  abstract     = {Subwavelength atomic arrays, recently labeled as quantum metamaterials, have emerged as an exciting platform for obtaining novel quantum optical phenomena. The strong interference effects in these systems generate subradiant excitations that propagate through the atomic array with very long lifetimes. Here, we demonstrate that one can harness these excitations to obtain tunable directional emission patterns and collective dissipative couplings when placing judiciously additional atoms nearby the atomic array. For doing that, we first characterize the optimal square array geometry to obtain directional emission patterns. Then, we characterize the best atomic positions to couple efficiently to the subradiant metasurface excitations and provide several improvement strategies based on entangled atomic clusters or bilayers. Afterward, we also show how the directionality of the emission pattern can be controlled through the relative dipole orientation between the auxiliary atoms and the one of the array. Finally, we benchmark how these directional emission patterns translate into to collective, anisotropic dissipative couplings between the auxiliary atoms by studying the lifetime modification of atomic entangled states.},

We show that the magnetic component of the light field plays an important role in nonsequential double ionization, which serves as a powerful tool to investigate electron correlation. We investigate the magnetic-field effects in double ionization of xenon atoms driven by near-infrared ultrashort femtosecond laser pulses and find that the mean forward shift of the electron momentum distribution in light-propagation direction agrees well with the classical prediction, where no under-barrier or recollisional nondipole enhancement is observed. By extending classical trajectory Monte Carlo simulations beyond the dipole approximation, we reveal that double ionization proceeds via recollision-induced doubly excited states, followed by subsequent sequential over-barrier field ionization of the two electrons. In agreement with this model, the binding energies do not lead to an additional nondipole forward shift of the electrons. Our findings provide a new method to study electron correlation by exploiting the effect of the magnetic component of the electromagnetic field.},

These sources can provide unparalleled measurements of the mass of the secondary object at a subpercent level for primordial black holes as light as O ( 0.01 ) M ⊙ up to luminosity distances around hundred megaparsec and few gigaparsec for LISA and Einstein Telescope, respectively, in a complementary frequency range.

  abstract     = {Recent work applying the notion of pseudospectrum to gravitational physics showed that the quasinormal mode spectrum of black holes is unstable, with the possible exception of the longest-lived (fundamental) mode. The fundamental mode dominates the expected signal in gravitational wave astronomy, and there is no reason why it should have privileged status. We compute the quasinormal mode spectrum of two model problems where the Schwarzschild potential is perturbed by a small “bump” consisting of either a Pöschl-Teller potential or a Gaussian, and we show that the fundamental mode is destabilized under generic perturbations. We present phase diagrams and study a simple double-barrier toy problem to clarify the conditions under which the spectral instability occurs.},

The LSD sensitivity has more favorable frequency scaling at high frequencies compared to laser interferometer detectors such as LIGO and VIRGO. We propose a method to substantially improve the sensitivity by optically levitating a multilayered stack of dielectric discs. These stacks allow the use of a more massive levitated object while exhibiting minimal photon recoil heating due to light scattering. Over an order of magnitude of unexplored frequency space for GWs above 10 kHz is accessible with an instrument 10 to 100 meters in size. Particularly motivated sources in this frequency range are gravitationally bound states of the axion from quantum chromodynamics with decay constant near the grand unified theory scale that form through black hole superradiance and annihilate to GWs. The LSD is also sensitive to GWs from binary coalescence of sub-solar-mass primordial black holes and as-yet unexplored new physics in the high-frequency GW window.},

The phase transition manifests itself as a cusp singularity in the probability distribution of the magnetization that forms at a critical time. The transition is due to a sudden switch in the dynamics, characterized by a dynamical order parameter. We derive a dynamical Landau theory for the transition that applies to a range of systems with scalar, parity-invariant order parameters. Close to criticalilty, our theory reveals an exact mapping between the dynamical and equilibrium phase transitions of the magnetic model, and implies critical exponents of mean-field type. We argue that interactions between nearby saddle points, neglected at the mean-field level, may lead to critical, spatiotemporal fluctuations of the order parameter, and thus give rise to novel, dynamical critical phenomena.},

We employ a trapped-ion quantum processor, where system qubits undergoing unitary evolution may optionally be coupled to an unobserved environment qubit, resulting in a heat leak. Evaluating the measurement data from the system qubits only, we show that global passivity can verify the presence of a heat leak, which is not detectable by a microscopic equivalent of the second law of thermodynamics. Furthermore, we experimentally show that passivity deformation allows for even more sensitive detection of heat leaks, as compared to global passivity, and detect a heat leak with an error margin of 5.3 standard deviations, in a scenario where other tests fail.},

In practice, however, the realization of device-independent QKD is technically challenging because of its low noise tolerance. In the photonic setup, due to the limited detection efficiency, a large amount of the data generates from no-detection events which contain few correlations but contribute high errors. Here, we propose the device-independent QKD protocol with random postselection, where the secret keys are extracted only from the postselected subset of outcomes. This could not open the detection loophole as long as the entropy of the postselected subset is evaluated from the information of the entire set of data, including both detection and no-detection events. This postselection has the advantage to significantly reduce the error events, thus relaxing the threshold of required detection efficiency. In the model of collective attacks, our protocol can tolerate detector efficiency as low as 68.5\%, which goes beyond standard security proofs. The results make a concrete step for the implementation of device-independent QKD in practice.},

  abstract     = {The difficulty in manipulating quantum resources deterministically often necessitates the use of probabilistic protocols, but the characterization of their capabilities and limitations has been lacking. We develop a general approach to this problem by introducing a new resource monotone that obeys a very strong type of monotonicity: it can rule out all transformations, probabilistic or deterministic, between states in any quantum resource theory. This allows us to place fundamental limitations on state transformations and restrict the advantages that probabilistic protocols can provide over deterministic ones, significantly strengthening previous findings and extending recent no-go theorems. We apply our results to obtain a substantial improvement in bounds for the errors and overheads of probabilistic distillation protocols, directly applicable to tasks such as entanglement or magic state distillation, and computable through convex optimization. In broad classes of resources, we strengthen our results to show that the monotone completely governs probabilistic transformations—it serves as a necessary and sufficient condition for state convertibility. This endows the monotone with a direct operational interpretation, as it can exactly quantify the highest fidelity achievable in resource distillation tasks by means of any probabilistic manipulation protocol.},

Some of these protected qubits (e.g., 0 − π qubit and Kerr-cat qubit) are stabilized by Hamiltonians which have (near-)degenerate ground state manifolds with large energy gaps to the excited state manifolds. Without dissipative stabilization mechanisms the performance of such energy-gap-protected qubits can be limited by leakage to excited states. Here, we propose a scheme for dissipatively stabilizing an energy-gap-protected qubit using colored (i.e., frequency-selective) dissipation without inducing errors in the ground state manifold. Concretely we apply our colored dissipation technique to Kerr-cat qubits and propose colored Kerr-cat qubits which are protected by an engineered colored single-photon loss. When applied to the Kerr-cat qubits our scheme significantly suppresses leakage-induced bit-flip errors (which we show are a limiting error mechanism) while only using linear interactions. Beyond the benefits to the Kerr-cat qubit we also show that our frequency-selective loss technique can be applied to a broader class of protected qubits.},

In principle, for an N -qubit quantum state, the runtime complexity of our proposal is O ( poly ( N ) T ) with T being the number of iterations. We experimentally implement our protocol on a linear optical network and exhibit its effectiveness to accomplish the bipartite entanglement detection for 5-qubit quantum pure states and 2-qubit quantum mixed states.

We use a superconducting transmon circuit coupled to an engineered environment to observe two different types of Liouvillian exceptional points that arise either from the interplay of energy loss and decoherence or purely due to decoherence. By dynamically tuning the Liouvillian superoperators in real time we observe a non-Hermiticity-induced chiral state transfer.

  abstract     = {In 1957 Feynman suggested that the quantum or classical character of gravity may be assessed by testing the gravitational interaction due to source masses in superposition. However, in all proposed experimental realizations using matter-wave interferometry, the extreme weakness of this interaction requires pure initial states with extreme squeezing to achieve measurable effects of nonclassical interaction for reasonable experiment durations. In practice, the systems that can be prepared in such nonclassical states are limited to small masses, which in turn limits the strength of their interaction. Here we address this key challenge—the weakness of gravitational interaction—by using a massive body as an amplifying mediator of gravitational interaction between two test systems. Our analysis shows that this results in an effective interaction between the two test systems that grows with the mass of the mediator, is independent of its initial state and, therefore, its temperature. This greatly reduces the requirement on the mass and degree of delocalization of the test systems and, while still highly challenging, brings experiments on gravitational source masses a step closer to reality.},

At intermediate temperatures 200–700 K, the process cannot be viewed as a two-step mechanism, often used to simplify and approximate collisions of three atoms or molecules. The developed theoretical approach is applied to the reaction O + O 2 + Ar because of extensive experimental data available. The rate coefficients for the formation of O 3 in ternary collisions O + O 2 + Ar without using two-step approximations were computed for the first time as a function of collision energy. Thermally averaged coefficients were derived for temperatures 5–900 K. It is found that the majority of O 3 molecules formed initially are weakly bound. Accounting for the process of vibrational quenching of the nascent population, a good agreement with available experimental data for temperatures 100–900 K is obtained.},

  abstract     = {When stretched, both DNA and RNA duplexes change their twist angles through twist-stretch coupling. The coupling is negative for DNA but positive for RNA, which is not yet completely understood. Here, our magnetic tweezers experiments show that the coupling of RNA reverses from positive to negative by multivalent cations. Combining with the previously reported tension-induced negative-to-positive coupling reversal of DNA, we propose a unified mechanism of the couplings of both RNA and DNA based on molecular dynamics simulations. Two deformation pathways are competing when stretched: shrinking the radius causes positive couplings but widening the major groove causes negative couplings. For RNA whose major groove is clamped by multivalent cations and canonical DNA, their radii shrink when stretched, thus exhibiting positive couplings. For elongated DNA whose radius already shrinks to the minimum and canonical RNA, their major grooves are widened when stretched, thus exhibiting negative couplings.},

The SAXS and WAXD results show the crystallization mechanism in which the crystalline nodules cover the entire sample with the formation of aggregation regions. The analysis of the SAXS results using Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami theory indicates that the formation kinetics of the aggregation regions is of three-dimensional homogeneous nucleation type. The analysis of the SAXS profiles using Sekimoto’s theory provides the growth velocity and the nucleation rate of the aggregation region. The temperature dependence of the growth velocity of the aggregation region is a natural extrapolation of that of spherulite to the high supercooling region. The temperature dependence of the nucleation rate of the aggregation region is also represented by the parameters of the spherulitic growth rate. The result of the growth velocities of the aggregation region and the spherulite suggests the existence of precursors at the front of the crystal growth.},

Our circuits can be built using local ingredients in Majorana devices, namely, charging-mediated interactions and braiding Majorana zero modes. This offers an analog-digital route to SYK quantum simulations that reconciles all-to-all interactions with the topological protection of Majorana zero modes, a key feature missing in existing proposals for analog SYK simulation.

In analogy to the Majorana zero mode (MZM) in topological superconductors, the interplay between SSC and band topology will also give rise to a specific kind of topological bound state obeying non-Abelian braiding statistics. Remarkably, the non-Abelian geometric phase here originates from the Aharonov-Casher effect of the “half-charge” other than the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Such topological bound state of SSC is bound with the vortex of electric flux gradient and can be experimentally more distinct than the MZM for being electrically charged.

With the interaction further screened by particle-hole excitations through one-loop quantum corrections, it has been believed that these marginal Fermi liquids (MFLs) are described by weakly coupled field theories at low energies. In this Letter, we point out a possibility in which higher-loop processes qualitatively change the picture through UV-IR mixing, in which the size of the FS enters as a relevant scale. The UV-IR mixing effect enhances the coupling at low energies, such that the basin of attraction for the weakly coupled fixed point of a ( 2 + 1 )-dimensional MFL shrinks to a measure-zero set in the low-energy limit. This UV-IR mixing is caused by gapless virtual Cooper pairs that spread over the entire FS through marginal long-range interactions. Our finding signals a possible breakdown of the patch description for the MFL and questions the validity of using the MFL as the base theory in a controlled scheme for non-Fermi liquids that arise from relevant long-range interactions.},

While the important role of many-body vdW interactions has been extensively documented for the stability of materials, much less is known about the coupling between vdW interactions and atomic forces. Here we analyze the Hessian force response matrix for a single and two vdW-coupled atomic chains to show that a many-body description of vdW interactions yields atomic force response magnitudes that exceed the expected pairwise decay by 3–5 orders of magnitude for a wide range of separations between perturbed and observed atoms. Similar findings are confirmed for carbon nanotubes, graphene, and delamination of graphene from a silicon substrate previously studied experimentally. This colossal force enhancement suggests implications for phonon spectra, free energies, interfacial adhesion, and collective dynamics in materials with many interacting atoms.},

  abstract     = {Materials once suffered at high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) conditions often exhibit exotic phenomena that defy conventional wisdom. The behaviors of sulfur dioxide ( SO 2 ), one of the archetypal simple molecules, at HPHT conditions have attracted a great deal of attention due to its relevance to the S cycle between deep Earth and the atmosphere. Here we report the discovery of an unexpected disproportionation of SO 2 via bond breaking into elemental S and sulfur trioxide ( SO 3 ) at HPHT conditions through a jointly experimental and theoretical study. Measured x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy data allow us to solve unambiguously the crystal structure (space group R 3 ¯ c ) of the resultant SO 3 phase that shows an extended framework structure formed by vertex-sharing octahedra SO 6 . Our findings lead to a significant extension of the phase diagram of SO 2 and suggest that SO 2 , despite its abundance in Earth’s atmosphere and ubiquity in other giant planets, is not a stable compound at HPHT conditions relevant to planetary interiors, providing important implications for elucidating the S chemistry in deep Earth and other giant planets.},

Strong interactions can lead to a blockade that prohibits the excitation of a collective resonance of two or more nearby atoms. However, a collective resonance can be excited with the presence of weak interaction and has been observed for atoms in the first excited state ( P state). Here, we report the observation of collective resonance of rubidium atoms in a higher excited state ( D state) in addition to the first excited state. The collective resonance is excited by a double-quantum four-pulse excitation sequence. The resulting double-quantum two-dimensional (2D) spectrum displays well-isolated peaks that can be attributed to collective resonances of atoms in P and D states. The experimental one-quantum and double-quantum 2D spectra can be reproduced by a simulation based on the perturbative solutions to the optical Bloch equations, confirming collective resonances as the origin of the measured spectra. The experimental technique provides a new approach for preparing and probing collective resonances of atoms in highly excited states.},

For bosonic atoms trapped in an optical lattice we show that, for any finite range of the cavity-mediated interaction, quantum self-bound droplets dominate the ground state phase diagram. Their size and in turn density is not externally fixed but rather emerges from the competition between local repulsion and finite-range cavity-mediated attraction. We identify two different regimes of the phase diagram. In the strongly glued regime, the interaction range exceeds the droplet size and the physics resembles the one of the standard Bose-Hubbard model in a (self-consistent) external potential, where in the phase diagram two incompressible droplet phases with different filling are separated by one with a superfluid core. In the opposite weakly glued regime, we find instead direct first order transitions between the two incompressible phases, as well as pronounced metastability. The cavity field leaking out of the mirrors can be measured to distinguish between the various types of droplets.},

The soft drop grooming algorithm provides access to the hard parton splittings inside a jet by removing soft wide-angle radiation. We report the groomed jet momentum splitting fraction, z g , and the (scaled) groomed jet radius, θ g . Charged-particle jets are reconstructed at midrapidity using the anti- k T algorithm with resolution parameters R = 0.2 and R = 0.4 . In heavy-ion collisions, the large underlying event poses a challenge for the reconstruction of groomed jet observables, since fluctuations in the background can cause groomed parton splittings to be misidentified. By using strong grooming conditions to reduce this background, we report these observables fully corrected for detector effects and background fluctuations for the first time. A narrowing of the θ g distribution in Pb − Pb collisions compared to p p collisions is seen, which provides direct evidence of the modification of the angular structure of jets in the quark-gluon plasma. No significant modification of the z g distribution in Pb − Pb collisions compared to p p collisions is observed. These results are compared with a variety of theoretical models of jet quenching, and provide constraints on jet energy-loss mechanisms and coherence effects in the quark-gluon plasma.},

A comprehensive exploration of the GW frequency spectrum is essential to fully harness this potential. Remarkably, current methods have left the μ Hz frequency band almost untouched. Here, we show that this μ Hz gap can be filled by searching for deviations in the orbits of binary systems caused by their resonant interaction with GWs. In particular, we show that laser ranging of the Moon and artificial satellites around the Earth, as well as timing of binary pulsars, may discover the first GW signals in this band, or otherwise set stringent new constraints. To illustrate the discovery potential of these binary resonance searches, we consider the GW signal from a cosmological first-order phase transition, showing that our methods will probe models of the early Universe that are inaccessible to any other near-future GW mission. We also discuss how our methods can shed light on the possible GW signal detected by NANOGrav, either constraining its spectral properties or even giving an independent confirmation.},

While the constraining power of GW170817 is limited, we show that even twenty coalescences detected by LIGO-Virgo at design sensitivity are not enough to discriminate between EOS with similar softness but distinct microphysics. However, just a single detection with a third-generation detector such as the Einstein Telescope or Cosmic Explorer will rule out several families of EOS with very strong statistical significance and can discriminate among models which feature similar softness, hence, constraining the properties of nuclear matter to unprecedented levels.},

The out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) is a standard measure of irreversibility, quantum scrambling, and the arrow of time. The question may be thus formulated more precisely and conveniently: can spatially ordered perpetual OTOC oscillations exist in many-body systems? Here we give a rigorous lower bound on the amplitude of OTOC oscillations in terms of a strictly local dynamical algebra allowing for identification of systems that are out-of-time-ordered (OTO) crystals. While OTOC oscillations are possible for few-body systems, due to the spatial order requirement OTO crystals cannot be achieved by effective single or few body dynamics, e.g., a pendulum or a condensate. Rather they signal perpetual motion of quantum scrambling. It is likewise shown that if a Hamiltonian satisfies this novel algebra, it has an exponentially large number of local invariant subspaces, i.e., Hilbert space fragmentation. Crucially, the algebra, and hence the OTO crystal, are stable to local unitary and dissipative perturbations. A Creutz ladder is shown to be an OTO crystal, which thus perpetually reverses its arrow of time.},

In particular, ultracold Fermi gases with tunable interactions have allowed to realize the famous BEC-BCS crossover from a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of molecules to a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluid of weakly bound Cooper pairs. However, large parts of the excitation spectrum of fermionic superfluids in the BEC-BCS crossover are still unexplored. In this work, we use Bragg spectroscopy to measure the full momentum-resolved low-energy excitation spectrum of strongly interacting ultracold Fermi gases. This enables us to directly observe the smooth transformation from a bosonic to a fermionic superfluid that takes place in the BEC-BCS crossover. We also use our spectra to determine the evolution of the superfluid gap and find excellent agreement with previous experiments and self-consistent T -matrix calculations both in the BEC and crossover regime. However, toward the BCS regime a calculation that includes the effects of particle-hole correlations shows better agreement with our data.},

Most real-world networks are under the influence of noisy, random inputs, potentially inhibiting synchronization. While noise is unavoidable, here we show that there exist optimal noise patterns which minimize desynchronizing effects and even enhance order. Specifically, using analytical arguments we show that in the case of a two-oscillator model, there exists a sharp transition from a regime where the optimal synchrony-enhancing noise is perfectly anticorrelated, to one where the optimal noise is correlated. More generally, we then use numerical optimization methods to demonstrate that there exist anticorrelated noise patterns that optimally enhance synchronization in large complex oscillator networks. Our results may have implications in networks such as power grids and neuronal networks, which are subject to significant amounts of correlated input noise.},

These behaviors stem from a unique microstructure in combination with a transition from glassy to rubbery as a result of humidity-driven diffusion of water. In this Letter we propose four length scales that govern the mechanical response of the silk during this transition. In addition, we develop a model that describes the microstructural evolution of the spider silk thread and explains the response due to the diffusion of water molecules. The merit of the model is demonstrated through an excellent agreement to experimental findings. The insights from this Letter can be used as a microstructural design guide to enable the development of new materials with unique spiderlike properties.},

We study the conductivity of ionic solutions using a stochastic density functional theory, paired with a modified Coulomb interaction that accounts for the hard-core repulsion between the ions. The modified potential suppresses unphysical, short-range electrostatic interactions, which are present in the Debye-Hückel-Onsager theory. Our results for the conductivity show very good agreement with experimental data up to 3 molars, without any fit parameters. We provide a compact expression for the conductivity, accompanied by a simple analytical approximation.},

In the absence of memory, the SSH circuit supports a symmetry-protected topological edge state. Memory induces nonlinearities that break chiral symmetry explicitly and spread the state across the circuit. However, the resulting state is still protected against perturbations by the ensuing custodial chiral symmetry. These predictions can be verified experimentally and demonstrate the interplay between symmetry and memory.},

While initially studied in superconducting and normal metals, recently, atomic persistent currents have been generated in ultracold gases spurring a new wave of theoretical investigations. Nevertheless, our understanding of the persistent currents in interacting systems is far from complete, especially at finite temperatures. Here we consider the fermionic one-dimensional Hubbard model and show that in the strong-interacting limit, the current can change its flux period and sign (diamagnetic or paramagnetic) as a function of temperature, features that cannot be explained within the single-particle or Luttinger liquid techniques. Also, the magnitude of the current can counterintuitively increase with temperature, in addition to presenting different rates of decay depending on the polarization of the system. Our work highlights the properties of the strongly interacting multicomponent systems that are missed by conventional approximation techniques, but can be important for the interpretation of experiments on persistent currents in ultracold gases.},

  abstract     = {For solids, the dispersionless flat band has long been recognized as an ideal platform for achieving intriguing quantum phases. However, experimental progress in revealing flat-band physics has so far been achieved mainly in artificially engineered systems represented as magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of flat-band-dominated anomalous transport and magnetic behaviors in CoSn, a paramagnetic kagome-lattice compound. By combination of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements and first-principles calculations, we reveal the existence of a kagome-lattice-derived flat band right around the Fermi level. Strikingly, the resistivity within the kagome lattice plane is more than one order of magnitude larger than the interplane one, in sharp contrast with conventional (quasi-) two-dimensional layered materials. Moreover, the magnetic susceptibility under the out-of-plane magnetic field is found to be much smaller as compared with the in-plane case, which is revealed to be arising from the introduction of a unique orbital diamagnetism. Systematic analyses reveal that these anomalous and giant anisotropies can be reasonably attributed to the unique properties of flat-band electrons, including large effective mass and self-localization of wave functions. Our results broaden the already fascinating flat-band physics, and demonstrate the feasibility of exploring them in natural solid-state materials in addition to artificial ones.},

Remarkably, in the universal region, where characteristic length scales are larger than the rather small Ginzburg scale ∼ 10 nm , these materials possess an infinite set of flat phases. These phases corresponds to a stable line of fixed points and are connected by an emergent continuous symmetry. This symmetry enforces power law scaling with momentum of the anisotropic bending rigidity and Young’s modulus, controlled by a single universal exponent—the very same along the whole line of fixed points. These anisotropic flat phases are uniquely labeled by the ratio of absolute Poisson’s ratios. We apply our theory to phosphorene.},

Thus, experimental changes in thermally activated reaction kinetics due to polariton formation appear entropically unlikely and remain a puzzle. Here we show that the overlooked dark modes, while parked at the same energy as bare molecular vibrations, are robustly delocalized across ∼ 2 – 3 molecules, yielding enhanced channels of vibrational cooling, concomitantly catalyzing a chemical reaction. As an illustration, we theoretically show an ≈ 50\% increase in an electron transfer rate due to enhanced product stabilization. The reported effects can arise when the homogeneous linewidths of the dark modes are smaller than their energy spacings.},

In addition, we find that the sublattice sum of the nonadiabatic Born effective charges does not vanish as it does in the insulating case, but instead is proportional to the Drude weight.

  abstract     = {Coupling of charge and lattice degrees of freedom in materials can produce intriguing electronic phenomena, such as conventional superconductivity where the electrons are mediated by lattice for creating supercurrent. The Mott transition, which is a source for many fascinating emergent behaviors, is originally thought to be driven solely by correlated electrons with an Ising criticality. Recent studies on the known Mott systems have shown that the lattice degree of freedom is also at play, giving rise to either Landau or unconventional criticality. However, the underlying coupling mechanism of charge and lattice degrees of freedom around the Mott critical end point remains elusive, leading to difficulties in understanding the associated Mott physics. Here, we report a study of Mott transition in cubic PbCrO 3 by measuring the lattice parameter, using high-pressure x-ray diffraction techniques. The Mott criticality in this material is revealed with large lattice anomalies, which is governed by giant viscoelasticity that presumably results from a combination of lattice elasticity and electron viscosity. Because of the viscoelastic effect, the lattice of this material behaves peculiarly near the critical end point, inconsistent with any existing university classes. We argue that the viscoelasticity may play as a hidden degree of freedom behind the Mott criticality.},

A spatially homogeneous medium is endowed with a time structure composed of randomly distributed temporal interfaces. This is achieved through electrostriction between water surface and an electrode. The wave field observed is the result of the interferences between reflected and refracted waves on the interfaces. Although no eigenmode can be associated with the wave field, several common features between space and time emerge. The waves grow exponentially depending on the disorder level in agreement with a 2D matrix evolution model such as in the spatial case. The relative position of the momentum gap appearing in the time modulated systems plays a central role in the wave field evolution. When tuning the excitation to compensate for the damping, transient waves, localized in time, appear on the liquid surface. They result from a particular history of the multiple interferences produced by a specific sequence of time boundaries.},

Using molecular and overdamped Brownian dynamics many-body simulations, we demonstrate that analogous viscous effects act on the acceleration field. This acceleration viscous behavior is associated with the divergence and the curl of the acceleration field, and it can be quantitatively described using simple exponentially decaying memory kernels.

  abstract     = {Both solids and gases have been demonstrated as the materials for terahertz (THz) coherent detection. The gas-based coherent detection methods require a high-energy probe laser beam and the detection bandwidth is limited in the solid-based methods. Whether liquids can be used for THz detection and relax these problems has not yet been reported, which becomes a timely and interesting topic due to the recent observation of efficient THz wave generation in liquids. Here, we propose a THz coherent detection scheme based on liquid water. When a THz pulse and a fundamental laser beam are mixed on a free-flowing water film, a second harmonic (SH) beam is generated as the plasma is formed. Combining this THz-induced SH beam with a control SH beam, we successfully achieve the time-resolved waveform of the THz field with the frequency range of 0.1–18 THz. The required probe laser energy is as low as a few microjoules. The sensitivity of our scheme is 1 order of magnitude higher than that of the air-based method under comparable detection conditions. The scheme is sensitive to the THz polarization and the phase difference between the fundamental and control SH beams, which brings direct routes for optimization and polarization sensitive detection. Energy scaling and polarization properties of the THz-induced beam indicate that its generation can be attributed to a four-wave mixing process. This generation mechanism makes simple relationships among the probe laser, THz-induced SH, and THz field, favorable for robustness and flexibility of the detection device.},

Edge solitons are observed in a broad power range where their propagation constant falls into one of the topological gaps of the system, while partial delocalization is observed when considerable nonlinearity drives the propagation constant into an allowed band, causing coupling with bulk modes. Our results provide direct experimental evidence of the coexistence and selective excitation in the same or in different topological gaps of two types of topological edge solitons with different internal structures, which can rarely be observed even in nontopological systems. This also constitutes the first experimental evidence of formation of topological solitons in a nonlinear system with more than one topological gap.},

Quantum-optical simulations and experiments are in good agreement and show that the scheme provides significant advantages over previously demonstrated excitation methods. The two-photon excitation of the biexciton suppresses re-excitation and enables ultralow multiphoton errors, while the precisely timed stimulation pulse results in very low timing jitter of the photons, and consequently, high indistinguishability. In addition, the polarization of the stimulation pulse allows us to deterministically program the polarization of the emitted photon ( H or V ). This ensures that all emission of interest occurs in the polarization of the detection channel, resulting in higher brightness than cross-polarized resonant excitation.},

In this Letter, we show that free-fermion states generally appear whenever the band of singly excited states has a quadratic dispersion relation at the band edge and, hence, may also be obtained with radiant and even superradiant states. 1D arrays have free-fermion multiply excited eigenstates that are typically either subradiant or (super)radiant, and we show that a simple transformation acts between the two families.

The spatial dimension of the system from 1D to 2D is tuned by designing the intensity profile of the driving field. We investigate the emergence of criticality by increasing the spatial size of the driven region. The system is nonlinear due to polariton-polariton interactions and the boundary conditions are diffusive because the polaritons can freely diffuse out of the driven region. We show that no phase transition occurs using a 1D driving geometry, while for a 2D geometry we do observe both in theory and experiments the emergence of a first-order phase transition.

We show that the kinetic energy of the Rb + fragment ions can be used to identify dimers formed in either the X Σ g + 1 ground state or in the lowest-lying triplet state, a Σ u + 3 . From the experiment, we estimate the abundance ratio of dimers in the a and X states as a function of the mean droplet size and find values between 4 ∶ 1 and 5 ∶ 1 . Our technique applies generally to dimers and trimers of alkali atoms, here also demonstrated for Li 2 , Na 2 , and K 2 , and will enable femtosecond time-resolved measurements of their rotational and vibrational dynamics, possibly with atomic structural resolution.},

We apply it to atoms in a single 2D pancake or arrays of pancakes featuring an effective Λ level structure (one excited and two degenerate ground states). We identify a parameter window in which a factor of 2 extension in the atomic lifetime clearly attributable to Pauli blocking should be experimentally observable in deeply degenerate gases with ∼ 10 3 atoms.

  abstract     = {The chiral magnetic effect (CME) refers to charge separation along a strong magnetic field due to imbalanced chirality of quarks in local parity and charge-parity violating domains in quantum chromodynamics. The experimental measurement of the charge separation is made difficult by the presence of a major background from elliptic azimuthal anisotropy. This background and the CME signal have different sensitivities to the spectator and participant planes, and could thus be determined by measurements with respect to these planes. We report such measurements in Au + Au collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 200 GeV at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider. It is found that the charge separation, with the flow background removed, is consistent with zero in peripheral (large impact parameter) collisions. Some indication of finite CME signals is seen in midcentral (intermediate impact parameter) collisions. Significant residual background effects may, however, still be present.},

The measurement is achieved using a novel technique that correlates individual photon hits of events to the known position of the Sun. In an energy window between 0.54 to 0.74 MeV, selected using the dominant scintillation light, we have measured 10 887 − 2103 + 2386 ( stat ) ± 947 ( syst ) (68\% confidence interval) solar neutrinos out of 19 904 total events.

The no-neutrino hypothesis can be excluded with &gt; 5 σ confidence level. For the first time, we have demonstrated the possibility of utilizing the directional Cherenkov information for sub-MeV solar neutrinos, in a large-scale, high light yield liquid scintillator detector.

Our analytical treatment, based on techniques from Gaussian quantum information, provides a simple and efficient model to describe all aspects of the out-state, including the entanglement between any bipartition. We complement the study with a numerical analysis and apply our tools to investigate the influence that ambient thermal noise and detector inefficiencies have on the out-state. We find that aspects of the Hawking effect that are of quantum origin, i.e., quantum entanglement, are extremely fragile to the influence of inefficiencies and noise. We propose a protocol to amplify and observe these quantum aspects, based on seeding the process with a single-mode squeezed input, opening the door to new possibilities for experimental verification of the Hawking effect.},

The normalizable numerical solutions found therein require a peculiar behavior at the throat: the mirror symmetry relatively the throat leads to the nonsmoothness of gravitational and matter fields. In particular, one must postulate changing of the sign of the fermionic charge density at the throat, requiring coexistence of particle and antiparticles without annihilation and posing a membrane of matter at the throat with specific properties. Apparently this kind of configuration could not exist in nature. We show that there are wormhole solutions, which are asymmetric relative the throat and endowed by smooth gravitational and matter fields, thereby being free from all the above problems. This indicates that such wormhole configurations could also be supported in a realistic scenario.},

Then, we considered the late inspiral and merger of binary neutron stars. We found that screening tends to suppress the (subdominant) dipole scalar emission, but not the (dominant) quadrupole scalar mode. Our results point at quadrupole scalar signals as large as (or even larger than) in Fierz-Jordan-Brans-Dicke theories with the same conformal coupling, for strong-coupling scales in the MeV range that we can simulate.},

The axions are produced within the NS cores from nucleon bremsstrahlung and, when the nucleons are in superfluid states, Cooper pair breaking and formation processes. We show that four of the nearby isolated magnificent seven NSs along with PSR J0659 are prime candidates for axion cooling studies because they are coeval, with ages of a few hundred thousand years known from kinematic considerations, and they have well-measured surface luminosities. We compare these data to dedicated NS cooling simulations incorporating axions, profiling over uncertainties related to the equation of state, NS masses, surface compositions, and superfluidity. Our calculations of the axion and neutrino emissivities include high-density suppression factors that also affect SN 1987A and previous NS cooling limits on axions. We find no evidence for axions in the isolated NS data, and within the context of the Kim-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov QCD axion model, we constrain m a ≲ 16 meV at 95\% confidence level. An improved understanding of NS cooling and nucleon superfluidity could further improve these limits or lead to the discovery of the axion at weaker couplings.},

We take a fundamentally new approach to this promising tool of polarimetric very long baseline interferometry, using ideas from the geometric phase and gauge theories. The multiplicative distortion of polarized signals at the individual elements are represented as gauge transformations by general 2 × 2 complex matrices, so the closure traces now appear as gauge-invariant quantities. We apply this formalism to polarimetric interferometry and generalize it to any number of interferometer elements. Our approach goes beyond existing studies in the following respects: (1) we use triangular combinations of correlations as basic building blocks of invariants, (2) we use well-known symmetry properties of the Lorentz group to transparently identify a complete and independent set of invariants, and (3) we do not need autocorrelations, which are susceptible to large systematic biases, and therefore unreliable. This set contains all the information, immune to corruption, available in the interferometer measurements, thus providing important robust constraints for interferometric studies.},

  abstract     = {Recent work has shown the effectiveness of tensor network methods for computing large deviation functions in constrained stochastic models in the infinite time limit. Here we show that these methods can also be used to study the statistics of dynamical observables at arbitrary finite time. This is a harder problem because, in contrast to the infinite time case, where only the extremal eigenstate of a tilted Markov generator is relevant, for finite time the whole spectrum plays a role. We show that finite time dynamical partition sums can be computed efficiently and accurately in one dimension using matrix product states and describe how to use such results to generate rare event trajectories on demand. We apply our methods to the Fredrickson-Andersen and East kinetically constrained models and to the symmetric simple exclusion process, unveiling dynamical phase diagrams in terms of counting field and trajectory time. We also discuss extensions of this method to higher dimensions.},

  abstract     = {We investigate dynamical fluctuations of transferred magnetization in the one-dimensional lattice Landau-Lifshitz magnet with uniaxial anisotropy, representing an emblematic model of interacting spins. We demonstrate that the structure of fluctuations in thermal equilibrium depends radically on the characteristic dynamical scale. In the ballistic regime, typical fluctuations are found to follow a normal distribution and scaled cumulants are finite. In stark contrast, on the diffusive and superdiffusive timescales, relevant, respectively, for the easy-axis and isotropic magnet at vanishing total magnetization, typical fluctuations are no longer Gaussian and, remarkably, scaled cumulants are divergent. The observed anomalous features disappear upon breaking integrability, suggesting that the absence of normal fluctuations is intimately tied to the presence of soliton modes. In a nonequilibrium setting of the isotropic magnet with weakly polarized step-profile initial state we find a slow drift of dynamical exponent from the superdiffusive towards the diffusive value.},

  abstract     = {Entanglement entropy (EE) contains signatures of many universal properties of conformal field theories (CFTs), especially in the presence of boundaries or defects. In particular, topological defects are interesting since they reflect internal symmetries of the CFT and have been extensively analyzed with field-theoretic techniques with striking predictions. So far, however, no lattice computation of EE has been available. Here, we present an ab initio analysis of EE for the Ising model in the presence of a topological defect. While the behavior of the EE depends, as expected, on the geometric arrangement of the subsystem with respect to the defect, we find that zero-energy modes give rise to crucial finite-size corrections. Importantly, contrary to the field-theory predictions, the universal subleading term in the EE when the defect lies at the edge of the subsystem arises entirely due to these zero-energy modes and is not directly related to the modular S matrix of the Ising CFT.},

Although quantum coherence in the quantum system of the working medium has been investigated to play a nontrivial role, a complete understanding of the intrinsic quantum advantage of quantum heat engines remains elusive. We experimentally demonstrate that the quantum correlation between the working medium and the thermal bath is critical for the quantum advantage of a quantum Szilárd engine, where quantum coherence in the working medium is naturally excluded. By quantifying the nonclassical correlation through quantum steering, we reveal that the heat engine is quantum when the demon can truly steer the working medium. The average work obtained by taking different ways of work extraction on the working medium can be used to verify the real quantum Szilárd engine.},

The actual shape of the photonic wave packet as well as possible temporal and spectral correlations between the photons play a critical role in successful scalable computation. Currently, unentangled indistinguishable photons are considered a suitable resource for scalable photonic circuits. Here we show that using so-called coherent photon conversion, it is possible to construct flying-qubit gates which are not only insensitive to wave shapes of the photons and temporal and spectral correlations between them but which also fully preserve these wave shapes and correlations upon the processing. This allows the use of photons with correlations and purity in a very broad range for a scalable computation. Moreover, such gates can process entangled photonic wave packets even more effectively than unentangled ones.},

Rooted in the dimensionality of their extended Hilbert spaces, the high computational complexity of simulating open quantum systems calls for the development of strategies to approximate their dynamics. In this Letter, we present an approach for tackling open quantum system dynamics. Using an exact probabilistic formulation of quantum physics based on positive operator-valued measure, we compactly represent quantum states with autoregressive neural networks; such networks bring significant algorithmic flexibility due to efficient exact sampling and tractable density. We further introduce the concept of string states to partially restore the symmetry of the autoregressive neural network and improve the description of local correlations. Efficient algorithms have been developed to simulate the dynamics of the Liouvillian superoperator using a forward-backward trapezoid method and find the steady state via a variational formulation. Our approach is benchmarked on prototypical one-dimensional and two-dimensional systems, finding results which closely track the exact solution and achieve higher accuracy than alternative approaches based on using Markov chain Monte Carlo method to sample restricted Boltzmann machines. Our Letter provides general methods for understanding quantum dynamics in various contexts, as well as techniques for solving high-dimensional probabilistic differential equations in classical setups.},

However, the signal suffers from both systematic errors, such as a limited time resolution and noise from the measurement apparatus, as well as statistical errors due to a limited amount of data. Here we demonstrate that an evaluation scheme based on factorial cumulants can reduce the influence of such errors by orders of magnitude. The error resilience is supported by a general theory for the detection errors as well as experimental data of single-electron tunneling through a self-assembled quantum dot. Thus, factorial cumulants push the limits in the analysis of random telegraph data, which represent a wide class of experiments in physics, chemistry, engineering, and life sciences.},

This ignores, however, the impact of phonons on the polariton energy structure. Here we establish and quantify the threefold coupling between excitons, cavity photons, and phonons. For this purpose, we employ energy-momentum-resolved photoluminescence and spatially resolved coherent two-dimensional spectroscopy to investigate the spectral properties of a high-quality-factor microcavity with an embedded WSe 2 van der Waals heterostructure at room temperature.

Using large-scale auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, we locate two zero-temperature phase transitions as function of increasing interaction strength. First, we observe a continuous transition from the weakly interacting semimetal to a different semimetallic phase in which the SO(3) symmetry is spontaneously broken and where two out of three Dirac cones acquire a mass gap. The associated quantum critical point can be understood in terms of a Gross-Neveu-SO(3) theory. Second, we subsequently observe a transition toward an insulating phase in which the SO(3) symmetry is restored and the U(1) symmetry is spontaneously broken. While strongly first order at the mean-field level, the QMC data are consistent with a direct and continuous transition. It is thus a candidate for a new type of deconfined quantum critical point that features gapless fermionic degrees of freedom.},

  abstract     = {Flat-band superconductivity has theoretically demonstrated the importance of band topology to correlated phases. In two dimensions, the superfluid weight, which determines the critical temperature through the Berezinksii-Kosterlitz-Thouless criteria, is bounded by the Fubini-Study metric at zero temperature. We show this bound is nonzero within flat bands whose Wannier centers are obstructed from the atoms—even when they have identically zero Berry curvature. Next, we derive general lower bounds for the superfluid weight in terms of momentum space irreps in all 2D space groups, extending the reach of topological quantum chemistry to superconducting states. We find that the bounds can be naturally expressed using the formalism of real space invariants (RSIs) that highlight the separation between electronic and atomic degrees of freedom. Finally, using exact Monte Carlo simulations on a model with perfectly flat bands and strictly local obstructed Wannier functions, we find that an attractive Hubbard interaction results in superconductivity as predicted by the RSI bound beyond mean field. Hence, obstructed bands are distinguished from trivial bands in the presence of interactions by the nonzero lower bound imposed on their superfluid weight.},

Here, we demonstrate, using the two-particle self-consistent theory, that in the antinodal region the Fermi liquid remains stable for a broad range of angles on the Fermi surface and for all dopings near the QCP. We show how the quasiparticle weight Z and effective mass m * change and then abruptly become meaningless as the hot spots are approached. We propose a dimensionless number, easily accessible in ARPES experiments, that can be used to gauge the strength of correlations.},

To shed a light on this problem, we report the theoretical reproduction of the debated 1 b 1 peaks observed in the XES spectra of liquid water using semiclassical Kramers-Heisenberg formula. The essence of the temperature and isotope dependence of the 1 b 1 double peaks is explained by molecular dynamics simulations including full vibrational ( O ─ H stretching, bending, and) modes, rotational combined with the density functional theory and core-hole induced dynamics. Some inconsistencies exist with the experimental XES profile, which illustrates the need to employ a more precise theoretical calculations for both geometry sampling and electronic structure using a more sophisticated procedure.},

Rationalizing individual influences of electrode atoms to the capacitance is possible by interpreting distinct elements of the charge-charge covariance matrix derived from individual charge variations of the electrode atoms. An ionic liquid solvated in acetonitrile and confined between two electrodes, each consisting of three undulated graphene layers, serves as a demonstrator to illustrate pronounced and nontrivial features of the capacitance with respect to the electrode curvature. In addition, the applied voltage determines whether a convex or concave surface contributes to increased capacitance. While at lower voltages capacitance variations are in general correlated with ion number density variations in the double layer formed in the concave region of the electrode, for certain electrode designs a surprisingly strong contribution of the convex part to the differential capacitance is found both at higher and lower voltages.},

But the benefit is low for Si at room temperature, amounting to only ∼ 10\% higher κ for bulk Si 2 8 than for bulk natural Si ( Si nat ). We show that in stark contrast to this bulk behavior, Si 2 8 (99.92\% enriched) nanowires have up to 150\% higher κ than Si nat nanowires with similar diameters and surface morphology. Using a first-principles phonon dispersion model, this giant isotope effect is attributed to a mutual enhancement of isotope scattering and surface scattering of phonons in Si nat nanowires, correlated via transmission of phonons to the native amorphous SiO 2 shell. The Letter discovers the strongest isotope effect of κ at room temperature among all materials reported to date and inspires potential applications of isotopically enriched semiconductors in microelectronics.},

An intrinsic current is observed to be modulated by turbulence driven by the electron temperature gradient. This turbulent current is generated in the countercurrent direction and can reach a maximum ratio of 25\% of the bootstrap current. Gyrokinetic simulations and experimental observations indicate that the turbulence is the electron temperature gradient mode (ETG). The dominant mechanism for the turbulent current generation is due to the divergence of ETG-driven residual flux of current. Good agreement has been found between experiments and theory for the critical value of the electron temperature gradient triggering ETG and for the level of the turbulent current. The maximum values of turbulent current and electron temperature gradient lead to the destabilization of an m / n = 1 / 1 kink mode, which by counteraction reduces the turbulence level ( m and n are the poloidal and toroidal mode number, respectively). These observations suggest that the self-regulation system including turbulence, turbulent current, and kink mode is a contributing mechanism for sustaining the steady-state long-pulse high- β θ e regime.},

Here the Bohm criterion analysis is performed in the intermediate plasma regime away from the previously known limiting cases of adiabatic laws and the asymptotic limit of infinitesimal Debye length in a finite-size system, using the transport equations of an anisotropic plasma. The resulting Bohm speed has explicit dependence on local plasma heat flux, temperature isotropization, and thermal force.

We then show that, in a broad aspect ratio range ( 1 / 32 ) ≤ Γ ≤ 32 , the rescaling Ra → Ra ℓ ≡ Ra [ Γ 2 / ( C + Γ 2 ) ] 3 / 2 collapses various OB numerical and almost-OB experimental heat transport data Nu ( Ra , Γ ) . Our findings predict the Γ dependence of the onset of the ultimate regime Ra u , Γ ∼ [ Γ 2 / ( C + Γ 2 ) ] − 3 / 2 in the OB case. This prediction is consistent with almost-OB experimental results (which only exist for Γ = 1 , 1 / 2 , and 1 / 3 ) for the transition in OB RB convection and explains why, in small- Γ cells, much larger Ra (namely, by a factor Γ − 3 ) must be achieved to observe the ultimate regime.},

In the current detectors, quantum noise is successfully reduced by the injection of squeezed vacuum states. The operation in a higher-order mode would then require the efficient generation of squeezed vacuum states in this mode to maintain a high quantum noise reduction. In our setup, we generate continuous-wave squeezed states at a wavelength of 1064 nm in the fundamental and three higher-order Hermite-Gaussian modes up to a mode order of 6 using a type-I optical parametric amplifier.

For the first time, we hereby observe quantum interference between flying photons and a single quantum of stored atomic coherence (magnon) in an atom-light beam splitter interface. We demonstrate that the Hermiticity of this interface determines the type of quantum interference between photons and magnons. Consequently, not only the bunching behavior that characterizes bosons is observed, but counterintuitively, fermionlike antibunching as well. The hybrid nature of the demonstrated magnon-photon quantum interface can be applied to versatile quantum memory platforms, and can lead to fundamentally different photon distributions from those occurring in boson sampling.},

Based on this chiral interresonator coupling, we achieve an all-optical diode and a three-port quasicirculator. By applying a second squeezed-vacuum field to the squeezed resonator mode, our nonreciprocal device also works for single-photon pulses. We obtain an isolation ratio of &gt; 40 dB for the diode and fidelity of &gt; 98\% for the quasicirculator, and insertion loss of &lt; 1 dB for both.

As these steady states are unique for the non-Markovian regime, they could offer a simple way of detecting non-Markovianity, as no information about the system’s transient dynamics is necessary. In particular, we study a driven two-level system (TLS) in a semi-infinite waveguide. Once the waveguide has been traced out, the TLS sees an environment with a distinct memory time. The memory time enters the equations as a time delay that can be varied to compare a Markovian to a non-Markovian environment. We find that some non-Markovian states show exotic behaviors such as population inversion and steady-state coherence beyond 1 / 8 , neither of which is possible for a driven TLS in the Markovian regime, where the time delay is neglected. Additionally, we show how the coherence of quantum interference is affected by time delays in a driven system by extracting the effective Purcell-modified decay rate of a TLS in front of a mirror.},

Quantum correlations are observed in a nanoseconds timescale in the interference between the central exciting frequency and sidebands dislocated by the detuning to the atomic resonance. They prevail over the noise background coming from Rayleigh scattering from the same optical transition. These correlations are fragile with respect to processes that disturb the phase of the atomic excitation, but are robust to variations in number of atoms and to increasing light intensities.},

It originates from the spinor degree of freedom that is affected by a two-body mean-field shift of the driven transition frequency. Importantly, its strength can be controlled with the Rabi-coupling strength and it does not come with additional losses. In the experiment, the three-body interactions are adjusted to play a predominant role in the equation of state of a cigar-shaped trapped condensate. This is confirmed through two striking observations: a downshift of the radial breathing mode frequency and the radial collapses for positive values of the dressed-state scattering length.},

We attain a spatial resolution of 300 nm, which is superresolving compared to the limit set by the 780 nm wavelength of the detected light.

Applying this spectroscopic approach to the autoionizing states of argon, we experimentally resolved its electronic composition and time evolution in exquisite detail.

A new window into the deformation of nuclei has been recently opened with the realization that nuclear collision experiments performed at high-energy colliders, such as the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), enable experimenters to identify the relative orientation of the colliding ions in a way that magnifies the manifestations of their intrinsic deformation. Here we apply this technique to LHC data on collisions of Xe 129 nuclei to exhibit the first evidence of nonaxiality in the ground state of ions collided at high energy. We predict that the low-energy structure of Xe 129 is triaxial (a spheroid with three unequal axes) and show that such deformation can be determined from high-energy data. This result demonstrates the unique capabilities of precision collider machines such as the LHC as new means to perform imaging of the collective structure of atomic nuclei.},

A weakly interacting continuum (WIC) model, coupled to the standard model via a Z portal, provides an explicit realization of this idea. The thermal DM relic density in this model is naturally consistent with observations, providing a continuum counterpart of the “WIMP miracle.” Direct detection cross sections are strongly suppressed compared to ordinary Z -portal WIMP, thanks to a unique effect of the continuum kinematics. Continuum DM states decay throughout the history of the Universe, and observations of cosmic microwave background place constraints on potential late decays. Production of WICs at colliders can provide a striking cascade-decay signature. We show that a simple Z -portal WIC model provides a fully viable DM candidate consistent with all current experimental constraints.},

According to the well-known Sakharov criterion for explaining the observed asymmetry, it is essential that C P violation exist. Even though C P violation has been observed in meson decays and is an integral part of the standard model (SM), measurements in meson decays indicate that C P violation in the SM is insufficient to explain the observed baryon–antibaryon asymmetry. The SM predicts the existence of yet to be observed C P violation in baryon decays. A critical test of the SM requires that C P violation be measured in baryon decays as well, in order to verify that it agrees with the measurement using meson decays. In this Letter we propose a new method to measure the C P violating phase in b baryons, using interference arising implicitly due to Bose symmetry considerations of the decaying amplitudes.},

  abstract     = {We propose inverse renormalization group transformations within the context of quantum field theory that produce the appropriate critical fixed point structure, give rise to inverse flows in parameter space, and evade the critical slowing down effect in calculations pertinent to criticality. Given configurations of the two-dimensional ϕ 4 scalar field theory on sizes as small as V = 8 2 , we apply the inverse transformations to produce rescaled systems of size up to V ′ = 51 2 2 which we utilize to extract two critical exponents. We conclude by discussing how the approach is generally applicable to any method that successfully produces configurations from a statistical ensemble and how it can give novel insights into the structure of the renormalization group.},

This results in a nearly flat free energy that terminates in a first-order phase transition. In the case of the SYK model, we show explicitly that the spectrum of the effective replica theory has a gap. These features are strikingly similar to those induced by wormholes in the gravity path integral which suggests a close relation between both configurations. For a nonchaotic SYK, the results are qualitatively different: the spectrum is gapless in the low temperature phase and there is an infinite number of second order phase transitions unrelated to the restoration of replica symmetry.},

  abstract     = {The formation of ultrarare supermassive black holes (SMBHs), with masses of O ( 10 9 M ⊙ ) , in the first billion years of the Universe remains an open question in astrophysics. At the same time, ultralight dark matter (DM) with mass in the vicinity of O ( 10 − 20 eV ) has been motivated by small scale DM distributions. Though this type of DM is constrained by various astrophysical considerations, certain observations could be pointing to modest evidence for it. We present a model with a confining first order phase transition at ∼ 10 keV temperatures, facilitating production of O ( 1 0 9 M ⊙ ) primordial SMBHs. Such a phase transition can also naturally lead to the implied mass for a motivated ultralight axion DM candidate, suggesting that SMBHs and ultralight DM may be two sides of the same cosmic coin. We consider constraints and avenues to discovery from superradiance and a modification to N eff . On general grounds, we also expect primordial gravitational waves—from the assumed first order phase transition—characterized by frequencies of O ( 10 − 12 – 10 − 9 Hz ) . This frequency regime is largely uncharted, but could be accessible to pulsar timing arrays if the primordial gravitational waves are at the higher end of this frequency range, as could be the case in our assumed confining phase transition.},

We demonstrate that a single subsystem in a broken-symmetry phase acting as a nucleation center may induce time-translation symmetry breaking across the entire ensemble. Seeding is observed for both coherent and dissipative coupling, as well as for a broad range of parameter regimes. In the spirit of mutual synchronization, we investigate the parameter regime where all subsystems are in the broken-symmetry phase. We observe that more broadly detuned time crystals require weaker coupling strength to be synchronized. This is in contrast to basic knowledge from classical as well as quantum synchronization theory. We show that this surprising observation is a direct consequence of the seeding effect.},

Such anomalous dynamics is qualitatively different from local-Hamiltonian evolution. Here we show how the presence of a nonzero index affects entanglement generation and the spreading of local operators, focusing on the coarse-grained description of generic systems. We tackle this problem by analyzing exactly solvable models of random quantum cellular automata (QCA) that generalize random circuits. We find that a nonzero index leads to asymmetric butterfly velocities with different diffusive broadening of the light cones and to a modification of the order relations between the butterfly and entanglement velocities. We propose that these results can be understood via a generalization of the recently introduced entanglement membrane theory, by allowing for a spacetime entropy current, which in the case of a generic QCA is fixed by the index. We work out the implications of this current on the entanglement “membrane tension” and show that the results for random QCA are recovered by identifying the topological index with a background velocity for the coarse-grained entanglement dynamics.},

Under typical conditions the nature of the atoms fixes the magnetic character of the system. Beyond classical light potentials leading to optical lattices and short-range interactions, high- Q cavities introduce novel dynamics into the system via the quantumness of light. Here we propose a theoretical model and we analyze it using exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group simulations. We explore the effects of cavity mediated long-range magnetic interactions and optical lattices in ultracold matter. We find that global interactions modify the underlying magnetic character of the system while introducing competition scenarios. Antiferromagnetic correlated bosonic matter emerges in conditions beyond what nature typically provides. These allow new alternatives toward the design of robust mechanisms for quantum information purposes, exploiting the properties of magnetic phases of strongly correlated quantum matter.},

Namely, a simple Ansatz is insufficient to capture the optimal solution, while an intricate Ansatz leads to the hardness of trainability. Despite its fundamental importance, an effective strategy of measuring the expressivity of VQAs remains largely unknown. Here, we exploit an advanced tool in statistical learning theory, i.e., covering number, to study the expressivity of VQAs. Particularly, we first exhibit how the expressivity of VQAs with an arbitrary Ansätze is upper bounded by the number of quantum gates and the measurement observable. We next explore the expressivity of VQAs on near-term quantum chips, where the system noise is considered. We observe an exponential decay of the expressivity with increasing circuit depth. We also utilize the achieved expressivity to analyze the generalization of QNNs and the accuracy of VQE. We numerically verify our theory employing VQAs with different levels of expressivity. Our Letter opens the avenue for quantitative understanding of the expressivity of VQAs.},

However, to go beyond proof-of-principle calculations, the current processing architectures will need to scale up to larger quantum circuits which will require fast and scalable algorithms for quantum error correction. Here, we present a neural network based decoder that, for a family of stabilizer codes subject to depolarizing noise and syndrome measurement errors, is scalable to tens of thousands of qubits (in contrast to other recent machine learning inspired decoders) and exhibits faster decoding times than the state-of-the-art union find decoder for a wide range of error rates (down to 1\%). The key innovation is to autodecode error syndromes on small scales by shifting a preprocessing window over the underlying code, akin to a convolutional neural network in pattern recognition approaches. We show that such a preprocessing step allows to effectively reduce the error rate by up to 2 orders of magnitude in practical applications and, by detecting correlation effects, shifts the actual error threshold up to fifteen percent higher than the threshold of conventional error correction algorithms such as union find or minimum weight perfect matching, even in the presence of measurement errors. An in situ implementation of such a machine learning-assisted quantum error correction will be a decisive step to push the entanglement frontier beyond the NISQ horizon.},

Entanglement purification provides a method to alleviate these nonidealities by distilling impure states into higher-fidelity entangled states. Here we demonstrate the entanglement purification of Bell pairs shared between two remote superconducting quantum nodes connected by a moderately lossy, 1-meter long superconducting communication cable. We use a purification process to correct the dominant amplitude damping errors caused by transmission through the cable, with fractional increases in fidelity as large as 25\%, achieved for higher damping errors. The best final fidelity the purification achieves is 94.09 ± 0.98\% . In addition, we use both dynamical decoupling and Rabi driving to protect the entangled states from local noise, increasing the effective qubit dephasing time by a factor of 4, from 3 to 12 μ s . These methods demonstrate the potential for the generation and preservation of very high-fidelity entanglement in a superconducting quantum communication network.},

Previous experimental generation of graph states and in particular the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states in linear optics quantum information schemes is subjected to an exponential decay in efficiency versus the system size, which limits its large-scale applications in quantum networks. Here, we demonstrate an efficient scheme to prepare graph states with only a polynomial overhead using long-lived atomic quantum memories. We generate atom-photon entangled states in two atomic ensembles asynchronously, retrieve the stored atomic excitations only when both sides succeed, and further project them into a four-photon GHZ state. We measure the fidelity of this GHZ state and further demonstrate its applications in the violation of Bell-type inequalities and in quantum cryptography. Our work demonstrates the prospect of efficient generation of multipartite entangled states in large-scale distributed systems with applications in quantum information processing and metrology.},

  abstract     = {How irreversibility arises in a universe with time-reversal symmetric laws is a central problem in physics. In this Letter, we discuss a radically different take on the emergence of irreversibility, adopting the recently proposed constructor theory framework. Irreversibility is expressed as the requirement that a task is possible, while its inverse is not. We prove the compatibility of such irreversibility with quantum theory’s time-reversal symmetric laws, using a dynamical model based on the universal quantum homogenizer. We also test the physical realizability of this model by means of an experimental demonstration with high-quality single-photon qubits.},

We show that this transition is continuous but very sharp due to a giant amplification of frictional forces which scales as exp θ 2 , where θ is the twist angle. We demonstrate that this transition is controlled solely by a nondimensional number H involving twist, friction coefficient, and geometric lengths. A critical value of this number H c ≃ 30 can be linked to a locking of the fibers together as the tensile strength is reached. This critical value imposes that yarns must be very slender structures with a given pitch. It also induces the existence of an optimal yarn radius. Predictions of our theory are successfully compared to yarns made from natural cotton fibers.},

Understanding this seemingly contradictory experimental observation, which occurs irrespective of whether the tissue is in the liquid or solid states, is not only crucial to our understanding of diverse biological processes, but is also of fundamental interest to soft matter and many-body physics. Here, we resolve this cellular to tissue level disconnect in the small fluctuation regime by using analytical theories based on hydrodynamic descriptions of confluent tissues, in both liquid and solid states. Specifically, we show that a collection of microscopic constituents with no inherently nematic extensile forces can exhibit active extensile nematic behavior when subject to polar fluctuating forces. We further support our findings by performing cell level simulations of minimal models of confluent tissues.},

We use first-principles simulations to predict room temperature ferroelectricity in a representative of the formate family, [ NH 2 NH 3 ] [ Co ( HCOO ) 3 ] . The ferroelectricity arises as a “by-product” of structural transition driven by the stabilization of the hydrogen bond. As a consequence the coupling with the electric field is relatively weak giving origin to large intrinsic coercive fields and making material immune to the depolarizing fields known for its detrimental role in nanoscale ferroelectrics. Insensitivity to the electric field and the intrinsic dynamics of the order-disorder transition in such material leads to the supercoercivity defined as significant increase in the coercive field with frequency. Room temperature polarization measurements provide further support for the predictions.},

In the present work, exposure of Cu-doped β − Ga 2 O 3 to UV light &gt; 4 eV is shown to cause large, persistent photo-induced darkening at room temperature. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy indicates that light exposure converts Cu 2 + to Cu 3 + , a rare oxidation state that is responsible for the optical absorption. The photodarkening is accompanied by the appearance of O ─ H vibrational modes in the infrared spectrum. Hybrid function calculations show that Cu acceptors can favorably complex with hydrogen donors incorporated as interstitial ( H i ) or substitutional ( H O ) defects. When Cu Ga − H O complexes absorb light, hydrogen is released, contributing to the observed Cu 3 + species and O ─ H modes.},

However, its origin is as yet unknown. Here, we carried out the high-pressure electrical measurements up to 150 GPa, together with the high-pressure x-ray diffraction measurements and first-principles calculations on CsV 3 Sb 5 . We find the new superconducting phase to be rather robust and inherently linked to the interlayer Sb 2 − Sb 2 interactions. The formation of Sb 2 − Sb 2 bonds at high pressure tunes the system from two-dimensional to three-dimensional and pushes the p z orbital of Sb2 upward across the Fermi level, resulting in enhanced density of states and increase of T C . Our work demonstrates that the dimensional crossover at high pressure can induce a topological phase transition and is related to the abnormal high-pressure T C evolution. Our findings should apply for other layered materials.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by efforts to create thin nanoscale metamaterials and understand atomically thin binary monolayers, we study the finite temperature statistical mechanics of arrays of bistable buckled dilations embedded in free-standing two-dimensional crystalline membranes that are allowed to fluctuate in three dimensions. The buckled nodes behave like discrete, but highly compressible, Ising spins, leading to a phase transition at T c with singularities in the staggered “magnetization,” susceptibility, and specific heat, studied via molecular dynamics simulations. Unlike conventional Ising models, we observe a striking divergence and sign change of the coefficient of thermal expansion near T c caused by the coupling of flexural phonons to the buckled spin texture. We argue that a phenomenological model coupling Ising degrees of freedom to the flexural phonons in a thin elastic sheet can explain this unusual response.},

  abstract     = {PbTe crystals have a soft transverse optical phonon mode in the terahertz frequency range, which is known to efficiently decay into heat-carrying acoustic phonons, resulting in anomalously low thermal conductivity. Here, we studied this phonon via polarization-dependent terahertz spectroscopy. We observed softening of this mode with decreasing temperature, indicative of incipient ferroelectricity, which we explain through a model including strong anharmonicity with a quartic displacement term. In magnetic fields up to 25 T, the phonon mode splits into two modes with opposite handedness, exhibiting circular dichroism. Their frequencies display Zeeman splitting together with an overall diamagnetic shift with increasing magnetic field. Using a group-theoretical approach, we demonstrate that these observations are the result of magnetic field-induced morphic changes in the crystal symmetries through the Lorentz force exerted on the lattice ions. Thus, our Letter reveals a novel process of controlling phonon properties in a soft ionic lattice by a strong magnetic field.},

The loop expansion is generated by the M -layer construction whose first diagrams are evaluated numerically and analytically. The generalized Ginzburg criterion reveals that the upper critical dimension below which mean-field theory fails is D U ≥ 8 , at variance with the classical result D U = 6 yielded by finite-temperature replica field theory. Our expansion around the Bethe lattice has two crucial differences with respect to the classical one. The finite connectivity z of the lattice is directly included from the beginning in the Bethe lattice, while in the classical computation the finite connectivity is obtained through an expansion in 1 / z . Moreover, if one is interested in the zero temperature ( T = 0 ) transition, one can directly expand around the T = 0 Bethe transition. The expansion directly at T = 0 is not possible in the classical framework because the fully connected spin glass does not have a transition at T = 0 , being in the broken phase for any value of the external field.},

In fragile molecular glasses, surface diffusion can be a factor of 10 8 faster than bulk diffusion at the glass transition temperature, while in the strong system SiO 2 , the enhancement is a factor of 10. Between these two extremes lie systems of intermediate fragility, including metallic glasses and amorphous selenium and silicon. This indicates that stronger liquids have greater resistance to dynamic excitation from bulk to surface and enables prediction of surface diffusion, surface crystallization, and formation of stable glasses by vapor deposition.},

The influence from the closure of the laser entrance hole, which was the main challenge in conventional wall-based techniques, was avoided through localized reemitted flux measurement, facilitating drive flux measurement throughout the entire time history.

Previous experiments have shown that particles undergoing electrophoresis are repelled from nearby channel walls, contrary to the standard description of electrophoresis that predicts no hydrodynamic repulsion. Dielectrophoretic (DEP) repulsive forces have been commonly invoked as the cause of this wall repulsion. We show that DEP forces can only account for this wall repulsion at high frequencies of applied electric field. In the presence of a low-frequency field, quadrupolar electro-osmotic flows are observed around the particles. We experimentally demonstrate that these hydrodynamic flows are the cause of the widely observed particle-wall interaction. This hydrodynamic wall repulsion should be considered in the design and application of electric-field-driven manipulation of particles in microfluidic devices.},

Interestingly, an exotic vibrational Kerr soliton state is found, which is modulated by a self-sustained mechanical oscillation. Besides, the soliton provides extra mechanical gain through the optical spring effect, and results in phonon lasing with a red-detuned pump. Various nonlinear dynamics is also observed, including limit cycle, higher periodicity, and transient chaos.

Compared with the maximum likelihood estimation method, which suffers from time-consuming and overfitting problems, a well-trained machine fed with squeezed vacuum and squeezed thermal states can complete the task of reconstruction of the density matrix in less than one second. Moreover, the resulting fidelity remains as high as 0.99 even when the antisqueezing level is higher than 20 dB. Compared with the phase noise and loss mechanisms coupled from the environment and surrounding vacuum, experimentally, the degradation information is unveiled with machine learning for low and high noisy scenarios, i.e., with the antisqueezing levels at 12 dB and 18 dB, respectively. Our neural network enhanced quantum state tomography provides the metrics to give physical descriptions of every feature observed in the quantum state with a single scan measurement just by varying the local oscillator phase from 0 to 2 π and paves a way of exploring large-scale quantum systems in real time.},

On the other hand, in such lattices, tunneling among different sites can cause additional dephasing and strongly broadening of the Rabi spectrum. Here, in our experiment, we periodically drive a shallow Sr 87 optical lattice clock. Counterintuitively, shaking the system can deform the wide broad spectral line into a sharp peak with 5.4 Hz linewidth. With careful comparison between the theory and experiment, we demonstrate that the Rabi frequency and the Bloch bands can be tuned, simultaneously and independently.

Our analysis unveils the microscopic dynamics of the system, showing that collective interactions between the atoms and a single guided photon gradually build up along the atomic array in the direction of propagation of light. These results are supported by time-resolved measurements of the light transmitted and reflected by the ensemble after excitation via nanofiber-guided laser pulses, whose rise and fall times are shorter than the atomic lifetime. Superradiant decays more than 1 order of magnitude faster than the single-atom free-space decay rate are observed for emission in the forward-propagating guided mode, while at the same time, no speed-up of the decay rate is measured in the backward direction. In addition, position-resolved measurements of the light that is transmitted past the atoms are performed by inserting the nanofiber-coupled atomic array in a 45-m-long fiber ring resonator, which allow us to experimentally reveal the progressive growth of the collective response of the atomic ensemble. Our results highlight the unique opportunities offered by nanophotonic cold atom systems for the experimental investigation of collective light-matter interaction.},

Engineered materials can be tailored to impart mathematical operations of choice on the spatial distribution of the impinging signals, but they also require extended footprints and precise large-area fabrication, which may hinder their practical applicability. Here we show that the nonlocal response of a compact scatterer can be engineered to impart operations of choice on arbitrary impinging waves, and even to solve integro-differential equations, whose solution is observed in the scattered fields. The lack of strongly resonant phenomena makes the response robust, and the compact nature opens to scalability and cascading of these processes, paving the way to efficient, compact analog computers based on engineered microstructures.},

Within the stochastic thermodynamics framework we find the origins of the overhead to Landauer’s bound required for fast operations: in the overdamped regime this term mainly comes from the dissipation, while in the underdamped regime it stems from the heating of the memory. Indeed, the system is thermalized with its environment at all times during quasistatic protocols, but for fast ones, the inefficient heat transfer to the thermostat is delayed with respect to the work influx, resulting in a transient temperature rise. The warming, quantitatively described by a comprehensive statistical physics description of the erasure process, is noticeable on both the kinetic and potential energy: they no longer comply with equipartition. The mean work and heat to erase the information therefore increase accordingly. They are both bounded by an effective Landauer’s limit k B T eff ln 2 , where T eff is a weighted average of the actual temperature of the memory during the process.},

Atomic tunneling along opposite directions in the two legs of the ladder is mediated by photon scattering from transverse pump lasers to two distinct cavity modes. The resulting interplay between cavity photon dissipation and the optomechanical atomic backaction then induces an average-density-dependent dynamical gauge field. The dissipation-stabilized steady-state atomic motion along the legs of the ladder leads either to a pure chiral current, screening the induced dynamical magnetic field as in the Meissner effect, or generates simultaneously chiral and particle currents. For a sufficiently strong pump the system enters into a dynamically unstable regime exhibiting limit-cycle and period-doubled oscillations. Intriguingly, an electromotive force is induced in this dynamical regime as expected from an interpretation based on Faraday’s law of induction for the time-dependent synthetic magnetic flux.},

The calculation of polarizability for quantum systems involves an infinite sum over all excited (bound and continuum) states, concealing the physical interpretation of polarization mechanisms and complicating the derivation of efficient response models. Approximate expressions for the dipole polarizability, α , rely on different scaling laws α ∝ R 3 , R 4 , or R 7 , for various definitions of the system radius R . Here, we consider a range of single-particle quantum systems of varying spatial dimensionality and having qualitatively different spectra, demonstrating that their polarizability follows a universal four-dimensional scaling law α = C ( 4 μ q 2 / ℏ 2 ) L 4 , where μ and q are the (effective) particle mass and charge, C is a dimensionless excitation-energy ratio, and the characteristic length L is defined via the L 2 norm of the position operator.

With the recent rise of quantum machine learning, it is natural to ask whether there is a quantum analog of the NFL theorem, which would restrict a quantum computer’s ability to learn a unitary process with quantum training data. However, in the quantum setting, the training data can possess entanglement, a strong correlation with no classical analog. In this Letter, we show that entangled datasets lead to an apparent violation of the (classical) NFL theorem. This motivates a reformulation that accounts for the degree of entanglement in the training set. As our main result, we prove a quantum NFL theorem whereby the fundamental limit on the learnability of a unitary is reduced by entanglement. We employ Rigetti’s quantum computer to test both the classical and quantum NFL theorems. Our Letter establishes that entanglement is a commodity in quantum machine learning.},

Further, simply having nonzero bath susceptibilities is not enough for the dissipation to be quantum.

  abstract     = {In bosonic gases at thermal equilibrium, an external quadratic drive can induce a Bose-Einstein condensation described by the Ising transition, as a consequence of the explicitly broken U(1) phase rotation symmetry down to Z 2 . However, in physical realizations such as exciton polaritons and nonlinear photonic lattices, thermal equilibrium is lost and the state is rather determined by a balance between losses and external drive. A fundamental question is then how nonequilibrium fluctuations affect this transition. Here, we show that in a two-dimensional driven-dissipative Bose system the Ising phase is suppressed and replaced by a nonequilibrium phase featuring Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) physics. Its emergence is rooted in a U(1)-symmetry restoration mechanism enabled by the strong fluctuations in reduced dimensionality. Moreover, we show that the presence of the quadratic drive term enhances the visibility of the KPZ scaling, compared to two-dimensional U(1)-symmetric gases, where it has remained so far elusive.},

  abstract     = {Contraction of the cytokinetic ring during cell division leads to physical partitioning of a eukaryotic cell into two daughter cells. This involves flows of actin filaments and myosin motors in the growing membrane interface at the midplane of the dividing cell. Assuming boundary driven alignment of the actomyosin filaments at the inner edge of the interface, we explore how the resulting active stresses influence the flow. Using the continuum gel theory framework, we obtain exact axisymmetric solutions of the dynamical equations. These solutions are consistent with experimental observations on closure rate. Using these solutions, we perform linear stability analysis for the contracting ring under nonaxisymmetric deformations. Our analysis shows that few low wave number modes, which are unstable during onset of the constriction, later on become stable when the ring shrinks to smaller radii, which is a generic feature of actomyosin ring closure. Our theory also captures how the effective tension in the ring decreases with its radius, causing significant slowdown in the contraction process at later times.},

Membrane dynamics are completely specified by two dimensionless numbers: the well-known Föppl–von Kármán number Γ and the recently introduced Scriven–Love number S L , respectively quantifying the base tension and base flow speed. For unstable tubes, the growth rate of a local perturbation depends only on Γ , whereas S L governs the absolute versus convective nature of the instability. Furthermore, nonlinear simulations of unstable tubes reveal an initially localized disturbance result in propagating fronts, which leave a thin atrophied tube in their wake. Depending on the value of Γ , the thin tube is connected to the unperturbed regions via oscillatory or monotonic shape transitions—reminiscent of recent experimental observations on the retraction and atrophy of axons. We elucidate our findings through a weakly nonlinear analysis, which shows membrane dynamics may be approximated by a model of the class of extended Fisher–Kolmogorov equations. Our study sheds light on the pattern selection mechanism in axonal shapes by recognizing the existence of two Lifshitz points, at which the front dynamics undergo steady-to-oscillatory bifurcations.},

The Pauli spin blockade is well established for systems such as GaAs QDs, but is to be further explored for systems with additional degrees of freedom, such as the valley quantum numbers in carbon-based materials or silicon. Here we report experiments on coupled bilayer graphene double quantum dots, in which the spin and valley states are precisely controlled, enabling the observation of the two-electron combined blockade physics. We demonstrate that the doubly occupied single dot switches between two different ground states with gate and magnetic-field tuning, allowing for the switching of selection rules: with a spin-triplet–valley-singlet ground state, valley blockade is observed; and with the spin-singlet–valley-triplet ground state, robust spin blockade is shown.},

To excavate the principal mechanism out of complex transport behaviors, we decompose the network into cycle trajectories, collect the cycle fluxes by algebraic graph theory, and select top-ranked cycle fluxes, i.e., the cycle trajectories with highest probabilities. We exemplify the cycle flux ranking in typical quantum device models, e.g., a thermal-drag spin-Seebeck pump and a quantum thermal transistor. Top-ranked cycle trajectories indeed elucidate the principal working mechanisms. Therefore, cycle flux ranking provides an alternative perspective that naturally describes the working cycle corresponding to the main functionality of quantum thermal devices, which would further guide the device optimization with desired performance.},

Here, we demonstrate robust sliding ferroelectricity in semiconducting 1 T ′ − ReS 2 multilayers via a combined study of theory and experiment. Room-temperature vertical ferroelectricity is observed in two-dimensional 1 T ′ − ReS 2 with layer number N ≥ 2 . The electric polarization stems from the uncompensated charge transfer between layers and can be switched by interlayer sliding. For bilayer 1 T ′ − ReS 2 , the ferroelectric transition temperature is estimated to be ∼ 4 0 5 K from the second harmonic generation measurements. Our results highlight the importance of interlayer engineering in the realization of atomic-scale ferroelectricity.},

The angular dependence of the MR depends on the relative angle between the induced OAM and the magnetization in a similar fashion as the spin Hall magnetoresistance. Despite the absence of elements with large spin-orbit coupling, we find a sizable MR ratio, which is in contrast to the conventional spin Hall magnetoresistance which requires heavy elements. Through Py thickness-dependence studies, we conclude another mechanism beyond the conventional spin-based scenario is responsible for the MR observed in Py / Cu * structures—originated in a sizable transport of OAM. Our findings not only suggest the current-induced torques without using any heavy elements via the OAM channel but also provide an important clue towards the microscopic understanding of the role that OAM transport can play for magnetization dynamics.},

Using a realistic low-energy model, we theoretically demonstrate that the three-dimensional Dirac semimetal Cd 3 As 2 is a promising platform for BCL Floquet engineering. Without strain, BCL irradiation induces a transition to a noncentrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal phase with tunable energy separation between the Weyl nodes.

We identify that the nematicity in MATBG is the E -symmetry ferro bond order, which is the modulation of correlated hopping integrals owing to the E -symmetry particle-hole pairing condensation. The nematicity in MATBG originates from prominent quantum interference among SU(4) valley + spin composite fluctuations. This novel “ valley + spin fluctuation interference mechanism” is revealed by the density wave equation analysis for the realistic multiorbital Hubbard model for MATBG. We find that the nematic state is robust once three van Hove singularity points exist in each valley. This interference mechanism also causes novel time-reversal-symmetry-broken valley polarization accompanied by a charge loop current. We discuss interesting similarities and differences between MATBG and Fe-based superconductors.},

Here, we show that disorder in the relative orientation between the layers and thermal fluctuations associated with their sliding motion degrade the propagation of sound in the moiré superlattice. Specifically, the phason modes become overdamped at low energies and acquire a finite gap, which displays a universal dependence on the twist-angle variance. Thus, twist-angle inhomogeneity is manifested not only in the noninteracting electronic structure of moiré systems, but also in their phononlike modes. More broadly, our results have important implications for the electronic properties of twisted moiré systems that are sensitive to the electron-phonon coupling.},

  abstract     = {In this Letter, we give an analytical quantum description of a nonequilibrium polariton Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) based on the solution of the master equation for the full polariton density matrix in the limit of fast thermalization. We find the density matrix of a nonequilibrium BEC, that takes into account quantum correlations between all polariton states. We show that the formation of BEC is accompanied by the build-up of cross-correlations between the ground state and the excited states reaching their highest values at the condensation threshold. Despite the nonequilibrium nature of polariton systems, we show the average population of polariton states exhibits the Bose-Einstein distribution with an almost zero effective chemical potential above the condensation threshold similar to an equilibrium BEC. We demonstrate that above threshold the effective temperature of polaritons drops below the reservoir temperature.},

We outline the theory of these diffractive plasma lenses and present simulations for two plasma mechanisms that allow their construction: spatially varying ionization and ponderomotively driven ion-density fluctuations. Damage-resistant plasma optics are necessary for manipulating high-intensity light, and divergence control of high-intensity pulses—provided by holographic plasma lenses—will be a critical component of high-power plasma-based lasers.},

However, frequency conversion remains limited by the dynamics of the variations of the propagation properties. Here we propose a new concept of space-time cascade to achieve arbitrary large frequency shifts by iterated elementary transformation steps. These steps use an intermediate medium in which wave packets enter and exit through noncommutative space and time interfaces. This concept avoids high frequency or subwavelength demanding metamaterials. Upward and downward frequency conversions are performed. The transmitted energy yield is given by the frequency ratio, regardless of impedence mismatch. We implement this concept with water waves controlled by electrostriction and achieve frequency conversion over 4 octaves.},

We find regimes where correlation growth can be enhanced by these effects, offering new routes for dissipatively enhancing transport and correlation spreading, relevant for both solid state and cold atom experiments.},

Contrary to previous realizations of ultradilute liquids, there is no need for stabilizing the system with an additional repulsive short-range potential. The advantage of the proposed system is that dipolar interactions on their own are sufficient for creation of a self-bound state and no additional short-range potential is needed for the stabilization. We perform quantum Monte Carlo simulations and find a rich ground-state phase diagram that contains quantum phase transitions between liquid, solid, atomic gas, and molecular gas phases. The stabilization mechanism of the liquid phase is consistent with the microscopic scenario in which the effective dimer-dimer attraction is balanced by an effective three-dimer repulsion. The equilibrium density of the liquid, which is extremely small, can be controlled by the interlayer distance. From the equation of state, we extract the spinodal density, below which the homogeneous system breaks into droplets. Our results offer a new example of a two-dimensional interacting dipolar liquid in a clean and highly controllable setup.},

  abstract     = {Capturing electronic dynamics in real time has been the ultimate goal of attosecond science since its beginning. While for atomic targets the existing measurement techniques have been thoroughly validated, in molecules there are open questions due to the inevitable copresence of moving nuclei, which are not always mere spectators of the phototriggered electron dynamics. Previous work has shown that not only can nuclear motion affect the way electrons move in a molecule, but it can also lead to contradictory interpretations depending on the chosen experimental approach. In this Letter we investigate how nuclear motion affects and eventually distorts the electronic dynamics measured by using two of the most popular attosecond techniques, reconstruction of attosecond beating by interference of two-photon transitions and attosecond streaking. Both methods are employed, in combination with ab initio theoretical calculations, to retrieve photoionization delays in the dissociative ionization of H 2 , H 2 → H + + H + e − , in the region of the Q 1 series of autoionizing states, where nuclear motion plays a prominent role. We find that the experimental reconstruction of attosecond beating by interference of two-photon transitions results are very sensitive to bond softening around the Q 1 threshold (27.8 eV), even at relatively low infrared (IR) intensity ( I 0 ∼ 1.4 × 10 1 1 W / cm 2 ), due to the long duration of the probe pulse that is inherent to this technique. Streaking, on the other hand, seems to be a better choice to isolate attosecond electron dynamics, since shorter pulses can be used, thus reducing the role of bond softening. This conclusion is supported by very good agreement between our streaking measurements and the results of accurate theoretical calculations. Additionally, the streaking technique offers the necessary energy resolution to accurately retrieve the fast-oscillating phase of the photoionization matrix elements, an essential requirement for extending this technique to even more complicated molecular targets.},

The determination of the nonperturbative soft function from first principles is crucial to sharpen our understanding of the processes with small transverse momentum such as the Drell-Yan production and the semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering.

  abstract     = {In the paper [L. Fei et al. , J. High Energy Phys. 09 ( 2015 ) 076 ] a cubic field theory of a scalar field σ and two anticommuting scalar fields, θ and θ ¯ , was formulated. In 6 − ε dimensions it has a weakly coupled fixed point with imaginary cubic couplings where the symmetry is enhanced to the supergroup OSp ( 1 | 2 ) . This theory may be viewed as a “UV completion” in 2 &lt; d &lt; 6 of the nonlinear sigma model with hyperbolic target space H 0 | 2 described by a pair of intrinsic anticommuting coordinates. It also describes the q → 0 limit of the critical q -state Potts model, which is equivalent to the statistical mechanics of spanning forests on a graph. In this Letter we generalize these results to a class of OSp ( 1 | 2 M ) symmetric field theories whose upper critical dimensions are d c ( M ) = 2 [ ( 2 M + 1 ) / ( 2 M − 1 ) ] . They contain 2 M anticommuting scalar fields, θ i , θ ¯ i , and one commuting one, with interaction g ( σ 2 + 2 θ i θ ¯ i ) ( 2 M + 1 ) / 2 . In d c ( M ) − ε dimensions, we find a weakly coupled IR fixed point at an imaginary value of g . We propose that these critical theories are the UV completions of the sigma models with fermionic hyperbolic target spaces H 0 | 2 M . Of particular interest is the quintic field theory with OSp ( 1 | 4 ) symmetry, whose upper critical dimension is 10 / 3 . Using this theory, we make a prediction for the critical behavior of the OSp ( 1 | 4 ) lattice system in three dimensions.},

The initial uniformly rotating NS models are computed assuming perfect conductivity, stationarity, and axisymmetry. Although the specific geometry of the mixed field configuration can delay or accelerate the development of various instabilities known from analytic perturbative studies, all our models finally succumb to them. Differential rotation is developed spontaneously in the cores of our magnetars which, after sufficient time, is converted back to uniform rotation. The rapidly rotating magnetars show a significant amount of ejecta, which can be responsible for transient kilonova signatures. However, no highly collimated, helical magnetic fields or incipient jets, which are necessary for γ -ray bursts, arise at the poles of these magnetars by the time our simulations are terminated.},

Specifically, we consider an ensemble of pure states supported on a small subsystem, generated from projective measurements of the remainder of the system in a local basis. We rigorously show that the ensemble, derived for a class of quantum chaotic systems undergoing quench dynamics, approaches a universal form completely independent of system details: it becomes uniformly distributed in Hilbert space. This goes beyond the standard paradigm of quantum thermalization, which dictates that the subsystem relaxes to an ensemble of quantum states that reproduces the expectation values of local observables in a thermal mixed state. Our results imply more generally that the distribution of quantum states themselves becomes indistinguishable from those of uniformly random ones, i.e., the ensemble forms a quantum state design in the parlance of quantum information theory. Our work establishes bridges between quantum many-body physics, quantum information and random matrix theory, by showing that pseudorandom states can arise from isolated quantum dynamics, opening up new ways to design applications for quantum state tomography and benchmarking.},

Conventionally, the realization of entanglement swapping relies on the Bell-state measurement. In particular, for entanglement swapping in continuous variable regime, such Bell-state measurement involves the optic-electro and electro-optic conversion, which limits the applications of the entanglement swapping for constructing broadband quantum network. In this Letter, we propose and demonstrate a measurement-free all-optical entanglement swapping. In our scheme, a high-gain parametric amplifier based on the four-wave mixing process is exploited to realize the function of Bell-state measurement without detection, which avoids the introduction of the optic-electro and electro-optic conversion. Our results provide an all-optical paradigm for implementing entanglement swapping and pave the way to construct a measurement-free all-optical broadband quantum network.},

To construct large-scale on-chip multimode multi-d.o.f.s quantum systems, a transverse mode-encoded controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate is necessary. Here, with the help of our new transverse mode-dependent directional coupler and attenuator, we demonstrate the first multimode implementation of a 2-qubit quantum gate. The ability of the gate is demonstrated by entangling two separated transverse mode qubits with an average fidelity of 0.89 ± 0.02 and the achievement of 10 standard deviations of violations in the quantum nonlocality verification. In addition, a fidelity of 0.82 ± 0.01 is obtained from quantum process tomography used to completely characterize the CNOT gate. Our work paves the way for universal transverse mode-encoded quantum operations and large-scale multimode multi-d.o.f.s quantum systems.},

  abstract     = {Bell’s theorem shows that correlations created by a single entangled quantum state cannot be reproduced classically. Such correlations are called nonlocal . They are the elementary manifestation of a broader phenomenon called network nonlocality , where several entangled states shared in a network create network nonlocal correlations. In this Letter, we provide the first class of strategies producing nonlocal correlations in generic networks. In these strategies, called color matching (CM), any source takes a color at random or in superposition, where the colors are labels for a basis of the associated Hilbert space. A party (besides other things) checks if the color of neighboring sources match. We show that in a large class of networks without input, well-chosen quantum CM strategies result in nonlocal correlations that cannot be produced classically. For our construction, we introduce the graph theoretical concept of rigidity of classical strategies in networks, and using the Finner inequality, establish a deep connection between network nonlocality and graph theory. In particular, we establish a link between CM strategies and the graph coloring problem. This work is extended in a longer paper [M.-O. Renou, Phys. Rev. A 105 , 022408 (2022) ], where we introduce a second family of rigid strategies called token counting, leading to network nonlocality.},

This instability has been extensively studied since the seminal work of Brazier nearly a century ago. However, the scenario of pressurized tubes has received much less attention. Motivated by rod-shaped bacteria such as E. coli , whose cell walls are much thinner than their radius and are subject to a substantial internal pressure, we study, theoretically, how this instability is affected by this internal pressure. In the parameter range relevant to the bacteria, we find that the internal pressure significantly postpones the onset of the instability, while the bending stiffness of the cell wall has almost no influence. This study suggests a new method to infer turgor pressure in rod-shaped bacteria from bending experiments.},

We show that the phenomenon can be well understood in terms of second order electrokinetic flow, which correctly predicts the hydrodynamic interactions required for the pattern formation process. Brownian particle simulations based on these interactions accurately recapitulate all of the observed pattern formation and symmetry-breaking events, starting from a homogeneous particle suspension.

We show that the helicity-dependent current is determined not only by the electron spin polarization and spin asymmetry of the tunneling but in great part by a dynamical factor resulting from the competition between tunneling and recombination in the semiconductor, as well as by a specific quantity: the charge polarization of the photocurrent. The two latter factors can be efficiently controlled through an electrical bias. Under longitudinal magnetic field, we observe a strong increase of the signal arising from inverted Hanle effect, which is a fingerprint of its spin origin. Our approach represents a radical shift in the physical description of this family of emerging spin devices.},

  abstract     = {Spatial inversion symmetry in crystal structures is closely related to the superconducting (SC) and magnetic properties of materials. Recently, several theoretical proposals that predict various interesting phenomena caused by the breaking of the local inversion symmetry have been presented. However, experimental validation has not yet progressed owing to the lack of model materials. Here we present evidence for antiferromagnetic (AFM) order in CeRh 2 As 2 (SC transition temperature T SC ∼ 0.37 K ), wherein the Ce site breaks the local inversion symmetry. The evidence is based on the observation of different extents of broadening of the nuclear quadrupole resonance spectrum at two crystallographically inequivalent As sites. This AFM ordering breaks the inversion symmetry of this system, resulting in the activation of an odd-parity magnetic multipole. Moreover, the onset of antiferromagnetism T N within an SC phase, with T N &lt; T SC , is quite unusual in systems wherein superconductivity coexists or competes with magnetism. Our observations show that CeRh 2 As 2 is a promising system to study how the absence of local inversion symmetry induces or influences unconventional magnetic and SC states, as well as their interaction.},

Our results show that spin-selective coupling dominates even for non-neighboring channels with parallel spin. Changes in magnetic field and bulk density let us control the equilibration until it is almost completely suppressed and dominated only by individual microscopic scatterers.

At the single-particle level, the topological nature of the bands prevents the opening of a gap between them. In contrast, we show that when the fragile bands are half filled, interactions can open a gap in the many-body spectrum without breaking any symmetry or mixing degrees of freedom from remote bands. Furthermore, the resulting ground state is not topologically ordered. Thus, a fragile topological band structure does not present an obstruction to forming a “featureless insulator” ground state. Our construction relies on the formation of fermionic bound states of two electrons and one hole known as “trions.” The trions form a band whose coupling to the electronic band enables the gap opening. This result may be relevant to the gapped state indicated by recent experiments in magic angle twisted bilayer graphene at charge neutrality.},

  abstract     = {Electronic properties of crystals are inherently pertained to crystalline symmetry, so that amorphization that lowers and breaks symmetry is detrimental. One important crystalline property is electron band topology which is known to be weakened and destroyed by structural disorder. Here, we report a counterintuitive theoretical discovery that atomic structural disorder by amorphization can in fact induce electronic order of topology in an otherwise topologically trivial crystal. The resulting nontrivial topology is characterized by a nonzero spin Bott index, associated with robust topological edge states and quantized conductance. The underlying topological phase transition (TPT) from a trivial crystal to a topological amorphous is analyzed by mapping out a phase diagram in the degree of structural disorder using an effective medium theory. The atomic disorder is revealed to induce topological order by renormalizing the spectral gap toward nontriviality near the phase boundary. As a concrete example, we further show such TPT in amorphous stanane by first-principles calculations. Our findings point to possible observation of an electronic ordering transition accompanied by a structural disorder transition.},

Classical theories based on the balance between capillary and viscous forces suggest that the droplet size should decrease with increasing flow rates of a displacing Newtonian fluid, and the droplet should be completely displaced at high injection rates. However, droplets in viscoelastic fluids cannot be removed by increasing flow rates due to the oscillation. The oscillation amplitude linearly increases with the Deborah number (De), which further inhibits the droplet’s passing through the constriction, “permanently.” Our microfluidic experiments show that the onset of oscillation is determined by a critical De, which is near 1. We derive a linear relationship for the trapped droplet length with Ec 1 / 3 , where Ec is the elastocapillary number, by introducing the elastic force into the force balance in addition to the capillary and viscous forces.},

  abstract     = {Efficient production of nuclear isomers is critical for pioneering applications, like nuclear clocks, nuclear batteries, clean nuclear energy, and nuclear γ -ray lasers. However, due to small production cross sections and quick decays, it is extremely difficult to acquire a significant amount of isomers with short lifetimes via traditional accelerators or reactors because of low beam intensity. Here, for the first time, we experimentally present femtosecond pumping of nuclear isomeric states by the Coulomb excitation of ions with the quivering electrons induced by laser fields. Nuclei populated on the third excited state of Kr 83 are generated with a peak efficiency of 2.34 × 10 15 particles / s from a tabletop hundred-TW laser system. It can be explained by the Coulomb excitation of ions with the quivering electrons during the interaction between laser pulses and clusters at nearly solid densities. This efficient and universal production method can be widely used for pumping isotopes with excited state lifetimes down to picoseconds, and could be a benefit for fields like nuclear transition mechanisms and nuclear γ -ray lasers.},

The hadronic tensor is calculated using lattice QCD and then combined with an analytic photon propagator, and the mass splitting is calculated with exponentially suppressed finite-volume errors. The calculation is performed using six gauge ensembles generated with 2 + 1 -flavor domain wall fermions, and five ensembles are at the physical pion mass. Both Feynman and Coulomb gauges are adopted in the calculation and agree well when the lattice spacing approaches zero. After performing the continuum extrapolation and examining the residual finite-volume effects, we obtain the pion mass splitting Δ m π = 4.534 ( 42 ) stat ( 43 ) sys MeV , which agrees well with experimental measurements.},

Our framework provides a consistent description of the experimental data over the full range of momentum transfer, in line with the strictures from analyticity and unitarity. The statistical uncertainties of the extracted form factors are estimated using the bootstrap method, while systematic errors are determined from variations of the spectral functions. We also perform a high-precision extraction of the nucleon radii and find good agreement with previous analyses of spacelike data alone. For the proton charge radius, we find r E p = 0.84 0 − 0.002 + 0.003 − 0.002 + 0.002 fm , where the first error is statistical and the second one is systematic. The Zemach radius and third moment are in agreement with Lamb shift measurements and hyperfine splittings. The combined dataset of space- and timelike data disfavors a zero crossing of μ p G E p / G M p in the spacelike region. Finally, we discuss the status and perspectives of modulus and phase of the form factors in the timelike region in the context of future experiments, as well as the onset of perturbative QCD.},

The range of mixings for which leptogenesis is feasible is considerably larger than in the minimal model with only two right-handed neutrinos and extends all the way up to the current experimental bounds. For such large mixing angles the HL-LHC could potentially observe a number of events that is large enough to compare different decay channels, a first step towards testing the hypothesis that these particles may be responsible for the origin of matter and neutrino masses.},

The resulting constraints are stronger than those arising from big bang nucleosynthesis or cosmic microwave background observations.

The first detection of PeV γ rays from astrophysical sources may provide a very sensitive probe of the effect of the Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), which results in decay of high-energy γ rays in the superluminal scenario and hence a sharp cutoff of the energy spectrum. Two highest energy sources are studied in this work. No signature of the existence of the LIV is found in their energy spectra, and the lower limits on the LIV energy scale are derived. Our results show that the first-order LIV energy scale should be higher than about 10 5 times the Planck scale M Pl and that the second-order LIV scale is &gt; 10 − 3 M Pl . Both limits improve by at least one order of magnitude the previous results.},

In this work, we provide a simple formula on the heating rate under fast and strong periodic driving in classical and quantum many-body systems. The key idea behind the formula is constructing a time-dependent dressed Hamiltonian by moving to a rotating frame, which is found by a truncation of the high-frequency expansion of the micromotion operator, and applying the linear-response theory. It is confirmed for specific classical and quantum models that the second-order truncation of the high-frequency expansion yields quantitatively accurate heating rates beyond the linear-response regime. Our result implies that the information on heating dynamics is encoded in the first few terms of the high-frequency expansion, although heating is often associated with an asymptotically divergent behavior of the high-frequency expansion.},

Rev. Lett. 125 , 120604 (2020) ]. Following the dissipative two-level model exemplified in the same Letter, we experimentally verify this fundamental trade-off in a single trapped ultracold Ca + 40 ion using elaborately designed dissipative channels, along with a postprocessing method developed in the data analysis, to build the effective nonequilibrium stochastic evolutions for the energy transfer between two heat baths mediated by a qubit. Since the dissipation-time uncertainty relation imposes a constraint on the quantum speed regarding entropy flux, our observation provides the first experimental evidence confirming such a speed restriction from thermodynamics on quantum operations due to dissipation, which helps us further understand the role of thermodynamical characteristics played in quantum information processing.},

Here, we probe the properties of the conformal field theories governing these MIPTs using a numerical transfer-matrix method, which allows us to extract the effective central charge, as well as the first few low-lying scaling dimensions of operators at these critical points for ( 1 + 1 )-dimensional systems. Our results provide convincing evidence that the generic and Clifford MIPTs for qubits lie in different universality classes and that both are distinct from the percolation transition for qudits in the limit of large on-site Hilbert space dimension. For the generic case, we find strong evidence of multifractal scaling of correlation functions at the critical point, reflected in a continuous spectrum of scaling dimensions.},

  abstract     = {As random operations for quantum systems are intensively used in various quantum information tasks, a trustworthy measure of the randomness in quantum operations is highly demanded. The Haar measure of randomness is a useful tool with wide applications, such as boson sampling. Recently, a theoretical protocol was proposed to combine quantum control theory and driven stochastic quantum walks to generate Haar-uniform random operations. This opens up a promising route to converting classical randomness to quantum randomness. Here, we implement a two-dimensional stochastic quantum walk on the integrated photonic chip and demonstrate that the average of all distribution profiles converges to the even distribution when the evolution length increases, suggesting the 1-pad Haar-uniform randomness. We further show that our two-dimensional array outperforms the one-dimensional array of the same number of waveguide for the speed of convergence. Our Letter demonstrates a scalable and robust way to generate Haar-uniform randomness that can provide useful building blocks to boost future quantum information techniques.},

We describe a procedure for achieving a constant Doppler shift during the transport, which uses fine temporal adjustment of the moving confinement potential. The fixed interaction duration of the ions transported through the laser beam as well as the dynamically changing ac Stark shift require alterations to the calibration procedures used for a stationary gate. We use the interaction to produce Bell states with fidelities commensurate to those of stationary gates performed in the same system. This result establishes the feasibility of actively incorporating ion transport into quantum information entangling operations.},

Initializing the system in the star’s central vertex, we determine the optimal quantum walk times to reach full overlap with the marked state using ⌈ ( π / 4 ) N − ( 1 / 2 ) ⌉ oracle queries, matching the well-known lower bound of Grover’s search. We implement the deterministic search in a database of size seven on photonic quantum hardware, and demonstrate the effective scaling of the approach up to size 115. This is the first experimental demonstration of quantum walk-based search on the highly noise-resistant star graph, which provides new evidence for the applications of quantum walk in quantum algorithms and quantum information processing.},

We show that this is a good measure of nonstabilizerness from the point of view of resource theory and show bounds with other known measures. The stabilizer Rényi entropy has the advantage of being easily computable because it does not need a minimization procedure. We present a protocol for an experimental measurement by randomized measurements.

Here we experimentally demonstrate a trade-off relation among all information contents, i.e., information gain, disturbance, and reversibility in quantum measurement. By exploring quantum measurements applied on a photonic qutrit, we observe that the information of a quantum state is split into three distinct parts accounting for the extracted, disturbed, and reversible information. We verify that such different parts of information are in trade-off relations not only pairwise but also triplewise all at once, and find that the triplewise relation is tighter than any of the pairwise relations. Finally, we realize optimal quantum measurements that inherently preserve quantum information without loss of information, which offer wider applications in measurement-based quantum information processing.},

We find that due to active stress, aggregate surface tension depends upon its size. As a result, both pressure and cell number density depend on size and violate equilibrium assumptions. However, the relationship between them resembles an equilibrium equation of state with an effective temperature. This suggests that bulk and surface properties of aggregates balance to yield a constant average work performed by each cell on their environment in regulating tissue size. These results describe basic physical principles that govern the size of cell aggregates.},

By contrast extensile stress promotes instabilities that can turn the director out of the plane, leaving behind a population of distinct, in-plane regions that continually elongate and divide. This supports extensile forces as a mechanism for the initial stages of layer formation in living systems, and we show that a planar drop with extensile (contractile) activity grows into three dimensions (remains in two dimensions). The results also explain the propensity of disclination lines in three dimensional active nematics to be of twist type in extensile or wedge type in contractile materials.},

For the extended Hubbard model on a periodic chain, HHG close to the quantum critical point (QCP) is more significant compared to two neighboring gapped phases (i.e., charge-density-wave and spin-density wave states), especially in low frequencies. We confirm that the systems in the vicinity of the QCP are supersensitive to the external field and more optical-transition channels via excited states are responsible for HHG. This feature holds the potential of obtaining high-efficiency harmonics by making use of materials approaching QCP. Based on the two-dimensional Haldane model, we further propose that the even- or odd-order components of generated harmonics can be promisingly regarded as spectral signals to distinguish the topologically ordered phases from locally ordered ones. Our findings in this Letter pave the way to achieve ultrafast light source from HHG in strongly correlated materials and to study quantum phase transition by nonlinear optics in strong laser fields.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogen-based superconductors provide a route to the long-sought goal of room-temperature superconductivity, but the high pressures required to metallize these materials limit their immediate application. For example, carbonaceous sulfur hydride, the first room-temperature superconductor made in a laboratory, can reach a critical temperature ( T c ) of 288 K only at the extreme pressure of 267 GPa. The next recognized challenge is the realization of room-temperature superconductivity at significantly lower pressures. Here, we propose a strategy for the rational design of high-temperature superconductors at low pressures by alloying small-radius elements and hydrogen to form ternary H-based superconductors with alloy backbones. We identify a “fluorite-type” backbone in compositions of the form A X H 8 , which exhibit high-temperature superconductivity at moderate pressures compared with other reported hydrogen-based superconductors. The F m 3 ¯ m phase of LaBeH 8 , with a fluorite-type H-Be alloy backbone, is predicted to be thermodynamically stable above 98 GPa, and dynamically stable down to 20 GPa with a high T c ∼ 1 8 5 K . This is substantially lower than the synthesis pressure required by the geometrically similar clathrate hydride LaH 1 0 (170 GPa). Our approach paves the way for finding high- T c ternary H-based superconductors at conditions close to ambient pressures.},

The quantum dot closest to the normal lead exhibits Coulomb diamonds, and the dot closest to the superconducting lead exhibits Andreev bound states and an induced gap. The experimental observations compare favorably to a theoretical model of Andreev blockade, named so because the triplet double dot configuration suppresses Andreev reflections. Observed leakage currents can be accounted for by finite temperature. We observe the predicted quadruple level degeneracy points of high current and a periodic conductance pattern controlled by the occupation of the normal dot. Even-odd transport asymmetry is lifted with increased temperature and magnetic field. This blockade phenomenon can be used to study spin structure of superconductors.

Here, we investigate the interaction between circularly polarized light and emergent chiral stacking orders in quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) charge-density waves (CDWs) with density-functional theory calculations. In our specific system, self-assembled In nanowires on a Si(111) surface, spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking leads to four symmetrically distinct degenerate quasi-1D CDW structures, which exhibit geometrical chirality. Such geometrical chirality may naturally induce optically active phenomena even when the quasi-1D CDW structures are stacked perpendicular to the CDW chain direction. Indeed, we find that left- and right-chiral stacking orders show distinct circular dichroism responses while a nonchiral stacking order has no circular dichroism. Such optical responses are attributed to the existence of glide mirror symmetry of the CDW stacking orders. Our findings suggest that the CDW chiral stacking orders can lead to diverse active optical phenomena such as chirality-dependent circular dichroism, which can be observed in scanning tunneling luminescence measurements with circularly polarized light.},

Four-phonon scattering contributes a prominent linewidth that increases with temperature, while temperature dependence from electron-phonon interactions is found to be reversed above a doping threshold ( ℏ ω G / 2 , with ω G being the frequency of the G phonon).},

Focusing on the density profile ρ ( r ) and a sensitive spatial measure of fluctuations, the local compressibility profile χ ( r ) , we develop a scaling theory which expresses the extent of the density depletion and enhancement in compressibility in terms of R s , the strength of solute-water attraction ϵ s , and the deviation from liquid-vapor coexistence δ μ . Testing the predictions against results of classical density functional theory for a simple solvent and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations of a popular water model, we find that the theory provides a firm physical basis for understanding how water behaves at a hydrophobe.},

We report computational evidence of a supersolid phase of deuterium under high pressure ( p &gt; 800 GPa ) and low temperature ( T &lt; 1.0 K ). In our simulations, that are based on bosonic path integral molecular dynamics, we observe a highly concerted exchange of atoms while the system preserves its crystalline order. The exchange processes are favored by the soft core interactions between deuterium atoms that form a densely packed metallic solid. At the zero temperature limit, Bose-Einstein condensation is observed as the permutation probability of N deuterium atoms approaches 1 / N with a finite superfluid fraction. Our study provides concrete evidence for the existence of a supersolid phase in high-pressure deuterium and could provide insights on the future investigation of supersolid phases in real materials.},

Phase-field simulations reproduce these morphologies, which are closely linked to the anomalous density-temperature profile of liquid water. Boundary layer flows yield pinnacles that sharpen with accelerating growth of tip curvature while scallops emerge from a Kelvin-Helmholtz–like instability caused by counterflowing currents that roll up to form vortex arrays. By linking the molecular-scale effects underlying water’s density anomaly to the macroscale flows that imprint the surface, these results show that the morphology of melted ice is a sensitive indicator of ambient temperature.},

We show experimentally and theoretically that the motion of a particle with radius R p is determined by the maximum bubble radius R b , max , the initial distance from the laser focus to the center of the particle L 0 , and the initial azimuth angle φ 0 . We identify two dominant regimes for the particle’s sudden acceleration, namely, the unsteady liquid inertia dominated regime and the bubble contact dominated regime, determined by R b , max R p / L 0 2 .

While our time-dependent density-functional theory simulations confirm the presence of a velocity threshold below which the proton stopping power vanishes, our calculations demonstrate that the antiprotons do not experience such a threshold. The combination of those two contrasting behaviors gives rise to an unprecedented negative Barkas effect: the stopping power of antiprotons is larger than that of protons. We identify that the slow antiproton at close encounter destabilizes a p orbital of the F − anion pointing toward the antiproton. This particular orbital becomes highly polarizable and hence contributes much to the stopping power.},

The ground-state-only g -factor measurement would also provide first experimental evidence of nuclear hyperfine mixing in atomic ions. Combining the measurements for H-, Li-, and B-like Th 229 ions has a potential to improve the initial result for a single charge state and to determine the nuclear magnetic moment to a higher accuracy than that of the currently accepted value. The calculations include relativistic, interelectronic-interaction, QED, and nuclear effects.},

We argue that existing experimental measurements of this observable support a picture where the relevant length scale characterizing the colliding nucleons is of order 0.5 fm or smaller, and we discuss the broad implications of this finding for future global Bayesian analyses aimed at extracting initial-state and medium properties from nucleus-nucleus collision data, including v n 2 − [ p t ] correlations. Determinations of the nucleon size in heavy-ion collisions will provide a solid independent constraint on the initial state of small system collisions and will establish a deep connection between collective flow data in nucleus-nucleus experiments and data on deep inelastic scattering on protons and nuclei.},

This is fully supported by numerical computations. Systems with negative kinetic terms often appear in modern cosmology, quantum gravity, and high energy physics and are usually deemed as unstable.

This measurement will thus help us to deepen our understanding on the strongly interacting exotic objects.

Our study is based on a quantum many-body model that is inspired by classical nonequilibrium processes which feature phase transitions into an absorbing state, such as epidemic spreading. The possibility for different dynamical paths to interfere quantum mechanically results in collective dynamical behavior without classical counterpart. We identify two competing dark states, a trivial one corresponding to a classical absorbing state and an emergent one which is quantum coherent. We establish a nonequilibrium phase transition within this dark space that features a phenomenology which cannot be encountered in classical systems. Such emergent two-dimensional dark space may find technological applications, e.g., for the collective encoding of a quantum information.},

Moreover, it has been shown that WVA-based metrology can reach the Heisenberg limit using entangled resources, but preparing macroscopic entangled resources remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a novel WVA scheme based on iterative interactions, achieving the Heisenberg-limited precision scaling without resorting to entanglement. This indicates that the perceived advantages of the entanglement-assisted WVA are in fact due to iterative interactions between each particle of an entangled system and a meter, rather than coming from the entanglement itself. Our work opens a practical pathway for achieving the Heisenberg-limited WVA without using fragile and experimentally demanding entangled resources.},

Our protocol includes multiple probes, that are not interacting, nor are they initially correlated to each other. They interact with a bosonic sample and reach a nonthermal steady state, which is measured to estimate the temperature of the sample. It is well known that in the steady state such noninteracting probes may get correlated to each other and even entangled. Nonetheless, the impact of these correlations in metrology has not been deeply investigated yet. Here, we examine their role for thermometry of cold bosonic gases and show that, although being classical, bath-induced correlations can lead to significant enhancement of precision for thermometry. The improvement is especially important at low temperatures, where attaining high precision thermometry is particularly demanding. The proposed thermometry scheme does not require any precise dynamical control of the probes and tuning the parameters and is robust to noise in initial preparation, as it is built upon the steady state generated by the natural dissipative dynamics of the system. Therefore, our results put forward new possibilities in thermometry at low temperatures, of relevance, for instance, in cold gases and Bose-Einstein condensates.},

Previous work attempted to simulate quantum systems using only real numbers by exploiting an enlarged Hilbert space. A fundamental question arises: are the complex numbers really necessary in the standard formalism of quantum theory? To answer this question, a quantum game has been developed to distinguish standard quantum theory from its real-number analog, by revealing a contradiction between a high-fidelity multiqubit quantum experiment and players using only real-number quantum theory. Here, using superconducting qubits, we faithfully realize the quantum game based on deterministic entanglement swapping with a state-of-the-art fidelity of 0.952. Our experimental results violate the real-number bound of 7.66 by 43 standard deviations. Our results disprove the real-number formulation and establish the indispensable role of complex numbers in the standard quantum theory.},

To supplement the symmetry analysis, we perform hydrodynamic simulations to show that the moment of inertia of the trapped gas indeed follows a universal time dependence that is determined jointly by the conformal symmetry and time-dependent scattering length a ( t ) .

The FG-like chromosome likely affects macromolecular transport, yet its characteristics remain poorly understood. Using computer simulations and scaling analysis, we show that the 3D folding and macromolecular size of the chromosomes determine their transport characteristics. Large-scale subdiffusion occurs at a critical particle size where the network of accessible volumes is critically connected. Condensed chromosomes have connectivity networks akin to simple Bernoulli bond percolation clusters, regardless of the polymer models. However, even if the network structures are similar, the tracer’s walk dimension varies. It turns out that the walk dimension depends on the network topology of the accessible volume and dynamic heterogeneity of the tracer’s hopping rate. We find that the FG structure has a smaller walk dimension than other random geometries, suggesting that the FG-like chromosome structure accelerates macromolecular diffusion and target-search.},

We show that our approximation is accurate for a very wide range of parameters, and that it correctly captures numerous nonequilibrium effects, which are the signature of the activity in the system. In addition to the determination of the diffusion coefficient of the tracer, our approach allows us to characterize the perturbation of the environment induced by the displacement of the active tracer.

  abstract     = {Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) presently stands as the preferred strategy to enhance the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, but its application relies on the use of high-frequency microwave to manipulate electron spins, an increasingly demanding task as the applied magnetic field grows. Here we investigate the dynamics of a system hosting a polarizing agent formed by two distinct paramagnetic centers near a level anticrossing. We theoretically show that nuclear spins polarize efficiently under a cyclic protocol that combines alternating thermal jumps and radio-frequency pulses connecting hybrid states with opposite nuclear and electronic spin alignment. Central to this process is the difference between the spin-lattice relaxation times of either electron spin species, transiently driving the electronic spin bath out of equilibrium after each thermal jump. Without the need for microwave excitation, this route to enhanced nuclear polarization may prove convenient, particularly if the polarizing agent is designed to feature electronic level anticrossings at high magnetic fields.},

SDE refers to the nonreciprocity of the critical current for the metal-superconductor transition. Among various mechanisms for the critical current, the depairing current is known to be intrinsic to each material and has recently been observed in several superconducting systems. We clarify the temperature scaling of the nonreciprocal depairing current near the critical temperature and point out its significant enhancement at low temperatures. It is also found that the nonreciprocal critical current shows sign reversals upon increasing the magnetic field. These behaviors are understood by the nonreciprocity of the Landau critical momentum and the change in the nature of the helical superconductivity. The intrinsic SDE unveils the rich phase diagram and functionalities of noncentrosymmetric superconductors.},

Laughlin states form a vector bundle, the Laughlin bundle, over the Jacobian—the space of Aharonov-Bohm fluxes through the holes of the surface. The rank of the Laughlin bundle is the degeneracy of Laughlin states or, in the presence of quasiholes, the dimension of the corresponding full many-body Hilbert space; its slope, which is the first Chern class divided by the rank, is the Hall conductance. We compute the rank and all the Chern classes of Laughlin bundles for any genus and any number of quasiholes, settling, in particular, the Wen-Niu conjecture. Then we show that Laughlin bundles with nonlocalized quasiholes are not projectively flat and that the Hall current is precisely quantized only for the states with localized quasiholes. Hence our test distinguishes these states from the full many-body Hilbert space.},

The spectra around K ¯ is found to exhibit a peak-dip-hump structure associated with two separate branches of dispersion, demonstrating the isotropic CDW gap opening below E F . The peak-dip-hump line shape is contributed by linearly dispersive Dirac bands in the lower branch and a dispersionless flat band close to E F in the upper branch. The electronic instability via Fermi surface nesting could play a role in determining these CDW-related features. The superconducting gap of ∼ 0.4 meV is observed on both the electron band around Γ ¯ and the flat band around K ¯ , implying the multiband superconductivity. The finite density of states at E F in the CDW phase is most likely in favor of the emergence of multiband superconductivity, particularly the enhanced density of states associated with the flat band.

By combining transport, photoemission, diffraction, and x-ray absorption measurements, we observe that the hysteresis loop has a temperature width of more than 400 K, setting a record among crystalline solids. The transition has an origin distinct from known mechanisms, lying entirely within the incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) phase of EuTe 4 with no change in the CDW modulation periodicity. We interpret the hysteresis as an unusual switching of the relative CDW phases in different layers, a phenomenon unique to quasi-2D compounds that is not present in either purely 2D or strongly coupled 3D systems. Our findings challenge the established theories on metastable states in density wave systems, pushing the boundary of understanding hysteretic transitions in a broken-symmetry state.},

  abstract     = {The origin of water on the Earth is a long-standing mystery, requiring a comprehensive search for hydrous compounds, stable at conditions of the deep Earth and made of Earth-abundant elements. Previous studies usually focused on the current range of pressure-temperature conditions in the Earth’s mantle and ignored a possible difference in the past, such as the stage of the core-mantle separation. Here, using ab initio evolutionary structure prediction, we find that only two magnesium hydrosilicate phases are stable at megabar pressures, α − Mg 2 SiO 5 H 2 and β − Mg 2 SiO 5 H 2 , stable at 262–338 GPa and &gt; 3 3 8 GPa , respectively (all these pressures now lie within the Earth’s iron core). Both are superionic conductors with quasi-one-dimensional proton diffusion at relevant conditions. In the first 30 million years of Earth’s history, before the Earth’s core was formed, these must have existed in the Earth, hosting much of Earth’s water. As dense iron alloys segregated to form the Earth’s core, Mg 2 SiO 5 H 2 phases decomposed and released water. Thus, now-extinct Mg 2 SiO 5 H 2 phases have likely contributed in a major way to the evolution of our planet.},

  abstract     = {Silica, water, and hydrogen are known to be the major components of celestial bodies, and have significant influence on the formation and evolution of giant planets, such as Uranus and Neptune. Thus, it is of fundamental importance to investigate their states and possible reactions under the planetary conditions. Here, using advanced crystal structure searches and first-principles calculations in the Si − O − H system, we find that a silica-water compound ( SiO 2 ) 2 ( H 2 O ) and a silica-hydrogen compound SiO 2 H 2 can exist under high pressures above 450 and 650 GPa, respectively. Further simulations reveal that, at high pressure and high temperature conditions corresponding to the interiors of Uranus and Neptune, these compounds exhibit superionic behavior, in which protons diffuse freely like liquid while the silicon and oxygen framework is fixed as solid. Therefore, these superionic silica-water and silica-hydrogen compounds could be regarded as important components of the deep mantle or core of giants, which also provides an alternative origin for their anomalous magnetic fields. These unexpected physical and chemical properties of the most common natural materials at high pressure offer key clues to understand some abstruse issues including demixing and erosion of the core in giant planets, and shed light on building reliable models for solar giants and exoplanets.},

The theory provides analytic forms for the elastic interactions and the core energy of the GB phase junction that, along with the change in GB energy, determines the nucleation barrier. We apply the resulting nucleation model to simulations of GB phase transformations in tungsten. Our theory explains why under certain conditions GBs cannot spontaneously change their structure even to a lower energy state.},

The theorem further reveals that the rigid-to-floppy transition from spherical to planar kirigami tessellations is possible if and only if the slits form parallelogram voids along with vanishing Gaussian curvature, which is also confirmed by an energy analysis and simulations. On the application side, we show a design of bistable spherical domelike structure based on the theorem.

The soliton pairs are generated seeding two modes with opposite dispersion but with similar group velocities. One laser operating in the anomalous dispersion regime generates a bright soliton microcomb, while the other laser in the normal dispersion regime creates a dark soliton via Kerr-induced cross-phase modulation with the bright soliton. Numerical simulations agree well with experimental results and reveal a novel mechanism to generate dark soliton pulses. The trapping of dark and bright solitons can lead to light states with the intriguing property of constant output power while spectrally resembling a frequency comb. These results can be of interest for telecommunication systems, frequency comb applications, and ultrafast optics.},

Our method can be viewed as implementing an exact, sector-dependent mean-field decoupling, or alternatively, as a kind of quantum-to-classical mapping. We focus on two canonical examples: a nonlinear bosonic mode subject to incoherent loss and pumping, and an inhomogeneous quantum Ising model with arbitrary connectivity and local dissipation. In both cases, we calculate and analyze the full dissipation spectrum. Our method is applicable to a variety of other systems, and could provide a powerful new tool for the study of complex driven-dissipative quantum systems.},

This SU(2)-in-SU(1,1) nested interferometer (SISNI) simultaneously achieves a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit (SQL) and tolerance to photon losses external to the interferometer, e.g., in detectors. We implement a SISNI using parametric amplification by four-wave mixing (FWM) in Rb vapor and a laser-fed Mach-Zehnder SU(2) interferometer. We observe path-length sensitivity with SNR 2.2 dB beyond the SQL at power levels (and thus SNR) 2 orders of magnitude beyond those of previous loss-tolerant interferometers. We find experimentally the optimal FWM gains and find agreement with a minimal quantum noise model for the FWM process. The results suggest ways to boost the in-practice sensitivity of high-power interferometers, e.g., gravitational wave interferometers, and may enable high-sensitivity, quantum-enhanced interferometry at wavelengths for which efficient detectors are not available.},

In this Letter, we demonstrate that the Rydberg states of an alkaline earth atom, ytterbium, can be stably trapped by the same red-detuned optical tweezer that also confines the ground state, by leveraging the polarizability of the Yb + ion core. Using the previously unobserved S 1 3 series, we demonstrate trapped Rydberg atom lifetimes exceeding 100 μ s , and observe no evidence of auto- or photoionization from the trap light for these states. We measure a coherence time of T 2 = 59 μ s between two Rydberg levels, exceeding the 28 μ s lifetime of untrapped Rydberg atoms under the same conditions. These results are promising for extending the interaction time of Rydberg atom arrays for quantum simulation and computing, and are vital to capitalize on the extended Rydberg lifetimes in circular states or cryogenic environments.},

The unparticle associated with two neutral charm mesons produces a peak in the recoil momentum spectrum of K ± in inclusive decays of B ± that has been observed.

  abstract     = {The first evidence for X(3872) production in relativistic heavy ion collisions is reported. The X(3872) production is studied in lead-lead (Pb-Pb) collisions at a center-of-mass energy of s NN = 5.02 TeV per nucleon pair, using the decay chain X ( 3872 ) → J / ψ π + π − → μ + μ − π + π − . The data were recorded with the CMS detector in 2018 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 1.7 nb − 1 . The measurement is performed in the rapidity and transverse momentum ranges | y | &lt; 1.6 and 15 &lt; p T &lt; 50 GeV / c . The significance of the inclusive X(3872) signal is 4.2 standard deviations. The prompt X(3872) to ψ 2 S yield ratio is found to be ρ Pb − Pb = 1.08 ± 0.49 ( stat ) ± 0.52 ( syst ) , to be compared with typical values of 0.1 for p p collisions. This result provides a unique experimental input to theoretical models of the X(3872) production mechanism, and of the nature of this exotic state.},

Such a cosmic coincidence might hint at a mutual origin for the formation scenario of PBHs and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. Baryogenesis can be triggered by a sharp transition of the rolling rate of inflaton from slow-roll to (nearly) ultraslow-roll phases that produce large curvature perturbations for PBH formation in single-field inflationary models. We show that the baryogenesis requirement drives the PBH contribution to DM, along with the inferred PBH mass range, the resulting stochastic gravitational wave background frequency window, and the associated cosmic microwave background tensor-to-scalar ratio amplitude, into potentially observable regimes.},

In particular, the spin orientations of the component black holes within the orbital plane, ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 , can be used to identify binaries caught in the so-called spin-orbit resonances. In a companion paper, we demonstrate that ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 are best measured near the merger of the two black holes. In this work, we use these spin measurements to provide the first constraints on the full six-dimensional spin distribution of merging binary black holes. In particular, we find that there is a preference for Δ ϕ = ϕ 1 − ϕ 2 ∼ ± π in the population, which can be a signature of spin-orbit resonances. We also find a preference for ϕ 1 ∼ − π / 4 with respect to the line of separation near merger, which has not been predicted for any astrophysical formation channel. However, the strength of these preferences depends on our prior choices, and we are unable to constrain the widths of the ϕ 1 and Δ ϕ distributions. Therefore, more observations are necessary to confirm the features we find. Finally, we derive constraints on the distribution of recoil kicks in the population and use this to estimate the fraction of merger remnants retained by globular and nuclear star clusters. We make our spin and kick population constraints publicly available.},

  abstract     = {We propose a tensor network approach to compute amplitudes and probabilities for a large number of correlated bitstrings in the final state of a quantum circuit. As an application, we study Google’s Sycamore circuits, which are believed to be beyond the reach of classical supercomputers and have been used to demonstrate quantum supremacy. By employing a small computational cluster containing 60 graphical processing units (GPUs), we compute exact amplitudes and probabilities of 2 × 10 6 correlated bitstrings with some entries fixed (which span a subspace of the output probability distribution) for the Sycamore circuit with 53 qubits and 20 cycles. The obtained results verify the Porter-Thomas distribution of the large and deep quantum circuits of Google, provide datasets and benchmarks for developing approximate simulation methods, and can be used for spoofing the linear cross entropy benchmark of quantum supremacy. Then we extend the proposed big-batch method to a full-amplitude simulation approach that is more efficient than the existing Schrödinger method on shallow circuits and the Schrödinger-Feynman method in general, enabling us to obtain the state vector of Google’s simplifiable circuit with n = 43 qubits and m = 14 cycles using only one GPU. We also manage to obtain the state vector for Google’s simplifiable circuits with n = 50 qubits and m = 14 cycles using a small GPU cluster, breaking the previous record on the number of qubits in full-amplitude simulations. Our method is general in computing bitstring probabilities for a broad class of quantum circuits and can find applications in the verification of quantum computers. We anticipate that our method will pave the way for combining tensor network–based classical computations and near-term quantum computations for solving challenging problems in the real world.},

We evaluate these geometric phases using Floquet theory for systems in time-dependent external fields with a focus on paths leading through a degeneracy of the eigenenergies. Contrary to expectations, the low-frequency limits of the two phases do not always coincide. This happens as the degeneracy leads to a slow convergence of the quantum states to adiabaticity, resulting in a nonzero finite or divergent contribution to the AA phase. Steering the system adiabatically through a degeneracy provides control over the geometric phase as it can cause a π shift of the Berry phase. On the other hand, we revisit an example of degeneracy crossing proposed by AA. We find that, at suitable driving frequencies, both geometric-phase definitions give the same result and the dynamical phase is zero due to the symmetry of time evolution about the point of degeneracy, providing an advantageous setup for manipulation of quantum states.},

Their behavior is even richer at finite temperature. Here, we use molecular dynamics to study the vibrations of a thermally fluctuating two-dimensional elastic sheet with one end clamped at its zero-temperature length. We uncover a tilted phase in which the sheet fluctuates about a mean configuration inclined with respect to the horizontal, thus breaking reflection symmetry. We determine the phase behavior as a function of the aspect ratio of the sheet and the temperature. We show that tilt may be viewed as a type of transverse buckling instability induced by clamping coupled to thermal fluctuations and develop an analytic model that predicts the tilted and untilted regions of the phase diagram. Qualitative agreement is found with the molecular dynamics simulations. Unusual response driven by control of purely geometric quantities like the aspect ratio, as opposed to external fields, offers a very rich playground for two-dimensional mechanical metamaterials.},

Here, we present a simulation method for evaluating the rate and mechanism of rare events in generic nonequilibrium systems and apply it to study the conformational changes of a passive solute in an active fluid. The method employs a variational optimization of a control force that renders the rare event a typical one, supplying an exact estimate of its rate as a ratio of path partition functions. Using this method we find that increasing activity in the active bath can enhance the rate of conformational switching of the passive solute in a manner consistent with recent bounds from stochastic thermodynamics.},

Here, we demonstrate how elasticity affects drop coalescence, the complement of the much studied drop pinch-off. We reveal the emergence of an elastic singularity, characterized by a diverging interface curvature at the point of coalescence. Intriguingly, while the polymers dictate the spatial features of coalescence, they hardly affect the temporal evolution of the bridge.

Exact coherent structures are stationary, periodic, quasiperiodic, or traveling wave solutions of the hydrodynamic equations that, together with their invariant manifolds, serve as an organizing template of the dynamics. We compute the dominant exact coherent structures and connecting orbits in a preturbulent active nematic channel flow, which enables a fully nonlinear but highly reduced-order description in terms of a directed graph. Using this reduced representation, we compute instantaneous perturbations that switch the system between disparate spatiotemporal states occupying distant regions of the infinite-dimensional phase space.

  abstract     = {We study the phase behavior of a quasi-two-dimensional cholesteric liquid crystal shell. We characterize the topological phases arising close to the isotropic-cholesteric transition and show that they differ in a fundamental way from those observed on a flat geometry. For spherical shells, we discover two types of quasi-two-dimensional topological phases: finite quasicrystals and amorphous structures, both made up of mixtures of polygonal tessellations of half-skyrmions. These structures generically emerge instead of regular double twist lattices because of geometric frustration, which disallows a regular hexagonal tiling of curved space. For toroidal shells, the variations in the local curvature of the surface stabilizes heterogeneous phases where cholesteric patterns coexist with hexagonal lattices of half-skyrmions. Quasicrystals and amorphous and heterogeneous structures could be sought experimentally by self-assembling cholesteric shells on the surface of emulsion droplets.},

We demonstrate electrical control of the Kondo correlation by coupling the bound spin to leads with tunable Rashba spin-orbit interactions, realized in semiconductor quantum point contacts. We observe a transition from single to double peak zero-bias anomalies in nonequilibrium transport—the manifestation of the Kondo effect—indicating a controlled Kondo spin reversal using only spin-orbit interactions. Universal scaling of the Kondo conductance is demonstrated, implying that the spin-orbit interactions could enhance the Kondo temperature.

Our model predicts anomalous anisotropic structures of the SHG yield contributed by the interbond electron hopping, which is identified in our experiments with ZnO crystals. Moreover, a generalized second-order susceptibility with an explicit form is proposed, which provides a unified description in both the weak and strong field regimes. Our work reveals the nonlinear responses of materials at the electron scale and extends the nonlinear optics to a previously unexplored regime, where the nonlinearity related to the interbond electron hopping becomes dominant.

  abstract     = {The ground state of two-dimensional electron systems (2DESs) at low Landau level filling factors ( ν ≲ 1 / 6 ) has long been a topic of interest and controversy in condensed matter. Following the recent breakthrough in the quality of ultrahigh-mobility GaAs 2DESs, we revisit this problem experimentally and investigate the impact of reduced disorder. In a GaAs 2DES sample with density n = 6.1 × 10 10 / cm 2 and mobility μ = 25 × 10 6 cm 2 / V s , we find a deep minimum in the longitudinal magnetoresistance ( R x x ) at ν = 1 / 7 when T ≃ 104 mK . There is also a clear sign of a developing minimum in R x x at ν = 2 / 13 . While insulating phases are still predominant when ν ≲ 1 / 6 , these minima strongly suggest the existence of fractional quantum Hall states at filling factors that comply with the Jain sequence ν = p / ( 2 m p ± 1 ) even in the very low Landau level filling limit. The magnetic-field-dependent activation energies deduced from the relation R x x ∝ e E A / 2 k T corroborate this view and imply the presence of pinned Wigner solid states when ν ≠ p / ( 2 m p ± 1 ) . Similar results are seen in another sample with a lower density, further generalizing our observations.},

We show that the material hosts a pair of real nodal rings, each protected by two topological charges: a real Chern number and a 1D winding number. The two charges generate distinct topological boundary modes at distinct boundaries. The real Chern number leads to a pair of hinge Fermi arcs, whereas the winding number protects a double drumhead surface bands. We develop a low-energy model for 3D graphdiyne which captures the essential topological physics. Experimental aspects and possible topological transition to a 3D real Chern insulator phase are discussed.},

The anisotropy of the Dirac cones and a concomitant cascade of saddle points induce a series of topological Lifshitz transitions that can be tuned by the twist angle and perpendicular electric field.

In some cases these spin-polarized, nematic insulator states are in the quantum valley Hall (QVH) phase by virtue of the nontrivial band topology of the systems. The spin-polarized insulator state is quasidegenerate with the valley polarized state if only the dominant intravalley Coulomb interaction is included. Such quasidegeneracy can be split by atomic on-site interactions such that the spin-polarized, nematic state become the unique ground state. Such a scenario applies to various twisted multilayer graphene systems at 1 / 2 filling, thus can be considered as a universal mechanism. Moreover, under vertical magnetic fields, the orbital Zeeman splittings and the field-induced change of charge density in twisted multilayer graphene systems would compete with the atomic Hubbard interactions, which can drive transitions from spin-polarized zero-Chern-number states to valley-polarized QAH states with small onset magnetic fields.},

Nevertheless, the moiré bands in heterobilayer TMDs were believed to be topologically trivial. Recently, it was reported that both a quantum valley Hall insulating state at filling ν = 2 (two holes per moiré unit cell) and a valley-polarized quantum anomalous Hall state at filling ν = 1 were observed in A B stacked moiré MoTe 2 / WSe 2 heterobilayers. However, how the topologically nontrivial states emerge is not known. In this Letter, we propose that the pseudomagnetic fields induced by lattice relaxation in moiré MoTe 2 / WSe 2 heterobilayers could naturally give rise to moiré bands with finite Chern numbers. We show that a time-reversal invariant quantum valley Hall insulator is formed at full filling ν = 2 , when two moiré bands with opposite Chern numbers are filled. At half filling ν = 1 , the Coulomb interaction lifts the valley degeneracy and results in a valley-polarized quantum anomalous Hall state, as observed in the experiment. Our theory identifies a new way to achieve topologically nontrivial states in heterobilayer TMD materials.},

Here, we report an incommensurate superstructure in monolayer TiSe 2 / CuSe / Cu ( 1 1 1 ) heterostructure. Characterizations by low-energy electron diffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy show that the main wave vector of the superstructure is ∼ 0.41 a * or ∼ 0.59 a * (here a * is in-plane reciprocal lattice constant of TiSe 2 ). After ruling out the possibility of moiré superlattices, according to the correlation of the wave vectors of the superstructure and the large indirect band gap below the Fermi level, we propose that the incommensurate superstructure is associated with an incommensurate charge density wave (I-CDW). It is noteworthy that the I-CDW is robust with a transition temperature over 600 K, much higher than that of commensurate CDW in pristine TiSe 2 . Based on our data and analysis, we present that interface effect may play a key role in the formation of the I-CDW state.},

During the decay process, the electric field carried by KAWs produces non-Maxwellian features in the particle velocity distribution functions, in accordance with space observations. The process we present solely requires the interaction of a large-scale AW with a magnetic shear and may be relevant for several astrophysical and laboratory plasmas.},

  abstract     = {The role of self-generated zonal flows in the collisionless trapped-electron-mode (CTEM) turbulence is a long-standing open issue in tokamak plasmas. Here, we show, for the first time, that the zonal flow excitation in the CTEM turbulence is formally isomorphic to that in the ion temperature gradient turbulence. Trapped electrons contribute implicitly only via linear dynamics. Theoretical analyses further suggest that, for short wavelength CTEMs, the zonal flow excitation is weak and, more importantly, not an effective saturation mechanism. Corresponding controlling parameters are also identified theoretically. These findings not only offer a plausible explanation for previous seemingly contradictory simulation results, but can also facilitate controlling the CTEM instability and transport with experimentally accessible parameters.},

In contrast to Compton scattering sources, the envisaged x-ray source exhibits an extremely narrow relative bandwidth of the order of 10 − 4 , comparable with an x-ray free-electron laser. The brilliance of the x rays can be an order of magnitude higher than that of a state-of-the-art Compton source. By tuning the laser intensities and the electron energy, one can realize either a single peak or a comblike x-ray source of around keV energy.

  abstract     = {Fluctuation-induced forces are observed in numerous physical systems spanning from quantum to macroscopic scale. However, there is as yet no experimental report of their existence in hydrodynamic turbulence. Here, we present evidence of an attraction force mediated via turbulent fluctuations by using two walls locally confining 2D turbulence. This long-range interaction is a function of the wall separation and the energy injection rate in the turbulent flow. As the wall spacing decreases, the confined flow becomes less energetic and more anisotropic in the bounded domain, producing stronger attraction. The mechanism of force generation is rooted in a nontrivial fluid-wall coupling where coherent flow structures are guided by the cavity walls. For the narrowest cavities studied, a resonance phenomenon at the flow forcing scale leads to a complex short-range interaction. The results could be relevant to problems encountered in a range of fields from industrial multiphase flows to modeling of planetary formation.},

  abstract     = {The calculation of turbulence statistics is considered the key unsolved problem of fluid mechanics, i.e., precisely the computation of arbitrary statistical velocity moments from first principles alone. Using symmetry theory, we derive turbulent scaling laws for moments of arbitrary order in two regions of a turbulent channel flow. Besides the classical scaling symmetries of space and time, the key symmetries for the present work reflect the two well-known characteristics of turbulent flows: non-Gaussianity and intermittency. To validate the new scaling laws we made a new simulation at an unprecedented friction Reynolds number of 10 000, large enough to test the new scaling laws. Two key results appear as an application of symmetry theory, which allowed us to generate symmetry invariant solutions for arbitrary orders of moments for the underlying infinite set of moment equations. First, we show that in the sense of the generalization of the deficit law all moments of the streamwise velocity in the channel center follow a power-law scaling, with exponents depending on the first and second moments alone. Second, we show that the logarithmic law of the mean streamwise velocity in wall-bounded flows is indeed a valid solution of the moment equations, and further, all higher moments in this region follow a power law, where the scaling exponent of the second moment determines all higher moments. With this we give a first complete mathematical framework for all moments in the log region, which was first discovered about 100 years ago.},

This unique shape results from the interplay between interface motion and the natural convective flows driven by the descent of relatively heavy solute. Previous investigations suggest these structures to be associated with shock formation in the underlying evolution equations, with the regularizing Gibbs-Thomson effect required for finite tip curvature. Here, we find a class of exact solutions that act as attractors for the shape dynamics in two and three dimensions. Intriguingly, the solutions exhibit large but finite tip curvature without any regularization, and they agree remarkably well with experimental measurements. The relationship between the dimensions of the initial shape and the final state of dissolution may offer a principle for estimating the age and environmental conditions of geological structures.},

Here, we present and experimentally demonstrate a scheme based on intensity interferometry to measure the joint spectral mode of photon pairs produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion. We observe correlations in the spectral phase of the photons due to chirp in the pump. We show that our scheme can be combined with stimulated emission tomography to quickly measure their mode using bright classical light. Our scheme does not require phase stability, nonlinearities, or spectral shaping and thus is an experimentally simple way of measuring the modal structure of quantum light.},

The nondipole shift of the electron momentum distribution along the light-propagation direction for high energy electrons beyond the 2 U p classical cutoff is found to be vastly different from that below this cutoff, where U p is the ponderomotive potential of the driving laser field. A local minimum structure in the momentum dependence of the nondipole shift above the cutoff is identified for the first time. With the help of classical and quantum-orbit analysis, we show that large-angle rescattering of the electrons strongly alters the partitioning of the photon momentum between electron and ion. The sensitivity of the observed nondipole shift to the electronic structure of the target atom is confirmed by three-dimensional time-dependent Schrödinger equation simulations for different model potentials.

A consistent description of the hadron suppression factor R A A and v 2 , especially at intermediate p T , however, remains a challenge. We solve this long-standing R A A ⊗ v 2 puzzle by including quark coalescence for hadronization and final state hadron cascade in the coupled linear Boltzmann transport-hydro model that combines concurrent jet transport and hydrodynamic evolution of the bulk medium. We illustrate that quark coalescence and hadron cascade, two keys to solving the puzzle, also lead to a splitting of v 2 for pions, kaons, and protons in the intermediate p T region. We demonstrate for the first time that experimental data on R A A , v 2 , and their hadron flavor dependence from low to intermediate and high p T in high-energy heavy-ion collisions can be understood within this coupled framework.},

  abstract     = {Taylor expansion in powers of baryon chemical potential ( μ B ) is an oft-used method in lattice QCD to compute QCD thermodynamics for μ B &gt; 0 . Based only upon the few known lowest order Taylor coefficients, it is difficult to discern the range of μ B where such an expansion around μ B = 0 can be trusted. We introduce a resummation scheme for the Taylor expansion of the QCD equation of state in μ B that is based on the n -point correlation functions of the conserved current ( D n ). The method resums the contributions of the first N correlation function D 1 , … , D N to the Taylor expansion of the QCD partition function to all orders in μ B . We show that the resummed partition function is an approximation to the reweighted partition function at μ B ≠ 0 . We apply the proposed approach to high-statistics lattice QCD calculations using 2 + 1 flavors of Highly Improved Staggered Quarks with physical quark masses on 32 3 × 8 lattices and for temperatures T ≈ 145 – 176 MeV . We demonstrate that, as opposed to the Taylor expansion, the resummed version not only leads to improved convergence but also reflects the zeros of the resummed partition function and severity of the sign problem, leading to its eventual breakdown. We also provide a generalization of scheme to include resummation of powers of temperature and quark masses in addition to μ B , and show that the alternative expansion scheme of [S. Borsányi et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 126 , 232001 (2021) .] is a special case of this generalized resummation.},

For significances greater than about 4 σ in both a toy problem and a simplified resonance search, we show that NS requires orders of magnitude fewer simulations than ordinary MC estimates. This is particularly relevant for high-energy physics, which adopts a 5 σ gold standard for discovery. We conclude with remarks on new connections between Bayesian and frequentist computation and possibilities for tuning NS implementations for still better performance in this setting.},

However, at the field theory level, no exact duality connecting strongly interacting bosons to weakly interacting fermions is known. Here we propose a solution to this long-standing problem. Our derivation relies on regularizing the only pointlike interaction between fermions in one dimension that induces a discontinuity in the wave function proportional to its derivative. In contrast to all known regularizations our potential is weak for small interaction strengths. Crucially, this allows one to apply standard methods of diagrammatic perturbation theory to strongly interacting bosons. As a first application we compute the finite temperature spectral function of the Cheon-Shigehara model, the fermionic model dual to the celebrated Lieb-Liniger model.},

Moreover, we find that, in the relaxation process, the order parameters of the Néel and the valence-bond-solid orders can be controlled by different length scales, although they satisfy the same equilibrium scaling forms. A dual dynamic scaling theory is then proposed. Our findings not only constitute a new realm of nonequilibrium criticality in DQCP, but also offer a controllable knob by which to investigate the dynamics in strongly correlated systems.

In this Letter, we propose a variant of quantum gate verification (QGV) that is robust to practical gate imperfections and experimentally realize efficient QGV on a 2-qubit controlled-not gate and a 3-qubit Toffoli gate using only local state preparations and measurements. The experimental results show that, by using only 1600 and 2600 measurements on average, we can verify with 95\% confidence level that the implemented controlled-not gate and Toffoli gate have fidelities of at least 99\% and 97\%, respectively. Demonstrating the superior low sample complexity and experimental feasibility of QGV, our work promises a solution to the dimensionality curse in verifying large quantum devices in the quantum era.},

Unlike the quantum spin case, however, for which the density matrix renormalization group and related matrix product state algorithms provide robust algorithms for optimizing the variational states, the optimization of cMPS for systems with inhomogeneous external potentials has been problematic. We resolve this problem by constructing a piecewise linear parameterization of the underlying matrix-valued functions, which enables the calculation of the exact reduced density matrices everywhere in the system by high-order Taylor expansions. This turns the variational cMPS problem into a variational algorithm from which both the energy and its backwards derivative can be calculated exactly and at a cost that scales as the cube of the bond dimension. We illustrate this by finding ground states of interacting bosons in external potentials and by calculating boundary or Casimir energy corrections of continuous many-body systems with open boundary conditions.},

We develop a general scheme for certifying entanglement and demonstrate it by revealing entanglement between distinct subsystems of a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. Our scheme builds on the spatially resolved simultaneous detection of the quantum field in two conjugate observables which allows the experimental confirmation of quantum correlations between local as well as nonlocal partitions of the system. The detection of squeezing in Bogoliubov modes in a multimode setting illustrates its potential to boost the capabilities of quantum simulations to study entanglement in spatially extended many-body systems.},

At short distances, we demonstrate the two-body and Efimovian character of the condensed pairs and triples, respectively. As the system evolves, their size becomes comparable to the interparticle distance, such that many-body effects become significant. The structure of the condensed triples depends on the size of Efimov states compared with density scales. Unexpectedly, we find universal condensed triples in the limit where these scales are well separated. Our findings provide a new framework for understanding dynamics in the unitary regime as the Bose-Einstein condensation of few-body composites.},

  abstract     = {Epithelial monolayers are subjected to various mechanical forces, such as stretching, shearing, and compression. Thus, its mechanical response to external loadings is essential for its biological functions. However, the mechanism of the fracture failure of the epithelial monolayer remains poorly understood. Here, by introducing a new type of topological transition, i.e., detach transition or T 4 transition, we develop a modified cellular vertex model to investigate the rupture of the cell monolayer. Interestingly, we find a brittle-to-ductile transition in epithelial monolayers, which is controlled by the mechanical properties of single cells and cell-cell contacts. We reveal that the external loadings can activate cell rearrangement in ductile cell monolayers. The plastic deformation results from the nucleation and propagation of “pentagon-heptagon defects” in analogy with the topological defects commonly seen in 2D materials. By using a simplified four-cell model, we further demonstrate that the brittle-to-ductile transition is induced by the competition between cell rearrangement and cell detachment. Our work provides a new theoretical framework to study the rupture of living tissues and may have important implications for many other biological processes, such as wound healing and tissue morphogenesis.},

We demonstrate that this time-dependent contact-scale rolling threshold controls the suspension yield stress and its aging kinetics. We identify a simple constitutive relation between the contact-scale flexural rigidity and rolling threshold, which transfers to macroscopic scales. This leads us to establishing a constitutive relation between macroscopic shear modulus and yield stress that is generic for an array of colloidal systems.},

  abstract     = {High strength-to-weight ratio materials can be constructed by either maximizing strength or minimizing weight. Tensegrity structures and aerogels take very different paths to achieving high strength-to-weight ratios but both rely on internal tensile forces. In the absence of tensile forces, removing material eventually destabilizes a structure. Attempts to maximize the strength-to-weight ratio with purely repulsive spheres have proceeded by removing spheres from already stable crystalline structures. This results in a modestly low density and a strength-to-weight ratio much worse than can be achieved with tensile materials. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a packing of hard spheres that has asymptotically zero density and yet maintains finite strength, thus achieving an unbounded strength-to-weight ratio. This construction, which we term Dionysian, is the diametric opposite to the Apollonian sphere packing which completely and stably fills space. We create tools to evaluate the stability and strength of compressive sphere packings. Using these we find that our structures have asymptotically finite bulk and shear moduli and are linearly resistant to every applied deformation, both internal and external. By demonstrating that there is no lower bound on the density of stable structures, this work allows for the construction of arbitrarily lightweight high-strength materials.},

So far, exchange coupling between chromium ions via heteroanions has not been explored and the associated quantum states are unknown. Here, we report the successful epitaxial synthesis and characterization of chromium oxide ( Cr 2 O 3 )-chromium nitride (CrN) superlattices. Room-temperature ferromagnetic spin ordering is achieved at the interfaces between these two antiferromagnets, and the magnitude of the effect decays with increasing layer thickness. First-principles calculations indicate that robust ferromagnetic spin interaction between Cr 3 + ions via anion-hybridization across the interface yields the lowest total energy. This work opens the door to fundamental understanding of the unexpected and exceptional properties of oxide-nitride interfaces and provides access to hidden phases at low-dimensional quantum heterostructures.},

More interestingly, in the isostructural material Mn Sb 2 Te 4 , the antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) states have been both observed in the bulk counterparts, which are also predicted to be topologically nontrivial. Revealing the layer-number-dependent magnetic properties of Mn Sb 2 Te 4 down to a single septuple layer (SL) is of great significance for exploring the topological phenomena. However, this is still elusive. Here, using the polar reflective magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy, both the A -type AFM and FM behaviors are observed and comprehensively studied in Mn Sb 2 Te 4 down to a single SL limit. In A -type AFM Mn Sb 2 Te 4 flakes, an obvious odd-even layer-number effect is observed. An additional surface spin-flop (SSF) transition occurs in even-SL flakes with the number of layers larger than 2. With the AFM linear-chain model, we identify that the even-SL flakes stabilize in a collinear state between the SSF transition and the spin-flop transition due to their appropriate energy ratio between the magnetic-field-scale anisotropy and interlayer interaction. In FM Mn Sb 2 Te 4 flakes, we observe very different magnetic behaviors with an abrupt spin-flipping transition and very small saturation fields, indicating a weakened interlayer interaction. By revealing the rich magnetic states of few-SL Mn Sb 2 Te 4 on the parameter space of the number of layers, external magnetic field, and temperature, our findings pave the way for further quantum transport studies of few-SL Mn Sb 2 Te 4 .},

We use this to evaluate the dynamical response of a non-Hermitian, one-dimensional Dirac model with imaginary and real masses, perturbed by a time-dependent electric field. The model has a rich phase diagram, and in particular, features a tachyon phase, where excitations travel faster than an effective speed of light. Surprisingly, we find that the dc conductivity of tachyons is finite, and the optical sum rule is exactly satisfied for all masses.

  abstract     = {A recent experiment reported the evidence of dispersing one-dimensional Majorana mode trapped by the crystalline domain walls in FeSe 0.45 Te 0.55 . Here, we perform the first-principles calculations to show that iron atoms in the domain wall spontaneously form the ferromagnetic order in line with orientation of the wall. The ferromagnetism can impose a π phase difference between the domain-wall-separated surface superconducting regimes under the appropriate width and magnetization of the wall. Accordingly, the topological surface superconducting state of FeSe 0.45 Te 0.55 can give rise to one-dimensional Majorana modes trapped by the wall. More interestingly, we further propose a surface junction in the form of FeSe 0.45 Te 0.55 -ferromagnet- FeSe 0.45 Te 0.55 , which can be adopted to create and fuse the Majorana zero modes through controlling the width or magnetization of the interior ferromagnetic barrier. The braiding and readout of Majorana zero modes can be realized by the designed device. Such surface junction has the potential application in the superconducting topological quantum computation.},

The conventional theory, i.e., the phonon gas model, fails to describe coherence and its impact on thermal transport. In this Letter, we propose a general heat conduction formalism supported by theoretical arguments and direct atomic simulations, which takes into account both the conventional phonon gas model and the wave nature of thermal phonons. By naturally introducing wave packets in the heat flux from fundamental concepts, we derive an original thermal conductivity expression including coherence times and lifetimes. Our theory and simulations reveal two distinct types of coherence, i.e., intrinsic and mutual, appearing in two different temperature ranges. This contribution establishes a fundamental frame for understanding and quantifying the coherence of thermal phonons, which should have a general impact on the estimation of the thermal properties of solids.},

The pressure and strain can also be induced by the gradually accumulated radiation disorder. However, in semiconductors, the radiation disorder accumulation typically results in the amorphization instead of engaging polymorphism. By studying these phenomena in gallium oxide we found that the amorphization may be prominently suppressed by the monoclinic to orthorhombic phase transition. Utilizing this discovery, a highly oriented single-phase orthorhombic film on the top of the monoclinic gallium oxide substrate was fabricated. Exploring this system, a novel mode of the lateral polymorphic regrowth, not previously observed in solids, was detected. In combination, these data envisage a new direction of research on polymorphs in Ga 2 O 3 and, potentially, for similar polymorphic families in other materials.},

The order-to-order phase transformation is dissected into three substages, involving energy and momentum scattering processes from optical ( A 1 ′ and E ′ ) to acoustic phonon modes [LA(M)] in subpicosecond timescale. An intermediate metallic state along the nonadiabatic transition pathway is also identified. These results have profound implications on nonequilibrium phase engineering strategies.},

Typically, metals exhibit only one of these structures at room temperature. Mechanical processing can cause phase transition in metals, however, metals that exhibit all the three crystal structures have rarely been approached, even when hydrostatic pressure or shock conditions are applied. Here, through in situ observation of the atomic-scale bending and tensile process of ∼ 5 nm -sized Ag nanowires (NWs), we show that bending is an effective method to facilitate fcc-structured Ag to access all the above-mentioned structures. The process of transitioning the fcc structure into a bcc structure, then into an hcp structure, and finally into a re-oriented fcc structure under bending has been witnessed in its entirety. This re-oriented fcc structure is twin-related to the matrix, which leads to twin nucleation without the need for partial dislocation activities. The results of this study advance our understanding of the deformation mechanism of small-sized fcc metals.},

  abstract     = {Topological metamaterials have robust properties engineered from their macroscopic arrangement, rather than their microscopic constituency. They can be designed by starting from Dirac metamaterials with either symmetry-enforced or accidental degeneracy. The latter case provides greater flexibility in the design of topological switches, waveguides, and cloaking devices, because a large number of tuning parameters can be used to break the degeneracy and induce a topological phase. However, the design of a topological logic element—a switch that can be controlled by the output of a separate switch—remains elusive. Here we numerically demonstrate a topological logic gate for ultrasound by exploiting the large phase space of accidental degeneracies in a honeycomb lattice. We find that a degeneracy can be broken by six physical parameters, and we show how to tune these parameters to create a phononic switch that transitions between a topological waveguide and a trivial insulator by ultrasonic heating. Our design scheme is directly applicable to photonic crystals and may guide the design of future electronic topological transistors.},

While a natural candidate for this phase is a unidirectional stripe phase predicted by Vorontsov and Sauls in 2007, recent nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of the superfluid order parameter rather suggest a two-dimensional PDW with noncollinear wave vectors, of possibly square or hexagonal symmetry. In this Letter, we present a general mechanism by which a PDW with the symmetry of a triangular lattice can be stabilized, based on a superfluid generalization of Landau’s theory of the liquid-solid transition. A soft-mode instability at a finite wave vector within the translationally invariant planar-distorted B phase triggers a transition from uniform superfluid to PDW that is first order due to a cubic term generally present in the PDW free-energy functional. This cubic term also lifts the degeneracy of possible PDW states in favor of those for which wave vectors add to zero in triangles, which in two dimensions uniquely selects the triangular lattice.},

We present experiments in a Couette setup of unprecedented azimuthal and axial aspect ratios. Approaching the critical point to within less than 0.1\% we determine five critical exponents, all of which are in excellent agreement with the 2 + 1 D DP universality class.

Our analysis shows that material nonlinearities combined with a static electric bias may lead to a linearized permittivity tensor that lacks the Hermitian and transpose symmetries. Remarkably, the material can either dissipate or generate energy, depending on the relative phase of the electric field components. We introduce a simple design for an electromagnetic isolator based on an idealized “MOSFET-metamaterial” and show that its performance can in principle surpass conventional Faraday isolators due to the material gain. Furthermore, it is suggested that analogous material responses may be engineered in natural media in nonequilibrium situations. Our solution determines an entirely novel paradigm to break the electromagnetic reciprocity in a bulk nonlinear material using a static electric bias.},

Despite this fundamental process being ubiquitous also in wave physics, it has only been observed once experimentally, in a water tank. Here, we measure this amplification for a nonlinear optics experiment in the superfluid regime. In particular, by focusing a weak optical beam carrying orbital angular momentum onto the core of a strong pump vortex beam, negative norm modes are generated and trapped inside the vortex core, allowing for amplification of a reflected beam. Our experiment demonstrates amplified reflection due to a novel form of nonlinear optical four-wave mixing, whose phase-relation coincides with the Zel’dovich-Misner condition for Penrose superradiance in our photon superfluid, and unveil the role played by negative frequency modes in the process.},

  abstract     = {We develop a stochastic mean-field theory to describe active frequency measurements of pulsed superradiant emission, studied in a recent experiment with strontium-87 atoms trapped in an optical lattice inside an optical cavity [M. Norcia et al. , Phys. Rev. X 8 , 021036 (2018) ]. Our theory reveals the intriguing dynamics of atomic ensembles with multiple transition frequencies, and it reproduces the superradiant beats signal, noisy power spectra, and frequency uncertainty in remarkable agreement with the experiments. Moreover, using longer superradiant pulses of similar strength and shortening the experimental duty cycle, we predict a short-term frequency uncertainty 7 × 10 − 17 / τ / s , which makes active frequency measurements with superradiant transitions comparable with the record performance of current frequency standards [M. Schioppo et al. , Nat. Photonics 11 , 48 (2017) ]. Our theory combines cavity quantum electrodynamics and quantum measurement theory, and it can be readily applied to explore conditional quantum dynamics and describe frequency measurements for other processes such as steady-state superradiance and superradiant Raman lasing.},

In this work, we study the effect of experimentally relevant positional disorder on Rydberg atoms trapped in a 2D square lattice under antiblockade (facilitation) conditions. We show that the facilitation conditions lead the connectivity graph of a particular subspace of the full Hilbert space to form a 2D Lieb lattice, which features a singular flat band. Remarkably, we find three distinct regimes as the disorder strength is varied: a critical regime, a delocalized but nonergodic regime, and a regime with a disorder-induced flat band. The critical regime’s existence depends crucially upon the singular flat band in our model, and is absent in any 1D array or ladder system. We propose to use quench dynamics to probe the three different regimes experimentally.},

  abstract     = {Circuit quantum electrodynamics is one of the most promising platforms for efficient quantum simulation and computation. In recent groundbreaking experiments, the immense flexibility of superconducting microwave resonators was utilized to realize hyperbolic lattices that emulate quantum physics in negatively curved space. Here we investigate experimentally feasible settings in which a few superconducting qubits are coupled to a bath of photons evolving on the hyperbolic lattice. We compare our numerical results for finite lattices with analytical results for continuous hyperbolic space on the Poincaré disk. We find good agreement between the two descriptions in the long-wavelength regime. We show that photon-qubit bound states have a curvature-limited size. We propose to use a qubit as a local probe of the hyperbolic bath, for example, by measuring the relaxation dynamics of the qubit. We find that, although the boundary effects strongly impact the photonic density of states, the spectral density is well described by the continuum theory. We show that interactions between qubits are mediated by photons propagating along geodesics. We demonstrate that the photonic bath can give rise to geometrically frustrated hyperbolic quantum spin models with finite-range or exponentially decaying interaction.},

However, this isolation leads to extremely slow preparation times, relying on weak spin transfer from an electron-spin ensemble. Here we propose a controllable mechanism to enhance this transfer rate. We analyze the spin dynamics of helium-3 atoms with hot, optically excited potassium atoms and reveal the formation of quasibound states in resonant binary collisions. We find a resonant enhancement of the spin-exchange cross section by up to 6 orders of magnitude and 2 orders of magnitude enhancement for the thermally averaged, polarization rate coefficient. We further examine the effect for various other noble gases and find that the enhancement is universal. We outline feasible conditions under which the enhancement may be experimentally observed and practically utilized.},

The computational cost for a correlated many-electron calculation is reduced to that of the self-consistent-field Hartree-Fock method, while the accuracy still reaches that of sophisticated configuration interaction based methods. In this method, the two-electron cumulant energy is measured with an information entropy associated with the Fermi-Dirac distribution of the occupation numbers. An eigenvalue equation for the orbitals is obtained, with the eigenvalues (orbital energies) connected to the occupation numbers through the Fermi-Dirac distribution. The occupation numbers for the strongly occupied orbitals are very close to the natural orbital occupation numbers from wave function methods. It covers in a single scheme the nondynamical correlation in weak or breaking bonds as well as the dynamical correlation at all distances. The method is well suited to large-scale potential energy surface calculation and molecular dynamics simulation.},

Such knowledge allows us to study jets based on their initial, rather than final, energy. We show how this new technique provides unique access to the genuine configuration profile of jets over the transverse plane of the nuclear collision, both with respect to their production point and their orientation. By effectively removing the selection biases induced by final-state interactions, one can analyze the potential azimuthal anisotropies of jet production associated to initial-state effects. Additionally, we demonstrate the capability of our new method to locate with precision the production point of a dijet pair in the nuclear overlap region, in what constitutes an important step forward toward the long term quest of using jets as tomographic probes of the quark-gluon plasma.},

Superseding previously applied approximations, our calculation provides the first result at this order that is valid in the entire range of dilepton invariant masses. The two-loop virtual contribution is computed by using semianalytical techniques, overcoming the technical problems in the evaluation of the relevant master integrals. The cancellation of soft and collinear singularities is achieved by a formulation of the q T subtraction formalism valid in the presence of charged massive particles in the final state. We present numerical results for the fiducial cross section and selected kinematical distributions. At large values of the lepton p T the mixed QCD-EW corrections are negative and increase in size, to about − 15\% with respect to the next-to-leading-order QCD result at p T = 500 GeV . Up to dilepton invariant masses of 1 TeV the computed corrections amount to about − 1.5\% with respect to the next-to-leading-order QCD result.},

The far-field time domain waveform of the gravitational waves produced in such a spinning encounter is computed at leading order in the post-Minkowskian (weak field, but generic velocity) expansion, and exhibits this supersymmetry. From the waveform we extract the leading-order total radiated angular momentum in a generic reference frame, and the total radiated energy in the center-of-mass frame to leading order in a low-velocity approximation.},

Here, we use a simple geometrical argument to prove that, if the hydrodynamic theory is stable according to this entropic criterion, then localized perturbations to the equilibrium state cannot propagate outside their future light cone. In other words, within relativistic hydrodynamics, acausal theories must be thermodynamically unstable, at least close to equilibrium. We show that the physical origin of this deep connection between stability and causality lies in the relationship between entropy and information. Our result may be interpreted as an “equilibrium conservation theorem,” which generalizes the Hawking-Ellis vacuum conservation theorem to finite temperature and chemical potential.},

The algebraic phase occurs for hopping decay exponents 1 &lt; p ≲ 3 / 2 , and features an algebraic entanglement entropy growth, and a slow algebraic decay of the density-density correlation function, both with a fractional exponent. It is separated from a critical phase with logarithmic entanglement growth at small, and an area law phase with constant entanglement entropy at large monitoring rates. A perturbative renormalization group analysis predicts that the transitions to the long-range phase correspond to an unconventional, modified sine-Gordon theory. Exact numerical simulations of the monitored wave functions are in excellent agreement with an analytical replica field theory approach, which confirms the view of the measurement-induced phase transition as a quantum phase transition in the dark state of an effective, non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.},

Here, we demonstrate that the nature of this transition is fundamentally altered by the presence of long-range, power-law interactions. For sufficiently weak power laws, the measurement-induced transition is described by conformal field theory, analogous to short-range-interacting hybrid circuits. However, beyond a critical power law, we demonstrate that long-range interactions give rise to a continuum of nonconformal universality classes, with continuously varying critical exponents. We numerically determine the phase diagram for a one-dimensional, long-range-interacting hybrid circuit model as a function of the power-law exponent and the measurement rate. Finally, by using an analytic mapping to a long-range quantum Ising model, we provide a theoretical understanding for the critical power law.},

In this Letter, we investigate the heat dissipation associated with finite-time information erasure and the effect of quantum coherence in such processes. By considering a scenario wherein information is encoded in an open quantum system whose dynamics are described by the Markovian Lindblad equation, we show that the dissipated heat is lower bounded by the conventional Landauer cost, as well as a correction term inversely proportional to the operational time. To clarify the relation between quantum coherence and dissipation, we derive a lower bound for heat dissipation in terms of quantum coherence. This bound quantitatively implies that the creation of quantum coherence in the energy eigenbasis during the erasure process inevitably leads to additional heat costs. The obtained bounds hold for arbitrary operational time and control protocol. By following an optimal control theory, we numerically present an optimal protocol and illustrate our findings by using a single-qubit system.},

To benchmark the method, we first show that, at a conformally invariant critical point of O(3) transition, the entanglement entropy exhibits universal scaling behavior of area law with logarithmic corner corrections, and the obtained correction exponent represents the current central charge of the critical theory. Then we move on to the deconfined quantum critical point, where we still observe similar scaling behavior, but with a very different exponent. Namely, the corner correction exponent is found to be negative. Such a negative exponent is in sharp contrast with the positivity condition of the Rényi entanglement entropy, which holds for unitary conformal field theories (CFTs). Our results unambiguously reveal fundamental differences between DQC and quantum critical points described by unitary CFTs.},

They typically transmit a high time-bandwidth product waveform and use pulse-compression reception to simultaneously achieve satisfactory range resolution and range accuracy under a peak transmitted-power constraint. Despite the many proposals for quantum radar, none have delineated the ultimate quantum limit on ranging accuracy. We derive that limit through continuous-time quantum analysis and show that quantum illumination ranging—a quantum pulse-compression radar that exploits the entanglement between a high time-bandwidth product transmitted signal pulse and and a high time-bandwidth product retained idler pulse—achieves that limit. We also show that quantum illumination ranging offers mean-squared range-delay accuracy that can be tens of dB better than that of a classical pulse-compression radar of the same pulse bandwidth and transmitted energy.},

Here, we introduce the concept of full network nonlocality, which describes correlations that necessitate all links in a network to distribute nonlocal resources. Showcasing that this notion is stronger than standard network nonlocality, we prove that the most well-known network Bell test does not witness full network nonlocality. In contrast, we demonstrate that its generalization to star networks is capable of detecting full network nonlocality in quantum theory. More generally, we point out that established methods for analyzing local and theory-independent correlations in networks can be combined in order to systematically deduce sufficient conditions for full network nonlocality in any network and input-output scenario. We demonstrate the usefulness of these methods by constructing polynomial witnesses of full network nonlocality for the bilocal scenario. Then, we show that these inequalities can be violated via quantum elegant joint measurements.},

EB states occur in the presence of exceptional points, which are non-Hermitian critical points where eigenstates coalesce and fail to span the Hilbert space. This eigenspace defectiveness not only limits the accessibility of state information but also interplays with long-range order to give rise to singular propagators only possible in non-Hermitian settings. Their resultant EB eigenstates are characterized by robust anomalously large or negative occupation probabilities, unlike ordinary Fermi sea states whose probabilities lie between 0 and 1. EB states remain robust after a variety of quantum quenches and give rise to enigmatic negative entanglement entropy contributions. Through suitable perturbations, the coefficient of the logarithmic entanglement entropy scaling can be continuously tuned. EB states represent a new avenue for robustness arising from geometric defectiveness, independent of topological protection or nonreciprocal pumping.},

To date, most answers relied on the quantum mutual information of S F , or on the Holevo bound on the channel capacity of F to communicate the classical information encoded in S . These are reasonable upper bounds on what is really needed but much harder to calculate—the accessible information in the fragment F about S . We consider a model based on imperfect c-not gates where all the above can be computed, and discuss its implications for the emergence of objective classical reality. We find that all relevant quantities, such as the quantum mutual information as well as various bounds on the accessible information exhibit similar behavior. In the regime relevant for the emergence of objective classical reality this includes scaling independent of the quality of the imperfect c-not gates or the size of E , and even nearly independent of the initial state of S .},
