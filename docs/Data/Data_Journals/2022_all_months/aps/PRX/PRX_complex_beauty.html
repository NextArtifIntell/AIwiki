  abstract     = {Phase separation of biomolecules gives rise to membraneless organelles that contribute to the spatiotemporal organization of the cell. In most cases, such biomolecular condensates contain multiple components, but the manner in which interactions between components control the stability of condensates have remained challenging to elucidate. Here, we develop an approach to determine tie-line gradients in ternary biomolecular phase-separation systems based on measurements of the dilute phase concentration of only one component. We show that the sign of the tie-line gradient is related to the cross-interaction energy between the polymers in the system and discriminates between associative and segregative phase separation. Using this approach, we study the interaction between protein fused in sarcoma (FUS) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer chains and measure positive tie-line gradients. Our results show that PEG drives phase separation through an associative interaction with FUS, other than through acting as an inert crowder. We further study the interaction between poly(A) ribonucleic acid (RNA) ( 700 – 3500 kDa [kilodalton]) and the protein G3BP1, and using the tie-line gradient as a reporter for the stoichiometry of polymers in the condensate, we determine a G3BP1-to-poly(A) RNA molar ratio of 1 ∶ 0.003 – 0.015 in the dense phase. Our framework for measuring tie-line gradients opens up a route for the characterization of interaction types and compositions in ternary phase-separation systems.},

  abstract     = {Persistent currents in annular geometries have played an important role in disclosing the quantum phase coherence of superconductors and mesoscopic electronic systems. Ultracold atomic gases in multiply connected traps also exhibit long-lived supercurrents and have attracted much interest both for fundamental studies of superfluid dynamics and as prototypes for atomtronics circuits. Here, we report on the realization of supercurrents in homogeneous, tunable fermionic rings. We gain exquisite, rapid control over quantized persistent currents in all regimes of the BCS-BEC crossover through a universal phase-imprinting technique, attaining on-demand circulations w as high as 9. High-fidelity readout of the superfluid circulation state is achieved by exploiting an interferometric protocol, which also yields local information about the superfluid phase around the ring. In the absence of externally introduced perturbations, we find the induced metastable supercurrents to be as long-lived as the atomic sample. Conversely, we trigger and inspect the supercurrent decay by inserting a single small obstacle within the ring. For circulations higher than a critical value, the quantized current is observed to dissipate via the emission of vortices, i.e., quantized phase slips, which we directly image, in good agreement with numerical simulations. The critical circulation at which the superflow becomes unstable is found to depend starkly on the interaction strength, taking its maximum value for the unitary Fermi gas. Our results demonstrate fast and accurate control of quantized collective excitations in a macroscopic quantum system and establish strongly interacting fermionic superfluids as excellent candidates for atomtronics applications.},

Here, we present a joint experiment-theory investigation of a rationally designed layered superatomic crystal of Au 6 Te 1 2 Se 8 (ATS) cubes stacked by noncovalent intercube quasibonds. We find a sequential-emerged anisotropic triple-cube charge density wave (TCCDW) and polarized metallic states below 120 K, as revealed via scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, transport measurement, Raman spectra, and density-functional theory. The polarized states are locked in an antiparallel configuration, which is required for maintaining the inversion symmetry of the center cube in the TCCDW. The antipolar metallic states are thus interweaved by the CDW and the polarized metallic states, and primarily ascribed to electronic effects via theoretical calculations. This work not only demonstrates a microscopic picture of the interweaved CDW and polarized charge orders in the superatomic crystal of ATS, but also sheds light on expanding the existing category of quantum materials to noncovalent solids.},

  abstract     = {The large-scale organization of the genome inside the cell nucleus is critical for the cell’s function. Chromatin—the functional form of DNA in cells—serves as a template for active nuclear processes such as transcription, replication, and DNA repair. Chromatin’s spatial organization directly affects its accessibility by ATP-powered enzymes, e.g., RNA polymerase II in the case of transcription. In differentiated cells, chromatin is spatially segregated into compartments—euchromatin and heterochromatin—the former being largely transcriptionally active and loosely packed, the latter containing mostly silent genes and densely compacted. The euchromatin-heterochromatin segregation is crucial for proper genomic function, yet the physical principles behind it are far from understood. Here, we model the nucleus as filled with hydrodynamically interacting active Zimm chains—chromosomes—and investigate how large heterochromatic regions form and segregate from euchromatin through their complex interactions. Each chromosome presents a block copolymer composed of heterochromatic blocks, capable of cross-linking that increases chromatin’s local compaction, and euchromatic blocks, subjected to stochastic force dipoles that capture the microscopic stresses exerted by nuclear ATPases. These active stresses lead to a dynamic self-organization of the genome, with its coherent motions driving some mixing of chromosome territories as well as large-scale heterochromatic segregation through cross-linking of distant genomic regions. We study the stresses and flows that arise in the nucleus during the heterochromatic segregation and identify their signatures in Hi-C proximity maps. Our results reveal the fundamental role of active mechanical processes and hydrodynamic interactions in the kinetics of chromatin compartmentalization and in the emergent large-scale organization of the nucleus.},

  abstract     = {The relationship between many-body interactions and dimensionality is integral to numerous emergent quantum phenomena. A striking example is the Bose gas, which upon confinement to one dimension (1D) obeys an infinite set of conservation laws, prohibiting thermalization and constraining dynamics. In our experiment, we demonstrate that such a 1D behavior can extend much further into the dimensional crossover toward 3D than expected. Starting from a weakly interacting Bose gas trapped in a highly elongated potential, we perform a quench to instigate the dynamics of a single density mode. Employing the theory of generalized hydrodynamics, we identify the dominant relaxation mechanism as the 1D dephasing of the relevant collective excitations of the system, the rapidities. Surprisingly, the dephasing remains dominant even for temperatures far exceeding conventional limits of one dimensionality where thermalization should occur. We attribute our observations to an emergent Pauli blocking of transverse excitations caused by the rapidities assuming fermionic statistics, despite the gas being purely bosonic. Thus, our study suggests that 1D physics is less fragile than previously thought, as it can persist even in the presence of significant perturbations. More broadly, by employing the exact Bethe ansatz solutions of the many-body system, we facilitate an interpretation of how the emergent macroscopic behavior arises from the microscopic interactions.},

  abstract     = {Because electrons and ions form a coupled system, it is a priori clear that the dynamics of the lattice should reflect symmetry breaking within the electronic degrees of freedom. Recently, this has been clearly evidenced for the case of time-reversal and mirror symmetry breaking by observations of a large phononic thermal Hall effect in many strongly correlated electronic materials. However, the mechanism by which time-reversal breaking and chirality is communicated to the lattice is far from evident. In this paper, we discuss how this occurs via many-body scattering of phonons by collective modes: a consequence of non-Gaussian correlations of the latter modes. We derive fundamental new results for such skew (i.e., chiral) scattering and the consequent thermal Hall conductivity. We emphasize that these results apply to any collective variables in any phase of matter: electronic, magnetic, or neither; highly fluctuating and correlated, or not. As a proof of principle, we compute general formulas for the above quantities for ordered antiferromagnets. From the latter, we obtain the scaling behavior of the phonon thermal Hall effect in clean antiferromagnets. The calculations show several different regimes and give quantitative estimates of similar order to that seen in recent experiments.},

Recent advances in electron microscopy enable the imaging of random photogenerated individual skyrmions. However, their deterministic and dynamical manipulation is hampered by the chaotic nature of such fluctuations and the intrinsically irreversible switching between different minima in the magnetic energy landscape. Here, we demonstrate a method to coherently control the rotation of a skyrmion crystal by discrete amounts at speeds which are much faster than previously observed. By employing circularly polarized femtosecond laser pulses with an energy below the band gap of the Mott insulator Cu 2 OSeO 3 , we excite a collective magnon mode via the inverse Faraday effect. This triggers coherent magnetic oscillations that directly control the rotation of a skyrmion crystal imaged by cryo-Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. The manipulation of topological order via ultrafast laser pulses shown here can be used to engineer fast spin-based logical devices.},

  abstract     = {The exploration of quantum spin liquids (QSLs) has been guided by different approaches including the resonating valence bond (RVB) picture, deconfined lattice gauge theories, and the Kitaev model. More recently, a spin-liquid ground state was numerically established on the ruby lattice, inspired by the Rydberg blockade mechanism. Here, we unify these varied approaches in a single parent Hamiltonian, in which local fluctuations of anyons stabilize deconfinement. The parent Hamiltonian is defined on kagomé triangles—each hosting four RVB-like states—and includes only Ising interactions and single-site transverse fields. In the weak-field limit, the ruby spin liquid and exactly soluble kagomé dimer models are recovered, while the strong-field limit reduces to the Kitaev honeycomb model, thereby unifying three seemingly different approaches to QSLs. We similarly obtain the chiral Yao-Kivelson model, the honeycomb toric code, and a new spin-1 quadrupolar Kitaev model. The last is shown to be in a QSL phase by a nonlocal mapping to the kagomé Ising antiferromagnet. We demonstrate various applications of our framework, including (a) an adiabatic deformation of the ruby lattice model to the exactly soluble kagomé dimer model, conclusively establishing the QSL phase in the former and (b) demystifying the dynamical protocol for measuring off-diagonal strings in the Rydberg implementation of the ruby lattice spin liquid. More generally, we find an intimate connection between Kitaev couplings and the repulsive interactions used for emergent dimer models. For instance, we show how a spin- 1 / 2 X X Z model on the ruby lattice encodes a Kitaev honeycomb model, providing a new route toward realizing the latter in cold-atom or solid-state systems.},

  abstract     = {We combine the swap Monte Carlo algorithm to long multi-CPU molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the equilibrium relaxation dynamics of model supercooled liquids over a time window covering 10 orders of magnitude for temperatures down to the experimental glass transition temperature T g . The analysis of several time correlation functions coupled to spatiotemporal resolution of particle motion allow us to elucidate the nature of the equilibrium dynamics in deeply supercooled liquids. We find that structural relaxation starts at early times in rare localized regions characterized by a waiting-time distribution that develops a power law near T g . At longer times, relaxation events accumulate with increasing probability in these regions as T g is approached. This accumulation leads to a power-law growth of the linear extension of relaxed domains with time with a large, temperature-dependent dynamic exponent. Past the average relaxation time, unrelaxed domains slowly shrink with time due to relaxation events happening at their boundaries. Our results provide a complete microscopic description of the particle motion responsible for key experimental signatures of glassy dynamics, from the shape and temperature evolution of relaxation spectra to the core features of dynamic heterogeneity. They also provide a microscopic basis to understand the emergence of dynamic facilitation in deeply supercooled liquids and allow us to critically reassess theoretical descriptions of the glass transition.},

  abstract     = {Turbulence in a conducting plasma can amplify seed magnetic fields in what is known as the turbulent, or small-scale, dynamo. The associated growth rate and emergent magnetic-field geometry depend sensitively on the material properties of the plasma, in particular on the Reynolds number Re, the magnetic Reynolds number Rm, and their ratio Pm ≡ Rm / Re . For Pm &gt; 1 , the amplified magnetic field is gradually arranged into a folded structure, with direction reversals at the resistive scale and field lines curved at the larger scale of the flow. As the mean magnetic energy grows to come into approximate equipartition with the fluid motions, this folded structure is thought to persist. Using analytical theory and high-resolution-magnetohydrodynamics simulations with the athena ++ code, we show that these magnetic folds become unstable to tearing during the nonlinear stage of the dynamo for Rm ≳ 10 4 and Re ≳ 10 3 . An Rm- and Pm-dependent tearing scale, at and below which folds are disrupted, is predicted theoretically and found to match well the characteristic field-reversal scale measured in the simulations. The disruption of folds by tearing increases the ratio of viscous-to-resistive dissipation. In the saturated state, the magnetic-energy spectrum exhibits a sub-tearing-scale steepening to a slope consistent with that predicted for tearing-mediated Alfvénic turbulence. Its spectral peak appears to be independent of the resistive scale and comparable to the driving scale of the flow, while the magnetic energy resides in a broad range of scales extending down to the field-reversal scale set by tearing. Emergence of a degree of large-scale magnetic coherence in the saturated state of the turbulent dynamo may be consistent with observations of magnetic-field fluctuations in galaxy clusters and recent laboratory experiments.},

  abstract     = {Interpreting partial information collected from systems subject to noise is a key problem across scientific disciplines. Theoretical frameworks often focus on the dynamics of variables that result from coarse-graining the internal states of a physical system. However, most experimental apparatuses can only detect a partial set of transitions, while internal states of the physical system are blurred or inaccessible. Here, we consider an observer who records a time series of occurrences of one or several transitions performed by a system, under the assumption that its underlying dynamics is Markovian. We pose the question of how one can use the transitions’ information to make inferences of dynamical, thermodynamical, and biochemical properties. First, elaborating on first-passage time techniques, we derive analytical expressions for the probabilities of consecutive transitions and for the time elapsed between them, which we call intertransition times. Second, we derive a lower bound for the entropy production rate that equals the sum of two non-negative contributions, one due to the statistics of transitions and a second due to the statistics of intertransition times. We also show that when only one current is measured, our estimate still detects irreversibility even in the absence of net currents in the transition time series. Third, we verify our results with numerical simulations using unbiased estimates of entropy production, which we make available as an open-source toolbox. We illustrate the developed framework in experimentally validated biophysical models of kinesin and dynein molecular motors, and in a minimal model for template-directed polymerization. Our numerical results reveal that while entropy production is entailed in the statistics of two successive transitions of the same type (i.e., repeated transitions), the statistics of two different successive transitions (i.e., alternated transitions) can probe the existence of an underlying disorder in the motion of a molecular motor. Taken all together, our results highlight the power of inference from transition statistics ranging from thermodynamic quantities to network-topology properties of Markov processes.},

  abstract     = {Many nonlinear systems are described by eigenmodes with amplitude-dependent frequencies, interacting strongly whenever the frequencies become commensurate at internal resonances. Fast energy exchange via the resonances holds the key to rich dynamical behavior, such as time-varying relaxation rates and signatures of nonergodicity in thermal equilibrium, revealed in the recent experimental and theoretical studies of micro- and nanomechanical resonators. However, a universal yet intuitive physical description for these diverse and sometimes contradictory experimental observations remains elusive. Here we experimentally reveal persistent nonlinear phase-locked states occurring at internal resonances and demonstrate that they are essential for understanding the transient dynamics of nonlinear systems with coupled eigenmodes. The measured dynamics of a fully observable micromechanical resonator system are quantitatively described by the lower-frequency mode entering, maintaining, and exiting a persistent phase-locked period-tripling state generated by the nonlinear driving force exerted by the higher-frequency mode. This model describes the observed phase-locked coherence times, the direction and magnitude of the energy exchange, and the resulting nonmonotonic mode energy evolution. Depending on the initial relative phase, the system selects distinct relaxation pathways, either entering or bypassing the locked state. The described persistent phase locking is not limited to particular frequency fractions or types of nonlinearities and may advance nonlinear resonator systems engineering across physical domains, including photonics as well as nanomechanics.},

We further use magnetic neutron diffraction to elucidate a rich variety of field-induced phases observed in the magnetometry.

  abstract     = {A primary requirement for a robust and unconditionally secure quantum network is the establishment of quantum nonlocal correlations over a realistic channel. While loophole-free tests of Bell nonlocality allow for entanglement certification in such a device-independent setting, they are extremely sensitive to loss and noise, which naturally arise in any practical communication scenario. Quantum steering relaxes the strict technological constraints of Bell nonlocality by reframing it in an asymmetric manner, with a trusted party only on one side. However, tests of quantum steering still require either extremely high-quality entanglement or very low loss. Here we introduce a test of quantum steering that harnesses the advantages of high-dimensional entanglement to be simultaneously noise robust and loss tolerant. Despite being constructed for qudits, our steering test is designed for single-detector measurements and is able to close the fair-sampling loophole in a time-efficient manner. We showcase the improvements over qubit-based systems by experimentally demonstrating quantum steering in up to 53 dimensions, free of the fair-sampling loophole, through simultaneous loss and noise conditions corresponding to 14.2-dB loss equivalent to 79 km of telecommunication fiber, and 36\% of white noise. We go on to show how the use of high dimensions counterintuitively leads to a dramatic reduction in total measurement time, enabling a quantum steering violation almost 2 orders of magnitude faster obtained by simply doubling the Hilbert space dimension. Our work conclusively demonstrates the significant resource advantages that high-dimensional entanglement provides for quantum steering in terms of loss, noise, and measurement time, and opens the door toward practical quantum networks with the ultimate form of security.},

  abstract     = {Exploiting near-term quantum computers and achieving practical value is a considerable and exciting challenge. Most prominent candidates as variational algorithms typically aim to find the ground state of a Hamiltonian by minimizing a single classical (energy) surface which is sampled from by a quantum computer. Here, we introduce a method we call CoVaR, an alternative means to exploit the power of variational circuits: We find eigenstates by finding joint roots of a polynomially growing number of properties of the quantum state as covariance functions between the Hamiltonian and an operator pool of our choice. The most remarkable feature of our CoVaR approach is that it allows us to fully exploit the extremely powerful classical shadow techniques; i.e., we simultaneously estimate a very large number &gt; 10 4 – 10 7 of covariances. We randomly select covariances and estimate analytical derivatives at each iteration applying a stochastic Levenberg-Marquardt step via a large but tractable linear system of equations that we solve with a classical computer. We prove that the cost in quantum resources per iteration is comparable to a standard gradient estimation; however, we observe in numerical simulations a very significant improvement by many orders of magnitude in convergence speed. CoVaR is directly analogous to stochastic gradient-based optimizations of paramount importance to classical machine learning while we also offload significant but tractable work onto the classical processor. As we demonstrate numerically, the approach shares features with phase-estimation protocols that prepare eigenstates with a dominant initial fidelity contribution.},

However, the formation of colloidal gels is beset by inadequate control over phase behavior and slow aging kinetics. In this work, we report on experiments that examine structure, structural relaxation, and dynamics in colloid-polymer suspensions, with fine, tunable control: the concentration of nonadsorbing polymer controls the strength of a depletion attraction, and an external electric field induces dipolar interactions that are instantly switchable and tunable in strength. With these switchable interactions, we have studied the “dipolar-depletion” phase diagram in real space via fluorescence confocal laser scanning microscopy. At lower polymer concentrations, combining depletion with dipolar interactions lowers the field threshold for observing ordered sheetlike dipolar structures. At intermediate polymer concentrations, depletion-induced clusters suppress field-induced ordering. At high depletion strengths, we can create partially ordered gel states. We have quantitatively characterized the transition from reversible to irreversible structures and used the cycling of the external field to accelerate aging in a gel-forming system. For processes that take months or years to study, such as the collapse of certain gels, such accelerated aging would prove extremely useful.},

The theoretical description of such superconductors involves Lifshitz invariants that are predicted to feature numerous exotic effects with so far sparse experimental evidence. Using a new observable—vortex inductance—we investigate the pinning properties of epitaxial Al / InAs -based heterostructures. We find a pronounced decrease of the vortex inductance with increasing in-plane field which corresponds to a counterintuitive increase of the pinning force. When rotating the in-plane component of the field with respect to the current direction, the pinning interaction turns out to be highly anisotropic. We analytically demonstrate that both the pinning enhancement and its anisotropy are consequences of the presence of Lifshitz invariant terms in the Ginzburg-Landau free energy. Hence, our experiment provides access to a fundamental property of Rashba superconductors and offers an entirely new approach to vortex manipulation.},

It is commonly believed that at least two modes must be involved in generating a comb. We demonstrate that a comb can be generated by a single nanomechanical mode driven by a resonant monochromatic drive. The comb emerges where the drive is still weak, so the anharmonic part of the mode potential energy remains small. We relate the experimental observation to a negative nonlinear friction induced by the resonant drive, which makes the vibrations at the drive frequency unstable. We directly map the measured trajectories of the emerging oscillations in the rotating frame and show how these oscillations lead to the frequency comb in the laboratory frame. The results go beyond nanomechanics and suggest a qualitatively new approach to generating tunable frequency combs in single-mode vibrational systems.

  abstract     = {Collectively migrating cells in living organisms are often guided by their local environment, including physical barriers and internal interfaces. Well-controlled in vitro experiments have shown that, when confined in adhesive stripes, monolayers of moderately active spindle-shaped cells self-organize at well-defined angle to the stripes’ longitudinal direction and spontaneously give rise to a simple shear flow, where the average cellular orientation smoothly varies across the system. However, the impact of physical boundaries on highly active, chaotic, multicellular systems is currently unknown, despite its potential relevance. In this work, we show that human fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080) close to an interface exhibit a spontaneous edge current with broken left-right symmetry, while in the bulk the cell flow remains chaotic. These localized edge currents result from an interplay between nematic order, microscopic chirality, and topological defects. Using a combination of in vitro experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical work, we demonstrate the presence of a self-organized layer of + 1 / 2 defects anchored at the boundary and oriented at a well-defined angle close to, but smaller than, 90° with respect to the boundary direction. These self-organized defects act as local sources of chiral active stress generating the directed edge flows. Our work therefore highlights the impact of topology on the emergence of collective cell flows at boundaries. It also demonstrates the role of chirality in the emergence of edge flows. Since chirality and boundaries are common properties of multicellular systems, this work suggests a new possible mechanism for collective cellular flows.},

The energy stability of the beams produced by that arrangement in the PWFA stage is comparable to both single-stage laser accelerators and plasma wakefield accelerators driven by conventional accelerators. Simulations support that the intrinsic insensitivity of PWFAs to driver energy fluctuations can be exploited to overcome stability limitations of state-of-the-art laser wakefield accelerators when adding a PWFA stage. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generation of electron bunches with energy spread and divergence superior to single-stage LWFAs, resulting in bunches with dense phase space and an angular-spectral charge density beyond the initial drive beam parameters. These results unambiguously show that staged LWFA-PWFA can help to tailor the electron-beam quality for certain applications and to reduce the influence of fluctuating laser drivers on the electron-beam stability. This encourages further development of this new class of staged wakefield acceleration as a viable scheme toward compact, high-quality electron beam sources.},

Through transport measurements, we observe an electronic analog of the Pomeranchuk effect at half filling of the first moiré subband, where increasing temperature paradoxically enhances charge localization. At low temperatures the system exhibits the characteristic of a Fermi liquid with strongly renormalized effective mass, suggesting a correlated metal state. The state is highly susceptible to out-of-plane electric and magnetic fields, which induce a Lifshitz transition and a metal-insulator transition (MIT), respectively. It enables identification of a tricritical point in the quantum phase diagram at the base temperature. We explain the Lifshitz transition in terms of interlayer charge transfer under the vertical electric field, which leads to the emergence of a new Fermi surface and immediate suppression of the Pomeranchuk effect. The existence of quantum criticality in the magnetic-field-induced MIT is supported by scaling behaviors of the resistance. Our work shows the 3 L − MoTe 2 / WSe 2 lies in the vicinity to the MIT point of the triangular lattice Hubbard model, rendering it a unique system to manifest the rich correlation effects at an intermediate interaction strength.},

  abstract     = {As in conventional computing, memories for quantum information benefit from high storage density and, crucially, random access, or the ability to read from or write to an arbitrarily chosen register. However, achieving such random access with quantum memories in a dense, hardware-efficient manner remains a challenge. Here we introduce a protocol using chirped pulses to encode qubits within an ensemble of quantum two-level systems, offering both random access and naturally supporting dynamical decoupling to enhance the memory lifetime. We demonstrate the protocol in the microwave regime using donor spins in silicon coupled to a superconducting cavity, storing up to four weak, coherent microwave pulses in distinct memory modes and retrieving them on demand up to 2 ms later. This approach offers the potential for microwave random access quantum memories with lifetimes exceeding seconds, while the chirped pulse phase encoding could also be applied in the optical regime to enhance quantum repeaters and networks.},

The central ingredient for Josephson diodes is the asymmetric proximity process inside the tunneling barrier. From the symmetry breaking point of view, there are two types of Josephson diodes: inversion breaking and time-reversal breaking. For the inversion breaking case, applying voltage bias could effectively tune the proximity process like the voltage-dependent Rashba coupling or electric polarization giving rise to I c ( V ) ≠ I c ( − V ) and I r + ≠ I r − . For the time-reversal breaking case, the current flow could adjust the internal time-reversal breaking field like magnetism or time-reversal breaking electron-electron pairing, which leads to I c + ≠ I c − . All these results provide a complete understanding and the general principles of realizing Josephson diodes, especially the recently found NbSe 2 / Nb 3 Br 8 / NbSe 2 Josephson diodes.},

The model combines predictions from the gauge/gravity duality with input from lattice field theory, QCD perturbation theory, chiral effective theory, and statistical modeling. It is therefore, by construction, in good agreement with theoretical constraints both at low and high densities and temperatures. The main ingredients of our setup are the nonperturbative V-QCD model based on the gauge/gravity duality, a van der Waals model for nucleon liquid, and the DD2 version of the Hempel-Schaffner-Bielich statistical model of nuclear matter. By consistently combining these models, we also obtain a description for the nuclear to quark matter phase transition and its critical end point. The parameter dependence of the model is represented by three (soft, intermediate, and stiff) variants of the equation of state, all of which agree with observational constraints from neutron stars and their mergers. We discuss resulting constraints for the equation of state, predictions for neutron stars, and the location of the critical point.},

  abstract     = {Two different heat-transport mechanisms are discussed in solids. In crystals, heat carriers propagate and scatter particlelike as described by Peierls’s formulation of the Boltzmann transport equation for phonon wave packets. In glasses, instead, carriers behave wavelike, diffusing via a Zener-like tunneling between quasidegenerate vibrational eigenstates, as described by the Allen-Feldman equation. Recently, it has been shown that these two conduction mechanisms emerge from a Wigner transport equation, which unifies and extends the Peierls-Boltzmann and Allen-Feldman formulations, allowing one to describe also complex crystals where particlelike and wavelike conduction mechanisms coexist. Here, we discuss the theoretical foundations of such transport equation as is derived from the Wigner phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics, elucidating how the interplay between disorder, anharmonicity, and the quantum Bose-Einstein statistics of atomic vibrations determines thermal conductivity. This Wigner formulation argues for a preferential phase convention for the dynamical matrix in the reciprocal Bloch representation and related off-diagonal velocity operator’s elements; such convention is the only one yielding a conductivity which is invariant with respect to the nonunique choice of the crystal’s unit cell and is size consistent. We rationalize the conditions determining the crossover from particlelike to wavelike heat conduction, showing that phonons below the Ioffe-Regel limit (i.e., with a mean free path shorter than the interatomic spacing) contribute to heat transport due to their wavelike capability to interfere and tunnel. Finally, we show that the present approach overcomes the failures of the Peierls-Boltzmann formulation for crystals with ultralow or glasslike thermal conductivity, with case studies of materials for thermal barrier coatings and thermoelectric energy conversion.},

Within our approach, singulants can be viewed as new emergent degrees of freedom which reorganize the large-order gradient expansion. We work out the physics of singulants for longitudinal flows, where they obey simple evolution equations which we compute in Müller-Israel-Stewart-like models, holography, and kinetic theory. These equations determine the dynamics of the large-order behavior of the hydrodynamic expansion, which we confirm with explicit numerical calculations. One of our key findings is a duality between singulant dynamics and a certain linear response theory problem. Finally, we discuss the role of singulants in optimal truncation of the hydrodynamic gradient expansion. A by-product of our analysis is a new Müller-Israel-Stewart-like model, where the qualitative behavior of singulants shares more similarities with holography than models considered hitherto.},

  abstract     = {Fault-tolerant quantum computing requires initializing the quantum register in a well-defined fiducial state. In solid-state systems, this is typically achieved through thermalization to a cold reservoir, such that the initialization fidelity is fundamentally limited by temperature. Here, we present a method of preparing a fiducial quantum state with a confidence beyond the thermal limit. It is based on real-time monitoring of the qubit through a negative-result measurement—the equivalent of a “Maxwell’s demon” that triggers the experiment only upon the appearance of a qubit in the lowest-energy state. We experimentally apply it to initialize an electron spin qubit in silicon, achieving a ground-state initialization fidelity of 98.9(4)\%, corresponding to a 20 × reduction in initialization error compared to the unmonitored system. A fidelity approaching 99.9\% could be achieved with realistic improvements in the bandwidth of the amplifier chain or by slowing down the rate of electron tunneling from the reservoir. We use a nuclear spin ancilla, measured in quantum nondemolition mode, to prove the value of the electron initialization fidelity far beyond the intrinsic fidelity of the electron readout. However, the method itself does not require an ancilla for its execution, saving the need for additional resources. The quantitative analysis of the initialization fidelity reveals that a simple picture of spin-dependent electron tunneling does not correctly describe the data. Our digital Maxwell’s demon can be applied to a wide range of quantum systems, with minimal demands on control and detection hardware.},

  abstract     = {The neural dynamics generating sensory, motor, and cognitive functions are commonly understood through field theories for neural population activity. Classic neural field theories are derived from highly simplified models of individual neurons, while biological neurons are highly complex cells. Integrate-and-fire models retain a key nonlinear feature of neuronal activity: Action potentials return the membrane potential to a nearly fixed reset value. This nonlinear reset of the membrane voltage after a spike is absent from classic neural field theories. Here, we develop a statistical field theory for networks of integrate-and-fire neurons with stochastic spike emission. This reveals a new mean-field theory for the activity in these networks, fluctuation corrections to the mean-field dynamics, and a mapping to a self-consistent renewal process. We use these to study the impact of the spike-driven reset of the membrane voltage on population activity. The spike reset gives rise to a multiplicative, rate-dependent leak term in the mean-field membrane voltage dynamics. This leads to bistability between quiescent and active states in the mean-field theory of homogenous and excitatory-inhibitory pulse-coupled networks. We uncover two types of fluctuation corrections to the mean-field theory, due to the nonlinear mapping from membrane voltage to spike emission and the nonlinear reset. These two fluctuation corrections can have competing effects, promoting and suppressing activity, respectively. We then examine the roles of spike resets and recurrent inhibition in stabilizing network activity. We calculate the phase diagram for inhibitory stabilization and find that an inhibition-stabilized regime occurs in wide regions of parameter space, consistent with experimental reports of inhibitory stabilization in diverse brain regions. Fluctuations narrow the region of inhibitory stabilization, consistent with their role in suppressing activity through spike resets.},

  abstract     = {We propose a microscopic picture for understanding the nonlinear rheology of supercooled liquids with soft repulsive potentials. Based on Brownian dynamics simulations of supercooled charge-stabilized colloidal suspensions, our analysis shows that the shear thinning of viscosity ( η ) at large enough shear rates ( γ ˙ ), expressed as η ∼ γ ˙ − λ , originates from the evolution of the localized elastic region (LER). An LER is a transient zone composed of the first several coordination shells of a reference particle. In response to the external shear, particles within the LER undergo nearly affine displacement before the yielding of the LER. The characteristic strain ( γ ) and size ( ξ ) of the LER, respectively, depend on the shear rate by γ ∼ γ ˙ ε and ξ ∼ γ ˙ − ν . Three exponents, λ , ε , and ν , are related by λ = 1 − ε = 4 ν . This simple relation connects the nonlinear rheology to the elastic properties and the microscopic configurational distortion of the system. The relaxation of the LER is promoted by the large-step nonaffine particle displacement along the extensional direction of the shear geometry with the step length of 0.4 particle diameter. The elastic deformation and relaxation of the LER are ubiquitous and successive in the flow, which compose the fundamental process governing the bulk nonlinear viscoelasticity. We apply this model to analyze the rheo-small-angle neutron scattering data of sheared charge-stabilized colloidal suspensions. It is seen that our model well explains the neutron spectra and the rheological data.},

  abstract     = {The interlayer coupling is emerging as a new parameter for tuning the physical properties of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials. When two identical semiconductor monolayers are stacked with a twist angle, the periodic interlayer coupling modulation due to the moiré superlattice may endow exotic physical phenomena, such as moiré excitons and correlated electronic phases. To gain insight into these new phenomena, it is crucial to unveil the underlying coupling between atomic layers. Recently, the rhombohedral-stacked transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) bilayer has attracted significant interest because of the emergence of an out-of-plane polarization from nonferroelectric monolayer constituents. However, as a key parameter responsible for the physical properties, the interlayer coupling and its relationship with ferroelectricity remain elusive. Here, we probe the asymmetric interlayer coupling between the conduction band of one layer and the valence band from the other layer in a 3 R − MoS 2 bilayer, which can be understood as a result of a layer-dependent Berry phase winding. By performing optical spectroscopy in a dual-gated device, we show an effective type-II band alignment exists at K points in the 3 R − MoS 2 bilayer. Furthermore, by unraveling various contributions to the band offset, we quantitatively determine the asymmetric interlayer coupling and spontaneous polarization in 3 R − MoS 2 . Our results unveil the physical nature of stacking-induced ferroelectricity in TMD homostructures and have important implications for moiré physics in 2D semiconductors.},

In the ferromagnetic Kitaev model, the dressed vison obtains a dispersion linear in Γ and h and a fully universal low- T mobility, μ = 6 ℏ v m 2 / ( k B T ) 2 , where v m is the velocity of Majorana fermions. In contrast, in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) Kitaev model interference effects suppress coherent propagation and an incoherent Majorana-assisted hopping leads to a T -independent mobility. The motion of a single vison due to Heisenberg interactions is strongly suppressed for both signs of the Kitaev coupling. Vison bands in AFM Kitaev models can be topological and may lead to characteristic features in the thermal Hall effects in Kitaev materials. Furthermore, we argue that vison diffusion leads to universal signatures in quench experiments.},

It is accurate for bulk as well as layered materials, and it systematically and significantly improves the performance of the present vdW-DFs for molecular problems. Importantly, vdW-DF2-ahbr also outperforms present-standard (dispersion-corrected) range-separated hybrids on a broad collection of noncovalent-interaction benchmark sets, while at the same time successfully mitigating the density-driven errors that often affect the description of molecular transition states and isomerization calculations. vdW-DF2-ahbr furthermore improves on state-of-the-art density-functional-theory approaches by succeeding at challenging problems. For example, it (1) correctly predicts both the substrate structure and the site preference for CO adsorption on Pt(111), (2) it outperforms existing nonempirical vdW-DFs for the description of CO 2 adsorption in both a functionalized and in a simple metal-organic framework, and (3) it is highly accurate for the set of base-pair interactions in a model of DNA assembly.},

  abstract     = {Monitored quantum circuits can exhibit an entanglement transition as a function of the rate of measurements, stemming from the competition between scrambling unitary dynamics and disentangling projective measurements. We study how entanglement dynamics in nonunitary quantum circuits can be enriched in the presence of charge conservation, using a combination of exact numerics and a mapping onto a statistical mechanics model of constrained hard-core random walkers. We uncover a charge-sharpening transition that separates different scrambling phases with volume-law scaling of entanglement, distinguished by whether measurements can efficiently reveal the total charge of the system. We find that while Rényi entropies grow sub-ballistically as t in the absence of measurement, for even an infinitesimal rate of measurements, all average Rényi entropies grow ballistically with time ∼ t . We study numerically the critical behavior of the charge-sharpening and entanglement transitions in U(1) circuits, and show that they exhibit emergent Lorentz invariance and can also be diagnosed using scalable local ancilla probes. Our statistical mechanical mapping technique readily generalizes to arbitrary Abelian groups, and offers a general framework for studying dissipatively stabilized symmetry-breaking and topological orders.},

For this reason, the job of testing the stability of states that are not Lorentz invariant can be very cumbersome. We show that two observers can disagree on whether a state is stable or unstable only if the perturbations can exit the light cone. Furthermore, we show that, if a perturbation exits the light cone and its intensity changes with time due to dissipation, then there are always two observers that disagree on the stability of the state. Hence, “stability” is a Lorentz-invariant property of dissipative theories if and only if the principle of causality is respected.

  abstract     = {Magnetism is one of the largest, most fundamental, and technologically most relevant fields of condensed-matter physics. Traditionally, two basic magnetic phases have been distinguished ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. The spin polarization in the electronic band structure reflecting the magnetization in ferromagnetic crystals underpins the broad range of time-reversal symmetry-breaking responses in this extensively explored and exploited type of magnets. By comparison, antiferromagnets have vanishing net magnetization. Recently, there have been observations of materials in which strong time-reversal symmetry-breaking responses and spin-polarization phenomena, typical of ferromagnets, are accompanied by antiparallel magnetic crystal order with vanishing net magnetization, typical of antiferromagnets. A classification and description based on spin-symmetry principles offers a resolution of this apparent contradiction by establishing a third distinct magnetic phase, dubbed altermagnetism. Our perspective starts with an overview of the still emerging unique phenomenology of this unconventional d -wave (or higher even-parity wave) magnetic phase, and of the wide array of altermagnetic material candidates. We illustrate how altermagnetism can enrich our understanding of overarching condensed-matter physics concepts and how it can have impact on prominent condensed-matter research areas.},

  abstract     = {Identifying phase transitions and classifying phases of matter is central to understanding the properties and behavior of a broad range of material systems. In recent years, machine-learning (ML) techniques have been successfully applied to perform such tasks in a data-driven manner. However, the success of this approach notwithstanding, we still lack a clear understanding of ML methods for detecting phase transitions, particularly of those that utilize neural networks (NNs). In this work, we derive analytical expressions for the optimal output of three widely used NN-based methods for detecting phase transitions. These optimal predictions correspond to the results obtained in the limit of high model capacity. Therefore, in practice, they can, for example, be recovered using sufficiently large, well-trained NNs. The inner workings of the considered methods are revealed through the explicit dependence of the optimal output on the input data. By evaluating the analytical expressions, we can identify phase transitions directly from experimentally accessible data without training NNs, which makes this procedure favorable in terms of computation time. Our theoretical results are supported by extensive numerical simulations covering, e.g., topological, quantum, and many-body localization phase transitions. We expect similar analyses to provide a deeper understanding of other classification tasks in condensed matter physics.},

  abstract     = {Recent series of theoretical and experimental reports have driven attention to time-reversal symmetry-breaking spintronic and spin-splitting phenomena in materials with collinear-compensated magnetic order incompatible with conventional ferromagnetism or antiferromagnetism. Here we employ an approach based on nonrelativistic spin-symmetry groups that resolves the conflicting notions of unconventional ferromagnetism or antiferromagnetism by delimiting a third basic collinear magnetic phase. We derive that all materials hosting this collinear-compensated magnetic phase are characterized by crystal-rotation symmetries connecting opposite-spin sublattices separated in the real space and opposite-spin electronic states separated in the momentum space. We describe prominent extraordinary characteristics of the phase, including the alternating spin-splitting sign and broken time-reversal symmetry in the nonrelativistic band structure, the planar or bulk d -, g -, or i -wave symmetry of the spin-dependent Fermi surfaces, spin-degenerate nodal lines and surfaces, band anisotropy of individual spin channels, and spin-split general, as well as time-reversal invariant momenta. Guided by the spin-symmetry principles, we discover in ab initio calculations outlier materials with an extraordinary nonrelativistic spin splitting, whose eV-scale and momentum dependence are determined by the crystal potential of the nonmagnetic phase. This spin-splitting mechanism is distinct from conventional relativistic spin-orbit coupling and ferromagnetic exchange, as well as from the previously considered anisotropic exchange mechanism in compensated magnets. Our results, combined with our identification of material candidates for the phase ranging from insulators and metals to a parent crystal of cuprate superconductors, underpin research of novel quantum phenomena and spintronic functionalities in high-temperature magnets with light elements, vanishing net magnetization, and strong spin coherence. In the discussion, we argue that the conflicting notions of unconventional ferromagnetism or antiferromagnetism, on the one hand, and our symmetry-based delimitation of the third phase, on the other hand, favor a distinct term referring to the phase. The alternating spin polarizations in both the real-space crystal structure and the momentum-space band structure characteristic of this unconventional magnetic phase suggest a term altermagnetism. We point out that d -wave altermagnetism represents a realization of the long-sought-after counterpart in magnetism of the unconventional d -wave superconductivity.},

However, it remains poorly understood how the dynamic interplay of these components and the cell polarity determine the emergent migration behavior at the cellular scale. Here, we combine data-driven inference with a mechanistic bottom-up approach to develop a model for protrusion and polarity dynamics in confined cell migration, revealing how the cellular dynamics adapt to confining geometries. Specifically, we use experimental data of joint protrusion-nucleus migration trajectories of cells on confining micropatterns to systematically determine a mechanistic model linking the stochastic dynamics of cell polarity, protrusions, and nucleus. This model indicates that the cellular dynamics adapt to confining constrictions through a switch in the polarity dynamics from a negative to a positive self-reinforcing feedback loop. Our model further reveals how this feedback loop leads to stereotypical cycles of protrusion-nucleus dynamics that drive the migration of the cell through constrictions. These cycles are disrupted upon perturbation of cytoskeletal components, indicating that the positive feedback is controlled by cellular migration mechanisms. Our data-driven theoretical approach therefore identifies polarity feedback adaptation as a key mechanism in confined cell migration.},

However, a fitness landscape depends on the organism’s environment, and evolution in changing environments is still poorly understood. We study a particular model of antibiotic resistance evolution in bacteria where the antibiotic concentration is an environmental parameter and the fitness landscapes incorporate trade-offs between adaptation to low and high antibiotic concentration. With evolutionary dynamics that follow fitness gradients, the evolution of the system under slowly changing antibiotic concentration resembles the athermal dynamics of disordered physical systems under external drives. Exploiting this resemblance, we show that our model can be described as a system with interacting hysteretic elements. As in the case of the driven disordered systems, adaptive evolution under antibiotic concentration cycling is found to exhibit hysteresis loops and memory formation. We derive a number of analytical results for quasistatic concentration changes. We also perform numerical simulations to study how these effects are modified under driving protocols in which the concentration is changed in discrete steps. Our approach provides a general framework for studying motifs of evolutionary dynamics in biological systems in a changing environment.},

These implications for understanding correlated materials and developing theoretical frameworks for many-body physics are of crucial importance. Here, we show that a gapless QSL can naturally emerge from a DQCP. Via large-scale tensor network simulations of a square-lattice spin- 1 / 2 frustrated Heisenberg model, both QSL-state and DQCP-type AFM-VBS transitions are observed. By tuning the coupling constants, the AFM-VBS transition vanishes, and instead, a gapless QSL phase gradually develops in between. Remarkably, along the phase boundaries of AFM-QSL and QSL-VBS transitions, we always observe the same correlation-length exponents, ν ≈ 1.0 , which is intrinsically different from the one of the DQCP-type transition, indicating new types of universality classes. Our results explicitly demonstrate a new scenario for understanding the emergence of gapless QSL from an underlying DQCP. The discovered QSL phase survives in a large region of tuning parameters, and we expect its experimental realization in solid-state materials or quantum simulators.},

  abstract     = {Discrete time crystals represent a paradigmatic nonequilibrium phase of periodically driven matter. Protecting its emergent spatiotemporal order necessitates a mechanism that hinders the spreading of defects, such as localization of domain walls in disordered quantum spin chains. In this work, we establish the effectiveness of a different mechanism arising in clean spin chains: the confinement of domain walls into “mesonic” bound states. We consider translationally invariant quantum Ising chains periodically kicked at arbitrary frequency, and we discuss two possible routes to domain-wall confinement: longitudinal fields and interactions beyond nearest neighbors. We study the impact of confinement on the order-parameter evolution by constructing domain-wall-conserving effective Hamiltonians and analyzing the resulting dynamics of domain walls. On the one hand, we show that for arbitrary driving frequency, the symmetry-breaking-induced confining potential gets effectively averaged out by the drive, leading to deconfined dynamics. On the other hand, we rigorously prove that increasing the range R of spin-spin interactions J i , j beyond nearest neighbors enhances the order-parameter lifetime exponentially in R . Our theory predictions are corroborated by a combination of exact and matrix-product-state simulations for finite and infinite chains, respectively. The long-lived stability of spatiotemporal order identified in this work does not rely on Floquet prethermalization nor on eigenstate order, but rather on the nonperturbative origin of vacuum-decay processes. We point out the experimental relevance of this new mechanism for stabilizing a long-lived time-crystalline response in Rydberg-dressed spin chains.},

  abstract     = {The synthesis of single-cycle pulses of compressed light and microwave signals sparked novel areas of fundamental research. In the field of acoustics, however, such a generation has not been introduced yet. For numerous applications, the large spatial extent of surface acoustic waves (SAW) causes unwanted perturbations and limits the accuracy of physical manipulations. Particularly, this restriction applies to SAW-driven quantum experiments with single flying electrons, where extra modulation renders the exact position of the transported electron ambiguous and leads to undesired spin mixing. Here, we address this challenge by demonstrating single-shot chirp synthesis of a strongly compressed acoustic pulse. Employing this solitary SAW pulse to transport a single electron between distant quantum dots with an efficiency exceeding 99\%, we show that chirp synthesis is competitive with regular transduction approaches. Performing a time-resolved investigation of the SAW-driven sending process, we outline the potential of the chirped SAW pulse to synchronize single-electron transport from many quantum-dot sources. By superimposing multiple pulses, we further point out the capability of chirp synthesis to generate arbitrary acoustic waveforms tailorable to a variety of (opto)nanomechanical applications. Our results shift the paradigm of compressed pulses to the field of acoustic phonons and pave the way for a SAW-driven platform of single-electron transport that is precise, synchronized, and scalable.},

  abstract     = {Macroscopic cyclic heat engines have been a major motivation for the emergence of thermodynamics. In the past decade, cyclic heat engines that have large fluctuations and operate at finite time were studied within the more modern framework of stochastic thermodynamics. The second law for such heat engines states that the efficiency cannot be larger than the Carnot efficiency. The concept of cyclic active heat engines for a system in the presence of hidden dissipative degrees of freedom, also known as a nonequilibrium or active reservoir, has also been studied in theory and experiment. Such active engines show rather interesting behavior such as an “efficiency” larger than the Carnot bound. They are also likely to play an important role in future developments, given the ubiquitous presence of active media. However, a general second law for cyclic active heat engines has been lacking so far. Here, by using a known inequality in stochastic thermodynamics for the excess entropy, we obtain a general second law for active heat engines, which does not involve the energy dissipation of the hidden degrees of freedom and is expressed in terms of quantities that can be measured directly from the observable degrees of freedom. Besides heat and work, our second law contains an information-theoretic term, which allows an active heat engine to extract work beyond the limits valid for a passive heat engine. To obtain a second law expressed in terms of observable variables in the presence of hidden degrees of freedom, we introduce a coarse-grained excess entropy and prove a fluctuation theorem for this quantity.},

We experimentally demonstrate this technique for an eight-mode integrated interferometer fabricated using femtosecond laser micromachining and four photons from a quantum dot single-photon source. We measure a four-photon indistinguishability up to 0.81 ± 0.03 . This value decreases as we intentionally alter the photon pairwise indistinguishability.

In particular, we show that by utilizing a pattern of repeated occupation measurements we can produce chiral edge transport of fermions hopping on a Lieb lattice. The procedure is similar in spirit to the use of periodic driving to induce chiral edge transport in Floquet topological insulators, while also exhibiting novel phenomena due to the nonunitary nature of the quantum measurements. We study in detail the dependence of the procedure on measurement frequency, showing that in the Zeno limit the system can be described by a classical stochastic dynamics, yielding protected transport. As the frequency of measurements is reduced, the charge flow is reduced and vanishes when no measurements are done.},

  abstract     = {Fluctuations of surfaces that harbor reactive molecules interacting across the intervening space strongly influence the reaction kinetics. One such paradigmatic system is the cell membrane, with associated proteins, binding to an interior or an exterior scaffold—for example, the cytoskeleton in the former and the extracellular matrix in the latter case. Given that membrane fluctuations are significant and regulated by the activity of the cell, we hypothesize that these active fluctuations can be tuned to influence ligand-receptor-mediated adhesion. However, a comprehensive model, deriving both binding and unbinding rates from first principles, has not yet been established, and as such, the effect of the membrane activity on the rates remains an open problem. Here, we solve this issue by establishing a systematic coarse graining procedure, providing a cascade of expressions for rates appropriate for the observed timescale, and present a scale-free formulation of rates. In the first step, we introduce a minimal model to recover the so-called Bell-Dembo rates from first principles, where the binding and unbinding rates depend on the instantaneous position of the membrane. We then derive the analytical coarse-grained rates for thermal fluctuations, recovering a result that has previously been successfully used in the literature. Finally, we expand this framework to account for active fluctuations of the membrane. In this step, we develop a mechanical model that convolutes Gauss and Laplace distributed noise. This choice may have universal features and is motivated by our analysis of measurements in two very different cell types, namely, human macrophages and red blood cells. We find that cell activation enables the formation of bonds at much larger separations between the cell and the target. This effect is significantly greater for binding to a surface on the extracellular compared to the intracellular side. We thus show that active fluctuations directly influence protein association and dissociation rates, which may have clear physiological implications that are yet to be explored.},

  abstract     = {In classical cosmological analysis of large-scale structure surveys with two-point functions, the parameter measurement precision is limited by several key degeneracies within the cosmology and astrophysics sectors. For cosmic shear, clustering amplitude σ 8 and matter density Ω m roughly follow the S 8 = σ 8 ( Ω m / 0.3 ) 0.5 relation. In turn, S 8 is highly correlated with the intrinsic galaxy alignment amplitude A IA . For galaxy clustering, the bias b g is degenerate with both σ 8 and Ω m , as well as the stochasticity r g . Moreover, the redshift evolution of intrinsic alignment (IA) and bias can cause further parameter confusion. A tomographic two-point probe combination can partially lift these degeneracies. In this work we demonstrate that a deep-learning analysis of combined probes of weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering, which we call DeepLSS, can effectively break these degeneracies and yield significantly more precise constraints on σ 8 , Ω m , A IA , b g , r g , and IA redshift evolution parameter η IA . In a simulated forecast for a stage-III survey, we find that the most significant gains are in the IA sector: the precision of A IA is increased by approximately 8 times and is almost perfectly decorrelated from S 8 . Galaxy bias b g is improved by 1.5 times, stochasticity r g by 3 times, and the redshift evolution η IA and η b by 1.6 times. Breaking these degeneracies leads to a significant gain in constraining power for σ 8 and Ω m , with the figure of merit improved by 15 times. We give an intuitive explanation for the origin of this information gain using sensitivity maps. These results indicate that the fully numerical, map-based forward-modeling approach to cosmological inference with machine learning may play an important role in upcoming large-scale structure surveys. We discuss perspectives and challenges in its practical deployment for a full survey analysis.},

The ability to chemically synthesize such systems—to generate optically addressable molecular spins—offers a modular qubit architecture which can be transported across different environments and atomistically tailored for targeted applications through bottom-up design and synthesis. Here, we demonstrate how the spin coherence in such optically addressable molecular qubits can be controlled through engineering their host environment. By inserting chromium (IV)-based molecular qubits into a nonisostructural host matrix, we generate noise-insensitive clock transitions, through a transverse zero-field splitting, that are not present when using an isostructural host. This host-matrix engineering leads to spin-coherence times of more than 1 0 μ s for optically addressable molecular spin qubits in a nuclear and electron-spin-rich environment. We model the dependence of spin coherence on transverse zero-field splitting from first principles and experimentally verify the theoretical predictions with four distinct molecular systems. Finally, we explore how to further enhance optical-spin interfaces in molecular qubits by investigating the key parameters of optical linewidth and spin-lattice relaxation time. Our results demonstrate the ability to test qubit structure-function relationships through a tunable molecular platform and highlight opportunities for using molecular qubits for nanoscale quantum sensing in noisy environments.},

Upon wetting rigid substrates, cell-substrate tension drives outward expansion of the monolayer. By contrast, upon wetting compliant substrates, cell-substrate tension is attenuated and aggregate capillary forces contribute to internal pressures that drive expansion. Thus, we show by experiments, data-driven modeling, and computational simulations that myosin-driven “active elastocapillary” effects enable adaptation of wetting mechanisms to substrate rigidity and introduce a novel, pressure-based mechanism for guiding collective cell motion.},

  abstract     = {The inference of thermodynamic quantities from the description of an only partially accessible physical system is a central challenge in stochastic thermodynamics. A common approach is coarse-graining, which maps the dynamics of such a system to a reduced effective one. While coarse-graining states of the system into compound ones is a well-studied concept, recent evidence hints at a complementary description by considering observable transitions and waiting times. In this work, we consider waiting time distributions between two consecutive transitions of a partially observable Markov network. We formulate an entropy estimator using their ratios to quantify irreversibility. Depending on the complexity of the underlying network, we formulate criteria to infer whether the entropy estimator recovers the full physical entropy production or whether it just provides a lower bound that improves on established results. This conceptual approach, which is based on the irreversibility of underlying cycles, additionally enables us to derive estimators for the topology of the network, i.e., the presence of a hidden cycle, its number of states, and its driving affinity. Adopting an equivalent semi-Markov description, our results can be condensed into a fluctuation theorem for the corresponding semi-Markov process. This mathematical perspective provides a unifying framework for the entropy estimators considered here and established earlier ones. The crucial role of the correct version of time reversal helps to clarify a recent debate on the meaning of formal versus physical irreversibility. Extensive numerical calculations based on a direct evaluation of waiting time distributions illustrate our exact results and provide an estimate on the quality of the bounds for affinities of hidden cycles.},

  abstract     = {For the brain to recognize local orientations within images, neurons must spontaneously break the translation and rotation symmetry of their response functions—an archetypal example of unsupervised learning. The dominant framework for unsupervised learning in biology is Hebb’s principle, but how Hebbian learning could break such symmetries is a longstanding biophysical riddle. Theoretical studies argue that this requires inputs to the visual cortex to invert the relative magnitude of their correlations at long distances. Empirical measurements have searched in vain for such an inversion and report the opposite to be true. We formally approach the question through the Hermitianization of a multilayer model, which maps it into a problem of zero-temperature phase transitions. In the emerging phase diagram, both symmetries break spontaneously as long as (i) recurrent interactions are sufficiently long range and (ii) Hebbian competition is duly accounted for. A key ingredient for symmetry breaking is competition among connections sprouting from the same afferent cell. Such a competition, along with simple monotonic falloff of input correlations with distance, is capable of triggering the broken-symmetry phase required by image processing. We provide analytic predictions on the relative magnitudes of the relevant length scales needed for this novel mechanism to occur. These results reconcile experimental observations to the Hebbian paradigm, shed light on a new mechanism for visual cortex development, and contribute to our growing understanding of the relationship between learning and symmetry breaking.},

  abstract     = {The flow of charge and entropy in solids usually depends on collisions decaying quasiparticle momentum. Hydrodynamic corrections can emerge, however, if most collisions among quasiparticles conserve momentum and the mean-free path approaches the sample dimensions. Here, through a study of electrical and thermal transport in antimony (Sb) crystals of various sizes, we document the emergence of a two-component fluid of electrons and phonons. Lattice thermal conductivity is dominated by electron scattering down to 0.1 K and displays prominent quantum oscillations. The Dingle mobility does not vary despite an order-of-magnitude change in transport mobility. The Bloch-Grüneisen behavior of electrical resistivity is suddenly aborted below 15 K and replaced by a quadratic temperature dependence. At the Kelvin temperature range, the phonon scattering time and the electron-electron scattering time display a similar amplitude and temperature dependence. Taken together, the results draw a consistent picture of a bifluid where frequent momentum-conserving collisions between electrons and phonons dominate the transport properties.},

For odd D we introduce the multipartite mutual information and show that it exhibits a log D L divergence as a function of system size L with a universal coefficient that is proportional to the Euler characteristic χ F of the Fermi sea. This provides a generalization, for a Fermi gas, of the well-known result for D = 1 that expresses the log L divergence of the bipartite entanglement entropy in terms of the central charge c characterizing a conformal field theory. For even D we introduce a charge-weighted entanglement entropy that is manifestly odd under a particle-hole transformation. We show that the corresponding charge-weighted mutual information exhibits a similar log D L divergence proportional to χ F . Our analysis relates the universal behavior of the multipartite mutual information in the absence of interactions to the D + 1 order equal-time density correlation function, which we show exhibits a universal behavior in the long wavelength limit proportional to χ F . Our analytic results are based on the replica method. In addition, we perform a numerical study of the charge-weighted mutual information for D = 2 that confirms several aspects of the analytic theory. Finally, we consider the effect of interactions perturbatively within the replica theory. We show that for D = 3 the log 3 L divergence of the topological mutual information is not perturbed by weak short-ranged interactions, though for D = 2 the charge-weighted mutual information is perturbed. Thus, for D = 3 the multipartite mutual information provides a robust classification that distinguishes distinct topological Fermi liquid phases.},

  abstract     = {Dry granular materials, such as sand, gravel, pills, or agricultural grains, can become rigid when compressed or sheared. Under isotropic compression, the material reaches a certain jamming density and then resists further compression. Shear jamming occurs when resistance to shear emerges in a system at a density lower than the jamming density. Although shear jamming is prevalent in frictional granular materials, their stability properties are not well described by standard elasticity theory and thus call for experimental characterization. We report on experimental observations of changes in the mechanical properties of a shear-jammed granular material subjected to small-amplitude, quasistatic cyclic shear. We study a layer of plastic disks confined to a shear cell, using photoelasticimetry to measure all interparticle vector forces. For sufficiently small cyclic shear amplitudes and large enough initial shear, the material evolves to an unexpected “ultrastable” state in which all the particle positions and interparticle contact forces remain unchanged after each complete shear cycle for thousands of cycles. The stress response of these states to small imposed shear is nearly elastic, in contrast to the original shear-jammed state.},

Building upon this, we construct hopping models to extract the effective masses of paired skyrmions, and discuss our findings and their implications for skyrmion superconductivity in relation to experiments, focusing on the dome-shaped dependence of the transition temperature on the twist angle. We also investigate the properties of spin skyrmions about the quantized anomalous Hall insulator at ν = + 3 .

  abstract     = {A two-dimensional electron system placed in a magnetic field develops Landau levels, where strong Coulomb interactions lead to the appearance of many-body correlated ground states. Quantum numbers similar to the electron spin enable the understanding and control of complex ground state order and collective excitations. Owing to its spin, valley, and orbital degrees of freedom, Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene offers a rich platform to pursue correlated phenomena in two dimensions. In this work, we fabricate dual-gated Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene devices and demonstrate unprecedented fine control over its valley isospin degrees of freedom using a perpendicular electric field. Higher sample quality enables us to probe regimes obscured by disorder in previous studies. We present evidence for a new even-denominator fractional quantum Hall state at filling factor ν = 5 / 2 . The 5 / 2 state is found to be spontaneously valley polarized in the limit of vanishing valley Zeeman splitting, consistent with a theoretical prediction made regarding the spin polarization of the Moore-Read state. In the vicinity of the even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states, we observe the appearance of the predicted Levin-Halperin daughter states of the Moore-Read Pfaffian wave function at ν = 3 / 2 and 7 / 2 and of the anti-Pfaffian at ν = 5 / 2 and − 1 / 2 . These observations suggest the breaking of particle-hole symmetry in bilayer graphene. We construct a comprehensive valley polarization phase diagram for the Jain sequence fractional states surrounding filling factor 3 / 2 . These results are well explained by a two-component composite fermion model, further demonstrating the SU(2) nature of the valley isospin in bilayer graphene. Our experiment paves the path for future efforts of manipulating the valley isospin in bilayer graphene to engineer exotic topological orders and quantum information processes.},

Here, we report on the observation of a mechanical deformation of a cloud of ultracold Rb 87 atoms due to the collective interplay of the atoms and a homogenous light field. This collective light scattering results in a self-confining potential with interesting features: It exhibits nonlocal properties, is attractive for both red- and blue-detuned light fields, and induces a remarkably strong force that depends on the gradient of the atomic density. Our experimental observations are discussed in the framework of a theoretical model based on a local-field approach for the light scattered by the atomic cloud. Our study provides a new angle on light propagation in high-density ensembles and expands the range of tools available for tailoring interactions in ultracold atomic gases.},

Monitoring rapid qubit dynamics, e.g., during quantum gates, requires more complicated methods with increased demand for prior information. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an alternative method for accurately tracking rapidly driven superconducting qubit trajectories that uses a long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial neural network with minimal prior information. Despite few training assumptions, the LSTM produces trajectories that include qubit-readout resonator correlations due to a finite detection bandwidth. In addition to revealing rotated measurement eigenstates and a reduced measurement rate in agreement with theory for a fixed drive, the trained LSTM also correctly reconstructs evolution for an unknown drive with rapid modulation.

After a quantum quench in a clean quantum many-body system they generically display a universal linear growth in time followed by saturation. While a finite subsystem is essentially at local equilibrium when the entanglement saturates, it is genuinely out of equilibrium in the growth phase. In particular, the slope of the growth carries vital information on the nature of the system’s dynamics, and its characterization is a key objective of current research. Here we show that the slope of Rényi entropies can be determined by means of a spacetime duality transformation. In essence, we argue that the slope coincides with the stationary density of entropy of the model obtained by exchanging the roles of space and time. Therefore, very surprisingly, the slope of the entanglement is expressed as an equilibrium quantity. We use this observation to find an explicit exact formula for the slope of Rényi entropies in all integrable models treatable by thermodynamic Bethe ansatz and evolving from integrable initial states. Interestingly, this formula can be understood in terms of a quasiparticle picture only in the von Neumann limit.},

An alternative to passive cooling, which brings a system to its ground state, is active feedback, which stabilizes the system at a chosen target state. This alternative, if realized, offers additional control capabilities for the design of quantum states. Here we present a feedback algorithm applied to a quantum system, which is capable of stabilizing the collective state of an ensemble from its maximum entropy state to the limit of single quantum fluctuations. Our algorithmic approach maximizes the rate of state purification given the system’s physical constants; thus it remains the optimal feedback approach even in the presence of dissipation and disorder. We test experimentally the robustness of this feedback on the highly inhomogeneous nuclear-spin ensemble of a semiconductor quantum dot, reducing nuclear-spin fluctuations 83-fold, down to 5.7(2) spin macrostates. Simulations demonstrate that without system-specific inhomogeneities, our algorithm can purify the system down to single-spin fluctuations. Further, we exploit our algorithmic approach to tailor nontrivial nuclear-spin distributions that go beyond simple polarization, including weighted bimodality and latticed multistability. This control is a precursor toward quantum-correlated macrostates, which an extended version of our algorithm could generate in homogeneous systems.},

  abstract     = {By leveraging shared entanglement between a pair of qubits, one can teleport a quantum state from one particle to another. Recent advances have uncovered an intrinsically many-body generalization of quantum teleportation, with an elegant and surprising connection to gravity. In particular, the teleportation of quantum information relies on many-body dynamics, which originate from strongly interacting systems that are holographically dual to gravity; from the gravitational perspective, such quantum teleportation can be understood as the transmission of information through a traversable wormhole. Here, we propose and analyze a new mechanism for many-body quantum teleportation—dubbed peaked-size teleportation. Intriguingly, peaked-size teleportation utilizes precisely the same type of quantum circuit as traversable wormhole teleportation yet has a completely distinct microscopic origin: It relies upon the spreading of local operators under generic thermalizing dynamics and not gravitational physics. We demonstrate the ubiquity of peaked-size teleportation, both analytically and numerically, across a diverse landscape of physical systems, including random unitary circuits, the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model (at high temperatures), one-dimensional spin chains, and a bulk theory of gravity with stringy corrections. Our results pave the way toward using many-body quantum teleportation as a powerful experimental tool for (i) characterizing the size distributions of operators in strongly correlated systems and (ii) distinguishing between generic and intrinsically gravitational scrambling dynamics. To this end, we provide a detailed experimental blueprint for realizing many-body quantum teleportation in both trapped ions and Rydberg atom arrays; effects of decoherence and experimental imperfections are analyzed.},

  abstract     = {Monopole operators are studied in a large family of quantum critical points between Dirac spin liquids and topological quantum spin liquids (QSLs): chiral and Z 2 QSLs. These quantum phase transitions are described by conformal field theories (CFTs): quantum electrodynamics in 2 + 1 dimensions with 2 N flavors of two-component massless Dirac fermions and a four-fermion interaction term. For the transition to a chiral spin liquid, it is the Gross-Neveu interaction ( QED 3 − GN ), while for the transitions to Z 2 QSLs, it is a superconducting pairing term with general spin and valley structure (generalized QED 3 − Z 2 GN ). Using the state-operator correspondence, we obtain monopole scaling dimensions to subleading order in 1 / N . For monopoles with a minimal topological charge q = 1 / 2 , the scaling dimension is 2 N × 0.265 10 at leading order, with the quantum correction being 0.118911(7) for the chiral spin liquid, and 0.102846(9) for the simplest Z 2 case (the expression is also given for a general pairing term). Although these two anomalous dimensions are nearly equal, the underlying quantum fluctuations possess distinct origins. The analogous result in QED 3 is also obtained, and we find a subleading contribution of − 0.038 138 ( 5 ) , which is slightly different from the value − 0.0383 first obtained in the literature. The scaling dimension of a QED 3 − GN monopole with minimal charge is very close to the scaling dimensions of other operators predicted to be equal by a conjectured duality between QED 3 − GN with 2 N = 2 flavors and the C P 1 model. Additionally, nonminimally charged monopoles with equal charges on both sides of the duality have similar scaling dimensions. By studying the large- q asymptotics of the scaling dimensions in QED 3 , QED 3 − GN , and QED 3 − Z 2 GN , we verify that the constant O ( q 0 ) coefficient precisely matches the universal nonperturbative prediction for CFTs with a global U(1) symmetry. Finally, we identify numerous open questions regarding the fate of monopoles and their hierarchies at transitions to spin liquids and ordered phases.},

  abstract     = {Collisionless plasmas exhibit nonthermal and anisotropic particle distributions after being energized; as a consequence, they enter a state of low Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) entropy relative to the thermal state. The Vlasov equations predict that in a collisionless plasma with closed boundaries, BG entropy is formally conserved, along with an infinite set of other Casimir invariants; this provides a seemingly strong constraint that may explain how plasmas maintain low entropy. Nevertheless, it is commonly believed that entropy production is enabled by phase mixing or nonlinear entropy cascades. The question of whether such anomalous entropy production occurs, and of how to characterize it quantitatively, is a fundamental problem in plasma physics. We construct a new theoretical framework for characterizing entropy production (in a generalized sense) based on a set of ideally conserved dimensional quantities derived from the Casimir invariants; these are referred to as the “Casimir momenta,” and they generalize the BG entropy. The growth of the Casimir momenta relative to the average particle momentum indicates entropy production. We apply this framework to quantify entropy production in particle-in-cell simulations of laminar flows and turbulent flows driven in relativistic plasma, where efficient nonthermal particle acceleration is enabled. We demonstrate that a large amount of anomalous entropy is produced by turbulence despite nonthermal features. The Casimir momenta grow to cover a range of energies in the nonthermal tail of the distribution, and we correlate their growth with spatial structures. These results have implications for reduced modeling of nonthermal particle acceleration and for diagnosing irreversible dissipation in collisionless plasmas such as the solar wind and Earth’s magnetosphere. Dimensional representations of generalized entropy analogous to the Casimir momenta may be useful for other problems in statistical physics.},

Utilizing quantum computers in such tasks to potentially enhance conventional machine-learning algorithms has emerged as a promising application but poses big challenges due to the limited number of qubits and the level of gate noise in available devices. In this work, we provide the first practical and experimental implementation of a quantum-classical generative algorithm capable of generating high-resolution images of handwritten digits with state-of-the-art gate-based quantum computers. In our quantum-assisted machine-learning framework, we implement a quantum-circuit-based generative model to learn and sample the prior distribution of a generative adversarial network. We introduce a multibasis technique which leverages the unique possibility of measuring quantum states in different bases, hence enhancing the expressivity of the prior distribution. We train this hybrid algorithm on an ion-trap device based on Yb + 171 ion qubits to generate high-quality images and quantitatively outperform comparable classical generative adversarial networks trained on the popular MNIST dataset for handwritten digits.},

We identify distinct classes of superconducting phases characterized by nonzero topological Chern numbers C = 1 and 2 and a nematic d -wave superconducting phase with a zero Chern number. The TSC states are shown to emerge from doping either a magnetic insulator or chiral spin liquid, which opens new opportunities for experimental discovery. In addition, we further classify the C = 2 class of TSC phases into an isotropic and a nematic TSC phase and present evidence of continuous quantum phase transitions from the nematic TSC phase to both isotropic TSC and nematic d -wave phases. These results provide new insight into the mechanism of TSC with an emphasis on the role played by hole dynamics, which changes spin background and drives a topological phase transition at a hole doping level around 3\% upon doping a magnetic insulator to enable the emergence of TSC.},

  abstract     = {In cuprate high- T c superconductors, resonant excitation of certain lattice vibrations has been shown to induce transient terahertz reflectivity features suggestive of nonequilibrium superconductivity above the critical temperature T c . A microscopic mechanism for these observations is still lacking. Here, time-resolved measurements of scattering-angle- and polarization-dependent second-harmonic generation in driven YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6 + x reveal a three-order-of-magnitude amplification of a 2.5-THz electronic mode, which is unique because of its symmetry, momentum, and temperature dependence. A theory for amplification of finite-momentum Josephson plasma polaritons, which are assumed to be well formed below T c but incoherent throughout the pseudogap phase, explains all these observations. A theoretical solution for the Fresnel-Floquet reflection that starts from the coherently oscillating Josephson plasma polaritons provides a possible mechanism for the nonequilibrium superconductorlike terahertz reflectivity reported earlier. Beyond the immediate case of cuprates, this work underscores the role of nonlinear mode mixing to amplify fluctuating modes above the transition temperature in a wide range of materials.},

Equivalently, any state that can be connected with a nonzero momentum state through a finite-depth local unitary transformation must also be long-range entangled. The statement can also be generalized to fermion systems. Some nontrivial consequences follow immediately from our theorem: (i) Several different types of Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-Oshikawa-Hastings theorems, including a previously unknown version involving only a discrete Z n symmetry, can be derived in a simple manner from our result; (ii) a gapped topological order (in space dimension d &gt; 1 ) must weakly break translation symmetry if one of its ground states on torus has nontrivial momentum—this generalizes the familiar physics of Tao-Thouless; (iii) our result provides further evidence of the “smoothness” assumption widely used in the classification of crystalline symmetry-protected topological phases.},

To develop a multiscale of these materials, we map the nonequilibrium phase diagram of microtubules and tip-accumulating kinesin-4 molecular motors. We find that kinesin-4 can drive either global contractions or turbulentlike extensile dynamics, depending on the concentrations of both microtubules and a bundling agent. We also observe a range of spatially heterogeneous nonequilibrium phases, including finite-sized radial asters, 1D wormlike chains, extended 2D bilayers, and system-spanning 3D active foams. Finally, we describe intricate kinetic pathways that yield microphase separated structures and arise from the inherent frustration between the orientational order of filamentous microtubules and the positional order of tip-accumulating molecular motors. Our work reveals a range of novel active states. It also shows that the form of active stresses is not solely dictated by the properties of individual motors and filaments, but is also contingent on the constituent concentrations and spatial arrangement of motors on the filaments.},

Yet, in nonergodic systems, such averaging is inconsistent; thus, identifying ergodicity breaking is essential in ecology. Using rich, high-resolution, movement data sets (greater than 7 × 10 7 localizations) from 70 individuals and continuous-time random walk modeling, we find subdiffusive behavior and ergodicity breaking in the localized movement of three species of avian predators. Small-scale, within-patch movement was found to be qualitatively different, not inferrable and separated from large-scale interpatch movement. Local search is characterized by long, power-law-distributed waiting times with a diverging mean, giving rise to ergodicity breaking in the form of considerable variability uniquely observed at this scale. This implies that wild animal movement is scale specific, with no typical waiting time at the local scale.},

We tune the strength of the electric-dipole interaction between the qubit and the resonator in situ using surface gates. We characterize the qubit-resonator coupling strength, the qubit decoherence, and the detuning noise affecting the charge qubit for different electrostatic DQD configurations. We find all quantities to be systematically tunable over more than one order of magnitude, resulting in reproducible decoherence rates Γ 2 / 2 π &lt; 5 MHz in the limit of high interdot capacitance. In the opposite limit, by reducing the interdot capacitance, we increase the DQD electric-dipole strength and, therefore, its coupling to the resonator. Employing a Josephson-junction array resonator with an impedance of approximately 4 k Ω and a resonance frequency of ω r / 2 π ∼ 5.6 GHz , we observe a coupling strength of g / 2 π ∼ 630 MHz , demonstrating the possibility to operate electrons hosted in a semiconductor DQD in the ultrastrong-coupling regime (USC).

We design the eigenfrequencies of two vibrational modes of an electromechanical resonator to be close to a ratio of 3 ∶ 1 and demonstrate that the energy supplied to the upper mode can be controllably transferred to the lower mode. With the lower mode vibrating with a period tripled that of the upper mode, the discrete time-translation symmetry imposed by the periodic drive is broken. The lower mode settles into one of three stable period-tripled states with different phases. This channel for energy transfer from the upper mode can be turned on or off without changing system parameters. When the upper mode itself becomes multistable under strong resonant or parametric drive, additional sets of coexisting period-tripled states emerge in the lower mode. In the latter case, we measure a total of six coexisting vibration states with identical amplitude but phases differing by π / 3 . Excitation of coexisting states with three different phases could open new opportunities in designing mechanical memory based on ternary logic. Coupled resonators with period-tripled states can also be used to model complex interacting systems with spin equal to one.},

Their predictive power, however, has often been thwarted by the lack of a systematic procedure to extract the relevant materials parameters from the microscopics. Here we address this limitation by establishing an unambiguous two-way mapping between spatially inhomogeneous fields and discrete lattice modes. This yields a natural treatment of gradient couplings in the macroscopic regime via a long-wavelength expansion of the crystal Hamiltonian. Our analysis reveals an inherent arbitrariness in both the flexoelectric and polarization gradient coefficients, which we ascribe to a translational freedom in the definition of the polar distortion pattern. Remarkably, such arbitrariness cancels out in all physically measurable properties (relaxed atomic structure and energetics) derived from the model, pointing to a generalized translational covariance in the continuum description of inhomogeneous ferroelectric structures. We demonstrate our claims with extensive numerical tests on 180° domain walls in common ferroelectric perovskites, finding excellent agreement between the continuum model and direct first-principles calculations.},

In contrast, for H ⊥ c , only the SC1 with μ 0 H c 2 = 2 T is observed. A simple model based on the crystal symmetry was able to reproduce the phase diagrams and their anisotropy, identifying SC1 and SC2 with even and odd parity superconducting states, respectively. However, additional orders were observed in the normal state which might have an influence on the change of the superconducting state at H * . Here, we present a comprehensive study of the angle dependence of the upper critical fields using magnetic ac susceptibility, specific heat, and torque on single crystals of CeRh 2 As 2 . The experiments show that the state SC2 is strongly suppressed when rotating the magnetic field away from the c axis and it disappears for an angle of 35°. This behavior agrees perfectly with our extended model of a pseudospin triplet state with d → vector in the plane and hence allows us to conclude that SC2 is indeed the suggested odd-parity state.},

  abstract     = {The interplay between electronic transport and antiferromagnetic order has attracted a surge of interest as recent studies show that a moderate change in the spin orientation of a collinear antiferromagnet may have a significant effect on the electronic band structure. Among numerous electrical probes to read out such a magnetic order, unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR), where the resistance changes under the reversal of the current direction, can provide rich insights into the transport properties of spin-orbit-coupled systems. However, UMR has never been observed in antiferromagnets before, given the absence of intrinsic spin-dependent scattering. Here, we report a UMR in the antiferromagnetic phase of a FeRh / Pt bilayer, which undergoes a sign change and then increases strongly with an increasing external magnetic field, in contrast to UMRs in ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic systems. We show that Rashba spin-orbit coupling alone cannot explain the sizable UMR in the antiferromagnetic bilayer and that field-induced spin canting distorts the Fermi contours to greatly enhance the UMR by 2 orders of magnitude. Our results can motivate the growing field of antiferromagnetic spintronics and suggest a route to the development of tunable antiferromagnet-based spintronics devices.},

Pairing can be mediated by phonons, the screened Coulomb force, spin or charge fluctuations, excitons, or by a combination of these. An excitonic pairing mechanism has been postulated, but experimental evidence for coupling between conduction electrons and excitons in the cuprates is sporadic. Here we use resonant inelastic x-ray scattering to monitor the temperature dependence of the d _ d exciton spectrum of Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 − x crystals with different charge carrier concentrations. We observe a significant change of the d _ d exciton spectra when the materials pass from the normal state into the superconductor state. Our observations show that the d _ d excitons start to shift up (down) in the overdoped (underdoped) sample when the material enters the superconducting phase. We attribute the superconductivity-induced effect and its sign reversal from underdoped to overdoped to the exchange coupling of the site of the d _ d exciton to the surrounding copper spins.},

The charge fractionalization at the MIT will lead to various experimental observable effects, such as a large resistivity as well as large universal resistivity jump at the continuous MIT. These predictions are different from previously proposed theory for interaction-driven continuous MIT. Physics in phases near the MIT will also be discussed.},

Here, we address precisely where this gap can be opened in the band structure of three-dimensional photonic crystals. Although strongly constrained by symmetry, this problem cannot be addressed directly with conventional band-symmetry analysis due to the existence of a photonic polarization vortex at zero frequency. We develop an approach for overcoming the associated symmetry singularity by incorporating fictitious, auxiliary longitudinal modes. Our strategy also enables us to extend recent developments in symmetry-based topological analysis to the fundamental gap of three-dimensional photonic crystals. Exploiting this, we systematically study the topology of the minimal fundamental gaps. This reveals the existence of topological gap obstructions that push the fundamental gap higher than what a conventional analysis would suggest. Our work demonstrates that topology can play a crucial role in the opening of the fundamental photonic gap and informs future theoretical and experimental searches for conventional and topological band gaps in three-dimensional photonic crystals.},

These results not only reveal the unusual valley-dependent moiré-modified electronic structure in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides, but also highlight the Γ -valley moiré bands as a promising platform for exploring strongly correlated physics in emergent honeycomb and kagome lattices at different energy scales.},

We present a magnetic and metal-insulator phase diagram and a detailed study of the dependence of the resistivity on temperature, band filling, and interlayer potential. We find that transport displays Fermi liquid, strange metal, and quantum critical behaviors in distinct regions of the phase diagram. Specifically, we find that the cube-root van Hove singularity [ ρ ( ε ) ∼ | ε | − 1 / 3 ] gives a strange metal behavior with a T -linear scattering rate and ω / T scaling.

  abstract     = {Storing memory for molecular recognition is an efficient strategy for responding to external stimuli. Biological processes use different strategies to store memory. In the olfactory cortex, synaptic connections form when stimulated by an odor and establish an associative distributed memory that can be retrieved upon reexposure to the same odors. In contrast, the immune system encodes specialized memory by diverse receptors that can recognize a multitude of evolving pathogens. Despite the mechanistic differences between memory storage in the olfactory system and the immune system, these processes can still be viewed as different information encoding strategies. Here, we develop analytical and numerical techniques for a generalized Hopfield network to probe the utility of distinct memory strategies against both static and dynamic (evolving) patterns. We find that while classical Hopfield networks with distributed memory can efficiently encode a memory of static patterns, they are inadequate against evolving patterns. To follow an evolving pattern, we show that a Hopfield network should use a higher learning rate, which can in turn distort the energy landscape associated with the stored memory attractors. Specifically, we observe the emergence of narrow connecting paths between memory attractors that lead to misclassification of evolving patterns. We demonstrate that compartmentalized networks with specialized subnetworks are the optimal solutions to memory storage for evolving patterns. We postulate that evolution of pathogens may be the reason for the immune system to be encoded in a focused memory, in contrast to the distributed memory used in the olfactory cortex that interacts with mixtures of static odors. Our approach offers a principled framework to study learning and memory retrieval in out-of-equilibrium dynamical systems.},

In this work, we present an efficient and continuously operating electro-optomechanical transducer whose mechanical mode has been optically sideband cooled to its quantum ground state. The transducer achieves a maximum efficiency of 47\% and minimum input-referred added noise of 3.2 photons in upconversion.

Unfortunately, these sensors can only detect signal fields with frequency in a few accessible ranges, typically low frequencies up to the experimentally achievable control field amplitudes and a narrow window around the sensors’ resonance frequency. Here, we develop and demonstrate a technique for sensing arbitrary-frequency signals by using the sensor qubit as a quantum frequency mixer, enabling a variety of sensing applications. The technique leverages nonlinear effects in periodically driven (Floquet) quantum systems to achieve quantum frequency mixing of the signal and an applied bias ac field. The frequency-mixed field can be detected using well-developed sensing techniques such as Rabi and CPMG with the only additional requirement of the bias field. We further show that the frequency mixing can distinguish vectorial components of an oscillating signal field, thus enabling arbitrary-frequency vector magnetometry. We experimentally demonstrate this protocol with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond to sense a 150-MHz signal field, proving the versatility of the quantum mixer sensing technique.},

  abstract     = {At high magnetic fields, monolayer graphene hosts competing phases distinguished by their breaking of the approximate SU(4) isospin symmetry. Recent experiments have observed an even denominator fractional quantum Hall state thought to be associated with a transition in the underlying isospin order from a spin-singlet charge density wave at low magnetic fields to an antiferromagnet at high magnetic fields, implying that a similar transition must occur at charge neutrality. However, this transition does not generate contrast in typical electrical transport or thermodynamic measurements and no direct evidence for it has been reported, despite theoretical interest arising from its potentially unconventional nature. Here, we measure the transmission of ferromagnetic magnons through the two-dimensional bulk of clean monolayer graphene. Using spin polarized fractional quantum Hall states as a benchmark, we find that magnon transmission is controlled by the detailed properties of the low-momentum spin waves in the intervening Hall fluid, which is highly density dependent. Remarkably, as the system is driven into the antiferromagnetic regime, robust magnon transmission is restored across a wide range of filling factors consistent with Pauli blocking of fractional quantum Hall spin-wave excitations and their replacement by conventional ferromagnetic magnons confined to the minority graphene sublattice. Finally, using devices in which spin waves are launched directly into the insulating charge-neutral bulk, we directly detect the hidden phase transition between bulk insulating charge density wave and a canted antiferromagnetic phase at charge neutrality, completing the experimental map of broken-symmetry phases in monolayer graphene.},

Here, we experimentally and theoretically study the rotational depinning and orientational dynamics of two-dimensional colloidal crystalline clusters on periodically corrugated surfaces in the presence of magnetically exerted torques. We demonstrate that the traversing of locally commensurate areas of the moiré pattern through the edges of clusters, which is hindered by potential barriers during cluster rotation, controls its rotational depinning. The experimentally measured depinning thresholds as a function of cluster size strikingly collapse onto a universal theoretical curve which predicts the possibility of a superlow-static-torque state for large clusters. We further reveal a cluster-size-independent rotation-translation depinning transition when lattice-matched clusters are driven jointly by a torque and a force. Our work provides guidelines to the design of nanomechanical devices that involve rotational motions on atomic surfaces.},

We demonstrate that these regions, which host the monomers of any maximum matching of the lattice, control the localization properties of a zero-energy quantum particle hopping on this lattice. The structure theory of Dulmage and Mendelsohn provides us with a way of identifying a complete and nonoverlapping set of such regions. This motivates our large-scale computational study of the Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition of site-diluted bipartite lattices in two and three dimensions. Our computations uncover an interesting universality class of percolation associated with the end-to-end connectivity of such monomer-carrying regions with local sublattice imbalance, which we dub Dulmage-Mendelsohn percolation. Our results imply the existence of a monomer percolation transition in the classical statistical mechanics of the associated maximally packed dimer model and the existence of a phase with area-law entanglement entropy of arbitrary many-body eigenstates of the corresponding quantum dimer model. They also have striking implications for the nature of collective zero-energy Majorana fermion excitations of bipartite networks of Majorana modes localized on sites of diluted lattices, for the character of topologically protected zero-energy wavefunctions of the bipartite random hopping problem on such lattices, and thence for the corresponding quantum percolation problem, and for the nature of low-energy magnetic excitations in bipartite quantum antiferromagnets diluted by a small density of nonmagnetic impurities.},

We find a possible signature for crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) across the superconductor separating two FQH edges. Our observed CAR probabilities in the particlelike fractional fillings are markedly higher than those in the integer and hole-conjugate fractional fillings and depend strongly on temperature and magnetic field unlike the other fillings. Further, we find a filling-independent CAR probability in integer fillings, which we attribute to spin-orbit coupling in NbN allowing for Andreev reflection between spin-polarized edges. These results provide a route to realize novel topological superconducting phases in FQH-superconductor hybrid devices based on graphene and NbN.},

  abstract     = {Power-law distributions are widely used in computational and statistical investigations of extreme events and complex systems. The usual technique to generate power-law distributed data is to first infer the scale exponent α using the observed data of interest and then sample from the associated distribution. This approach has important limitations because it relies on a fixed α (e.g., it has limited applicability in testing the family of power-law distributions) and on the hypothesis of independent observations (e.g., it ignores temporal correlations and other constraints typically present in complex systems data). Here we propose a constrained surrogate method that overcomes these limitations by choosing uniformly at random from a set of sequences exactly as likely to be observed under a discrete power law as the original sequence (i.e., regardless of α ) and by showing how additional constraints can be imposed in the sequence (e.g., the Markov transition probability between states). This nonparametric approach involves redistributing observed prime factors to randomize values in accordance with a power-law model but without restricting ourselves to independent observations or to a particular α . We test our results in simulated and real data, ranging from the intensity of earthquakes to the number of fatalities in disasters.},

  abstract     = {Understanding how symmetries encode optical polarization information into selection rules in molecules and materials is important for their optoelectronic applications including spectroscopic analysis, display technology, and quantum computation. Here, we extend polarization-dependent selection rules from atoms to solid-state systems with various point groups with the help of the rotational operator for circular polarization and the twofold rotational operator (or reflection operator) for linear polarization. We use these new selection rules to study the optical properties of twisted bilayer graphene quantum dots (TBGQDs), which inherit advantages of graphene quantum dot including its ultrathin thickness, excellent biocompatibility, and shape- and size-tunable optical absorption or emission. We study how the electronic structures and optical properties of TBGQDs rely on size, shape, twist angle, and correlation effects for TBGQDs with 10 different point groups for which we obtain an optical selection rule database. We show how current operator matrix elements identify the generalized polarization-dependent selection rules. Our results show that both the electronic and optical band gaps follow power-law size scalings with a dominant role of the twist angle. We derive an atlas of optical conductivity spectra for both size and twist angle in TBGQDs. As a result of quantum confinement effects, in the atlas a new type of optical conductivity features emerges with multiple discrete absorption frequencies ranging from infrared to ultraviolet energy, allowing for applications in photovoltaic devices and photodetectors. The atlas and size scaling provide a full structure–symmetry-function interrelation and hence offer an excellent basis for the geometrical manipulation of optical properties of TBGQDs as building blocks for novel integrated carbon optoelectronics.},

  abstract     = {The threat of global warming and the demand for reliable climate predictions pose a formidable challenge because the climate system is multiscale, high-dimensional and nonlinear. Spatiotemporal recurrences of the system hint to the presence of a low-dimensional manifold containing the high-dimensional climate trajectory that could make the problem more tractable. Here we argue that reproducing the geometrical and topological properties of the low-dimensional attractor should be a key target for models used in climate projections. In doing so, we propose a general data-driven framework to characterize the climate attractor and showcase it in the tropical Pacific Ocean using a reanalysis as observational proxy and two state-of-the-art models. The analysis spans four variables simultaneously over the periods 1979–2019 and 2060–2100. At each time t , the system can be uniquely described by a state space vector parametrized by N variables and their spatial variability. The dynamics is confined on a manifold with dimension lower than the full state space that we characterize through manifold learning algorithms, both linear and nonlinear. Nonlinear algorithms describe the attractor through fewer components than linear ones by considering its curved geometry, allowing for visualizing the high-dimensional dynamics through low-dimensional projections. The local geometry and local stability of the high-dimensional, multivariable climate attractor are quantified through the local dimension and persistence metrics. Model biases that hamper climate predictability are identified and found to be similar in the multivariate attractor of the two models during the historical period while diverging under the warming scenario considered. Finally, the relationships between different subspaces (univariate fields), and therefore among climate variables, are evaluated. The proposed framework provides a comprehensive, physically based, test for assessing climate feedbacks and opens new avenues for improving their model representation.},

  abstract     = {At cell-matrix contacts, an elastocapillary effect arises in addition to active cell traction. The coexistence of active extracellular traction and other interfacial forces at the contacts blurs their distinctive roles in tissue morphogenesis, wound healing, and cancer metastasis. Here, we first observe that cell colonies can indent soft hydrogels, forming dimples. At inhibited cell contractility, the dimples still occur but with a reduced depth. To exclude active cell traction at the cell-matrix contact, we inhibit cell contractility and measure the interfacial stresses at the colony-hydrogel-medium three-phase interfaces using the Neumann triangle method. The critical elastocapillary length scale of the colony-hydrogel contacts is found to be comparable to the cell colony size, at which the classical Johnson-Kendall-Roberts contact theory fails. Theoretical and computational models suitable for different critical elastocapillary length scales are developed to predict the elastocapillarity-induced indentation depth. A two-step traction force microscopy is, therefore, proposed to separate active cell traction from the interfacial stresses. By quantifying the elastocapillary effect separated from active cell traction, our study lays down a foundation for understanding a variety of elastocapillarity-induced mechanobiological processes in cells and tissues.},

  abstract     = {Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is a life-threatening electromechanical dysfunction of the heart associated with complex spatiotemporal dynamics of electrical excitation and mechanical contraction of the heart muscle. It has been hypothesized that VF is driven by three-dimensional rotating electrical scroll waves, which can be characterized by filamentlike electrical phase singularities or vortex filaments, but visualizing their dynamics has been a long-standing challenge. Recently, it was shown that rotating excitation waves during VF are associated with rotating waves of mechanical deformation. Three-dimensional mechanical scroll waves and mechanical filaments describing their rotational core regions were observed in the ventricles by using high-resolution ultrasound. The findings suggest that the spatiotemporal organization of cardiac fibrillation may be assessed from waves of mechanical deformation. However, the complex relationship between excitation and mechanical waves during VF is currently not understood. Here, we study the fundamental nature of mechanical phase singularities, their spatiotemporal organization, and their relation with electrical phase singularities. We demonstrate the existence of two fundamental types of mechanical phase singularities: “paired singularities,” which are colocalized with electrical phase singularities, and “unpaired singularities,” which can form independently. We show that the unpaired singularities emerge due to the anisotropy of the active force field, generated by fiber anisotropy in cardiac tissue, and the nonlocality of elastic interactions, which jointly induce strong spatiotemporal inhomogeneities in the strain fields. The inhomogeneities lead to the breakup of deformation waves and create mechanical phase singularities, even in the absence of electrical singularities, which are typically associated with excitation wave break. We exploit these insights to develop an approach to discriminate paired and unpaired mechanical phase singularities, which could potentially be used to locate electrical rotor cores from a mechanical measurement. Our findings provide a fundamental understanding of the complex spatiotemporal organization of electromechanical waves in the heart and a theoretical basis for the analysis of high-resolution ultrasound data for the three-dimensional mapping of heart rhythm disorders.},

Current approaches to analyzing such connectomes rely mainly on graph-theoretical tools, but these may downplay the complex nonlinear dynamics of single neurons and the way networks respond to their inputs. Here, we measure the functional similarity of simulated networks of neurons, by quantifying the similitude of their spiking patterns in response to the same stimuli. We find that common graph-theory metrics convey little information about the similarity of networks’ responses. Instead, we learn a functional metric between networks based on their synaptic differences and show that it accurately predicts the similarity of novel networks, for a wide range of stimuli. We then show that a sparse set of architectural features—the sum of synaptic inputs that each neuron receives and the sum of each neuron’s synaptic outputs—predicts the functional similarity of networks of up to 1000 neurons, with high accuracy. We thus suggest new architectural design principles that shape the function of neural networks. These architectural features conform with experimental evidence of homeostatic synaptic mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {In correlated electronic systems, strong interactions and the interplay between different degrees of freedom may give rise to anomalous charge-transport properties, which can be tuned by external parameters like temperature and magnetic field. Recently, magnetic quantum oscillations and metallic low-temperature thermal conductivity have been observed in the Kondo insulator YbB 12 , whose resistivity is a few orders of magnitude higher than those of conventional metals. As yet, these unusual observations are not fully understood. Here we present a detailed investigation of the behavior of YbB 12 under intense magnetic fields using both transport and torque magnetometry measurements. The Hall resistivity displays a strongly nonlinear field dependence which cannot be described using a standard two-band Drude model. A low-field Hall anomaly, reminiscent of the Hall response associated with “strange-metal” physics, develops at T &lt; 1.5 K . At two characteristic magnetic fields ( μ 0 H 1 = 19.6 T and μ 0 H 2 ∼ 31 T ), signatures appear in the Hall coefficient, magnetic torque, and magnetoresistance; the latter characteristic field coincides with the occurrence of a change in quantum-oscillation frequency. We suggest that they are likely to be field-induced Lifshitz transitions. Moreover, above 35 T, where the most pronounced quantum oscillations are detected, the background resistivity displays an unusual, nonmetallic T α behavior, with α being field dependent and varying between − 1.5 and − 2 By normalizing the Shubnikov–de Haas oscillation amplitude to this T α dependence, the calculated cyclotron mass becomes more consistent with that deduced from de Haas–van Alphen oscillations. Our results support a novel two-fluid scenario in YbB 12 : A Fermi-liquid-like fluid of charge-neutral quasiparticles coexists with charge carriers that remain in a nonmetallic state. The former experience successive Lifshitz transitions and develop Landau quantization in applied magnetic fields, while scattering between both fluids allows the Shubnikov–de Haas effect to be observed in the electrical transport. The verification of this two-fluid scenario by the data in the current work strongly suggests that YbB 12 represents a new phase of matter.},

  abstract     = {Neutral-atom arrays have recently emerged as a promising platform for quantum information processing. One important remaining roadblock for the large-scale application of these systems is the ability to perform error-corrected quantum operations. To entangle the qubits in these systems, atoms are typically excited to Rydberg states, which could decay or give rise to various correlated errors that cannot be addressed directly through traditional methods of fault-tolerant quantum computation. In this work, we provide the first complete characterization of these sources of error in a neutral-atom quantum computer and propose hardware-efficient, fault-tolerant quantum computation schemes that mitigate them. Notably, we develop a novel and distinctly efficient method to address the most important errors associated with the decay of atomic qubits to states outside of the computational subspace. These advances allow us to significantly reduce the resource cost for fault-tolerant quantum computation compared to existing, general-purpose schemes. Our protocols can be implemented in the near term using state-of-the-art neutral-atom platforms with qubits encoded in both alkali and alkaline-earth atoms.},

The resulting randomness affects biological outcomes at multiple scales, from the functional states of single proteins in a cell to the evolutionary trajectory of whole populations. Controlling how the distribution of these outcomes changes over time—via external interventions like time-varying concentrations of chemical species—is a complex challenge. In this work, we show how counterdiabatic (CD) driving, first developed to control quantum systems, provides a versatile tool for steering biological processes. We develop a practical graph-theoretic framework for CD driving in discrete-state continuous-time Markov networks. Though CD driving is limited to target trajectories that are instantaneous stationary states, we show how to generalize the approach to allow for nonstationary targets and local control—where only a subset of system states is targeted. The latter is particularly useful for biological implementations where there may be only a small number of available external control knobs, insufficient for global control. We derive simple graphical criteria for when local versus global control is possible. Finally, we illustrate the formalism with global control of a genetic regulatory switch and local control in chaperone-assisted protein folding. The derived control protocols in the chaperone system closely resemble natural control strategies seen in experimental measurements of heat shock response in yeast and E. coli .},

Here, we study how the glass-transition temperature T g varies with molecular weight M for different polymer chemistries and chain flexibilities. We find that T g ( M ) is controlled by the average mass (or volume) per conformational degree of freedom and that a “local” molecular relaxation (involving a few conformers) controls the larger-scale cooperative α relaxation responsible for T g . We propose that dynamic facilitation where a local relaxation facilitates adjacent relaxations, leading to hierarchical dynamics, can explain our observations, including logarithmic T g ( M ) dependences. Our study provides a new understanding of molecular relaxations and the glass transition in polymers, which paves the way for predictive design of polymers based on monomer-scale metrics.},

The advent of femtosecond laser pulses and extreme-ultraviolet sources allowed one to put theoretical models to the test. Recent experimental and theoretical investigations of nonequilibrium aluminum, which is considered to be a good real-world representation of an ideal free-electron metal, showed that, despite significant progress, the transient hot-electron/cold-ion state is not well understood. In particular, the role of plasmon broadening, screening, and electron degeneracy remains unclear. Here, we experimentally investigate the free-free opacity in aluminum on the few-femtosecond timescale at laser intensities close to the damage threshold. Few-femtosecond time resolution allows us to track the purely electronic contribution to nonequilibrium absorption and unambiguously separate it from the slower lattice contribution. We support the experiments with ab initio calculations and a nearly free electron model in the Sommerfeld expansion. We find that the simplest independent-particle model with a fixed band structure is sufficient to explain the experimental findings without the need to include changes in screening or electron scattering, contrasting previous observations in 3 d transition metals. We further find that electronic heating of a free-electron gas shifts the spectral weight of the absorption to higher photon energies, and we are able to distinguish the influence of the population change and the chemical potential shift based on the comparison of ab initio calculations to a simplified free-electron model. Our findings provide a benchmark for further investigations and modeling of dense nonequilibrium plasma under even more extreme conditions.},

  abstract     = {We present the first generalization of Navier-Stokes theory to relativity that satisfies all of the following properties: (a) the system coupled to Einstein’s equations is causal and strongly hyperbolic; (b) equilibrium states are stable; (c) all leading dissipative contributions are present, i.e., shear viscosity, bulk viscosity, and thermal conductivity; (d) nonzero baryon number is included; (e) entropy production is non-negative in the regime of validity of the theory; (f) all of the above hold in the nonlinear regime without any simplifying symmetry assumptions. These properties are accomplished using a generalization of Eckart’s theory containing only the hydrodynamic variables, so that no new extended degrees of freedom are needed as in Müller-Israel-Stewart theories. Property (b), in particular, follows from a more general result that we also establish, namely, sufficient conditions that when added to stability in the fluid’s rest frame imply stability in any reference frame obtained via a Lorentz transformation All of our results are mathematically rigorously established. The framework presented here provides the starting point for systematic investigations of general-relativistic viscous phenomena in neutron star mergers.},

  abstract     = {Radiation properties of a pointlike source of light, such as a molecule or a semiconductor quantum dot, can be tailored by modifying its photonic environment. This phenomenon lies at the core of cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED). Quantum dots in photonic crystal microcavities have served as a model system for exploring the CQED effects and for the realization of efficient single-photon quantum emitters. Recently, it has been suggested that quantum interference of the exciton recombination paths through the cavity and free-space modes can significantly modify the radiation. In this work, we report an unambiguous experimental observation of this fundamental effect in the emission spectra of site-controlled quantum dots positioned at prescribed locations within a photonic crystal cavity. The observed asymmetry in the polarization-resolved emission spectra strongly depends on the quantum dot position, which is confirmed by both analytical and numerical calculations. We perform quantum interferometry in the near-field zone of the radiation, retrieving the overlap and the position-dependent relative phase between the interfering free-space and cavity-mode-mediated radiative decays. The observed phenomenon is of importance for realization of photonic-crystal light emitters with near unity quantum efficiency. Our results suggest that the full description of light-matter interaction in the framework of CQED requires a modification of the conventional quantum master equation by also considering the radiation mode interference.},

Polarization-resolved RIXS spectra reveal the overwhelming dominance of the spin-flip ( Δ S = 1 ) character of this continuum with respect to the Δ S = 0 multimagnon contributions. Moreover, its incident-energy dependence is identical to that of the magnon, supporting a common physical origin. We propose that the continuum originates from the decay of the magnon into spinon pairs, and we relate it to the exceptionally high ring exchange J c ∼ J 1 of CaCuO 2 . In the infinite-layer cuprates, long-range and multisite hopping integrals are very important, and they amplify the 2D quantum magnetism effects in spite of the 3D antiferromagnetic Néel order.},

For Hermitian Hamiltonians, quantum chaotic motion is related to random matrix theory spectral correlations. Based on recent progress in the application of spectral analysis to non-Hermitian quantum systems, we show that local level statistics, which probe the dynamics around the Heisenberg time, of a non-Hermitian q -body Sachdev-Ye-Kitev (nHSYK) model with N Majorana fermions, and its chiral and complex-fermion extensions, are also well described by random matrix theory for q &gt; 2 , while for q = 2 , they are given by the equivalent of Poisson statistics. For that comparison, we combine exact diagonalization numerical techniques with analytical results obtained for some of the random matrix spectral observables. Moreover, depending on q and N , we identify 19 out of the 38 non-Hermitian universality classes in the nHSYK model, including those corresponding to the tenfold way. In particular, we realize explicitly 14 out of the 15 universality classes corresponding to non-pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians that involve universal bulk correlations of classes AI † and AII † , beyond the Ginibre ensembles. These results provide strong evidence of striking universal features in nonunitary many-body quantum chaos, which in all cases can be captured by nHSYK models with q &gt; 2 .},

In one-dimensional models, we give a useful extension of this result that demonstrates the smallness of all matrix elements of the commutator [ A 0 , B r ( t ) ] between finite-density states if t / r is sufficiently small. Our bounds are relevant for physically realistic initial conditions in experimentally realized models of interacting bosons. In particular, we prove that v can scale no faster than linear in number density in the Bose-Hubbard model: This scaling matches previous results in the high-density limit. The quantum-walk formalism underlying our proof provides an alternative method for bounding quantum dynamics in models with unbounded operators and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, where Lieb-Robinson bounds have been notoriously challenging to prove.},

This is especially puzzling, since recent studies demonstrate that a surprising amount of functionally relevant diversity is present at all levels of resolution, down to strains differing by 100 nucleotides or fewer. Rigorously defining coarse-grainability and understanding the conditions for its emergence is of critical importance for understanding microbial ecosystems. To begin addressing these questions, we propose a minimal model for investigating hierarchically structured ecosystems within the framework of resource competition. We use our model to operationally define coarse-graining quality based on reproducibility of the outcomes of a specified experiment and show that a coarse-graining can be operationally valid despite grouping together functionally diverse strains. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a high diversity of strains (while nominally more complex) may, in fact, facilitate coarse-grainability and that, at least within our model, coarse-grainability is maximized when a community is assembled in its “native” environment. Our modeling framework offers a path toward building a theoretical understanding of which ecosystem properties, and in which environmental conditions, might be predictable by coarse-grained models.},

In particular, we provide an unconditional proof of separation in expressive power between a class of widely used generative models, known as Bayesian networks, and its minimal quantum-inspired extension. We show that this expressivity enhancement is associated with quantum nonlocality and quantum contextuality. Furthermore, we numerically test this separation on standard machine-learning data sets and show that it holds for practical problems. The possibility of quantum-inspired enhancement demonstrated in this work not only sheds light on the design of useful quantum machine-learning protocols but also provides inspiration to draw on ideas from quantum foundations to improve purely classical algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Systems with low mechanical dissipation are extensively used in precision measurements such as gravitational wave detection, atomic force microscopy, and quantum control of mechanical oscillators via optomechanics and electromechanics. The mechanical quality factor ( Q ) of these systems determines the thermomechanical force noise and the thermal decoherence rate of mechanical quantum states. While the dissipation rate is typically set by the bulk acoustic properties of the material, by exploiting dissipation dilution, mechanical Q can be engineered through geometry and increased by many orders of magnitude Recently, soft clamping in combination with strain engineering has enabled room temperature quality factors approaching 10 9 in millimeter-scale resonators. Here we demonstrate a new approach to soft clamping which exploits vibrations in the perimeter of polygon-shaped resonators tethered at their vertices. In contrast to previous approaches, which rely on cascaded elements to achieve soft clamping, perimeter modes are soft clamped due to symmetry and the boundary conditions at the polygon vertices. Perimeter modes reach Q ’s of 3.6 × 10 9 —a record at room temperature—while spanning only two acoustic wavelengths. We demonstrate thermal-noise-limited force sensitivity of 1.3 aN / Hz for a 226 kHz perimeter mode with quality factor of 1.5 × 10 9 at room temperature. The small size of our devices makes them well suited for near-field integration with microcavities for quantum optomechanical experiments. Moreover, their compactness allows the realization of phononic lattices. We demonstrate a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain of high- Q perimeter modes coupled via nearest-neighbour interaction and characterize the localized edge modes.},

Here, we report on a new platform that was designed to surpass this long-standing record. The new scheme avoids inherently probabilistic protocols and, instead, combines aspects of two established quantum nonlinear systems: atom-cavity systems and Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency. We demonstrate a cnot gate between two optical photons with an average efficiency of 41.7(5)\% at a postselected process fidelity of 81(2)\%. Moreover, we extend the scheme to a cnot gate with multiple target qubits and produce entangled states of presently up to five photons. All these achievements are promising and have the potential to advance optical quantum information processing in which almost all advanced protocols would profit from high-efficiency logic gates.},

Combined with one of the recently reported isotope-shift measurements of Yb + on two optical transitions, the result allows us to construct the King plots—a set of scaled isotope shifts data on two different optical transitions plotted in two-dimensional plane. When only the leading-order terms of isotope shifts are taken into account, a King plot should exhibit a linear relation as a result of elimination of the leading nuclear-size dependence. Extremely large nonlinearity unexplainable by a quadratic field shift is revealed, which was proposed previously as a source of the observed nonlinearity of the King plot. We further construct the generalized King plot with three optical transitions so that we can eliminate the contribution arising from a higher-order effect within the standard model. Our analysis of the generalized King plot shows a deviation from linearity at the 3 σ level, indicating that there exist at least two higher-order contributions in the measured isotope shifts. Under reasonable assumptions, we obtain the upper bound of the product of the couplings for a new boson, mediating a force between electrons and neutrons— | y e y n | / ( ℏ c ) &lt; 1 × 10 − 10 for the mass less than 1 keV—with the 95\% confidence level, providing an important step toward probing new physics via isotope-shift spectroscopy.},

  abstract     = {Photoinduced ultrafast phase transitions can generate quasiequilibrium states with novel emergent properties modulated by the interplay of electronic and lattice degrees of freedoms. Therefore, accurately probing transient atomic structures and their dynamics is crucial to understand and control the interaction of electrons and lattice but remains a central challenge of ultrafast science. Using MeV ultrafast electron diffraction on single crystals, we quantitatively reveal the photoinduced lattice distortion of the monoclinic M1 phase of VO 2 . Our results resolve previous controversies concerning decoupled distortion components, as well as a proposed M2 intermediate phase. Further, we emphasize the importance of quantifying the transformed phase fraction into the metallic rutile phase, beyond previously reported analyses, and we also clarify the importance of thermal heating in assisting the insulator-metal transition. Our complementary ab initio molecular dynamics calculations support the experimental findings and identify the primary A g phonon mode coupling to photoexcitation. Our study provides the critical and previously missing precise 3D and time-resolved structural evolution of the crystal structure of photoexcited M1 VO 2 . These results provide the basis upon which to rationalize this archetypal photoinduced transition.},

  abstract     = {A general mechanism is presented by which topological physics arises in strongly correlated systems without flat bands. Starting from a charge transfer insulator, topology emerges when the charge transfer energy between the cation and anion is reduced to invert the lower Hubbard band and the spin-degenerate charge transfer band. A universal low-energy theory is developed for the inversion of the charge transfer gap in a quantum antiferromagnet. The inverted state is found to be a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator with noncoplanar magnetism. Interactions play two essential roles in this mechanism: producing the insulating gap and quasiparticle bands prior to the band inversion, and causing the change of magnetic order necessary for the QAH effect after inversion. Our theory explains the electric-field-induced transition from a correlated insulator to a QAH state in A B -stacked transition-metal-dichalcogenides bilayer MoTe 2 / WSe 2 .},

  abstract     = {As a promising avenue to obtain a new extreme ultraviolet light source and detect electronic properties, high-harmonic generation (HHG) has been actively developed in both theory and experiment. In solids lacking inversion symmetry, when electrons undergo a nonadiabatic transition, a directional charge shift occurs and is characterized by a shift vector, which measures the real-space shift of the photoexcited electron and hole. For the first time, we reveal that the shift vector plays a prominent role in the real-space tunneling mechanism of the three-step model for electrons under strong laser fields. Since the shift vector is determined by the topological properties of related wave functions, we expect that the contribution of HHG can provide direct knowledge of the band topology in noncentrosymmetric topological insulators (TIs). In both the Kane-Mele model and the realistic material BiTeI, we find that the shift vector reverses when band inversion happens during the topological phase transition between the normal insulator and the TI. Under oscillating strong laser fields, the reversal of the shift vector leads to completely opposite radiation time of high-order harmonics. This makes HHG a feasible, all-optical, strong-field method to directly identify the band inversion in noncentrosymmetric TIs.},

  abstract     = {A chiral spin liquid state is discovered in the highly frustrated, noncentrosymmetric swedenborgite compound YBaCo 3 FeO 7 , a layered kagome system of hexagonal symmetry, by advanced polarized neutron scattering from a single domain crystalline sample. The observed diffuse magnetic neutron scattering has an antisymmetric property that relates to its specific chirality, which consists of three cycloidal waves perpendicular to the c axis, forming an entity of cylindrical symmetry. Chirality and symmetry agree with relevant antisymmetric exchanges arising from broken spatial parity. Applying a Fourier analysis to the chiral interference pattern, with distinction between kagome sites and the connecting trigonal interlayer sites of threefold symmetry, the chiral spin correlation function is determined. Characteristic chiral waves originate from the trigonal sites and extend over several periods in the kagome planes. The chiral spin liquid is remarkably stable at low temperatures despite strong antiferromagnetic spin exchange. The observation raises a challenge, since the commonly accepted ground states in condensed matter either have crystalline long-range order or form a quantum liquid. We show that, within the classical theory of magnetic order, a disordered ground state may arise from chirality. The present scenario, with antisymmetric exchange acting as a frustrating gauge background that stabilizes local spin lumps, is similar to the avoided phase transition in coupled gauge and matter fields for subnuclear particles.},

We demonstrate several attractive properties of this atom for its use as a building block of a quantum information processing platform. Its nuclear spin of 1 / 2 serves as a long-lived and coherent two-level system, while its rich, alkaline-earth-like electronic structure allows for low-entropy preparation, fast qubit control, and high-fidelity readout. We present a near-deterministic loading protocol, which allows us to fill a 10 × 10 tweezer array with 92.73(8)\% efficiency and a single tweezer with 96.0(1.4)\% efficiency. In the future, this loading protocol will enable efficient and uniform loading of target arrays with high probability, an essential step in quantum simulation and information applications. Employing a robust optical approach, we perform submicrosecond qubit rotations and characterize their fidelity through randomized benchmarking, yielding 5.2 ( 5 ) × 10 − 3 error per Clifford gate. For quantum memory applications, we measure the coherence of our qubits with T 2 * = 3.7 ( 4 ) s and T 2 = 7.9 ( 4 ) s , many orders of magnitude longer than our qubit rotation pulses. We measure spin depolarization times on the order of tens of seconds and find that this can be increased to the 100 s scale through the application of a several-gauss magnetic field. Finally, we use 3D Raman-sideband cooling to bring the atoms near their motional ground state, which will be central to future implementations of two-qubit gates that benefit from low motional entropy.},

As the two spins are brought into resonance with each other, but detuned from the photons, an avoided crossing larger than the spin linewidths is observed with an exchange splitting around 2 J / 2 π = 20 MHz . In addition, photon-number states are resolved from the shift 2 χ s / 2 π = − 13 MHz that they induce on the spin frequency. These observations demonstrate that we reach the strong dispersive regime of circuit quantum electrodynamics with spins.

  abstract     = {The material α − RuCl 3 has been the subject of intense scrutiny as a potential Kitaev quantum spin liquid, predicted to display Majorana fermions as low-energy excitations. In practice, α − RuCl 3 undergoes a transition to a state with antiferromagnetic order below a temperature T N ≈ 7 K , but this order can be suppressed by applying an external in-plane magnetic field of H ∥ = 7 T . Whether a quantum spin liquid phase exists just above that field is still an open question, but the reported observation of a quantized thermal Hall conductivity at H ∥ &gt; 7 T by Kasahara and co-workers [ Nature (London) 559 , 227 (2018) ] has been interpreted as evidence of itinerant Majorana fermions in the Kitaev quantum spin liquid state. In this study, we reexamine the origin of the thermal Hall conductivity κ x y in α − RuCl 3 . Our measurements of κ x y ( T ) on several different crystals yield a temperature dependence very similar to that of the phonon-dominated longitudinal thermal conductivity κ x x ( T ) , for which the natural explanation is that κ x y is also mostly carried by phonons. Upon cooling, κ x x peaks at T ≃ 20 K , then drops until T N , whereupon it suddenly increases again. The abrupt increase below T N is attributed to a sudden reduction in the scattering of phonons by low-energy spin fluctuations as these become partially gapped when the system orders. The fact that κ x y also increases suddenly below T N is strong evidence that the thermal Hall effect in α − RuCl 3 is also carried predominantly by phonons. This implies that any quantized signal from Majorana edge modes would have to come on top of a sizable—and sample-dependent—phonon background.},

Here we probe the effects of associating groups on the structure and dynamics of linear polymer melts in uniaxial elongation using molecular dynamics simulations. We study model polymers with randomly incorporated backbone associations with interaction strengths varying from 1 k B T to 10 k B T . These associating groups drive the formation of clusters in equilibrium with an average size that increases with interaction strength. Flow drives these clusters to continuously break and reform as chains stretch.

We classify all thermal emitters based on their symmetries using the known list of all three-dimensional Shubnikov point groups. Each class possesses its own set of laws that relates the absorptivity and emissivity.

  abstract     = {Many inexplicable phenomena in low-temperature many-body physics are a result of macroscopic quantum effects. Such macroscopic quantumness is often evaluated via long-range entanglement, that is, entanglement in the macroscopic length scale. Long-range entanglement is employed to characterize novel quantum phases and serves as a critical resource for quantum computation. However, the conditions under which long-range entanglement is stable, even at room temperatures, remain unclear. In this regard, this study demonstrates the unstable nature of bipartite long-range entanglement at arbitrary temperatures, which exponentially decays with distance. The proposed theorem is a no-go theorem pertaining to the existence of long-range entanglement. The obtained results are consistent with existing observations, indicating that long-range entanglement at nonzero temperatures can exist in topologically ordered phases, where tripartite correlations are dominant. The derivation in this study introduces a quantum correlation defined by the convex roof of the standard correlation function. Further, an exponential clustering theorem for generic quantum many-body systems under such a quantum correlation at arbitrary temperatures is established, which yields the primary result by relating quantum correlation with quantum entanglement. Moreover, a simple application of analytical techniques is demonstrated by deriving a general limit on the Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew and quantum Fisher information; this is expected to attract significant attention in the field of quantum metrology. Notably, this study reveals the novel, general aspects of low-temperature quantum physics and clarifies the characterization of long-range entanglement.},

  abstract     = {A central question of quantum computing is determining the source of the advantage of quantum computation over classical computation. Even though simulating quantum dynamics on a classical computer is thought to require exponential overhead in the worst case, efficient simulations are known to exist in several special cases. It was widely assumed that these easy-to-simulate cases as well as any yet-undiscovered ones could be avoided by choosing a quantum circuit at random. We prove that this intuition is false by showing that certain families of constant-depth, 2D random circuits can be approximately simulated on a classical computer in time only linear in the number of qubits and gates, even though the same families are capable of universal quantum computation and are hard to exactly simulate in the worst case (under standard hardness assumptions). While our proof applies to specific random circuit families, we demonstrate numerically that typical instances of more general families of sufficiently shallow constant-depth 2D random circuits are also efficiently simulable. We propose two classical simulation algorithms. One is based on first simulating spatially local regions which are then “stitched” together via recovery maps. The other reduces the 2D simulation problem to a problem of simulating a form of 1D dynamics consisting of alternating rounds of random local unitaries and weak measurements. Similar processes have recently been the subject of an intensive research focus, which has observed that the dynamics generally undergo a phase transition from a low-entanglement (and efficient-to-simulate) regime to a high-entanglement (and inefficient-to-simulate) regime as measurement strength is varied. Via a mapping from random quantum circuits to classical statistical mechanical models, we give analytical evidence that a similar computational phase transition occurs for both of our algorithms as parameters of the circuit architecture like the local Hilbert space dimension and circuit depth are varied and, additionally, that the effective 1D dynamics corresponding to sufficiently shallow random quantum circuits falls within the efficient-to-simulate regime. Implementing the latter algorithm for the depth-3 “brickwork” architecture, for which exact simulation is hard, we find that a laptop could simulate typical instances on a 409 × 409 grid with a total variation distance error less than 0.01 in approximately one minute per sample, a task intractable for previously known circuit simulation algorithms. Numerical results support our analytic evidence that the algorithm is asymptotically efficient.},

  abstract     = {The study of CoNb 2 O 6 sits at the confluence of simplicity and complexity: on one hand, the model for Ising chains—the building blocks of CoNb 2 O 6 —in a transverse field can be exactly solved and, thus, serves as an archetype of quantum criticality; on the other hand, the weak but nonzero interchain coupling adds geometric frustration to the stage, substantially complicating the phase diagram. Here we utilize low-temperature specific heat and thermal conductivity measurements to study the low-lying magnetic excitations in CoNb 2 O 6 and its spin-1 analog NiNb 2 O 6 . The thermal conductivity is found to be suppressed around the quantum critical point, where the specific heat is enhanced due to gapless magnetic excitations, pointing to the localized nature of the latter. These results highlight the predominant role of frustration in determining the quantum critical magnetic excitations of spin chains, which may furthermore underlie the remarkable similarities between the phenomenology of these spin- 1 / 2 and spin-1 systems.},

  abstract     = {Supersolids are a fundamental quantum phase of matter where the global phase and translational symmetries are spontaneously broken. The recently discovered supersolidity in quantum gases of strongly magnetic atoms gives the opportunity to explore in depth how superfluidity and crystalline order are mixed in this fascinating phase. The dipolar supersolid is usually created from a Bose-Einstein condensate, i.e., a standard superfluid, crossing a quantum phase transition that is related to the crystallization transitions of ordinary matter. In this work, we assess experimentally and theoretically the character of the superfluid-supersolid quantum phase transition. We find that one-row supersolids can have already two types of phase transitions, discontinuous and continuous, that are reminiscent of the first- and second-order transitions predicted in the thermodynamic limit in 2D and 1D, respectively. The dimensional crossover is peculiar to supersolids, is controlled via the transverse confinement and the atom number, and can be justified on the general ground of the Landau theory of phase transitions. The quasiadiabatic crossing of a continuous phase transition opens new directions of investigation for supersolids.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by recent experiments indicating strong superconductivity and intricate correlated insulating and flavor-polarized physics in mirror-symmetric twisted-trilayer graphene, we study the effects of interactions in this system close to the magic angle, using a combination of analytical and numerical methods. We identify asymptotically exact correlated many-body ground states at all integer filling fractions ν of the flat bands. To determine their fate when moving away from these fine-tuned points, we apply self-consistent Hartree-Fock numerics and analytic perturbation theory, with good agreement between the two approaches. This allows us to construct a phase diagram for the system as a function of ν and the displacement field, the crucial experimental tuning parameter of the system, and study the spectra of the different phases. The phase diagram is dominated by a correlated semimetallic intervalley coherent state and an insulating sublattice-polarized phase around charge neutrality ν = 0 , with additional spin polarization being present at quarter ( ν = − 2 ) or three-quarter ( ν = + 2 ) fillings of the quasiflat bands. We further study the superconducting instabilities emerging from these correlated states, both in the absence and in the additional presence of electron-phonon coupling, also taking into account possible Wess-Zumino-Witten terms. In the experimentally relevant regime, we find triplet pairing to dominate, possibly explaining the observed violation of the Pauli limit. Our results have several consequences for experiments as well as future theoretical work and illustrate the rich physics resulting from the interplay of almost-flat bands and dispersive Dirac cones in twisted-trilayer graphene.},

Driven by scattered sound, levitated grains self-assemble into a monolayer of particles, forming mesoscopic granular rafts with both an acoustic binding energy and a bending rigidity. Detuning the acoustic trap can give rise to stochastic forces and torques that impart angular momentum to levitated objects. As the angular momentum of a quasi-two-dimensional granular raft is increased, the raft deforms from a disk to an ellipse, eventually pinching off into multiple separate rafts, in a mechanism that resembles the breakup of a liquid drop. We extract the raft effective surface tension and elastic modulus and show that nonpairwise acoustic forces give rise to effective elastic moduli that scale with the raft size. We also show that the raft size controls the microstructural basis of plastic deformation, resulting in a transition from fracture to ductile failure.},

Here, by combining symmetry analysis and model calculations, we elucidate that the crystallographic symmetry groups of a vast number of magnetic materials with light elements, in which the neglect of relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is an appropriate approximation, are considerably larger than the conventional magnetic groups. Thus, a symmetry description that involves partially decoupled spin and spatial rotations, dubbed spin group, is required. We derive the classifications of spin point groups describing coplanar and collinear magnetic structures, and the irreducible corepresentations of spin space groups illustrating more energy degeneracies that are disallowed by magnetic groups. One consequence of the spin group is the new antiunitary symmetries that protect SOC-free Z 2 topological phases with unprecedented surface-node structures. Our work not only manifests the physical reality of materials with weak SOC, but also sheds light on the understanding of all solids with and without SOC by a unified group theory.},

We report new polarized neutron diffraction at low temperatures, as well as heat capacity ( C p ) measurements on single crystal Ce 2 Zr 2 O 7 . The former bears both similarities and differences with that measured from the canonical dipolar spin ice compound Ho 2 Ti 2 O 7 , while the latter rises sharply at low temperatures, initially plateauing near 0.08 K, before falling off toward a high temperature zero beyond 3 K. Above ∼ 0.5 K , the C p dataset can be fit to the results of a quantum numerical linked cluster calculation, carried out to fourth order, that allows estimates for the terms in the near-neighbor XYZ Hamiltonian expected for such dipole-octupole pyrochlore systems. Fits of the same theory to the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility and unpolarized neutron scattering complement this analysis. A comparison between the resulting best-fit numerical linked cluster calculation and the polarized neutron diffraction shows both agreement and discrepancies, mostly in the form of zone-boundary diffuse scattering in the non-spin-flip channel, which are attributed to interactions beyond near neighbors. The lack of an observed thermodynamic anomaly and the constraints on the near-neighbor XYZ Hamiltonian suggest that Ce 2 Zr 2 O 7 realizes a U ( 1 ) π quantum spin liquid state at low temperatures, and one that likely resides near the boundary between dipolar and octupolar character.},

The understanding of these phenomena expands the scope of established thermodynamics into the out-of-equilibrium domain. Here, we experimentally and theoretically study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a bosonic lattice model subjected to a strong dc field, realized as ultracold atoms in a strongly tilted triangular optical lattice. We observe the emergence of pronounced density-wave patterns—which spontaneously break the underlying lattice symmetry—using a novel single-shot imaging technique with two-dimensional single-site resolution in three-dimensional systems, which also resolves the domain structure. Our study suggests that the short-time dynamics arises from resonant pair tunneling processes within an effective description of the tilted Hubbard model. More broadly, we establish the far out-of-equilibrium regime of lattice models subjected to a strong dc field, as an exemplary and paradigmatic scenario for transient pattern formation.},

  abstract     = {The second law of thermodynamics states that work cannot be extracted from thermal equilibrium, whose quantum formulation is known as complete passivity; a state is called completely passive if work cannot be extracted from any number of copies of the state by any unitary operations. It has been established that a quantum state is completely passive if and only if it is a Gibbs ensemble. In physically plausible setups, however, the class of possible operations is often restricted by fundamental constraints such as symmetries imposed on the system. In the present work, we investigate the concept of complete passivity under symmetry constraints. Specifically, we prove that a quantum state is completely passive under a symmetry constraint described by a connected compact Lie group, if and only if it is a generalized Gibbs ensemble including conserved charges associated with the symmetry. Remarkably, our result applies to noncommutative symmetry such as SU(2) symmetry, suggesting an unconventional extension of the notion of generalized Gibbs ensemble. Furthermore, we consider the setup where a quantum work storage is explicitly included, and prove that the characterization of complete passivity remains unchanged. Our result extends the notion of thermal equilibrium to systems protected by symmetries, and would lead to flexible design principles of quantum heat engines and batteries. Moreover, our approach serves as a foundation of the resource theory of thermodynamics in the presence of symmetries.},

  abstract     = {One manifestation of quantum chaos is a random-matrix-like fine-grained energy spectrum. Prior to the inverse level spacing time, random matrix theory predicts a “ramp” of increasing variance in the connected part of the spectral form factor. However, in realistic quantum chaotic systems, the finite-time dynamics of the spectral form factor is much richer, with the pure random matrix ramp appearing only at sufficiently late time. In this article, we present a hydrodynamic theory of the connected spectral form factor prior to the inverse level spacing time. We first derive a general formula for the spectral form factor of a system with almost-conserved sectors in terms of return probabilities and spectral form factors within each sector. Next we argue that the theory of fluctuating hydrodynamics can be adapted from the usual Schwinger-Keldysh contour to the periodic time setting needed for the spectral form factor, and we show explicitly that the general formula is recovered in the case of energy diffusion. We also initiate a study of interaction effects in this modified hydrodynamic framework and show how the Thouless time defined as the time required for the spectral form factor to approach the pure random matrix result is controlled by the slow hydrodynamics modes. We then extend the formalism to Floquet systems, where a ramp is expected but with a different coefficient, and we derive a crossover formula from the Hamiltonian ramp to the Floquet ramp when the Floquet drive is weak. Taken together, these results establish an effective field theory of chaotic spectral correlations which predicts the random matrix ramp at late time and computes corrections to it at earlier times.},

We show that Jain states at filling factor ν = n / ( 2 p n ± 1 ) with integers n , p ≥ 2 support two kinds of collective modes: In addition to the well-known Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman (GMP) mode, they host a high-energy collective mode, which we interpret as the GMP mode of partons. We elucidate observable signatures of the parton mode in the dynamics following a geometric quench. We construct a microscopic wave function for the parton mode and demonstrate agreement between its variational energy and exact diagonalization. Using the parton construction, we derive a field theory of the Jain states and show that the previously proposed effective theories follow from our approach. Our results point to partons being “real” quasiparticles which, in a way reminiscent of quarks, become observable only at sufficiently high energies.},

The bunches are emitted at specific values V k of the bias voltage, for which each Cooper pair tunneling across the junction creates exactly k photons in the resonator. The latter is a microfabricated spiral coil which resonates and leaks photons at 4.4 GHz in a measurement line. Its characteristic impedance of 1.97 k Ω is high enough to reach a strong junction-resonator coupling and a bright emission of the k -photon bunches. We show that a rotating-wave approximation treatment of the system accounts quantitatively for the observed radiation intensity, from k = 1 to 6, and over 3 orders of magnitude when varying the Josephson energy E J . We also measure the second-order correlation function of the radiated microwave to determine its Fano factor F k , which in the low E J limit confirms with F k ≃ k the emission of k -photon bunches. At larger E J , a more complex behavior is observed in quantitative agreement with numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {We present evidence of non-excimer-based secondary scintillation in gaseous xenon, obtained using both the NEXT-White time projection chamber (TPC) and a dedicated setup. Detailed comparison with first-principle calculations allows us to assign this scintillation mechanism to neutral bremsstrahlung (NBrS), a process that is postulated to exist in xenon that has been largely overlooked. For photon emission below 1000 nm, the NBrS yield increases from about 10 − 2 photon / e − cm − 1 bar − 1 at pressure-reduced electric field values of 50 V cm − 1 bar − 1 to above 3 × 10 − 1 photon / e − cm − 1 bar − 1 at 500 V cm − 1 bar − 1 . Above 1.5 kV cm − 1 bar − 1 , values that are typically employed for electroluminescence, it is estimated that NBrS is present with an intensity around 1 photon / e − cm − 1 bar − 1 , which is about 2 orders of magnitude lower than conventional, excimer-based electroluminescence. Despite being fainter than its excimeric counterpart, our calculations reveal that NBrS causes luminous backgrounds that can interfere, in either gas or liquid phase, with the ability to distinguish and/or to precisely measure low primary-scintillation signals (S1). In particular, we show this to be the case in the “buffer” region, where keeping the electric field below the electroluminescence threshold does not suffice to extinguish secondary scintillation. The electric field leakage in this region should be mitigated to avoid intolerable levels of NBrS emission. Furthermore, we show that this new source of light emission opens up a viable path toward obtaining S2 signals for discrimination purposes in future single-phase liquid TPCs for neutrino and dark matter physics, with estimated yields up to 20 – 50 photons / e − cm − 1 .},

  abstract     = {Stochastic processes play a key role for modeling a huge variety of transport problems out of equilibrium, with manifold applications throughout the natural and social sciences. To formulate models of stochastic dynamics, the conventional approach consists in superimposing random fluctuations on a suitable deterministic evolution. These fluctuations are sampled from probability distributions that are prescribed a priori , most commonly as Gaussian or Lévy. While these distributions are motivated by (generalized) central limit theorems, they are nevertheless unbounded , meaning that arbitrarily large fluctuations can be obtained with finite probability. This property implies the violation of fundamental physical principles such as special relativity and may yield divergencies for basic physical quantities like energy. Here, we solve the fundamental problem of unbounded random fluctuations by constructing a comprehensive theoretical framework of stochastic processes possessing physically realistic finite propagation velocity. Our approach is motivated by the theory of Lévy walks, which we embed into an extension of conventional Poisson-Kac processes. The resulting extended theory employs generalized transition rates to model subtle microscopic dynamics, which reproduces nontrivial spatiotemporal correlations on macroscopic scales. It thus enables the modeling of many different kinds of dynamical features, as we demonstrate by three physically and biologically motivated examples. The corresponding stochastic models capture the whole spectrum of diffusive dynamics from normal to anomalous diffusion, including the striking “Brownian yet non-Gaussian” diffusion, and more sophisticated phenomena such as senescence. Extended Poisson-Kac theory can, therefore, be used to model a wide range of finite-velocity dynamical phenomena that are observed experimentally.},

  abstract     = {Layered transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) host a plethora of interesting physical phenomena ranging from charge order to superconductivity. By introducing magnetic ions into 2 H − T A 2 ( T = Nb , Ta; A = S , Se), the material forms a family of magnetic intercalated TMDCs M x T A 2 ( M = 3 d transition metal). Recently, Fe 1 / 3 + δ NbS 2 has been found to possess intriguing resistance switching and magnetic memory effects coupled to the Néel temperature of T N ∼ 45 K [Maniv et al ., Nat. Phys. 17 , 525 (2021) ; Sci. Adv. 7 , eabd8452 (2021) ]. We present comprehensive single crystal neutron diffraction measurements on underintercalated ( δ ∼ − 0.01 ), stoichiometric, and overintercalated ( δ ∼ 0.01 ) samples. Magnetic defects are usually considered to suppress magnetic correlations and, concomitantly, transition temperatures. Instead, we observe highly tunable magnetic long-ranged states as the Fe concentration is varied from underintercalated to overintercalated, that is, from Fe vacancies to Fe interstitials. The under- and overintercalated samples reveal distinct antiferromagnetic stripe and zigzag orders, associated with wave vectors k 1 = ( 0.5 , 0 , 0 ) and k 2 = ( 0.25 , 0.5 , 0 ) , respectively. The stoichiometric sample shows two successive magnetic phase transitions for these two wave vectors with an unusual rise-and-fall feature in the intensities connected to k 1 . We ascribe this sensitive tunability to the competing next-nearest neighbor exchange interactions and the oscillatory nature of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida mechanism. We discuss experimental observations that relate to the observed intriguing switching resistance behaviors. Our discovery of a magnetic defect tuning of the magnetic structure in bulk crystals Fe 1 / 3 + δ NbS 2 provides a possible new avenue to implement controllable antiferromagnetic spintronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Remarkably, complex assemblies of superconducting wires, electrodes, and Josephson junctions are compactly described by a handful of collective phase degrees of freedom that behave like quantum particles in a potential. Almost all these circuits operate in the regime where quantum phase fluctuations are small—the associated flux is smaller than the superconducting flux quantum—although entering the regime of large fluctuations would have profound implications for metrology and qubit protection. The difficulty arises from the apparent need for circuit impedances vastly exceeding the resistance quantum. Independently, exotic circuit elements that require Cooper pairs to form pairs in order to tunnel have been developed to encode and topologically protect quantum information. In this work, we demonstrate that pairing Cooper pairs magnifies the phase fluctuations of the circuit ground state. We measure a tenfold suppression of flux sensitivity of the first transition energy only, implying a twofold increase in the vacuum phase fluctuations and showing that the ground state is delocalized over several Josephson wells.},

In a mean-field Mari-Kurchan model, we find that relaxation changes from a power law to an exponential decay below a well-defined temperature, consistent with recent findings in mean-field p -spin models. By contrast, for finite-dimensional systems, the relaxation is always algebraic, with a nontrivial universal exponent at high temperatures crossing over to a harmonic value at low temperatures. We demonstrate that this apparent evolution is controlled by a temperature-dependent population of localized glassy excitations. Our work unifies several recent lines of studies aiming at a detailed characterization of the complex potential energy landscape of glass formers, and challenges both mean-field and real space descriptions of glasses.},

Such a doped hole behaves like a “twisted” non-Landau quasiparticle characterized by an emergent quantum number in agreement with exact numerics. In this work, we further investigate the ground state of two holes by VMC. It is found that the two holes strongly attract each other to form a pairing state with a new quantum number the same as obtained by the numerical exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations. A unique feature of this pairing state is a dichotomy in the pairing symmetry, i.e., a d wave in terms of the electron c operators and an s wave in terms of the new quasiparticles, as explicitly illustrated in the ground state wave function. A similar VMC study of a two-hole wave function for the t − J two-leg ladder also yields a good agreement with the DMRG result. We demonstrate that the pairing mechanism responsible for the strong binding here is not due to the long-range antiferromagnetic order nor the resonating-valence-bound pairing in the spin background but is the consequence of the quantum phase strings created by the hopping of holes. The resulting spin-current pattern mediating the pairing force is explicitly illustrated in the VMC calculation. Physical implications to superconductivity at finite doping are also discussed.},

An unbiased approach to this problem is highly desirable, but also particularly challenging, given the multiple electron flavors, the topological obstruction to defining tight-binding models, and the long-ranged Coulomb interactions. While numerical simulations of realistic models have thus far been confined to zero temperature, typically excluding some spin or valley species, analytic progress has relied on fixed point models away from the realistic limit. Here, we present unbiased Monte Carlo simulations of realistic models of magic-angle TBG at charge neutrality. We establish the absence of a sign problem for this model in a momentum-space approach and describe a computationally tractable formulation that applies even on breaking chiral symmetry and including band dispersion. Our results include (i) the emergence of an insulating Kramers intervalley coherent ground state in competition with a correlated semimetal phase, (ii) detailed temperature evolution of order parameters and electronic spectral functions that reveal a “pseudogap” regime, in which gap features are established at a higher temperature than the onset of order, and (iii) predictions for electronic tunneling spectra and their evolution with temperature. Our results pave the way towards uncovering the physics of magic-angle graphene through exact simulations of over a hundred electrons across a wide temperature range.},

The experimental sample is a trilayer garnet consisting of two thin magnetic films epitaxially grown on both sides of a half-millimeter-thick nonmagnetic single crystal.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a circuit-based approach for training a reinforcement learning agent on quantum control tasks in a model-free way. Given a continuously parametrized control circuit, the agent learns its parameters through trial-and-error interaction with the quantum system, using measurement outcomes as the only source of information about the quantum state. Focusing on control of a harmonic oscillator coupled to an ancilla qubit, we show how to reward the learning agent with measurements of experimentally available observables. We train the agent to prepare various nonclassical states via both unitary control and control with adaptive measurement-based quantum feedback, and to execute logical gates on encoded qubits. The agent does not rely on averaging for state tomography or fidelity estimation, and significantly outperforms widely used model-free methods in terms of sample efficiency. Our numerical work is of immediate relevance to superconducting circuits and trapped ions platforms where such training can be implemented in experiment, allowing complete elimination of model bias and the adaptation of quantum control policies to the specific system in which they are deployed.},

In order to fully exploit the current observational inputs and to study the impact of future observations of NS masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities, we analyze a large ensemble of randomly generated viable NS-matter equations of state (EOSs) and the corresponding rotating stellar structures. We discuss the compatibility and impact of various hypotheses and measurements on the EOS, including those involving the merger product of the gravitational-wave (GW) event GW170817, the binary-merger components in GW190814, and radius measurements of the pulsar PSR J 0740 + 6620 . We obtain an upper limit for the dimensionless spin of a rigidly rotating NS | χ | &lt; 0.81 , an upper limit for the compactness of a NS G M / ( R c 2 ) &lt; 0.33 , and find that the conservative hypothesis that the remnant in GW170817 ultimately collapsed to a black hole strongly constrains the EOS and the maximal mass of NSs, implying M TOV &lt; 2.53 M ⊙ (or M TOV &lt; 2.19 M ⊙ if we assume that a hypermassive NS was created). Additionally, we derive a novel lower limit for the tidal deformability as a function of the NS mass and provide fitting formulas that can be used to set priors for parameter estimation and to discern whether neutron stars or other compact objects are involved in future low-mass GW events. Finally, we find that the recent NICER results for the radius of the massive NS PSR J 0740 + 6620 place strong constraints for the behavior of the EOS and that the indicated radius values R ( 2 M ⊙ ) ≳ 11 km are compatible with moderate speeds of sound in NS matter and thus with the existence of quark-matter cores in massive NSs.},

  abstract     = {The light-matter interaction in bulk semiconductors is in the strong-coupling regime with hybrid eigenstates, the so-called exciton polaritons and phonon polaritons. In two-dimensional (2D) systems, the translational invariance is broken in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the 2D system. The light-matter interaction switches to the weak-coupling regime with a finite radiative lifetime of the matter excitations in 2D. Radiative phenomena have been extensively studied for 2D excitons in quantum wells and 2D crystals, but their counterpart has never been addressed for optical phonons in 2D. Here we present a parallel study of the exciton and phonon radiative linewidths in atomically thin layers of hexagonal boron nitride ( h -BN), epitaxially grown on graphite. Reflectivity experiments are performed either in the deep ultraviolet for the excitonic resonance or in the midinfrared for the phononic one. A quantitative interpretation is implemented in the framework of a transfer matrix approach generalized to the case of monolayers with the inclusion of Breit-Wigner resonances of either excitonic or phononic nature. For the exciton we find a giant radiative broadening in comparison to other 2D crystals, with a value of ∼ 25 meV related to the strong excitonic effects in h -BN. For the phonon we provide the first estimation of the radiative linewidth of a 2D phonon, with a value of ∼ 0.2 meV in monolayer h -BN. Our results are found to be in good agreement with first-principles calculations. Our study unravels the existence of radiative states for optical phonons in 2D, with numerous perspectives for fundamental physics, optoelectronic applications in the midinfrared spectral range, and advanced thermal management, and h -BN is emerging as a model system in this novel topic.},

  abstract     = {Nuclear spins interact weakly with their environment and therefore exhibit long coherence times. This has led to their use as memory qubits in quantum information platforms, where they are controlled via electromagnetic waves. Scaling up such platforms comes with challenges in terms of power efficiency, as well as cross-talk between devices. Here, we demonstrate coherent control of a single nuclear spin using surface acoustic waves. We use mechanically driven Ramsey and spin-echo sequences to show that the nuclear spin retains its excellent coherence properties. We estimate that this approach requires 2–3 orders of magnitude less power than more conventional control methods. Furthermore, this technique is scalable because of the possibility of guiding acoustic waves and reduced cross-talk between different acoustic channels. This work demonstrates the use of mechanical waves for complex quantum control sequences, offers an advantageous alternative to the standard electromagnetic control of nuclear spins, and opens prospects for incorporating nuclear spins in mechanically interfaced hybrid quantum architectures.},

  abstract     = {The discovery of superconductivity in square-planar low valence nickelates has ignited a vigorous debate regarding their essential electronic properties: Do these materials have appreciable oxygen charge-transfer character akin to the cuprates, or are they in a distinct Mott-Hubbard regime where oxygen plays a minimal role? Here, we resolve this question using O K -edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements of the low valence nickelate La 4 Ni 3 O 8 and a prototypical cuprate La 2 − x Sr x CuO 4 ( x = 0.35 ). As expected, the cuprate lies deep in the charge-transfer regime of the Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen (ZSA) scheme. The nickelate, however, is not well described by either limit of the ZSA scheme and is found to be of mixed charge-transfer–Mott-Hubbard character with the Coulomb repulsion U of similar size to the charge-transfer energy Δ . Nevertheless, the transition-metal-oxygen hopping is larger in La 4 Ni 3 O 8 than in La 2 − x Sr x CuO 4 , leading to a significant superexchange interaction and an appreciable hole occupation of the ligand O orbitals in La 4 Ni 3 O 8 despite its larger Δ . Our results clarify the essential characteristics of low valence nickelates and put strong constraints on theoretical interpretations of superconductivity in these materials.},

In contrast to two-level atoms, we find that multilevel atoms can harbor eigenstates that are perfectly dark to cavity decay even within the subspace of permutationally symmetric states (collective Dicke manifold). The dark states arise from destructive interference between different internal transitions and are shown to be entangled. Remarkably, the superradiant decay of multilevel atoms can end up stuck in one of these dark states, where a macroscopic fraction of the atoms remains excited. This opens the door to the preparation of entangled dark states of matter through collective dissipation that are useful for quantum sensing and quantum simulation. Our predictions should be readily observable in current optical cavity experiments with alkaline-earth atoms or Raman-dressed transitions.},

This supercompactness is achieved via arrays of waveguides with shifted spatial dispersions, where each waveguide functions as both the transmission channel and an effective “cladding layer” of its neighboring waveguides, and has been experimentally realized in low-loss all-dielectric photonic crystals. We show that the zero-spacing transmission array possesses the remarkable features of negligible crosstalk, high-efficiency sharp bending, and ultracompact photonic routing where the light can traverse the entire physical space. This finding opens a new avenue for extreme space utilization efficiency in waveguide physics and integrated photonics.},

This class of non-Markovian random walks has applications in a broad range of examples, from insects to living cells, where a random walker locally modifies its environment—leaving behind footprints along its path and, in turn, responding to its own footprints. Because of their inherent non-Markovian nature, the exploration properties of self-interacting random walks have remained elusive. Here, we show that long-range memory effects can have deep consequences on the dynamics of generic self-interacting random walks; they can induce aging and nontrivial persistence and transience exponents, which we determine quantitatively, in both infinite and confined geometries. Based on this analysis, we quantify the search kinetics of self-interacting random walkers and show that the distribution of the first-passage time to a target site in a confined domain takes universal scaling forms in the large-domain size limit, which we characterize quantitatively. We argue that memory abilities induced by attractive self-interactions provide a decisive advantage for local space exploration, while repulsive self-interactions can significantly accelerate the global exploration of large domains.},

  abstract     = {Protein concentration in a living cell fluctuates over time due to noise in growth and division processes. In the high expression regime, variance of the protein concentration in a cell is found to scale with the square of the mean, which belongs to a general phenomenon called Taylor’s law (TL). To understand the origin for these fluctuations, we measure protein concentration dynamics in single Escherichia coli cells from a set of strains with a variable expression of fluorescent proteins. The protein expression is controlled by a set of constitutive promoters with different strength, which allows one to change the expression level over 2 orders of magnitude without introducing noise from fluctuations in transcription regulators. Our data confirm the square TL, but the prefactor has a cell-to-cell variation independent of the promoter strength. Furthermore, distributions of the normalized protein concentration for different promoters collapse onto the same curve. To explain these observations, we use a minimal mechanistic model to describe the stochastic growth and division processes in a single cell with a feedback mechanism for regulating cell division. In the high expression regime where extrinsic noise dominates, the model reproduces our experimental results quantitatively. By using the mean-field approximation in the minimal model, we show that the stochastic dynamics of protein concentration is described by a Langevin equation with multiplicative noise. The Langevin equation has a scale invariance which is responsible for the square TL. By solving the Langevin equation, we obtain an analytical solution for the protein concentration distribution function that agrees with experiments. The solution shows explicitly how the prefactor depends on strength of different noise sources, which explains its cell-to-cell variability. By using this approach to analyze our single-cell data, we find that the noise in production rate dominates the noise from cell division. The deviation from the square TL in the low expression regime can also be captured in our model by including intrinsic noise in the production rate.},

We provide a precise definition of Hilbert space fragmentation in this formalism as the case where the dimension of the commutant algebra grows exponentially with the system size. Fragmentation can, hence, be distinguished from systems with conventional symmetries such as U(1) or SU(2), where the dimension of the commutant algebra grows polynomially with the system size. Furthermore, the commutant algebra language also helps distinguish between “classical” and “quantum” Hilbert space fragmentation, where the former refers to fragmentation in the product state basis. We explicitly construct the commutant algebra in several systems exhibiting classical fragmentation, including the t − J z model and the spin-1 dipole-conserving model, and we illustrate the connection to previously studied “statistically localized integrals of motion.” We also revisit the Temperley-Lieb spin chains, including the spin-1 biquadratic chain widely studied in the literature, and show that they exhibit quantum Hilbert space fragmentation. Finally, we study the contribution of the full commutant algebra to the Mazur bounds in various cases. In fragmented systems, we use expressions for the commutant to analytically obtain new or improved Mazur bounds for autocorrelation functions of local operators that agree with previous numerical results. In addition, we are able to rigorously show the localization of the on-site spin operator in the spin-1 dipole-conserving model.},

Of particular importance is the nature of the long-lived intermediate complexes which may be formed in ultracold molecular collisions, as such complexes can dramatically affect the stability of molecular gases, even when exothermic reaction channels are not present. Here, we investigate collisional loss in an ultracold mixture of K 40 Rb 87 molecules and Rb 87 atoms, where chemical reactions between the two species are energetically forbidden. Through direct detection of the KRb 2 * intermediate complexes formed from atom-molecule collisions, we show that a 1064 nm laser source used for optical trapping of the sample can efficiently deplete the complex population via photoexcitation, an effect which can explain the strong two-body loss observed in the mixture. By monitoring the time evolution of the KRb 2 * population after a sudden reduction in the 1064 nm laser intensity, we measure the lifetime of the complex [0.39(6) ms], as well as the photoexcitation rate for 1064 nm light [ 0.50 ( 3 ) μ s − 1 ( kW / cm 2 ) − 1 ]. The observed lifetime, which is ∼ 10 5 times longer than recent estimates based on the Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus statistical theory, calls for new theoretical insight to explain its origin.},

Here, we show that pairs of identical nuclear spins in solids form intrinsically long-lived qubits. We study three carbon-13 pairs in diamond and realize high-fidelity measurements of their quantum states using a single nitrogen-vacancy center in their vicinity. We then reveal that the spin pairs are robust to external perturbations due to a combination of three phenomena: a decoherence-free subspace, a clock transition, and a variant on motional narrowing. The resulting inhomogeneous dephasing time is T 2 * = 1.9 ( 3 ) min , the longest reported for individually controlled qubits. Finally, we develop complete control and realize an entangled state between two spin pairs through projective parity measurements. These long-lived qubits are abundantly present in diamond and other solids and provide new opportunities for ancilla-enhanced quantum sensing and for robust memory qubits for quantum networks.},

By expanding supercell size, basis set, and the resolution of the fluctuation space of an embedded fragment, we show that the systematic improvability of the approach yields accurate structural and electronic properties of realistic solids without empirical parameters, even across changes in geometry. The results are presented in insulating, semimetallic, and more strongly correlated regimes, finding state-of-the-art agreement with experimental data.},

  abstract     = {The extension of many-body quantum dynamics to the nonunitary domain has led to a series of exciting developments, including new out-of-equilibrium entanglement phases and phase transitions. We show how a duality transformation between space and time, on one hand, and unitarity and nonunitarity, on the other, can be used to realize steady-state phases of nonunitary dynamics that exhibit a rich variety of behavior in their entanglement scaling with subsystem size—from logarithmic to extensive to fractal . We show how these outcomes in nonunitary circuits (that are “spacetime dual” to unitary circuits) relate to the growth of entanglement in time in the corresponding unitary circuits, and how they differ, through an exact mapping to a problem of unitary evolution with boundary decoherence, in which information gets “radiated away” from one edge of the system. In spacetime duals of chaotic unitary circuits, this mapping allows us to analytically derive a nonthermal volume-law entangled phase with a universal logarithmic correction to the entropy, previously observed in unitary-measurement dynamics. Notably, we also find robust steady-state phases with fractal entanglement scaling, S ( ℓ ) ∼ ℓ α with tunable 0 &lt; α &lt; 1 for subsystems of size ℓ in one dimension. We present an experimental protocol for preparing these novel steady states with only a vanishing density of postselected measurements via a type of “teleportation” between spacelike and timelike slices of quantum circuits.},

  abstract     = {Cortical neurons are characterized by irregular firing and a broad distribution of rates. The balanced state model explains these observations with a cancellation of mean excitatory and inhibitory currents, which makes fluctuations drive firing. In networks of neurons with current-based synapses, the balanced state emerges dynamically if coupling is strong, i.e., if the mean number of synapses per neuron K is large and synaptic efficacy is of the order of 1 / K . When synapses are conductance-based, current fluctuations are suppressed when coupling is strong, questioning the applicability of the balanced state idea to biological neural networks. We analyze networks of strongly coupled conductance-based neurons and show that asynchronous irregular activity and broad distributions of rates emerge if synaptic efficacy is of the order of 1 / log ( K ) . In such networks, unlike in the standard balanced state model, current fluctuations are small and firing is maintained by a drift-diffusion balance. This balance emerges dynamically, without fine-tuning, if inputs are smaller than a critical value, which depends on synaptic time constants and coupling strength, and is significantly more robust to connection heterogeneities than the classical balanced state model. Our analysis makes experimentally testable predictions of how the network response properties should evolve as input increases.},

The interplay of topology and competing interactions in these XY systems drives new kinds of emergent behavior relevant in both quantum and classical settings. Such coupled U(1) systems further introduce rich physics, bringing topology into contact with fractionalization and deconfinement. Motivated by a hidden-order phase transition in isotropic liquid-crystal 54COOBC films, we study the finite-temperature phase diagram of a minimalist hexatic-nematic XY model. We identify a small region of composite Potts order above the vortex-binding transition; this phase is characterized by relative hexatic-nematic ordering though both variables are disordered. We propose that the Potts order results from a confinement of fractional vortices into extended nematic defects and discuss the broader implications of fractional vortices and composite ordering in the wider class of coupled XY condensates.},

  abstract     = {From enzyme binding to robot grasping, the function of many mechanical systems depends upon large, coordinated motions of their components. Such motions arise from a network of physical interactions in the form of links (edges) that transmit forces between constituent elements (nodes) and have been fruitfully modeled in known networks. However, the principled design of precise motions in novel networks is made difficult by the number and nonlinearity of interactions. Here, we formulate a simple but powerful framework for designing fully nonlinear motions using concepts from dynamical systems theory. We demonstrate that a small network unit acts as a one-dimensional map between the distances across pairs of nodes, and we represent the act of combining units as an iteration of this map. By tying the map’s attractors and their stability to the shape and folding sequence in a network of combined units, we program the precise coordinated motion between arbitrarily complex macroscopic shapes, the exact folding sequence between the shapes, and exotic network behaviors such as a mechanical and gate and a period-doubling route to chaos. Further, we construct a unit with a 3-cycle that combines to form a lattice with any positive integer period as a result of Sharkovskii’s theorem. Finally, we construct physical networks and analyze the effect of bond elasticity to demonstrate the framework’s potential and versatility. The precise design of shape change and folding sequence makes this framework ideal as a starting minimal model for many applications, such as robotics, providing a promising direction for future work in metamaterials.},

  abstract     = {Ultracold atomic gas provides a useful tool to explore many-body physics. One of the recent additions to this experimental toolbox is Floquet engineering, where periodic modulation of the Hamiltonian allows the creation of effective potentials that do not exist otherwise. When subject to external modulations, however, generic interacting many-body systems absorb energy, thus posing a heating problem that may impair the usefulness of this method. For discrete systems with bounded local energy, an exponentially suppressed heating rate with driving frequency has been observed previously, leaving the system in a prethermal state for exceedingly long durations. However, for systems in continuous space, the situation remains unclear. Here, we show that Floquet engineering can be applied to a strongly interacting degenerate Fermi gas held in a flat boxlike potential without inducing excessive heating on experimentally relevant timescales. The driving eliminates the effect of a spin-dependent potential originating from the simultaneous magnetic levitation of two different spin states. We calculate the heating rate and obtain a power-law suppression with the drive frequency. To further test the many-body behavior of the driven gas, we measure both the pair-condensation fraction at unitarity and the contact parameter across the BEC-BCS crossover. At low driving frequencies, the condensate fraction is reduced by the time-dependent force, but at higher frequencies, it revives and attains an even higher value than without driving. Our results are promising for future exploration of exotic many-body phases of a bulk strongly interacting Fermi gas with dynamically engineered Hamiltonians.},

  abstract     = {Quantum processing architectures that include multiple qubit modalities offer compelling strategies for high-fidelity operations and readout, quantum error correction, and a path for scaling to large system sizes. Such hybrid architectures have been realized for leading platforms, including superconducting circuits and trapped ions. Recently, a new approach for constructing large, coherent quantum processors has emerged based on arrays of individually trapped neutral atoms. However, these demonstrations have been limited to arrays of a single atomic element where the identical nature of the atoms makes crosstalk-free control and nondemolition readout of a large number of atomic qubits challenging. Here we introduce a dual-element atom array with individual control of single rubidium and cesium atoms. We demonstrate their independent placement in arrays with up to 512 trapping sites and observe negligible crosstalk between the two elements. Furthermore, by continuously reloading one atomic element while maintaining an array of the other, we demonstrate a new continuous operation mode for atom arrays without any off-time. Our results enable avenues for auxiliary-qubit-assisted quantum protocols such as quantum nondemolition measurements and quantum error correction, as well as continuously operating quantum processors and sensors.},

This allows us to study the issue of the optimal probe incompatibility in the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters in generic noisy channels, while so far the issue has been studied mostly in effectively noiseless scenarios (where the Heisenberg scaling is possible). We apply our results to the estimation of both unitary and noise parameters and indicate models where the fundamental probe incompatibility is present. In particular, we show that in lossy multiple-arm interferometry the probe incompatibility is as strong as in the noiseless scenario, reducing the potential advantage of simultaneous estimation to a constant factor. Finally, going beyond the multiparameter estimation paradigm, we introduce the concept of random quantum sensing and show how the tools developed may be applied to multiple-channel discrimination problems. As an illustration, we provide a simple proof of the loss of the quadratic advantage of the time-continuous Grover algorithm in the presence of dephasing or erasure noise.},

By isolating the coherent and incoherent contributions to the system dynamics, we derive both lower and upper bounds on the speed of evolution. We prove that the latter provide tighter limits on the speed of observables than previously known quantum speed limits and that a preferred basis of speed operators serves to completely characterize the observables that saturate the speed limits. We use this construction to bound the effect of incoherent dynamics on the evolution of an observable and to find the Hamiltonian that gives the maximum coherent speedup to the evolution of an observable.},

We use the Seebeck coefficient as a probe of the particle-hole asymmetry of the electronic structure across the pseudogap critical doping p ⋆ = 0.23 . Outside the pseudogap phase, at p = 0.24 &gt; p ⋆ , we observe a positive and essentially isotropic Seebeck coefficient as T → 0 . That S &gt; 0 at p = 0.24 is at odds with expectations given the electronic band structure of Nd-LSCO above p ⋆ and its known electronlike Fermi surface. We can reconcile this observation by invoking an energy-dependent scattering rate with a particle-hole asymmetry, possibly rooted in the non-Fermi-liquid nature of cuprates just above p ⋆ . Inside the pseudogap phase, for p &lt; p ⋆ , S a is seen to rise at low temperature as previously reported, consistent with the drop in carrier density n from n ≃ 1 + p to n ≃ p across p ⋆ as inferred from other transport properties. In stark contrast, S c at low temperature becomes negative below p ⋆ , a novel signature of the pseudogap phase. The sudden drop in S c reveals a change in the electronic structure of Nd-LSCO upon crossing p ⋆ . We can exclude a profound change of the scattering across p ⋆ and conclude that the change in the out-of-plane Seebeck coefficient originates from a transformation of the Fermi surface.},

Here, we use near-single-cycle laser pulses with a controlled carrier-envelope phase to show that the actual waveform of the laser field has a clear impact on the plasma response. The beam pointing of our relativistic electron beam oscillates in phase with the carrier-envelope phase of the laser, at an amplitude of 15 mrad, or 30\% of the beam divergence. Numerical simulations explain this observation through asymmetries in the injection and acceleration of the electron beam, which are locked to the carrier-envelope phase. These results imply that we achieve waveform control of relativistic electron dynamics. Our results pave the way to high-precision, subcycle control of electron injection in plasma accelerators, enabling the production of attosecond relativistic electron bunches and x rays.},

We report the experimental observation of the quantum boomerang effect. Using a degenerate gas and a phase-shifted pair of optical lattices, we not only confirm the predicted dependence of the boomerang effect on Floquet gauge but also elucidate the crucial role of initial-state symmetries. Highlighting the key role of localization, we observe that as stochastic kicking destroys dynamical localization, the quantum boomerang effect also disappears. Measured dynamics are in agreement with numerical models and with predictions of an analytical theory we present which clarifies the connection between time-reversal symmetry and boomerang dynamics.

  abstract     = {Topological materials have drawn increasing attention owing to their rich quantum properties, as highlighted by a large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in Weyl and nodal-line semimetals. However, the practical applications for topological electronics have been hampered by the difficulty in the external control of their band topology. Here, we demonstrate a magnetic-field-induced switching of band topology in α − EuP 3 , a magnetic semimetal with a layered crystal structure derived from black phosphorus. When the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the single mirror plane of the monoclinic structure, a giant AHE signal abruptly emerges at a certain threshold magnetization value, giving rise to a prominently large anomalous Hall angle of | Θ AHE | ∼ 2 0 ° . On the other hand, when the magnetic field is applied along the interlayer direction, which breaks the mirror symmetry, the system shows a pronounced negative longitudinal magnetoresistance. Based on first-principles calculations and group-theoretic analysis, we show that such nontrivial anomalies in the magnetotransport properties are manifestations of two distinct topological phases: topological nodal-line and Weyl semimetals, respectively. Notably, the nodal-line structure is composed of bands with the same spin character and spans a wide energy range around the Fermi level. These topological phases are stabilized via the exchange coupling between localized Eu − 4 f moments and mobile carriers conducting through the phosphorus layers. Our findings provide a realistic solution for external manipulation of band topology, enriching the functional aspects of topological materials.},

  abstract     = {Quantum error correction requires the detection of errors via reliable measurements of multiqubit correlation operators. As these operations are inherently faulty, fault-tolerant schemes for realizing quantum error correction are required. Recently, a paradigm requiring only minimal resource overhead in the form of “flag” qubits to detect and correct errors has been proposed. We experimentally demonstrate a fault-tolerant weight-4 parity-check measurement scheme, where one additional flag qubit serves to detect errors, which would otherwise proliferate into uncorrectable weight-2 errors onto the qubit register. We achieve a parity measurement fidelity of 92.3(2)\%, which increases to 93.2(2)\% upon conditioning to the flag readout result, which shows that the measurement scheme intercepts intrinsic errors occurring throughout the sequence. We show that the protocol is capable of reliably intercepting faults by deliberately injecting bit- and phase-flip errors. For holistic benchmarking of the parity measurement scheme, we use an entanglement witnessing scheme requiring a minimal number of measurements to verify genuine six-qubit multipartite entanglement. The demonstrated fault-tolerant parity measurement scheme constitutes the key building block in a broad class of resource-efficient flag-based quantum error correction protocols including topological color codes. Our hardware platform is based on atomic ions stored in a microchip ion trap. The qubit register is dynamically reconfigured via shuttling operations enabling effective full connectivity without operational cross talk, thereby providing key prerequisites underlying fault-tolerant circuit design. These architectural features in combination with the demonstrated approach to flag-based fault-tolerant quantum error correction open up a route toward scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing.},

The resulting long-time vortex distributions are found to be in excellent agreement with the mean-field Poisson Boltzmann equation for the system describing the microcanonical ensemble at fixed energy H and angular momentum M . The equilibrium states are characterized by the corresponding thermodynamic variables of inverse temperature β ^ and rotation frequency ω ^ . We are able to realize equilibria spanning the full phase diagram of the vortex gas, including on-axis states near zero temperature, infinite temperature, and negative absolute temperatures. At sufficiently high energies, the system exhibits a symmetry-breaking transition, resulting in an off-axis equilibrium phase at negative absolute temperature that no longer shares the symmetry of the container. We introduce a point-vortex model with phenomenological damping and noise that is able to quantitatively reproduce the equilibration dynamics.},

  abstract     = {There is growing interest in using ultrafast light pulses to drive functional materials into nonequilibrium states with novel properties. The conventional wisdom is that above-gap photoexcitation behaves similarly to raising the electronic temperature and lacks the desired selectivity in the final state. Here, we report a novel nonthermal lattice instability induced by ultrafast above-gap excitation in SnSe, a representative of the I V − V I class of semiconductors that provides a rich platform for tuning material functionality with ultrafast pulses due to their multiple lattice instabilities. The new lattice instability is accompanied by a drastic softening of the lowest-frequency A g phonon. This mode has previously been identified as the soft mode in the thermally driven phase transition to a C m c m structure. However, by a quantitative reconstruction of the atomic displacements from time-resolved x-ray diffraction for multiple Bragg peaks and excitation densities, we show that ultrafast photoexcitation with near-infrared (1.55 eV) light induces a distortion toward a different structure with I m m m symmetry. The I m m m structure of SnSe is an orthorhombic distortion of the rocksalt structure and does not occur in equilibrium. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the photoinduced I m m m lattice instability arises from electron excitation from the Se 4 p - and Sn 5 s -derived bands deep below the Fermi level that cannot be excited thermally. The results have implications for optical control of the thermoelectric, ferroelectric, and topological properties of the monochalcogenides and related materials. More generally, the results emphasize the need for ultrafast structural probes to reveal distinct atomic-scale dynamics that are otherwise too subtle or invisible in conventional spectroscopies.},

The effects rely on a conserved spin current passing between a reference and a sensing ferromagnetic electrode in a multilayer structure. Recently, we have proposed that these fundamental spintronic effects can be realized in unconventional collinear antiferromagnets with nonrelativistic alternating spin-momentum coupling. Here, we elaborate on the proposal by presenting archetype model mechanisms for the giant and tunneling magnetoresistance effects in multilayers composed of these unconventional collinear antiferromagnets. The models are based, respectively, on anisotropic and valley-dependent forms of the alternating spin-momentum coupling. Using first-principles calculations, we link these model mechanisms to real materials and predict an approximately 100\% scale for the effects. We point out that, besides the giant or tunneling magnetoresistance detection, the alternating spin-momentum coupling can allow for magnetic excitation by the spin-transfer torque.},

Generalizing the half-integer defects in nematic liquid crystals, two-dimensional k -atic DLCs can host point defects of fractional topological charge ± m / k . Starting from a generic microscopic model, we derive a unified hydrodynamic description of DLCs with aligning or antialigning short-range interactions in terms of Ginzburg-Landau and Landau-Brazovskii-Swift-Hohenberg theories for a universal complex order-parameter field. Building on this framework, we demonstrate in particle simulations how adiabatic braiding protocols, implemented through suitable boundary conditions, can emulate anyonic exchange behavior in a classical system. Analytic solutions and simulations of the mean-field theory further predict a novel spontaneous chiral symmetry-breaking transition in antialigning DLCs, in quantitative agreement with the patterns observed in particle simulations.},

The bath in the model is formed of oscillators initially in the ground state with a distribution of energies and coupling strengths. A direct numerical solution of the Schrödinger equation for the full system including up to 10 6 oscillators in the bath verifies the expected decay process. We address quantitatively the question of separation of the qubit and bath by adding a cavity in between which by detuning allows one to adjust the decay rate into a convenient regime for detection purposes. Most importantly, we propose splitting a quantum to two uncoupled baths and performing a cross-correlation measurement of their temperatures. This technique enhances significantly the signal-to-noise ratio of the calorimeter.},

V 3 O 5 , a compound of the vanadium oxide Magnéli series, is one of the rare materials to exhibit an insulator-metal transition above room temperature ( T c ∼ 415 K ). The switching mechanisms in this material are still not clear. Here, we demonstrate both static dc volatile resistive switching and fast oscillatory spiking regimes in V 3 O 5 devices at room temperature (120 K below the phase transition temperature) by applying an electric field. We couple electrical measurements, operando optical imaging, and infrared measurements to track the reflectivity change and the temperature of a device during the resistive switching. We find that the resistive switching starts via thermal runaway deep in the insulating state and triggers the phase transition with the formation of a filament of the high-temperature phase. Furthermore, we capture optically and thermally the spiking oscillations that we link to the negative differential resistance regime and find the filament forms and dissolves via a periodic spatiotemporal instability that we describe by numerical simulations. Our studies play an important role in understanding the volatile resistive switching mechanisms and demonstrate that V 3 O 5 can be a key vanadium oxide for neuromorphic computing.},

Such structural Leggett modes can occur in the phase channel as in the original work of Leggett [ Prog. Theor. Phys. 36 , 901 (1966) ]. That is, they are antiphase Goldstone modes (antiphasons). In addition, a new collective mode can also occur in the amplitude channel, an out-of phase (antiphase) Higgs mode, that should be observable in multiband superconductors as well.

  abstract     = {CeRh 2 As 2 has recently been reported to be a rare case of a multiphase unconventional superconductor close to a quantum critical point (QCP). Here, we present a comprehensive study of its normal-state properties and of the phase (I) below T 0 ≈ 0.4 K which preempts superconductivity at T c = 0.26 K . The second-order phase transition at T 0 presents signatures in specific heat and thermal expansion but none in magnetization and ac susceptibility, indicating a nonmagnetic origin of phase I. In addition, an upturn of the in-plane resistivity at T 0 points to a gap opening at the Fermi level in the basal plane. Thermal expansion indicates a strong-positive-pressure dependence of T 0 , d T 0 / d p = 1.5 K / GPa , in contrast to the strong-negative-pressure coefficient observed for magnetic order in Ce-based Kondo lattices close to a QCP. Similarly, an in-plane magnetic field shifts T 0 to higher temperatures and transforms phase I into another nonmagnetic phase (II) through a first-order phase transition at about 9 T. Using renormalized band-structure calculations, we find that the Kondo effect ( T K ≈ 30 K ) leads to substantial mixing of the excited crystalline-electric-field states into the ground state. This allows quadrupolar degrees of freedom in the resulting heavy bands at the Fermi level which are prone to nesting. The huge sensitivity of the quadrupole moment on hybridization together with nesting causes an unprecedented case of phase transition into a quadrupole-density-wave state at a temperature T 0 ≪ T K , which explains the nature of phases I and II.},

  abstract     = {In the local or itinerant extreme, magnetic excitations can be described by the Heisenberg model which treats electron spins as localized moments, or by the itinerant-electron model where the exchange interaction between electrons leads to unequal numbers of electrons with up and down spins. However, the nature of the magnetic excitations has been elusive when both local moments and itinerant electrons are present in the intermediate range. Using inelastic neutron scattering, we provide direct spectroscopic evidence on the coexistence of and interplay between local moments and itinerant electrons in a van der Waals metallic ferromagnet Fe 2.72 GeTe 2 , which can sustain tunable room-temperature ferromagnetism down to the monolayer limit. We find that there exist ferromagnetic spin-wave excitations dispersing from the zone center at low energies resulting from local moments and a columnlike broad continuum at the zone boundary at high energies up to over 100 meV resulting from itinerant electrons. Unlike the two-dimensional crystal structure, the low-energy mode exhibits a three-dimensional nature, and the high-energy mode also has an out-of-plane dependence. Both modes persist well above the Curie temperature of 160 K. Our neutron spectroscopic data reveal that the low-energy spin waves at 100 K are more coherent than those at 4 K, which is evidence of the weakening of the Kondo screening at high temperatures. These results unambiguously demonstrate the coexistence of local moments and itinerant electrons and the Kondo effect between these two components in Fe 2.72 GeTe 2 . Such behaviors are generally expected in heavy-fermion systems with heavy f electrons but are rarely clearly observed in materials with light d electrons. These findings shed light on the understanding of magnetism in transition-metal compounds.},

Although it is often difficult to completely achieve the aforementioned goal, the existence of superconducting nodes, one of the few important experimental signatures of unconventional superconductivity, plays a vital role in exploring the possibility of unconventional superconductivity. The interplay between superconducting nodes and topology has been actively investigated, and intensive research in the past decade has revealed various intriguing nodes out of the scope of the pioneering work to classify superconducting order parameters based on the point groups. However, a systematic and unified description of superconducting nodes for arbitrary symmetry settings is still elusive. In this paper, we develop a systematic framework to comprehensively classify superconducting nodes pinned to any line in momentum space. While most previous studies are based on the homotopy theory, our theory is on the basis of the symmetry-based analysis of band topology, which enables systematic diagnoses of nodes in all nonmagnetic and magnetic space groups. Furthermore, our framework can readily provide a highly effective scheme to detect nodes in a given superconductor by using density-functional theory and assuming symmetry properties of Cooper pairs (called pairing symmetries). There are two main advantages of our method. One is that, while the symmetry-indicator theory cannot be directly applied to systems violating compatibility conditions, our diagnostic scheme focuses on such systems, which results in a complement of the symmetry-indicator theory. The other is that, although our method does not predict any pairing symmetry itself, our framework can diagnose not only the positions but also the dimensions of nodes such as line or surface nodes, which can reduce candidates of pairing symmetries. We substantiate the power of our method through the time-reversal broken and noncentrosymmetric superconductor CaPtAs. Our work establishes a unified theory for understanding superconducting nodes and facilitates determining superconducting gaps in materials combined with experimental observations.},

Here, we employ optical coherent feedback to remotely cool a nanomechanical membrane using atomic spins as a controller. Direct manipulation of the atoms allows us to tune from strong coupling to an overdamped regime. Making use of the full coherent control offered by our system, we perform spin-membrane state swaps combined with stroboscopic spin pumping to cool the membrane in a room-temperature environment to T = 216 mK ( n ¯ m = 2.3 × 10 3 phonons ) in 200 μ s . We furthermore observe and study the effects of delayed feedback on the cooling performance. Starting from a cryogenically precooled membrane, this method would enable cooling of the mechanical oscillator close to its quantum mechanical ground state and the preparation of nonclassical states.},

  abstract     = {Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is the most powerful technique to investigate the electronic band structure of crystalline solids. To completely characterize the electronic structure of topological materials, one needs to go beyond band structure mapping and access information about the momentum-resolved Bloch wave function, namely, orbitals, Berry curvature, and topological invariants. However, because phase information is lost in the process of measuring photoemission intensities, retrieving the complex-valued Bloch wave function from photoemission data has yet remained elusive. We introduce a novel measurement methodology and associated observable in extreme ultraviolet angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, based on continuous modulation of the ionizing radiation polarization axis. Tracking the energy- and momentum-resolved amplitude and phase of the photoemission intensity modulation upon polarization axis rotation allows us to retrieve the circular dichroism in photoelectron angular distributions (CDAD) without using circular photons, providing direct insights into the phase of photoemission matrix elements. In the case of two relevant bands, it is possible to reconstruct the orbital pseudospin (and thus the Bloch wave function) with moderate theory input, as demonstrated for the prototypical, layered, semiconducting, transition metal dichalcogenide 2 H − WSe 2 . This novel measurement methodology in ARPES, which is articulated around the manipulation of the photoionization transition dipole matrix element, in combination with a simple tight-binding theory, is general and adds a new dimension to obtaining insights into the orbital pseudospin, Berry curvature, and Bloch wave functions of many relevant crystalline solids.},

They provide unique insights into energy eigenstate statistics of many-body systems, as we show in an analysis on the basis of random matrix theory and of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We propose a protocol that allows the measurement of the SFF and PSFFs in quantum many-body spin models, within the framework of randomized measurements. Aimed to probe dynamical properties of quantum many-body systems, our scheme employs statistical correlations of local random operations which are applied at different times in a single experiment.

  abstract     = {The pairing of interacting fermions leading to superfluidity has two limiting regimes: the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) scheme for weakly interacting degenerate fermions and the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of bosonic pairs of strongly interacting fermions. While the superconductivity that emerges in most metallic systems is the BCS-like electron pairing, strongly correlated electrons with poor Fermi liquidity can condense into the unconventional BEC-like pairs. Quantum spin liquids harbor extraordinary spin correlation free from order, and the superconductivity that possibly emerges by carrier doping of the spin liquids is expected to have a peculiar pairing nature. The present study experimentally explores the nature of the pairing condensate in a doped spin liquid candidate material and under varying pressure, which changes the electron-electron Coulombic interactions across the Mott critical value in the system. The transport measurements reveal that the superconductivity at low pressures is a BEC-like condensate from a non-Fermi liquid and crosses over to a BCS-like condensate from a Fermi liquid at high pressures. The Nernst-effect measurements distinctively illustrate the two regimes of the pairing in terms of its robustness to the magnetic field. The present Mott tuning of the BEC-BCS crossover can be compared to the Feshbach tuning of the BEC-BCS crossover of fermionic cold atoms.},

The first is a macroscopic sensitivity of the steady state to whether N is even or odd. We discuss how this effect can be avoided (if the goal is parity-insensitive squeezing) or could be exploited as a new kind of sensing modality to detect the addition or removal of a single spin. The second effect is an anomalous emergent long timescale and a “prethermalized” regime that occurs for even weak single-spin dephasing. This effect allows one to have strong spin squeezing over a long transient time even though the level of spin squeezing in the steady state is very small. We also discuss a general hybrid-systems approach for implementing dissipative spin squeezing that does not require squeezed input light or complex multilevel atoms, but instead makes use of bosonic reservoir-engineering ideas. Our protocol is compatible with a variety of platforms, including trapped ions, nitrogen-vacancy defect spins coupled to diamond optomechanical crystals, and spin ensembles coupled to superconducting microwave circuits.},

The kagome contribution follows an original power law C p ( T → 0 ) ∝ T α with α ∼ 1.5 and is found to be field independent between 28 and 34 T for temperatures 1 ≤ T ≤ 4 K . These are serious constraints when it comes to replication using low-temperature extrapolations of high-temperature series expansions. We manage to reproduce the experimental observations if about 10\% of the kagome sites do not contribute. Between 0 and 34 T, the computed specific heat then has a minute field dependence supporting an algebraic temperature dependence in zero field, typical of a critical spin-liquid ground state. The need for an effective dilution of the kagome planes is discussed and is likely linked to the presence of copper ions on the interplane zinc sites. At very low temperatures and moderate fields, we also report some small field-induced anomalies in the total specific heat and start to elaborate on a phase diagram.},

We show that intense femtosecond laser pulses induce a substantial redshift of the upper Hubbard band while leaving the Zhang-Rice singlet energy unaffected. By comparing the experimental data to time-dependent spectra of single- and three-band Hubbard models, we assign this effect to an approximately 140-meV reduction of the on-site Coulomb repulsion on the copper sites. Our demonstration of a dynamical Hubbard U renormalization in a copper oxide paves the way to a novel strategy for the manipulation of superconductivity and magnetism as well as to the realization of other long-range-ordered phases in light-driven quantum materials.},

Prior theoretical work has focused on RNNs with additive interactions. However, gating, i.e., multiplicative, interactions are ubiquitous in real neurons and also the central feature of the best-performing RNNs in ML. Here, we show that gating offers flexible control of two salient features of the collective dynamics: (i) timescales and (ii) dimensionality. The gate controlling timescales leads to a novel, marginally stable state, where the network functions as a flexible integrator. Unlike previous approaches, gating permits this important function without parameter fine-tuning or special symmetries. Gates also provide a flexible, context-dependent mechanism to reset the memory trace, thus complementing the memory function. The gate modulating the dimensionality can induce a novel, discontinuous chaotic transition, where inputs push a stable system to strong chaotic activity, in contrast to the typically stabilizing effect of inputs. At this transition, unlike additive RNNs, the proliferation of critical points (topological complexity) is decoupled from the appearance of chaotic dynamics (dynamical complexity). The rich dynamics are summarized in phase diagrams, thus providing a map for principled parameter initialization choices to ML practitioners.},

Indeed, several approaches have been proposed to introduce metadata into probabilistic network models and to use them to make better inferences. However, we know little about the effect of such metadata in the inference process. Here, we investigate this issue. We find that, rather than affecting inference gradually, adding metadata causes a crossover in the inference process and in our ability to make accurate predictions, from a situation in which metadata do not play any role to a situation in which metadata completely dominate the inference process. When network data and metadata are partly correlated, metadata optimally contributes to the inference process at the crossover between data-dominated and metadata-dominated regimes.},

  abstract     = {We discuss several low-energy backgrounds to sub-GeV dark-matter searches, which arise from high-energy particles of cosmic or radioactive origin that interact with detector materials. We focus, in particular, on Cherenkov radiation, transition radiation, and luminescence or phonons from electron-hole pair recombination and show that these processes are an important source of backgrounds at both current and planned detectors. We perform detailed analyses of these backgrounds at several existing and proposed experiments based on a wide variety of detection strategies and levels of shielding. We find that a large fraction of the observed single-electron events in the SENSEI 2020 run originate from Cherenkov photons generated by high-energy events in the Skipper charge coupled device and from recombination photons generated in a phosphorus-doped layer of the same instrument. In a SuperCDMS HVeV 2020 run, Cherenkov photons produced in printed-circuit boards located near the sensor likely explain the origin of most of the events containing 2–6 electrons. At SuperCDMS SNOLAB, radioactive contaminants inside the Cirlex located inside or on the copper side walls of their detectors produce many Cherenkov photons, which could dominate the low-energy backgrounds. For the EDELWEISS experiment, Cherenkov or luminescence backgrounds are subdominant to their observed event rate but could still limit the sensitivity of their future searches. We also point out that Cherenkov radiation, transition radiation, and recombination could be a significant source of backgrounds at future experiments aiming to detect dark matter via scintillation or phonon signals. We also discuss the implications of our results for the development of superconducting qubits and low-threshold searches for coherent neutrino scattering. Fortunately, several design strategies to mitigate these backgrounds can be implemented, such as minimizing nonconductive materials near the target, implementing active and passive shielding, and using multiple nearby detectors.},

  abstract     = {Deterministic photon-photon gates enable the controlled generation of entanglement between mobile carriers of quantum information. Such gates have thus far been exclusively realized in the optical domain and by relying on postselection. Here, we present a nonpostselected, deterministic, photon-photon gate in the microwave frequency range realized using superconducting circuits. We emit photonic qubits from a source chip and route those qubits to a gate chip with which we realize a universal gate set by combining controlled absorption and reemission with single-qubit gates and qubit-photon controlled-phase gates. We measure quantum process fidelities of 75\% for single- and of 57\% for two-qubit gates, limited mainly by radiation loss and decoherence. This universal gate set has a wide range of potential applications in superconducting quantum networks.},

  abstract     = {Central to the success of adaptive systems is their ability to interpret signals from their environment and respond accordingly—they act as agents interacting with their surroundings. Such agents typically perform better when able to execute increasingly complex strategies. This comes with a cost: the more information the agent must recall from its past experiences, the more memory it will need. Here we investigate the power of agents capable of quantum information processing. We uncover the most general form a quantum agent need adopt to maximize memory compression advantages and provide a systematic means of encoding their memory states. We show these encodings can exhibit extremely favorable scaling advantages relative to memory-minimal classical agents, particularly when information must be retained about events increasingly far into the past.},

  abstract     = {The statistics of gap ratios between consecutive energy levels is a widely used tool—in particular, in the context of many-body physics—to distinguish between chaotic and integrable systems, described, respectively, by Gaussian ensembles of random matrices and Poisson statistics. In this work, we extend the study of the gap ratio distribution P ( r ) to the case where discrete symmetries are present. This is important since in certain situations it may be very impractical, or impossible, to split the model into symmetry sectors, let alone in cases where the symmetry is not known in the first place. Starting from the known expressions for surmises in the Gaussian ensembles, we derive analytical surmises for random matrices comprised of several independent blocks. We check our formulas against simulations from large random matrices, showing excellent agreement. We then present a large set of applications in many-body physics, ranging from quantum clock models and anyonic chains to periodically driven spin systems. In all these models, the existence of a (sometimes hidden) symmetry can be diagnosed through the study of the spectral gap ratios, and our approach furnishes an efficient way to characterize the number and size of independent symmetry subspaces. We finally discuss the relevance of our analysis for existing results in the literature, as well as its practical usefulness, and point out possible future applications and extensions.},

It was first proposed in the context of quantum machine learning, but has since been shown to have broad applications in quantum metrology and computation. No experimental demonstration of DME has been performed thus far due to its demanding circuit depths and the need to efficiently generate multiple identical copies of ρ during the finite lifetime of the target system. In this work, we describe the first demonstration of the DME algorithm, which we accomplish using a superconducting quantum processor. Our demonstration relies on a 99.7\% fidelity controlled-phase gate implemented using two tunable superconducting transmon qubits. We achieve a fidelity surpassing 90\% at circuit depths exceeding 70 when comparing the output of the circuit executed on our quantum processor to a simulation assuming perfect operations and measurements.},

Here, we present a generative model and corresponding inference procedure that are capable of distinguishing between both mechanisms. Our approach is based on a variation of the stochastic block model (SBM) with the addition of triadic closure edges, and its inference can identify the most plausible mechanism responsible for the existence of every edge in the network, in addition to the underlying community structure itself. We show how the method can evade the detection of spurious communities caused solely by the formation of triangles in the network and how it can improve the performance of edge prediction when compared to the pure version of the SBM without triadic closure.},

  abstract     = {Skyrmions are topologically protected, vortexlike formations of a field that cannot be removed by any smooth transformation and emerge in a range of fundamentally different, either quantum or classical systems, from spin textures to chiral ferromagnets and chiral complex fluids. Notably, they are generally observed in thin ordered or disordered quasi-2D layers, but little is known about their three-dimensional structuring and organization, including structural transitions from 2D to 3D. Here, we show experimentally and numerically that the blue phase (BP) III of a chiral liquid crystal is a 3D fluid of chiral skyrmion filaments of the nematic orientational field, entangled with a 3D network of topological defect lines. It is an effective 3D dynamic fluid determined by the thermal fluctuations of two distinct branches of excitations: rapid internal fluctuations of the skyrmion structure and a slow collective motion of the skyrmion filaments. When confined to less than an approximately 150-nm layer, the 3D bulk skyrmion fluid transforms into a different effectively 2D liquid of half-skyrmions, with the dynamics of the skyrmion liquid slowing down by an order of magnitude and with the individual skyrmions lingering, and even disappearing into, and reappearing from the homogeneous liquid crystal. The thickness-temperature phase diagram actually shows that both the BPIII and BPI phases are made of skyrmions, which when confined to less than approximately 150 nm cells transform equally into a 2D half-skyrmion liquid. The temperature range of this 2D half-skyrmion liquid is much broader than the temperature interval of BP phases, which makes BP materials interesting for broad-temperature-range skyrmionic applications. We envisage a soft matter skyrmionic device, in which skyrmions are created and detected by light.},

Recent advances in attosecond metrology revealed the attosecond lifetime of the shape resonance. For a heteronuclear molecule, the asymmetric initial state and landscape of the molecular potential would lead to an asymmetric shape resonance, whose effect, however, has not been characterized yet. Here, we employ an attosecond interferometer to investigate the molecular-frame photoionization time delay in the vicinity of the shape resonance of the NO molecule. Driven by photons with energy ranging from 23.8 eV to 36.5 eV, a 150 attosecond difference in the time delay is observed between photoemission from the N / O end. Our quantum scattering theoretical simulations reproduce well our experimental findings. It illustrates that the asymmetric time delay originates from the interference between resonant and nonresonant photoionization pathways.},

Here we report successful electron doping to CsV 3 Sb 5 by Cs dosing, as visualized by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We found that the electron doping with Cs dosing proceeds in an orbital-selective way, as characterized by a marked increase in electron filling of the Sb 5 p z and V 3 d x z / y z bands as opposed to the relatively insensitive nature of the V 3 d x y / x 2 − y 2 bands. By monitoring the temperature evolution of the CDW gap around the M ¯ point, we found that the CDW can be completely killed by Cs dosing while keeping the saddle point with the V 3 d x y / x 2 − y 2 character almost pinned at the Fermi level. The present result suggests a crucial role of multiorbital effect to the occurrence of CDW and provides an important step toward manipulating the CDW and superconductivity in A V 3 Sb 5 .},

Through interactions, active particles spontaneously organize in emergent large-scale structures with a rich range of materials properties. The active-matter paradigm is applied to living and nonliving systems over a vast dynamic range, from the organization of subnuclear structures in the cell to collective motion at the human scale. The diverse phenomena exhibited by these systems all stem from the defining property of active matter as an assembly of components that individually and dissipatively break time-reversal symmetry. This article outlines a selection of current and emerging directions in active matter research. It aims at providing a pedagogical and forward-looking introduction for researchers new to the field and a road map of open challenges and future directions that may appeal to those established in the area.},
