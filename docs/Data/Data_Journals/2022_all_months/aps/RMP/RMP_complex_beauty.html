  abstract = {Surfaces are at the frontier of every known solid. They provide versatile supports for functional nanostructures and mediate essential physicochemical processes. Intimately related to two-dimensional materials, interfaces and atomically thin films often feature distinct electronic states with respect to the bulk, which is key to many relevant properties, such as catalytic activity, interfacial charge-transfer, and crystal growth mechanisms. To induce novel quantum properties via lateral scattering and confinement, reducing the surface electrons’ dimensionality and spread with atomic precision is of particular interest. Both atomic manipulation and supramolecular principles provide access to custom-designed molecular assemblies and superlattices, which tailor the surface electronic landscape and influence fundamental chemical and physical properties at the nanoscale. Here the confinement of surface-state electrons is reviewed, with a focus on their interaction with molecular scaffolds created by molecular manipulation and self-assembly protocols under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Starting with the quasifree two-dimensional electron gas present at the ( 111 ) -oriented surface planes of noble metals, the intriguing molecule-based structural complexity and versatility is illustrated. Surveyed are low-dimensional confining structures in the form of artificial lattices, molecular nanogratings, or quantum dot arrays, which are constructed upon an appropriate choice of their building constituents. Whenever the realized (metal-)organic networks exhibit long-range order, modified surface band structures with characteristic features emerge, inducing noteworthy physical phenomena such as discretization, quantum coupling or energy, and effective mass renormalization. Such collective electronic states can be additionally modified by positioning guest species at the voids of open nanoarchitectures. The designed scattering potential landscapes can be described with semiempirical models, bringing thus the prospect of total control over surface electron confinement and novel quantum states within reach.},

  abstract = {A central result in the foundations of quantum mechanics is the Kochen-Specker theorem. In short, it states that quantum mechanics is in conflict with classical models in which the result of a measurement does not depend on which other compatible measurements are jointly performed. Here compatible measurements are those that can be implemented simultaneously or, more generally, those that are jointly measurable. This conflict is generically called quantum contextuality. In this review, an introduction to this subject and its current status is presented. Several proofs of the Kochen-Specker theorem and different notions of contextuality are reviewed. How to experimentally test some of these notions is explained, and connections between contextuality and nonlocality or graph theory are discussed. Finally, some applications of contextuality in quantum information processing are reviewed.},

This was possible because of concurrent advances in the models used to represent these systems, the methods employed, and the analysis of the emerging phenomenology. A comprehensive review of these three integrated research directions is given. First provided is an overarching view of the models of boundary-driven open quantum systems, in both the weak- and strong-coupling regimes. This is followed by a review of state-of-the-art analytical and numerical methods that are exact, perturbative, and approximate. Finally, the transport properties of some paradigmatic one-dimensional chains are discussed, with an emphasis on disordered and quasiperiodic systems, the emergence of rectification and negative differential conductance, and the role of phase transitions, and an outlook on further research options is given.},

  abstract = {Nanomechanics has brought mesoscopic physics into the world of vibrations. Because nanomechanical systems are small, fluctuations are significant, the vibrations already become nonlinear for comparatively small amplitudes, and new mechanisms of dissipation come into play. At the same time, the exquisite control of these systems makes them a platform for studying many problems of classical and quantum physics far from thermal equilibrium in a well-characterized setting. This review describes, at a conceptual level, basic theoretical ideas and explicative experiments pertaining to mesoscopic physics of nanomechanical systems. Major applications of nanomechanics in science and technology are also outlined. A broad range of phenomena related to the conservative as well as dissipative nonlinearity and fluctuations are discussed within a unifying framework. They include the linear response of single and coupled vibrational modes as well as nonlinear effects of periodic driving. Such driving breaks the continuous time-translation symmetry and the detailed balance, with conspicuous consequences for fluctuations, particularly in the presence of the driving-induced bistability and multistability. Mathematical techniques are described in the appendixes to provide an introduction to the theory. The goal of the review is to show the richness of the physics at work. The continuous experimental and theoretical advances make nanomechanical systems a vibrant area of research with many new phenomena to discover.},

  abstract = {Since the discovery of electron-wave duality, electron scattering instrumentation has developed into a powerful array of techniques for revealing the atomic structure of matter. Beyond detecting local lattice variations in equilibrium structures with the highest possible spatial resolution, recent research efforts have been directed toward the long-sought-after dream of visualizing the dynamic evolution of matter in real time. The atomic behavior at ultrafast timescales carries critical information on phase transition and chemical reaction dynamics, the coupling of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom in materials and molecules, and the correlation among structure, function, and previously hidden metastable or nonequilibrium states of matter. Ultrafast electron pulses play an essential role in this scientific endeavor, and their generation has been facilitated by rapid technical advances in both ultrafast laser and particle accelerator technologies. This review presents a summary of the noteworthy developments in this field in the last few decades. The physics and technology of ultrafast electron beams is presented with an emphasis on the figures of merit most relevant for ultrafast electron diffraction experiments. Recent developments in the generation, manipulation, and characterization of ultrashort electron beams aimed at improving the combined spatiotemporal resolution of these measurements are discussed. The fundamentals of electron scattering from atomic matter and the theoretical frameworks for retrieving dynamic structural information from solid-state and gas-phase samples is described. Essential experimental techniques and several landmark works that have applied these approaches are also highlighted to demonstrate the widening applicability of these methods. Ultrafast electron probes with ever-improving capabilities, combined with other complementary photon-based or spectroscopic approaches, hold tremendous potential for revolutionizing our ability to observe and understand energy and matter at atomic scales.},

  abstract = {Gauge freedom in quantum electrodynamics (QED) outside of textbook regimes is reviewed. It is emphasized that QED subsystems are defined relative to a choice of gauge. Each definition uses different gauge-invariant observables. This relativity is eliminated only if a sufficient number of Markovian and weak-coupling approximations are employed. All physical predictions are gauge invariant, including subsystem properties such as photon number and entanglement. However, subsystem properties naturally differ for different physical subsystems. Gauge ambiguities arise not because it is unclear how to obtain gauge-invariant predictions, but because it is not always clear which physical observables are the most operationally relevant. The gauge invariance of a prediction is necessary but not sufficient to ensure its operational relevance. It is shown that, in controlling which gauge-invariant observables are used to define a material system, the choice of gauge affects the balance between the material system’s localization and its electromagnetic dressing. Various implications of subsystem gauge relativity for deriving effective models, for describing time-dependent interactions, for photodetection theory, and for describing matter within a cavity are reviewed.},

  abstract = {In the laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing of metals, extreme thermal conditions create many highly dynamic physical phenomena, such as vaporization and recoil, Marangoni convection, and protrusion and keyhole instability. Collectively, however, the full set of phenomena is too complicated for practical applications and, in reality, the melting modes are used as a guideline for printing. With an increasing local material temperature beyond the boiling point, the mode can change from conduction to keyhole. These mode designations ignore laser-matter interaction details but in many cases are adequate to determine the approximate microstructures, and hence the properties of the build. To date no consistent, common, and coherent definitions have been agreed upon because of historic limitations in melt pool and vapor depression morphology measurements. In this review, process-based definitions of different melting modes are distinguished from those based on postmortem evidence. The latter are derived mainly from the transverse cross sections of the fusion zone, whereas the former come directly from time-resolved x-ray imaging of melt pool and vapor depression morphologies. These process-based definitions are more strict and physically sound, and they offer new guidelines for laser additive manufacturing practices and create new research directions. The significance of the keyhole, which substantially enhances the laser energy absorption by the melt pool, is highlighted. Recent studies strongly suggest that stable-keyhole laser melting enables efficient, sustainable, and robust additive manufacturing. The realization of this scenario demands the development of multiphysics models, signal translations from morphology to other feasible signals, and in-process metrology across platforms and scales.},

  abstract = {A future quantum network will consist of quantum processors that are connected by quantum channels, just like conventional computers are wired up to form the Internet. In contrast to classical devices, however, the entanglement and nonlocal correlations available in a quantum-controlled system facilitate novel fundamental tests of quantum theory. In addition, they enable numerous applications in distributed quantum information processing, quantum communication, and precision measurement. While pioneering experiments have demonstrated the entanglement of two quantum nodes separated by up to 1.3 km, and three nodes in the same laboratory, accessing the full potential of quantum networks requires scaling of these prototypes to many more nodes and global distances. This is an outstanding challenge, posing high demands on qubit control fidelity, qubit coherence time, and coupling efficiency between stationary and flying qubits. This Colloquium describes how optical resonators facilitate quantum network nodes that achieve the aforementioned prerequisites in different physical systems (trapped atoms, defect centers in wide-band-gap semiconductors, and rare-earth dopants) by enabling high-fidelity qubit initialization and readout, efficient generation of qubit-photon and remote qubit-qubit entanglement, and quantum gates between stationary and flying qubits. These advances open a realistic perspective toward the implementation of global-scale quantum networks in the near future.},

  abstract = {Magnetic skyrmions are topologically stable nanoscale particlelike objects that were discovered in 2009. Since that time, intense research interest in the field has led to the identification of numerous compounds that support skyrmions over a range of conditions spanning from cryogenic to room temperatures. Skyrmions can be set into motion under various types of driving, and the combination of their size, stability, and dynamics makes them ideal candidates for numerous applications. At the same time, skyrmions represent a new class of system in which the energy scales of the skyrmion-skyrmion interactions, sample disorder, temperature, and drive can compete. A growing body of work indicates that the static and dynamic states of skyrmions can be influenced strongly by pinning or disorder in the sample; thus, an understanding of such effects is essential for the eventual use of skyrmions in applications. The current state of knowledge regarding individual skyrmions and skyrmion assemblies interacting with quenched disorder or pinning is reviewed. The microscopic mechanisms for skyrmion pinning, including the repulsive and attractive interactions that can arise from impurities, grain boundaries, or nanostructures, are outlined. This is followed by descriptions of depinning phenomena, sliding states over disorder, the effect of pinning on the skyrmion Hall angle, the competition between thermal and pinning effects, the control of skyrmion motion using ordered potential landscapes such as one- or two-dimensional periodic asymmetric substrates, the creation of skyrmion diodes, and skyrmion ratchet effects. Highlighted are the distinctions arising from internal modes and the strong gyrotropic or Magnus forces that cause the dynamical states of skyrmions to differ from those of other systems with pinning, such as vortices in type-II superconductors, charge density waves, or colloidal particles. Throughout this review future directions and open questions related to the pinning and dynamics in skyrmion systems are also discussed.},

  abstract = {This is a review of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model of compressible quantum many-body systems without quasiparticle excitations, and its connections to various theoretical studies of non-Fermi liquids in condensed matter physics. The review is placed in the context of numerous experimental observations on correlated electron materials. Strong correlations in metals are often associated with their proximity to a Mott transition to an insulator created by the local Coulomb repulsion between the electrons. The phase diagrams of a number of models of such a local electronic correlation are explored, employing a dynamical mean-field theory in the presence of random spin exchange interactions. Numerical analyses and analytical solutions, using renormalization group methods and expansions in large spin degeneracy, lead to critical regions that display SYK physics. The models studied include the single-band Hubbard model, the t − J model, and the two-band Kondo-Heisenberg model in the presence of random spin exchange interactions. Also examined are non-Fermi liquids obtained by considering each SYK model with random four-fermion interactions to be a multiorbital atom, with the SYK atoms arranged in an infinite lattice. Connections are made to theories of sharp Fermi surfaces without any low-energy quasiparticles in the absence of spatial disorder, obtained by coupling a Fermi liquid to a gapless boson; a systematic large- N theory of such a critical Fermi surface, with SYK characteristics, is obtained by averaging over an ensemble of theories with random boson-fermion couplings. Finally, an overview of the links between the SYK model and quantum gravity is presented, and the review ends with an outlook on open questions.},

  abstract = {Interest in the multiple facets of optical vortices has flourished in the last three decades. This review examines the basic research and applications of the interplay between optical vortices and condensed-matter systems. This subfield of optical-vortex physics has rapidly developed in recent years thanks to a vigorous synergy between theory and experiment. After presenting self-contained and focused introductions to optical vortices and condensed-matter optics, theory and current progress in the research on the interaction of condensed-matter systems and optical vortices are examined. When one considers the interaction of optical vortices with condensed-matter systems, many aspects of the standard theory of the interaction of matter with plane-wave light need to be reformulated. In bulk, light-matter Hamiltonian matrix elements have to be recalculated and novel selection rules are obtained, reflecting the conservation of total angular momentum. Orbital angular momentum is transferred from the light beam to the photoexcited electrons, thereby generating macroscopic currents. Semiconductor nanostructures add the complexity of their own spatial inhomogeneity, which is handled adequately by the envelope-function approximation. Here again modified matrix elements for light-matter interactions dictate the allowed and forbidden optical transitions, which are distinct from those obtained in traditional optical excitation with smooth fields. Quantum rings play a central role due to their specially adapted geometry to the cylindrical nature of the optical-vortex beams. When the electron-electron interaction is taken into account, the rich physics of excitons and exciton polaritons comes into play and is modified by the finite orbital angular momentum of the structured light. Furthermore, the new features brought about by optical vortices in plasmonics and in the optical excitation of two-dimensional materials are reviewed. For all these systems theory and recent experiments are discussed. Finally, an overview of current and prospective applications of the interaction of optical vortices with condensed-matter systems in the fields of quantum technologies, communications, sensing, etc., is presented. Throughout this review an attempt has been made to present not only a survey of the relevant literature but also a perspective on the interesting and rapidly evolving field of optical-vortex–condensed-matter interactions.},

  abstract = {Laser-produced plasmas (LPPs) engulf exotic and complex conditions ranging in temperature, density, pressure, magnetic and electric fields, charge states, charged particle kinetics, and gas-phase reactions based on the irradiation conditions, target geometries, and background cover gas. The application potential of the LPP is so diverse that it generates considerable interest for both basic and applied research areas. The fundamental research on LPPs can be traced back to the early 1960s, immediately after the invention of the laser. In the 1970s, the laser was identified as a tool to pursue inertial confinement fusion, and since then several other technologies have emerged out of LPPs. These applications prompted the development and adaptation of innovative diagnostic tools for understanding the fundamental nature and spatiotemporal properties of these complex systems. Although most of the traditional characterization techniques developed for other plasma sources can be used to characterize the LPPs, care must be taken to interpret the results because of their small size, transient nature, and inhomogeneities. The existence of the large spatiotemporal density and temperature gradients often necessitates nonuniform weighted averaging over distance and time. Among the various plasma characterization tools, optical-based diagnostic tools play a key role in the accurate measurements of LPP parameters. The optical toolbox contains optical spectroscopy (emission, absorption, and fluorescence), as well as passive and active imaging and optical probing methods (shadowgraphy, Schlieren imaging, interferometry, Thomson scattering, deflectometry, and velocimetry). Each technique is useful for measuring a specific property, and its use is limited to a certain time span during the LPP evolution because of the sensitivity issues related to the selected measuring tool. Therefore, multiple diagnostic tools are essential for a comprehensive insight into the entire plasma behavior. Recent improvements in performance in laser and detector systems have expanded the capability of the aforementioned passive and active diagnostic tools. This review provides an overview of optical diagnostic tools frequently employed for the characterization of the LPPs and emphasizes techniques, associated assumptions, and challenges. Considering that most of the industrial and other applications of the LPP belong to low to moderate laser intensities ( 10 8 – 10 15 W cm − 2 ), this review focuses on diagnostic tools pertaining to this regime.},

  abstract = {Quantum theory has been successfully validated in numerous laboratory experiments. But would such a theory, which effectively describes the behavior of microscopic physical systems and its predicted phenomena such as quantum entanglement, still be applicable on large length scales? From a practical perspective, how can quantum key distribution (where the security of establishing secret keys between distant parties is ensured by the laws of quantum mechanics) be made technologically useful on a global scale? Owing to photon loss in optical fibers and terrestrial free space, the achievable distance using direct transmission of single photons has been limited to a few hundred kilometers. A promising route to testing quantum physics over long distances and in the relativistic regimes, and thus realizing flexible global-scale quantum networks, is via the use of satellites and space-based technologies, where a significant advantage is that the photon loss and turbulence predominantly occurs in the lower ∼ 10 km of the atmosphere, and most of the photons’ transmission path in space is virtually in vacuum, with almost zero absorption and decoherence. Progress in free-space quantum experiments, with a focus on the fast-developing Micius satellite–based quantum communications, is reviewed. The perspective of space-ground integrated quantum networks and fundamental quantum optics experiments in space conceivable with satellites are discussed.},

  abstract = {A complete understanding of the brain requires an integrated description of the numerous scales and levels of neural organization. This means studying the interplay of genes and synapses, but also the relation between the structure and dynamics of the whole brain, which ultimately leads to different types of behavior, from perception to action, while asleep or awake. Yet multiscale brain modeling is challenging, in part because of the difficulty to simultaneously access information from multiple scales and levels. While some insight has been gained on the role of specific microcircuits on the generation of macroscale brain activity, a comprehensive characterization of how changes occurring at one scale or level can have an impact on other ones remains poorly understood. Recent efforts to address this gap include the development of new frameworks originating mostly from network science and complex systems theory. These theoretical contributions provide a powerful framework to analyze and model interconnected systems exhibiting interactions within and between different layers of information. Recent advances for the characterization of the multiscale brain organization in terms of structure-function, oscillation frequencies, and temporal evolution are presented. Efforts are reviewed on the multilayer network properties underlying the physics of higher-order organization of neuronal assemblies, as well as on the identification of multimodal network-based biomarkers of brain pathologies such as Alzheimer’s disease. This Colloquium concludes with a perspective discussion of how recent results from multilayer network theory, involving generative modeling, controllability, and machine learning, could be adopted to address new questions in modern physics and neuroscience.},

In classical cryptography, this can usually be guaranteed only under computational hardness assumptions, such as when factoring large integers is infeasible.

  abstract = {Two processes of photon-pair creation can be arranged such that the paths of the emitted photons are identical. The path information is thereby not erased but rather never born in the first place due to this path identity. In addition to its implications for fundamental physics, this concept has recently led to a series of impactful discoveries in the fields of imaging, spectroscopy, and quantum information science. Here the idea of path identity is presented and a comprehensive review of recent developments is provided. Specifically, the concept of path identity is introduced based on three defining experimental ideas from the early 1990s. The three experiments have in common that they contain two photon-pair sources. The paths of one or both photons from the different sources overlap such that no measurement can recognize from which source they originate. A wide range of noteworthy quantum interference effects (at the single- or two-photon level), such as induced coherence, destructive interference of photon pairs, and entanglement generation, are subsequently described. Progress in the exploration of these ideas has stagnated and has gained momentum again only in the last few years. The focus of the review is the new development in the last few years that modified and generalized the ideas from the early 1990s. These developments are overviewed and explained under the same conceptual umbrella, which will help the community develop new applications and realize the foundational implications of this sleeping beauty.},

These formulations involve various types of duality and provide exact coarse-graining formulas that can be combined with truncations to obtain practical implementations of the Wilson renormalization group program. Tensor reformulations are naturally discrete and provide manageable transfer matrices. Truncations with the time continuum limit are combined, and Hamiltonians suitable for performing quantum simulation experiments, for instance, using cold atoms, or to be programmed on existing quantum computers, are derived. Recent progress concerning the tensor field theory treatment of noncompact scalar models, supersymmetric models, economical four-dimensional algorithms, noise-robust enforcement of Gauss’s law, symmetry preserving truncations, and topological considerations are reviewed.

  abstract = {In undergraduate courses on classical electromagnetism, it is taught that a perfect conductor expels the electromagnetic (EM) field, and hence its surface is not able to support the propagation of bound EM waves. However, when the surface of a perfect conductor is structured at a length scale much smaller than the operating wavelength, geometrically induced surface EM modes can be supported. Owing to their similarities with the surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in the optical regime, these surface EM modes were named spoof surface plasmons. The concept of spoof surface plasmons has opened up a new line of research within plasmonics with the aim of transferring all the potentialities of SPPs in the optical regime to lower frequencies (microwave, terahertz, and midinfrared regimes) in which a metal behaves as a quasiperfect conductor. In recent years, several research groups have extended this concept from planar surfaces to waveguides, and eventually to resonators, covering the entire range of structures studied in standard plasmonics. This review provides a detailed perspective on the recent developments in spoof surface plasmon photonics from both the fundamental and applied sides.},

  abstract = {The cell, as the most fundamental unit of life, is a microcosm of biology in which the confluence of nearly all aspects of classical physics (mechanics, statistical physics, condensed matter, and electromagnetism) plays out. This leads to a rich and complex emergent behavior that determines the entire gamut of biological functions. Specifically, at the cellular scale, mechanical forces and deformations are inextricably linked to electrical fields (and, to a lesser degree, magnetic fields). This in turn is responsible for phenomenology such as cell-cell communication, morphological evolution, cell fusion, self-assembly, cell fission, magnetoreception, endocytosis, and adhesion, among others. From the viewpoint of biomedicine, cellular response to the combined influence of electrical, magnetic, and mechanical fields has applications in cancer treatment, targeted transfer of medicine, gene therapy, and wound amelioration. As an example of the profound influence of the combined electrical-mechanical coupling, one needs to take cognizance only of the operation of ion channels that form the basis for our sensing system (such as hearing, sight, and tactile sense). The coupled mechanical and electromagnetic behavior of a cell is a highly interdisciplinary endeavor and this review provides a distillation of both the theoretical underpinnings of the subject and the pertinent biological interpretation. The key developments pertaining to this topic are reviewed, a unified mathematical framework that couples nonlinear deformation and electromagnetic behavior as germane for soft biological entities is summarized, gaps in current knowledge are pointed out, and the central issues that are pertinent to future research are commented upon.},

  abstract = {Interfacial thermal resistance (ITR) is the main obstacle for heat flows from one material to another. Understanding ITR becomes essential for the removal of redundant heat from fast and powerful electronic and photonic devices, batteries, etc. In this review, a comprehensive examination of ITR is conducted. Particular focus is placed on the theoretical, computational, and experimental developments in the 30 years after the last review given by Swartz and Pohl in 1989. To be self-consistent, the fundamental theories, such as the acoustic mismatch model, the diffuse mismatch model, and the two-temperature model, are reviewed. The most popular computational methods, including lattice dynamics, molecular dynamics, the Green’s function method, and the Boltzmann transport equation method, are discussed in detail. Various experimental tools in probing ITR, such as the time-domain thermoreflectance, the thermal bridge method, the 3 ω method, and the electron-beam self-heating method, are illustrated. This review covers ITR (also known as the thermal boundary resistance or Kapitza resistance) of solid-solid, solid-liquid, and solid-gas interfaces. Such fundamental challenges as how to define the interface, temperature, etc. when the materials scale down to the nanoscale or atomic scale and the opportunities for future studies are also pointed out.},

  abstract = {The new era of gravitational wave astronomy truly began on September 14, 2015, with the detection of GW150914, the sensational first direct observation of gravitational waves from the inspiral and merger of two black holes by the two Advanced LIGO detectors. In the subsequent first three observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo network, gravitational waves from ∼ 50 compact binary mergers have been announced, with more results to come. The events have mostly been produced by binary black holes, but two binary neutron star mergers have been observed thus far, as well as the mergers of two neutron star–black hole systems. Furthermore, gravitational waves emitted by core-collapse supernovae, pulsars, and the stochastic gravitational wave background are within the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA sensitivity band and are likely to be observed in future observation runs. Beyond signal detection, a major challenge has been the development of statistical and computational methodology for estimating the physical waveform parameters and quantifying their uncertainties in order to accurately characterize the emitting system. These methods depend on the sources of the gravitational waves and the gravitational waveform model that is used. This review examines the main waveform models and parameter estimation methods used to extract physical parameters from gravitational wave signals detected to date by LIGO and Virgo and from those expected to be observed in the future, which will include KAGRA, and how these methods interface with various aspects of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA science. Also presented are the statistical methods used by LIGO and Virgo to estimate detector noise, test general relativity, and draw conclusions about the rates of compact binary mergers in the Universe. Furthermore, a summary of major publicly available gravitational wave parameter estimation software packages is given.},

  abstract = {The rich and diverse dynamics of particle-based systems ultimately originates from the coupling of their degrees of freedom via internal interactions. To arrive at a tractable approximation of such many-body problems, coarse graining is often an essential step. Power functional theory provides a unique and microscopically sharp formulation of this concept. The approach is based on an exact one-body variational principle to describe the dynamics of both overdamped and inertial classical and quantum many-body systems. In equilibrium, density-functional theory is recovered, and hence spatially inhomogeneous systems are described correctly. The dynamical theory operates on the level of time-dependent one-body correlation functions. Two- and higher-body correlation functions are accessible via the dynamical test-particle limit and the nonequilibrium Ornstein-Zernike route. The structure of this functional approach to many-body dynamics is described, including much background as well as applications to a broad range of dynamical situations, such as the van Hove function in liquids, flow in nonequilibrium steady states, motility-induced phase separation of active Brownian particles, lane formation in binary colloidal mixtures, and both steady and transient shear phenomena.},

  abstract = {The Monte Carlo evaluation of path integrals is one of a few general purpose methods to approach strongly coupled systems. It is used in all branches of physics, from QCD and nuclear physics to the correlated electron systems. However, many systems of great importance (dense matter inside neutron stars, the repulsive Hubbard model away from half filling, and dynamical and nonequilibrium observables) are not amenable to the Monte Carlo method as it currently stands due to the so-called sign problem. A new set of ideas recently developed to tackle the sign problem based on the complexification of field space and the Picard-Lefshetz theory accompanying it is reviewed. The mathematical ideas underpinning this approach, as well as the algorithms developed thus far, are described together with nontrivial examples where the method has already been proved successful. Directions of future work, including the burgeoning use of machine learning techniques, are delineated.},

  abstract = {The ongoing transition to renewable energy supply comes with a restructuring of power grids, changing their effective interaction topologies, more and more strongly decentralizing them and substantially modifying their input, output, and response characteristics. All of these changes imply that power grids become increasingly affected by collective, nonlinear dynamic phenomena, structurally and dynamically more distributed and less predictable in space and time, more heterogeneous in its building blocks, and as a consequence less centrally controllable. Here cornerstone aspects of data-driven and mathematical modeling of collective dynamical phenomena emerging in real and model power grid networks by combining theories from nonlinear dynamics, stochastic processes and statistical physics, anomalous statistics, optimization, and graph theory are reviewed. The mathematical background required for adequate modeling and analysis approaches is introduced, an overview of power system models is given, and a range of collective dynamical phenomena are focused on, including synchronization and phase locking, flow (re)routing, Braess’s paradox, geometric frustration, and spreading and localization of perturbations and cascading failures, as well as the nonequilibrium dynamics of power grids, where fluctuations play a pivotal role.},

  abstract = {A universal fault-tolerant quantum computer that can efficiently solve problems such as integer factorization and unstructured database search requires millions of qubits with low error rates and long coherence times. While the experimental advancement toward realizing such devices will potentially take decades of research, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers already exist. These computers are composed of hundreds of noisy qubits, i.e., qubits that are not error corrected, and therefore perform imperfect operations within a limited coherence time. In the search for achieving quantum advantage with these devices, algorithms have been proposed for applications in various disciplines spanning physics, machine learning, quantum chemistry, and combinatorial optimization. The overarching goal of such algorithms is to leverage the limited available resources to perform classically challenging tasks. In this review, a thorough summary of NISQ computational paradigms and algorithms is provided. The key structure of these algorithms and their limitations and advantages are discussed. A comprehensive overview of various benchmarking and software tools useful for programming and testing NISQ devices is additionally provided.},

  abstract = {The study of lepton flavor universality violation (LFUV) in semitauonic b -hadron decays has become increasingly important in light of long-standing anomalies in their measured branching fractions, and the large datasets anticipated from the LHC experiments and Belle II. In this review, a comprehensive survey of the experimental environments and methodologies for semitauonic LFUV measurements at the B factories and LHCb is undertaken, along with an overview of the theoretical foundations and predictions for a wide range of semileptonic decay observables. The future prospects of controlling systematic uncertainties down to the percent level, matching the precision of standard model (SM) predictions, are examined. Furthermore, new perspectives and caveats on combinations of the LFUV data are discussed and the world averages for the R ( D ( * ) ) ratios are revisited. Here it is demonstrated that different treatments for the correlations of uncertainties from D * * excited states can vary the current 3 σ tension with the SM within a 1 σ range. Prior experimental overestimates of D * * τ ν contributions may further exacerbate this. The precision of future measurements is also estimated; their power to exploit full differential information, and solutions to the inherent difficulties in self-consistent new physics interpretations of LFUV observables, are explored.},

  abstract = {Nucleons (protons and neutrons) are the building blocks of atomic nuclei and are responsible for more than 99\% of the visible matter in the Universe. Despite decades of efforts in studying its internal structure, there are still a number of puzzles surrounding the proton such as its spin and charge radius. Accurate knowledge about the proton charge radius is not only essential for understanding how QCD works in the nonperturbative region but also important for bound state QED calculations of atomic energy levels. It also has an impact on the Rydberg constant, one of the most precisely measured fundamental constants in nature. This review examines the latest situation concerning the proton charge radius in light of the new experimental results from both atomic hydrogen spectroscopy and electron-scattering measurements, with particular focus on the latter. Theoretical backgrounds and recent developments concerning the determination of the proton charge radius using different experimental techniques are also presented. Upcoming experiments are discussed, and the deuteron charge radius puzzle is mentioned at the end.},

  abstract = {The second law of thermodynamics implies a relationship between the net entropy export by Earth and its internal irreversible entropy production. The application of this constraint for the purpose of understanding Earth’s climate is reviewed. Both radiative processes and material processes are responsible for irreversible entropy production in the climate system. With a focus on material processes, an entropy budget for the climate system is derived that accounts for the multiphase nature of the hydrological cycle. The entropy budget facilitates a heat-engine perspective of atmospheric circulations that has been used to propose theories for convective updraft velocities, tropical cyclone intensity, and the atmospheric meridional heat transport. Such theories can be successful, however, only if they properly account for the irreversible entropy production associated with water in all its phases in the atmosphere. Irreversibility associated with such moist processes is particularly important in the context of global climate change, for which the concentration of water vapor in the atmosphere is expected to increase, and recent developments toward understanding the response of the atmospheric heat engine to climate change are discussed. Finally, the application of variational approaches to the climate and geophysical flows is reviewed, including the use of equilibrium statistical mechanics to predict the behavior of long-lived coherent structures and the controversial maximum entropy production principle.},
