  abstract     = {Watson–Crick (WK) finite automata are working on a Watson–Crick tape, that is, on an abstract construct similar to DNA molecules. Therefore, it has two reading heads. While in traditional WK automata both heads read the whole input in the same physical direction, in $$5&#39;\rightarrow 3&#39;$$ WK automata the heads start from the two extremes and read the input in opposite direction. In sensing $$5&#39;\rightarrow 3&#39;$$ WK automata the process on the input is finished when the heads meet. Since the heads of a WK automaton may read longer strings in a transition, in previous models a so-called sensing parameter took care for the proper meeting of the heads (not allowing to read the same positions of the input in the last step). In this paper, a new model is investigated, which works without the sensing parameter (it is done by an appropriate change of the concept of configuration). Consequently, the accepted language classes of the variants are also changed. Various hierarchy results including six sublinear language classes and closure properties are proven in the paper.},

  abstract     = {Meta-heuristics are powerful tools for solving optimization problems whose structural properties are unknown or cannot be exploited algorithmically. We propose such a meta-heuristic for a large class of optimization problems over discrete domains based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) paradigm. We provide a comprehensive formal analysis of the performance of this algorithm on certain “easy” reference problems in a black-box setting, namely the sorting problem and the problem OneMax. In our analysis we use a Markov model of the proposed algorithm to obtain upper and lower bounds on its expected optimization time. Our bounds are essentially tight with respect to the Markov model. We show that for a suitable choice of algorithm parameters the expected optimization time is comparable to that of known algorithms and, furthermore, for other parameter regimes, the algorithm behaves less greedy and more explorative, which can be desirable in practice in order to escape local optima. Our analysis provides a precise insight on the tradeoff between optimization time and exploration. To obtain our results we introduce the notion of indistinguishability of states of a Markov chain and provide bounds on the solution of a recurrence equation with non-constant coefficients by integration.},

  abstract     = {In 1989, den Boer presented the first card-based protocol, called the “five-card trick,” that securely computes the AND function using a deck of physical cards via a series of actions such as shuffling and turning over cards. This protocol enables a couple to confirm their mutual love without revealing their individual feelings. During such a secure computation protocol, it is important to keep any information about the inputs secret. Almost all existing card-based protocols are secure under the assumption that all players participating in a protocol are semi-honest or covert, i.e., they do not deviate from the protocol if there is a chance that they will be caught when cheating. In this paper, we consider a more malicious attack in which a player as an active adversary can reveal cards illegally without any hesitation. Against such an actively revealing card attack, we define the t-secureness, meaning that no information about the inputs leaks even if at most t cards are revealed illegally. We then actually design t-secure AND protocols. Thus, our contribution is the construction of the first formal framework to handle actively revealing card attacks as well as their countermeasures.},

An input string is accepted by a swarm automaton depending on the conditions of the agents in the swarm. That is, an input string that leads the swarm to a specified condition is accepted. When we introduce position information for agents in a swarm automaton, the agent not only changes but also moves according to the nearby agents. In this paper, we introduce a language accepted by a swarm automaton based on the position of agents in a swarm. That is, a string is accepted when it leads to the swarm consisting of agents on the designated position. We focus on the number of agents in a swarm and consider the computing power of that swarm automaton.

However, in some settings there can be hard constraints that make the problem unfeasible. In this paper we focus on the task of repairing infeasibility in job shop scheduling problems with a hard constraint on the makespan. In this context, earlier work addressed the problem of computing the largest subset of the jobs that can be scheduled within the makespan constraint. Herein, we face a more general weighted version of the problem, consisting in computing a feasible subset of jobs maximizing their weighted sum. To this aim, we propose an efficient memetic algorithm, that combines a genetic algorithm with a local search method, also proposed in the paper.

This research develops two ROS components, one for translating robot knowledge to the conceptual graphs and one for extracting context knowledge from this graph using Bayesian networks. We evaluate these components in a real-world scenario, performing a task where a robot notifies to a user a message of an event at home.

In this paper, we propose a combination of Genetic Programming (GP) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) to obtain ensembles of priority rules to solve a scheduling problem, denoted $$(1,Cap(t)||\sum T_i)$$ , on-line. In this problem, a set of jobs must be scheduled on a single machine whose capacity varies over time. The proposed approach interleaves GP and GA so that a GP is in charge of evolving single priority rules and a GA is executed after each iteration of the GP to evolve ensembles from the rules produced by the GP in this iteration, at the same time as the GP evolves the next generation of rules. Therefore, the ensembles are obtained in an anytime fashion. In the experimental study, we compare the proposed approach to a previous one in which the GP was firstly run to evolve a large pool of candidate priority rules, and then the GA was run to obtain ensembles from that pool of rules. The results of this study revealed that the ensembles produced by the interleaved combination of GP and GA are better than those obtained by the sequential combination of GP and GA. So, these results, together with the ensembles being available earlier, make this approach more appropriate to the on-line requirements of the scheduling problem.},

In link-state routing, setting appropriate weights to the links is an important and challenging optimization task. Different approaches have been put forward towards this aim, including evolutionary algorithms (EAs). This work addresses the evaluation of a single and two multi-objective EAs, in two tasks related to weight setting optimization towards optimal intra-domain routing, knowing the network topology and aggregated traffic demands and seeking to minimize network congestion. In both tasks, the optimization considers scenarios where there is a dynamic alteration in the network, with (1) changes in the traffic demand matrices, and (2) link failures. The methods will simultaneously optimize for both conditions, the normal and the altered one, following a preventive TE approach. Since this leads to a bi-objective function, the use of multi-objective EAs, such as SPEA2 and NSGA-II, came naturally; those are compared to a single-objective EA previously proposed by the authors. The results show a remarkable performance and scalability of NSGA-II in the proposed tasks presenting itself as the most promising option for TE.},

A collection of properties is presented and discussed: nilpotency and asymptotic, generic or mu- variants, unique ergodicity, convergence, bounded-changeness, freezingness. They all correspond to the cold dynamics paradigm at various degrees, and we study their links and differences by key examples and results. Besides dynamical considerations, we also focus on computational aspects: we show how such cold cellular automata can still compute under their dynamical constraints, and what are their computational limitations. The purpose of this tutorial is to illustrate how the richness and complexity of the model of cellular automata are preserved under such strong constraints. By putting forward some open questions, it is also an invitation to look more closely at this cold dynamics territory, which is far from being completely understood.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we introduce an application of a Cellular Automata (CA)-based system for monitoring and estimating the spread of epidemics in real world, considering the example of a Greek city. The proposed system combines cellular structure and graph representation to approach the connections among the area’s parts more realistically. The original design of the model is attributed to a classical SIR (Susceptible–Infected–Recovered) mathematical model. Aiming to upgrade the application’s effectiveness, we have enriched the model with parameters that advances its functionality to become self-adjusting and more efficient of approaching real situations. Thus, disease-related parameters have been introduced, while human interventions such as vaccination have been represented in algorithmic manner. The model incorporates actual geographical data (GIS, geographic information system) to upgrade its response. A methodology that allows the representation of any area with given population distribution and geographical data in a graph associated with the corresponding CA model for epidemic simulation has been developed. To validate the efficient operation of the proposed model and methodology of data display, the city of Eleftheroupoli, in Eastern Macedonia—Thrace, Greece, was selected as a testing platform (Eleftheroupoli, Kavala). Tests have been performed at both macroscopic and microscopic levels, and the results confirmed the successful operation of the system and verified the correctness of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {In the context of the propagation of infectious diseases, when a sufficient degree of immunisation is achieved within a population, the spread of the disease is ended or significantly decreased, leading to collective immunity, meaning the indirect protection given by immune individuals to susceptible individuals. Here we describe the estimates of the collective immunity to COVID-19 from a stochastic cellular automaton based model designed to emulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a population of static individuals interacting only via a Moore neighbourhood of radius one, with a view to analyze the impact of initially immune individuals on the dynamics of COVID-19. This impact was measured by comparing a progression of initial immunity ratio—the percentage of immunised individuals before patient zero starts infecting its neighbourhood—from 0 to 95\% of the initial population, with the number of susceptible individuals not contaminated, the peak value of active cases, the total number of deaths and the emulated pandemic duration in days. The influence of this range of immunities over the model was tested with different parameterisations regarding the uncertainties involved in the model such as the durations of the cellular automaton states, the contamination contributions of each state and the state transition probabilities. A collective immunity threshold of $$55\% \pm 2.5\%$$ on average was obtained from this procedure, under four distinct parameterisations, which is in tune with the estimates of the currently available medical literature, even increasing the uncertainty of the input parameters.},

More specifically, the objective is to find CA rules which are able to cover the 2D space by a minimum number of so–called “Sensor Tiles”. A sensor tile consists of a von Neumann neighborhood of range 2 centered at sensor “point” and surrounded by 12 sensing “pixels”. Two probabilistic CA rules were designed that can perform this task. Results of an experimental study show that the first rule evolves very fast stable sub-optimal coverings, starting from a random configuration. The second rule finds optimal coverings, however it needs much more time for their evolution. The results are supported by a theoretical study on von Neumann neighborhoods and borrowing either from heuristics or from the spectral theory of circulant graphs.},

The fluid flow is solved by a multiple relaxation time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), whereas the temperature and concentration fields are computed by finite difference method (FDM). To assess numerical accuracy, the model (MRT-LBM coupled with FDM) are verified and validated using data from the literature. Besides reasonable agreement, satisfactory computational efficiency is also found. Thereafter, the model is applied for the thermal diffusion effect on a double-diffusive mixed convection in a cavity with moving lid. Results are obtained depending on various dimensionless parameters. It is found that upon increasing the Soret number, heat transfer is slightly enhanced whereas the thickness of the concentration boundary layer increases, thereby decreasing the mass transfer rate.},

We prove that our construction preserves the algebraic degree of the local rule, and we narrow our attention to the subclass of quadratic functions, performing several experiments based on exhaustive combinatorial search and heuristic optimization through Evolutionary Strategies (ES). Finally, we classify the obtained results up to permutation equivalence, remarking that the number of equivalence classes that our CA-XOR construction can successfully extend grows very quickly with respect to the CA diameter.},

As an example we describe a construction of a cellular automaton that generates prefixes of the Oldenburger–Kolakoski sequence within real time. Furthermore, we study the real-time generation of unary and non-unary patterns in depth. In the unary case, we obtain a characterization by time-constructible functions and their corresponding unary formal languages.

We would like to point out the possibility to solve such problems by computer game plying that is called a gamesourcing. Gamesourcing can be understood as a version of game-driven crowdsourcing. The main part and contribution of this paper is a demonstration of gamesourcing use in the game called Labyrinth that reflects TSP structure. The game has a form of a maze-labyrinth that enables players to move through it like the Ant Colony Optimization. The playing of the Labyrinth, thus, by playing, solves the problem. The performance of the “human ant-like system” is then evaluated and compared against some well-known versions of ACO. As we believe, our experiments suggest that this approach can serve as an alternative way that employs gamesourcing to assist a combinatorial optimizer in achieving better results on a well-known NP-hard optimization problem.},

The characteristics of an optimisation problem can be intuitively understood and quantified in terms of fitness landscapes characteristics (FLCs). Similarly, the behaviour of a swarm-based algorithm can be quantified in terms of its diversity rate-of-change (DRoC). This study investigates correlations between the FLCs of optimisation problems and the DRoCs of particle swarm optimisers. The result is a collection of findings about links between particular problem characteristics and algorithm behaviour.

This paper investigates the fractal nature of LONs and how that nature relates to metaheuristic performance on the underlying problem. We use visual analysis, correlation analysis, and machine learning techniques to demonstrate that relationships exist and that fractal features of LONs can contribute to explaining and predicting algorithm performance. The results show that the extent of multifractality and high fractal dimensions in the LON can contribute in this way when placed in regression models with other predictors. Features are also individually correlated with search performance, and visual analysis of LONs shows insight into this relationship.},

We show a convenient way to analyze such search strategies as dynamic systems that transform the sampling measure. We can draw informative conclusions for a class of strategies with a focusing heuristic. For this class we can evaluate the amount of information about the problem that can be gathered and suggest ways to verify stopping conditions. Next, we show the Hierarchic Memetic Strategy coupled with Multi-Winner Evolutionary Algorithm (HMS/MWEA) that follow the ideas from the first part of the paper. We introduce a complex, ergodic Markov chain of their dynamics and prove an asymptotic guarantee of success. Finally, we present numerical solutions to ill-conditioned problems: two benchmarks and a real-life engineering one, which show the strategy in action.

  abstract     = {Learning Classifier Systems (LCSs) are a group of rule-based evolutionary computation techniques, which have been frequently applied to data mining tasks. The LCSs’ rules are designed to be human-readable to enable the underlying knowledge to be investigated. However, the models for the majority of domains with high feature interaction contain a large number of rules that cooperatively represent the knowledge. However, the interaction between many rules is too complex to be comprehended by humans. Thus, it is hypothesized that translating the models’ underlying patterns into human-discernable visualizations will advance the understanding of the learned patterns and LCSs themselves. Interrogatable artificial Boolean domains with varying numbers of attributes are considered as benchmarks. Three new visualization techniques, termed as Feature Importance Map, Action-based Feature Importance Map, and Action-based Feature’s Average value Map, successfully produce interpretable results for all the complex domains tested. This includes both tracing the training progress and analyzing the trained models from LCSs. The visualization techniques’ ability to handle complex optimal solutions is observed for the 14-bits Majority-On problem, where the patterns from 6435 different cooperating rules were translated into human-discernable graphs.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate-based optimization, nature-inspired metaheuristics, and hybrid combinations have become state of the art in algorithm design for solving real-world optimization problems. Still, it is difficult for practitioners to get an overview that explains their advantages in comparison to a large number of available methods in the scope of optimization. Available taxonomies lack the embedding of current approaches in the larger context of this broad field. This article presents a taxonomy of the field, which explores and matches algorithm strategies by extracting similarities and differences in their search strategies. A particular focus lies on algorithms using surrogates, nature-inspired designs, and those created by automatic algorithm generation. The extracted features of algorithms, their main concepts, and search operators, allow us to create a set of classification indicators to distinguish between a small number of classes. The features allow a deeper understanding of components of the search strategies and further indicate the close connections between the different algorithm designs. We present intuitive analogies to explain the basic principles of the search algorithms, particularly useful for novices in this research field. Furthermore, this taxonomy allows recommendations for the applicability of the corresponding algorithms.},

A surrogate-assisted MOEA solves multi-objective optimization problems while estimating the evaluation of solutions with a surrogate function. A surrogate function is produced by a machine learning model. This paper uses an extreme learning surrogate-assisted MOEA/D (ELMOEA/D), which utilizes one of the well-known MOEA algorithms, MOEA/D, and a machine learning technique, extreme learning machine (ELM). A parallelization of MOEA, on the other hand, evaluates solutions in parallel on multiple computing nodes to accelerate the optimization process. We consider a synchronous and an asynchronous parallel MOEA as a master-slave parallelization scheme for ELMOEA/D. We carry out an experiment with multi-objective optimization problems to compare the synchronous parallel ELMOEA/D with the asynchronous parallel ELMOEA/D. In the experiment, we simulate two settings of the evaluation time of solutions. One determines the evaluation time of solutions by the normal distribution with different variances. On the other hand, another evaluation time correlates to the objective function value. We compare the quality of solutions obtained by the parallel ELMOEA/D variants within a particular computing time. The experimental results show that the parallelization of ELMOEA/D significantly reduces the computational time. In addition, the integration of ELMOEA/D with the asynchronous parallelization scheme obtains higher quality of solutions quicker than the synchronous parallel ELMOEA/D.},

  abstract     = {The initial population in genetic programming (GP) should form a representative sample of all possible solutions (the search space). While large populations accurately approximate the distribution of possible solutions, small populations tend to incorporate a sampling error. This paper analyzes how the size of a GP population affects the sampling error and contributes to answering the question of how to size initial GP populations. First, we present a probabilistic model of the expected number of subtrees for GP populations initialized with full, grow, or ramped half-and-half. Second, based on our frequency model, we present a model that estimates the sampling error for a given GP population size. We validate our models empirically and show that, compared to smaller population sizes, our recommended population sizes largely reduce the sampling error of measured fitness values. Increasing the population sizes even more, however, does not considerably reduce the sampling error of fitness values. Last, we recommend population sizes for some widely used benchmark problem instances that result in a low sampling error. A low sampling error at initialization is necessary (but not sufficient) for a reliable search since lowering the sampling error means that the overall random variations in a random sample are reduced. Our results indicate that sampling error is a severe problem for GP, making large initial population sizes necessary to obtain a low sampling error. Our model allows practitioners of GP to determine a minimum initial population size so that the sampling error is lower than a threshold, given a confidence level.},

  abstract     = {Metaheuristics provide the means to approximately solve complex optimisation problems when exact optimisers cannot be utilised. This led to an explosion in the number of novel metaheuristics, most of them metaphor-based, using nature as a source of inspiration. Thus, keeping track of their capabilities and innovative components is an increasingly difficult task. This can be resolved by an exhaustive classification system. Trying to classify metaheuristics is common in research, but no consensus on a classification system and the necessary criteria has been established so far. Furthermore, a proposed classification system can not be deemed complete if inherently different metaheuristics are assigned to the same class by the system. In this paper we provide the basis for a new comprehensive classification system for metaheuristics. We first summarise and discuss previous classification attempts and the utilised criteria. Then we present a multi-level architecture and suitable criteria for the task of classifying metaheuristics. A classification system of this kind can solve three main problems when applied to metaheuristics: organise the huge set of existing metaheuristics, clarify the innovation in novel metaheuristics and identify metaheuristics suitable to solve specific optimisation tasks.},

  abstract     = {The inherent difficulty of solving a continuous, static, bound-constrained and single-objective black-box optimization problem depends on the characteristics of the problem’s fitness landscape and the algorithm being used. Exploratory landscape analysis (ELA) uses numerical features generated via a sampling process of the search space to describe such characteristics. Despite their success in a number of applications, these features have limitations related with the computational costs associated with generating accurate results. Consequently, only approximations are available in practice which may be unreliable, leading to systemic errors. The overarching aim of this paper is to evaluate the reliability of five well-known ELA feature sets across multiple dimensions and sample sizes. For this purpose, we propose a comprehensive experimental methodology combining exploratory and statistical validation stages, which uses resampling techniques to minimize the sampling cost, and statistical significance tests to identify strengths and weaknesses of individual features. The data resulting from the methodology is collected and made available in the LEarning and OPtimization Archive of Research Data v1.0. The results show that instances of the same function can have feature values that are significantly different; hence, non-generalizable across instances, due to the effects produced by the boundary constraints. In addition, some landscape features under evaluation are highly volatile, and strongly susceptible to changes in sample size. Finally, the results show evidence of a curse of modality, meaning that the sample size should increase with the number of local optima.},

  abstract     = {The growing interest in dynamic optimisation has accelerated the development of genetic algorithms with specific mechanisms for these problems. To ensure that these developed mechanisms are capable of solving a wide range of practical problems it is important to have a diverse set of benchmarking functions to ensure the selection of the most appropriate Genetic Algorithm. However, the currently available benchmarking sets are limited to unconstrained problems with predominantly continuous characteristics. In this paper, the existing range of dynamic problems is extended with 15 novel constrained multi-objective functions. To determine how genetic algorithms perform on these constrained problems, and how this behaviour relates to unconstrained dynamic optimisation, 6 top-performing dynamic genetic algorithms are compared alongside 4 re-initialization strategies on the proposed test set, as well as the currently existing unconstrained cases. The results show that there are no differences between constrained/unconstrained optimisation, in contrast to the static problems. Therefore, dynamicity is the prevalent characteristic of these problems, which is shown to be more important than the discontinuous nature of the search and objective spaces. The best performing algorithm overall is MOEA/D, and VP is the best re-initialisation strategy. It is demonstrated that there is a need for more dynamic specific methodologies with high convergence, as it is more important to performance on dynamic problems than diversity.},

  abstract     = {Computational pangenomics is an emerging research field that is changing the way computer scientists are facing challenges in biological sequence analysis. In past decades, contributions from combinatorics, stringology, graph theory and data structures were essential in the development of a plethora of software tools for the analysis of the human genome. These tools allowed computational biologists to approach ambitious projects at population scale, such as the 1000 Genomes Project. A major contribution of the 1000 Genomes Project is the characterization of a broad spectrum of genetic variations in the human genome, including the discovery of novel variations in the South Asian, African and European populations—thus enhancing the catalogue of variability within the reference genome. Currently, the need to take into account the high variability in population genomes as well as the specificity of an individual genome in a personalized approach to medicine is rapidly pushing the abandonment of the traditional paradigm of using a single reference genome. A graph-based representation of multiple genomes, or a graph pangenome, is replacing the linear reference genome. This means completely rethinking well-established procedures to analyze, store, and access information from genome representations. Properly addressing these challenges is crucial to face the computational tasks of ambitious healthcare projects aiming to characterize human diversity by sequencing 1M individuals (Stark et al. 2019). This tutorial aims to introduce readers to the most recent advances in the theory of data structures for the representation of graph pangenomes. We discuss efficient representations of haplotypes and the variability of genotypes in graph pangenomes, and highlight applications in solving computational problems in human and microbial (viral) pangenomes.},

We identify an important subproblem of this prediction problem, namely: the problem of recognizing the recurrent configurations of the sandpile dynamics. This latter problem can be solved in linear time by simulating the appropriate sandpile avalanches. We ask: do there exist sequential algorithms that solve this recognition problem in sublinear time? We prove that there do not exist sublinear time sequential algorithms that solve this problem in a probabilistic approximately correct way. This means that those avalanches cannot be predicted by a sequential algorithm. We also study the problem of fighting against avalanches. This latter problem resembles the classical firefighter problem. We prove that fighting against two-dimensional avalanches is harder than fighting against fires on forests of low depth.},

  abstract     = {Iterative arrays whose internal inter-cell communication is quantitatively restricted are investigated. The quantity of communication is measured by counting the number of uses of the links between cells. In particular, iterative arrays are studied where the maximum number of communications per cell occurring in accepting computations is drastically bounded by a constant number. Additionally, the iterative arrays have to work in realtime. We study the computational capacity of such devices. For example, a result is that a strict and dense hierarchy with respect to the constant number of communications exists. Due to their very restricted communication, the question arises whether the usually studied decidability problems such as, for example, emptiness, finiteness, inclusion, or equivalence become decidable for such devices. However, it can be shown that all such decidability questions remain undecidable even if only four communications per cell are allowed. Finally, the undecidability results are shown to hold as well for one-way and two-way cellular automata having at most four communications per cell.},
