  abstract     = {Recently, decoding human electroencephalographic (EEG) data using convolutional neural network (CNN) has driven the state-of-the-art recognition of motor-imagery EEG patterns for brain–computer interfacing (BCI). While a variety of CNN models have been used to classify motor-imagery EEG data, it is unclear if aggregating an ensemble of heterogeneous CNN models could further enhance the classification performance. To integrate the outputs of ensemble classifiers, this work utilizes fuzzy integral with particle swarm optimization (PSO) to estimate optimal confidence levels assigned to classifiers. The proposed framework aggregates CNN classifiers and fuzzy integral with PSO, achieving robust performance in single-trial classification of motor-imagery EEG data across various CNN model training schemes depending on the scenarios of BCI usage. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of applying fuzzy fusion techniques to enhance CNN-based EEG decoding and benefit practical applications of BCI.},

Autonomous vehicles need to detect and analyze the movement of surrounding vehicles to make safe driving decisions. This paper proposes a Clustering Convolution-LSTM (CC-LSTM) vehicle trajectory prediction model. Using Fuzzy Clustering method, similar trajectories of surrounding vehicles are clustered to mine the temporal features of vehicles trajectory. The result is carried out to classify the features of historical trajectory by Density Clustering and find the similarity during segments which are used as the spatial features of target vehicles trajectory. The screened spatio-temporal features are fused by Las Vegas Wrapper (LVW) algorithm to obtain new input data of Convolution-LSTM network to make prediction. This model is trained by different features of data. Simulation shows that the CC-LSTM prediction model with surrounding vehicle interaction information and selected features can meet the real-time and accuracy requirements of prediction.},

  abstract     = {Cognitive fuzzy preference relations (CFPRs) can represent the preference information of pairwise comparisons of objects through membership and non-membership degrees in an explainable way. Nevertheless, there is a heavy burden of an expert to provide a CFPR. As an important property of preference relations, the additive transitivity has challenging points in terms of weak interpretability of thresholds, inefficient use of information, and unfair treatment of small-value inputs. In addition, it is still a challenge to analyze the information variability of experts in the additive transitivity. In this study, to reduce the burden of experts when providing pairwise preference information, we define the reciprocal cognitive fuzzy preference relation (RCFPR). The additive transitivity of an RCFPR is defined to enhance the utilization efficiency of preference information. To avoid the unfair treatment of small-value inputs, we apply the ceiling restriction in the additive transitivity conditions of an RCFPR. An additive transitivity learning model considering the risk preferences of experts is set up to identify the information variability in RCFPRs. Simulation experiments show that the absolute-error-based objective function is suitable for the additive transitivity learning model.},

By introducing a novel finite-time command filter, the derivative of virtual control law is approximated, so the issue of “explosion of complexity” is successfully avoided. At the same time, the fractional power error compensation mechanism is constructed to quickly remove the effect of filtered error. By virtue of the command filter technique, backstepping design method, and event-triggered control strategy, the adaptive finite-time fault-tolerant controllers for a quadrotor UAV are designed. It is demonstrated that all signals of the closed-loop system are finite time bounded, and the attitude and position tracking errors can converge to a small neighborhood near the origin in a finite time. Finally, the simulation examples are given to validate the efficacy of the developed adaptive finite-time control algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Soft clustering is able to handle overlapping data thanks to membership functions that allow examples to belong to several clusters. However, the formula linking membership functions to centers and the adoption of fixed time steps, when updating the parameters, prevents research from exploring areas that may be promising. To alleviate this complexity and enlarge the search space, we propose a constrained optimization model that de-assigns memberships from centers. To take advantage of the ability of neural networks to understand the characteristics of the data and of dynamic systems to remember previous groupings, we solve the proposed model by the third-order gradient recurrent network whose stability point is formed by the memberships and the centers. In this respect, the fixed time step Euler-Cauchy algorithm prevents the search from exploring promising regions. To remedy this problem, we adopt a variable time step that allows a maximum decay of the Lyaponuv function at each iteration. We demonstrate that dissociating the membership coefficients from the group centers results in a less complex optimization model with a larger set of feasible solutions offering better optimal fuzzy clustering. We compared our method to different clustering methods basing on silhouette, separability, compactness criterion, and on Dunn’s index; our method has shown its superiority on academic data sets. We used our method to group plants based on 24 nutrients which results in a better classification in comparison with the unidimensional methods.},

The strategy is mainly composed of data driven approach and adaptive fuzzy neural network method. Firstly, support vector machine (SVM) is adopted to identify road condition. The load, speed and air pressure signals collected by sensors and indirectly obtained suspension dynamic deflection data are imported into the SVM model trained by data to obtain-specific road conditions. Then, with the obtained road condition, the optimal air pressure of the pneumatic linear actuators is searched, which decides the negative stiffness of the system and is later the target pressure. Adaptive fuzzy neural network which trained by large amount of data is used in the air pressure seeking process to make sure that the target air pressure of any driving condition is suitable. Finally, active disturbance rejection controller (ADRC) is applied to realize tracking control of target air pressure. Parameters of ADRC are set to adapt to variable driving conditions. The results of Hardware-in-Loop (HiL) tests indicate that the negative stiffness control strategy can effectively improve multi-objective performance of commercial vehicles under different driving conditions.},

First, an evaluation criteria system of point-pillar stability is established. Considering that point-pillar stability is affected by both qualitative and quantitative factors, hesitant fuzzy numbers (HFNs) and crisp numbers are adopted to express criteria values. Then, the traditional GA is modified with a nonlinear programming algorithm to improve its local search ability and calculate criteria weights. Afterwards, the traditional WDBA method is extended with HFNs to solve those evaluation problems with hybrid decision information. Finally, the proposed methodology is applied to evaluate the point-pillar stability in Xinli mining district. The effectiveness and advantages of the methodology are discussed based on the comparison of multiple approaches. The results indicate that the proposed hesitant fuzzy GA-WDBA approach is reasonable and efficient for the evaluation of point-pillar stability, and can provide a reference for the risk management of point-pillar stability.},

Logic methods like Karnaugh maps and Quine McCluskey&#39;s algorithm have been offered as ways to adapt and reduce the amount of fuzzy rules. An approach based on Karnaugh maps to reduce the number of fuzzy rules without binary coding has been proposed. The second technique, on the other hand, is a non-fuzzy approach that employs the same rules as the reduced fuzzy controller, namely, non-fuzzy (ordinary) If–then rules.

As a result, this work investigates a class of nonlinear strict-feedback fractional-order systems and presents a novel control strategy. To begin, in order to cope with the unknown drift functions and unmeasurable system states, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs)and a robust fractional-order state observer are designed. Second, in order to further reduce the FLS approximation error and state estimation error, a hyperbolic tangent function is implemented. Third, the problem of the differential explosion caused by repeated differentiation when employing the backstepping technique when designing a control scheme is also overcome without the help of a command filter or dynamic surface control. Finally, theoretical analysis and simulation results show that by combining the backstepping procedure with the sliding mode technique, not only is it possible to achieve strong robustness against unknown drift function and unknown external time-varying disturbance, but also that the tracking error can converge to the vicinity of the origin.},

  abstract     = {Probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy set (PDHFS) as an extension of the generalization of hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) and dual hesitant fuzzy set (DHFS). It not only reflects the hesitant attitude of decision-makers (DMs), but also reflects probabilistic information. It is a more powerful and important tool to express uncertain information. As we all know, the distance and entropy measures are very useful tool in the MADM problems. In many fuzzy environments, their distance and entropy measures are proposed, and the MADM methods depend on the distance and entropy measures are given. First, to overcome the disadvantages of destroying the original information caused by artificially adding elements, we defined the membership degree (MD) mean, non-membership degree (NMD) mean and standard deviation for PDHFE, based on above definitions, the mean and standard deviation distance were proposed. Secondly, without the aid of other auxiliary functions, we built some novel PDHF entropy measures. Third, depend on the distance and entropy measures built, we integrate the classical CODAS method with the PDHF setting, and build a novel MADM technique to solving the MADM problem. Finally, the built MADM technique is used to the evaluation of enterprise credit risk to testify the practicability and feasibility of the built MADM technique. Meanwhile, the MADM technique built in this study is compared with some existing methods, and the advantages of the MADM technique proposed in this study are put forward, which has a better effect in solving MADM problems.},

  abstract     = {With the redundancy and complexity of information and data, how to acquire the samples that meet the requirements is an inevitable task in data analysis. There is a general consensus that the neighborhood rough set (NRS) has become the mainstream method for data mining and knowledge classification. Whereas, the limitations still exist in the neighborhood relation for it cannot more accurately reflect the dominance relations that commonly exist in actual data, nor can it select the required data according to different conditions. Enlightened by this idea, this paper focuses on the intuitionistic fuzzy neighborhood dominance relation, which both refines the relationship between samples in the neighborhood and mines the needed samples in data analysis. On this basis, we define the neighborhood dominance rough set (NDRS) model in intuitionistic fuzzy ordered information system (IFOIS). Moreover, we establish the multigranulation neighborhood dominance rough set (MNDRS) from multiple perspectives, and discuss related properties between NDRS and MNDRS. Meanwhile, we compare the NDRS with other rough set models from the roughness and the dependence degree viewpoints. Finally, we adopt nine UCI data sets and implement a series of experiments to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed models.},

  abstract     = {As one of the important natural resources, water resources are related to the future survival and development of human beings. In recent years, the problem of water resources security has become more and more prominent, and it is urgent to study water resources security. Taking 30 provinces and cities in China as an example, this paper constructs a water resources security index system from three aspects of resource supply, social economy and ecological environment, and innovatively proposes a new evaluation method. Specifically, considering the influence of subjective and objective factors on the weighting of indicators, the best–worst method (BWM) and the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation (CRITIC) method are used to determine the subjective and objective weights of each indicator, and the two weights are unified in combination with the principle of maximizing variance. After that, the combined weight was applied to the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method, and a new fuzzy multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) method of combined weighting was finally developed to evaluate the water security status in China. This avoids the error of the traditional single-weight method evaluation to a certain extent, and also conducts other relevant empirical analysis. The research method developed in this paper provides a new idea for dealing with multi-criteria optimization problems in complex systems, and the research results provide a theoretical basis for ensuring regional water resources security and promoting coordinated development among regions.},

In recent years, it has been rapidly developed and popularized in the field of decision science. Firstly, it is pointed out that there are some defects in the existing score function and ranking criteria of PFNs through counter examples, and the main causes of these defects are analyzed according to the geometric method. Secondly, IFNs are unified into the Pythagorean fuzzy environment, the new unified score function and geometric ranking criterion of IFNs and PFNs are proposed by the corresponding upper curved trapezoidal area and hesitation factor, and then the rationality of geometric ranking method and some basic properties of the score function are studied. Finally, the comparison of other ranking methods shows that the proposed method only needs a score function and its own hesitation to rank all PFNs uniformly, especially the accurate comparisons among equivalent PFNs are realized. This not only overcomes the contradiction and confusion caused by the respective ranking of traditional IFNs and PFNs, but also provides a theoretical basis for further expanding the fuzzy decision-making method of Pythagorean fuzzy sets.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses a special class of non-linear programming problems, viz., linear fractional programming problems having multiple objectives. In solving the real-life linear fractional optimization problems, the ambiguity and hesitation in the decision are inherent and ever-present, therefore, it is perfectly viable to formulate and solve these optimization models using the intuitionistic fuzzy environment. The purpose of this study is to propose a simple and computationally efficient approach to obtain the solution of multiple objective linear fractional programming problems having all the decision variables and parameters expressed in terms of triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. The proposed solution algorithm is primarily based on the goal programming approach, fuzzy-based linearization technique, and a membership function strategy. The original linear fractional programming problem is first converted to its equivalent deterministic/crisp multi-objective linear fractional optimization problem using the weighted goal programming methodology along with the linear membership technique to resolve the intuitionistic fuzzy constraints into the crisp one. Finally, the variable transformation technique for the under- and over-deviational variables of the goal programming model is employed to linearize all the fractions involved in the problem so as to convert the original problem to an equivalent linear optimization problem. Further, this linear programming problem can be solved using any available commercial packages. Moreover, a numerical illustration is provided to demonstrate the steps of the proposed technique followed by the analysis and solution of an E-education set-up problem. The discussion and comparisons of the practical case establish the relevancy and usefulness of the proposed model.},

Firstly, a general ETM is proposed, whose triggering threshold includes both of a plant-dependent term and a plant-independent constant. Unlike some existing ETMs having high triggering rates during steady stage or transient stage, the proposed ETM can keep a low triggering rate during the whole system-running time. By integrating effects of the ETM, Bernoulli-distribution deception attacks, and network-induced delays in a unified framework, a closed-loop T-S fuzzy system model is built. Then, ultimately bounded stability criteria are obtained with guaranteed $$\mathcal {L}_\infty$$ performance. Next, sufficient conditions for designing dynamic output feedback fuzzy controller are derived. Finally, an example illustrates effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {As an important modeling tool for knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR), fuzzy Petri nets (FPNs) have been applied in kinds of fields. However, there exist some deficiencies for existing FPNs, resulting in application limitations. (1) The sum of membership and non-membership is less than 1, which is hard to model various types of uncertain knowledge by existing FPNs; (2) The reasonable and nonidentical experiential knowledge for electrolysis operation among domain experts should be fused; (3) The existing knowledge reasoning algorithm min, max, and product operators may not work well in many practical applications. In an effort to overcome the shortcomings of existing FPNs, a new type of FPNs is proposed, called simplified neutrosophic Petri nets (SNPNs). First, the simplified neutrosophic sets (SNSs) are introduced into SNPNs, characterized by three independent degrees of truth-membership, indeterminacy-membership and falsity-membership, to depict the experiential cognition of domain experts. Second, the extended TOPSIS (ETOPSIS) is proposed for knowledge fusion. Third, hybrid averaging SNNs concurrent reasoning algorithm (HASCRA) is also proposed to improve the knowledge reasoning efficiency. Finally, a novel model for the identification of superheat degree of aluminum electrolysis cell (ISDAEC) is proposed based on SNPNs. Comparative experimental results show that the SNPNs provide a feasible and practical decision-making method. Moreover, this fact denotes that the proposed method has potential applications in intelligent ISDAEC.},

The SAFNN overcomes the sequential tuning process of classical ANFIS controllers by simultaneously optimizing the structure and parameters of unknown system dynamics. The construction of SAFNN does not require control base rules in the initial phase and this enhances the learning capability to track the approximated voltage error. The proposed SAFNN employs the linear transformation of the input signal to optimize the required fuzzy rules and speed up the online learning process to achieve the higher accuracy of the control results. The meta-algorithms whale optimization algorithm and Harris hawks optimization is employed for online dynamic behavior identification. The SAFNN-WOA optimizes the membership function to estimate direct and quadrature axis voltage for prediction performance in terms of fast-tracking predefined signals, fewer oscillations, and voltage compensation ability. The dc-link voltage is accurately estimated by employing OELM-HHO and provides improved power quality performance during voltage disturbances. The OELM has the inherent feature of randomly generating the initial weights which effectively evaluates the output weight during the online training procedure and enhances the learning rate. The statistical tools MSE, RMSE, ME, SD, and R during the training stage were evaluated as 168.9052, 12.9964, − 5.5524e−07, 12.9965 and during the testing stage the value are 168.9611, 12.9985, − 0.11566, 12.9986 and 0.78654. These statistical assessment values confirm the goodness-of-fit of the predictive model. The result shows that the proposed hybrid controls SAFNN-WOA and OELM-HHO-based DVR significantly achieves the prediction accuracy for both training and test dataset. Nevertheless, the proposed intelligent DVR model outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Photovoltaic (PV) array equipped on an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) suffers from rapid-changing partial-shading conditions since USV maneuvers frequently alter shadows on deck, thereby facing a challenge in time-varying maximum power point tracking (MPPT). In this paper, a fuzzy neural directed adaptive particle optimization (FN-APSO) solution is innovatively provided to dynamically determine the global maximum power point (GMPP) in a fast-accurate manner. To facilitate the accuracy, an adaptive PSO (APSO) algorithm is created by assigning region-wise update laws which sufficiently avoid unnecessary search behaviors and ensure global convergence, simultaneously. To further enhance the rapidity, using history data, a fuzzy neural network is devised to judge the evolution direction of GMPP, and enables the APSO to incrementally execute, thereby establishing the entire FN-APSO scheme. Simulation results clearly show remarkable MPPT performance in terms of both speed and accuracy under rapid-changing partial-shading conditions.},

A new fuzzy hybrid neural network named as backstepping self-organizing hybrid function-link fuzzy brain emotional learning controller (BSDFFBC) is developed. The proposed hybrid structure is a type of brain-imitated neural network. The BSDFFBC is combined with a backstepping control technique, an enhancement search algorithm (ESA), and a hybrid function-link network (HFLN) to enforce its control ability. Moreover, a self-organizing mechanism is used to automatically adjust the number of neurons that can maintain the BSDFFBC to accommodate large variations in inputs and system uncertainties and can also significantly reduce the computation time. Next, a new genetic algorithm-based ESA is proposed to find the optimal parameters for the control system. Then, the online learning rules of the BSDFFBC are designed using the backstepping control technique and the gradient descent algorithm. Thus, the system structure and control parameters of the control system can be online adjusted to achieve more efficient control performance. Moreover, a robust compensation controller is added to BSDFFBC to improve the control quality of the system. Finally, the proposed BSDFFBC control system is used to control a roll-to-roll system and a magnetic ball levitation system to show its favorable control performance; and the comparisons with other controllers have shown its superiority.},

  abstract     = {Common interventions to control the spread of cholera include improving sanitation, hygiene, and access to safe drinking water and providing epidemic regions with sufficient treatment kits and oral vaccines. Due to resources limitation, these interventions should be guided by a risk assessment of cholera-affected regions, thereby targeting regions based on their risk level. Cholera risk assessment is very challenging because of the lack of precise and reliable data. This study proposes an approach for cholera risk assessment and vaccine allocation, which consists of two phases: (i) cholera risk assessment, where a fuzzy inference system (FIS) is proposed to evaluate the risk level of cholera-affected regions based on five cholera risk indicators: (1) attack rate, (2) case fatality rate, (3) the number of internally displaced persons, (4) accessibility of water, sanitation and hygiene, and (5) accessibility of cholera treatment; (ii) cholera vaccine allocation, where a mixed-integer programming model is used to optimize the allocation of limited vaccine doses among multiple regions over multiple periods while considering the risk level, population of regions, and vaccine efficacy. The model answers the questions of where, what amounts, and when to send vaccines during a 2-year horizon. Implementation of the proposed approach is illustrated using a case study from Yemen, which is currently experiencing the world’s worst cholera outbreak according to the World Health Organization. The results reveal the usefulness of the proposed approach in mapping the cholera risk, which in turn is used as effective guidance for the allocation of cholera vaccine.},

Based on the modeling approach, the system is described by Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model such that the linear theories can be applied to discuss the problem. To guarantee the regularity and impulse-free property, proportional derivative (PD) control scheme and parallel distributed compensation (PDC) concept are employed to construct the fuzzy controller. Furthermore, a PD fuzzy observer is also designed to ensure the existence the derivative term of controller and to estimate the unmeasurable states. For the problem, a Lyapunov function and converting technologies are applied to derive less conservative stability criterion. Moreover, some sufficient conditions are transferred into Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) form for using convex optimization algorithm. In addition, uncertainty is also considered for practical operation to achieve robustness of the closed loop system. According to the uncertainty and the derived conditions, a general and relaxed observer-based fuzzy controller design method is proposed to guarantee the robust asymptotical stability of the uncertain nonlinear singular systems.

Detecting anomaly in WSNs is a decisive research area, which emphasizes making sensor nodes to be reliable in handling data. Owing to energy restrictions and less computation capability of sensor networks, anomaly detection ought to concentrate on the fundamental limitations of sensor networks. Anomaly detection and dipping noisy data transmission are essential to recover the network life span of sensor networks by promising data integrity. Henceforth, academicians and researchers are frequently getting motivated in finding methods to improve the accuracy of data held by the sensor nodes. In such surroundings, the investigators focus on semi-supervised anomaly detection which uses real data to distinguish incidences that are conflicting with the widely-held data. The proposed idea is acquainted with a fuzzy-based anomaly detection model for semi-supervised anomaly detection in an effort to recover accuracy. The proposed model is compared with other leading existing procedures and methodology over robustness and other substantial metrics. Comparatively, our proposed prototype achieves a high-performance score with 99.70% accuracy, 99.14% precision, 99.27% detection rate, 98.56% specificity, 98.78% F1 score, and 0.8 correlation coefficient. It is detected that our proposed model diminishes false alarms up to 1.20% through detection which is a key concern in WSNs.},

  abstract     = {Earth observation satellites are playing an increasingly important role in emergencies and have become an essential means of obtaining information. Given the suddenness and high urgency of emergencies, evaluating and selecting the emergency mission scheduling schemes in consideration evaluators’ individual preferences have become a high priority. Since the selection of emergency task scheduling scheme often involves many stakeholders and has the complex characteristics of a large group, how to obtain the common solution accepted by the majority of participants is the main challenge we face in the process of scheme selection. To cope with this challenge, this paper presents an original evaluation framework to address the selection problem of emergency mission scheduling schemes under a linguistic distribution preference relationship (LDPR) with numerous evaluators. In the proposed evaluation framework, a consistency-driven optimization model is proposed to produce interval numerical scales with personalized individual semantics by maximizing the consistency of the interval fuzzy preference relation transformed from the LDPR. Then, a personalization-driven consensus reaching model with acceptance probability is devised to model the individual willingness of evaluators to improve the satisfaction of consensus achievement. Following this, a collective method is designed to aggregate evaluators’ individual preferences based on the principle of justifiable granularity by maximizing the product of the specificity and coverage of information granule. Finally, a case study and some comparative analyses are undertaken to demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed evaluation framework.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the stabilization problem for a class of uncertain nonlinear fractional order systems described by an interval type-2 fuzzy model, under actuator faults. To solve the problem, a robust fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme composed mainly of an augmented non-fragile observer and a new-type $$H_\infty$$ controller is developed. The resulting control system is with the following advantages. On the one hand, the system stability domain is extended significantly, attributed to introducing the concept of D-stability to the control design and stability analysis, instead of the conventional indirect Lyapunov theory. Theoretically, the stability domain can be expanded from the original half-plane to nearly the overall plane. On the other hand, the control system is robust against the measurement noise and external disturbances which however are not taken into account in the related works. This is achieved by adopting the $$H_\infty$$ control method in a novel way, in which a new technical lemma is presented to solve real linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). In this way, the robust FTC design is also simplified, wherein the number of the required decision variables is reduced from four to two. Besides, the control design is less restrictive: three common requirements for the system matrix or the control gain selection are eliminated. Finally, the simulation results on an electrical circuit system and a numeral example both illustrate the above theoretical findings.},

Although many scholars have studied the issue of enterprise sustainability, to date, the institutional and risk control perspectives of sustainability have received less attention, particularly in manufacturing practices. To address research gap, this study develops a comprehensive framework for evaluating enterprise sustainability that encompasses the economic, social, environmental, institutional, and risk control dimensions. A novel group decision-making approach, called the Rough-Fermatean Fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory technique is proposed, which identifies the mutual relationships among the 15 evaluation criteria and generates the influence weights. Fermatean fuzzy theory is used to reflect the subjective judgment of experts and the inherent uncertainty in evaluation. Moreover, rough set theory is used to aggregate the multiple experts’ opinions and to retain potential information in the form of interval values. A case study of Taiwan’s electronics manufacturers is carried out to demonstrate the practicality and validity of the proposed approach. The results show that goodwill and corporate image, zero emission of pollutants and waste discharge, and corporate governance are the most influential sustainability criteria. This study can assist decision-makers in the manufacturing sector in developing more appropriate improvement strategies. Enterprises can improve their competitiveness and move towards sustainable development by first focusing on the more influential criteria. For academic researchers, the proposed framework and methodology can be applied to the discussion of sustainability evaluation in other industries.},

Second, we design a new adaptive robust control with a leakage-type self-correcting adaptive law to render the constrained mechanical system to follow the specified constraints accurately. It is shown that the designed adaptive law can compensate for the uncertainty and avoid overcompensation. The control is deterministic other than IF-THEN fuzzy rule-based and guarantees uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness. Third, we introduce the Nash game theory into the multi-parameter optimization design to optimize the two tunable control parameters. We choose the two control parameters as two players with cost functions relevant to the control cost and performance. Then we obtain the optimal control parameters in Nash equilibrium which is proved to exist and can be analytically obtained. Ultimately, the numerical simulations on the 2DOF robot manipulator are presented to demonstrate the proposed control scheme’s effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Picture fuzzy set (PFS) is more comprehensive tool than intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) for modeling the uncertain decision-making problems. In this paper, a new picture fuzzy entropy measure is proposed and proved that the proposed measure satisfies the axiomatic definition of entropy measures for picture fuzzy sets. Besides this, the useful mathematical properties of the new entropy measure are also investigated. The justification of the proposed picture fuzzy measure is established by discussing its particular cases and compares it with the existing entropy measures. Then, for the case where criteria weights are partially known, we used an entropy-based method to produce objective weights. For the uncertain environment, TODIM (portuguese acronym for interactive multicriteria decision-making) and ELECTRE methods are useful for practical problems. Based on the advantages of PFSs,TODIM, and ELECTRE, we proposed an integrated picture fuzzy TODIM-ELECTRE to combine the prominent benefits of these theories. We present the TODIM-ELECTRE model for PFS environment and express the computing steps in brief of this new established model. Thereafter, the superiority of the new model is verified by a numerical example of supplier selection and through comparative study with other existing methods.},

Not paying enough attention to such risks increases the possibility of investment failure. Accordingly, in this study, the risk criteria for investing in mineral industries and sub-criteria for risk assessment according to the type of industries, including mineral exploration, exploitation, and processing projects, have been identified and prioritized. In this regard, a methodology is presented based on multi-attribute decision-making methods, including Fuzzy Delphi, DEMATEL, and ANP methods to identify and analyze the risk criteria and evaluate sub-criteria. The results indicate that financial and commercial, technical, HSE, infrastructural considerations, geological, political, security, and legal risks are the main risk measures affecting investment in mining projects with different priorities. From the viewpoint of investment risk assessment in mineral processing and exploration projects, technical, financial and commercial, and geological risk criteria are the most significant, respectively. Generally, all risk criteria must be considered to make a reasonable investment in the mining sector, especially those more important.},

  abstract     = {Although the Wang–Mendel (WM) method, a typical way of fuzzy modeling, can rapidly obtain fuzzy rules from data to construct fuzzy systems with good interpretability, its accuracy is not high. In the literatures, many optimization approaches are proposed to improve the accuracy of the WM method, but the optimization process is in general time-consuming. A shallow or single fuzzy system cannot deal with “the curse of dimensionality”, which makes it challenging to realize modeling of high-dimensional data. Inspired by deep neural networks, building deep fuzzy systems (DFS) through many shallow fuzzy systems will become a new direction of fuzzy modeling for high-dimensional data modeling. As a building block in DFS, each shallow fuzzy system should have the characteristics of high precision and fast training speed to ensure the operating efficiency of DFS. This paper proposes a Fast Learning-algorithm with Optimized Weights for Fuzzy Systems (FLOWFS) in the following three steps: (1) Obtain a basic fuzzy system with full rules through fast training; (2) Assign each fuzzy rule a weight starting with 1; (3) Develop a fast learning-algorithm optimal weights via the least square method and coefficient regularization. Aiming at the regression problems, FLOWFS is compared with the back propagation neural network (BP), radial basis function neural network (RBF), the WM method and long short-term memory (LSTM) on three classic datasets of UCI. The experimental results show that: (1) FLOWFS has achieved a higher prediction accuracy; (2) Compared with the WM method, FLOWFS not only has greater accuracy, but also is faster in training; (3) In terms of comprehensive indicators of accuracy and running-time, FLOWFS has the best performance. Therefore, FLOWFS can provide good fuzzy building blocks for DFS to enable fast modeling of high-dimensional data and achieve good interpretability and high accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Hot box and hot wheel threaten any rail operation, increasing fatigue and wear processes which result in failures, costly train stoppages and derailments. For this reason, detectors monitor those components and when they detect overheating, a warning is given to alert of the impending failure. However, some situations such as solar incidence, misalignment, or sensor defect can lead to improper warnings, that is, warnings that do not exhibit the problem. Therefore, this work develops new models for the classification of proper and improper warnings in hot box and hot wheel problems, by the analysis of the temperatures measured in the wheels and bearings of the train when the warning was given. The discussion focuses on the use of an algorithm for stochastic optimization and the set-membership concept into the training phase of a type-2 fuzzy logic system, to increase the convergence speed and the accuracy of this procedure. Thus, the performance of the new models will be based on the real data set composed of train wheel and bearing temperatures, provided by a Brazilian railway transportation company, covering several situations of proper and improper warnings. Additionally, this work presents performance analyses based on well-known data sets provided by UCI Machine Learning Repository and Knowledge Extraction based on Evolutionary Learning Repository, aiming to evaluate the proposals. Performance analysis is discussed in terms of classification ratio and convergence speed. The proposals achieved improved convergence speed and higher classification ratio during the training phase, which results in lower hardware resource utilization.},

To demonstrate the VIGS functions, a series of tests were conducted in the stability tank and towing tank at National Cheng Kung University. The characteristic of the VIGS is to immediately capture continuous real-time images from the bow to calculate and identify visual information concerning the AUV’s surroundings. By mapping the target’s information in the AUV visual coordinate system (two-dimensional) onto the earth-fixed coordinates (three-dimensional), the relationships of corresponding distance and azimuth between the target and the AUV were defined. Eventually, this information was used to calculate the control parameters of the AUV’s moving speed and heading angle, completing the visual motion control framework. In the dynamic guidance experiments, the moving speed of the target object is proved to be a predominant factor leading to different trends of AUV’s steering performances for pitch and yaw controls.},

This allows the general behavior of the data covered, as well as their specific variability, to be expressed as a single rule. In order to ensure the highest transparency and accuracy values, this learning process maximizes two widely accepted semantic metrics and also minimizes both the number of rules and the model mean squared error. The results obtained in 23 regression datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method by applying statistical tests to the said metrics, which cover the different aspects of the interpretability of linguistic fuzzy models. This learning process has obtained the preservation of high-level semantics and less than 5 rules on average, while it still clearly outperforms some of the previous state-of-the-art linguistic fuzzy regression methods for learning interpretable regression linguistic fuzzy systems, and even to a competitive, pure accuracy-oriented linguistic learning approach.

  abstract     = {Differential games are a class of game theory problems governed by differential equations. Differential games are often defined in the continuous domain and solved by the calculus of variations. However, modelling and solving these games are not straightforward tasks. Differential games, like game theory, are often involved with social dilemmas and social behaviours. Modelling these social phenomena with mathematical tools is often problematic. In this paper, we modelled deception to increase the pay-off in differential games. Deception is modelled as a bi-level policy system, and each level is modelled with a fuzzy controller. Fuzzy controllers are trained using a novel hierarchical fuzzy actor-critic learning algorithm. A deceitful player plays against multiple opponents. Although there is one ultimate goal for the player, it can choose multiple fake goals as well. The intention is to find a strategy to switch between the fake goals and the true goal to fool the opponents. The simulation platform is the game of guarding territories, a specific form of the pursuit–evasion games. We propose a method to easily increase the number of defenders with minimum changes in the policies. We create a universal structure that is not affected by the curse of dimensionality. We show that a discerning invader capable of using deception can improve its performance against the defenders by increasing the chance of invasion. We investigate the single-invader single-defender game and the single-invader multi-defender game. We study the superior invader and agents with the same speed. In all mentioned situations, the invader increases its pay-off by using deception versus being honest. A two-level policy system is used in this paper to model deception. The lower-level policy controls each goal’s invasion actions, while the higher-level policy controls deception where a successful game is not initially possible.},

Through rigorous analysis, all followers can completely track the leader on a finite time interval.

  abstract     = {Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA), as a practical and easy-to-use reliability assessment tool, has been widely applied across various fields of researches. At the same time, it also receives criticisms for its limited selection of risk factors as well as its discrete numerical ordinal scales. In an attempt to fill in this gap, this paper proposes an improved FMEA method based on analytic network process (ANP) with probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs). Firstly, the three risk factors of FMEA, namely occurrence, severity and detection, are broken down to more elaborate and specific sub-factors, and a network representing the influential relationship between these sub-factors is constructed. ANP is then utilized to derive the relative weights of factors, sub-factors and failure modes by making pairwise comparisons with the help of PLTS. To verify the rationality and applicability of our proposed method, a case study of hospital information system reliability assessment is carried out. Comparative analyses with other existing FMEA methods are also undertaken to highlight the differences and advantages of our proposed method.},

It is usually assumed that these functions are linear, hence excluding the possibility of non-linearity in many decision-making situations. From an alternative definition of non-linear neutrosophic numbers, we develop the concepts of $$(\alpha ,\beta ,\gamma )$$ -cuts, possibility mean, variance, skewness and a new possibility score function. These concepts are useful to deal with multiple criteria decision making problems. We illustrate the practical use of these concepts by means of a real case study in supply chain risk management in the motor industry. Due to the fact that neutrosophic sets have been used in several areas of decision-making, finance and economics, we argue that our proposal contributes to enhance the application of neutrosophic numbers.},

A fixed-time control framework with funnel error variables is constructed, which guarantees the fast convergence performance and the static performance of tracking errors. Meanwhile, an adaptive decoupling control strategy is designed to conquer the design difficulties caused by the full-state coupling of subsystems and the output variables coupling among subsystems. By combining the boundary estimation method and the event-triggered mechanism, the control laws are designed in the backstepping procedure, which can eliminate the effect of actuator faults and save communication costs for control signals. It is shown that all signals of the closed-loop systems are bounded and the tracking errors converge to the small neighborhoods of origin in a fixed time.

First, non-additive measures and Choquet integrals calculating the comprehensive assessments of Internet public opinion are applied to incorporate the interaction between attributes. Then, the attribute weight is determined by the generalized Shapley function. In addition, an example of haze network public opinion risk shows that the approach has good identification and assessment effect. The approach can be used to solve the problems of fuzziness and subjectivity in linguistic assessments, and it can be applied to identify the customer service framework with the linguistic assessments process in emergency management. From the results, it infers that the haze network public opinion risk is directly related to haze incidents, while the role of media and Internet users can only indirectly affect the public opinion dissemination.},

Second, based on the conventional seepage model, single fuzzy parameter seepage models and the multiple fuzzy parameter seepage model for shale gas reservoirs are set up in turn. Solutions to the fuzzy seepage model are handled by means of the fuzzy structural element method. Finally, with the assistance of the centroid method, we work out a single numerical solution in accordance with the fuzzy solution set. In contrast with the conventional seepage models of shale gas reservoirs, the fuzzy seepage model in this paper makes use of the fuzzy numbers to describe the parameters with uncertainty, which also completely considers the in-homogeneity and complex variability of shale gas reservoirs. A numerical simulation example is presented to show the efficiency and development of the fuzzy seepage model.

The observation about the system comes in a large-data streaming way. This framework is based on a nonparametric fuzzy-based classifier built to deal with large-scale, streaming, and dynamically evolving problems called Self-Organizing Fuzzy (SOF) classifier. The proposed approach is divided into two main stages: in the first stage, a feature extraction algorithm and a hypothesis test based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test are used to extract and select features from the observed time series. In the second stage, the SOF classifier processes the selected features to determine the existence of a fault pattern in the time-series data stream. The approach presented in this paper was tested in the real-world problem of real-time fault classification of railway switch machines. The obtained results show that the SOF classifier is more effective and has a lower computational cost than alternative approaches in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Decision-making is an activity based on human cognitive information. Z-numbers is a new concept that takes into account both the description of cognitive information and the reliability of the information. The distance measure of Z-numbers is an important subject in the decision-making process based on Z-information. However, the existing Z-number distance measure methods have problems of incomplete consideration and loss of information, which will lead to unreasonable results in decision-making. To this end, this paper proposes an improved distance measure of Z-numbers. The proposed method considers all aspects of the Z-number and preserves the original information as much as possible. It can overcome the shortcomings of existing methods. Some numerical examples are used to show the detailed calculation process and the advantages of the proposed method. To extend the classic Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution(TOPSIS) to the Z-information environment, we suggested the Z-TOPSIS method based on the improved distance measure of Z-numbers. An example of supplier selection indicates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed Z-TOPSIS method. Illustrative and comparative analyses further demonstrate the flexibility and superiority of the proposed method.},

Most of the traditional fuzzy portfolio models are established without short selling, which cannot effectively guide investors to make profits when stock prices tend to fall. This paper aims to address the multi-period portfolio problem with short selling under fuzzy environment. To comprehensively consider the effect of short selling on the investment process, we propose three types of short selling constraints, i.e., total short selling proportion constraint, short selling cardinality constraint, and lower and upper bound constraint. Then, we establish a multi-period possibilistic mean-semi-variance portfolio selection model with multiple short selling constraints. Next, we design a multiple particle swarm optimization with simulated annealing to solve it. Finally, we illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm via a numerical example using actual stock data. The results show that short selling has a significant impact on investment decisions, and our proposed model can help investors construct portfolio strategies with short selling to improve their investment return.},

  abstract     = {People nowadays deal with busy and dynamic lifestyles on a daily basis. Adopting or maintaining a healthy lifestyle to prevent chronic conditions is therefore a core societal challenge. It is thus critical to engage and motivate citizens with healthy and tailored activities that they like, as a key driver for safeguarding good health from a preventive vantage point, aligned with the pursuance of SDG 3: “good health and well-being”. This is why Health Recommender Systems have recently become a research trend, particularly in the domains of food and physical activity recommendation. In this work, we present F-EvoRecSys: an extension of an evolutionary algorithm-driven solution for “healthy bundle” recommendations to help users improve their well-being. F-EvoRecSys presents the novelty of incorporating a fuzzy inference system with the aim of improving physical activity recommendations, predicated on users’ exercising habit information. Through an experimental study and a live study with real participants, we demonstrate the feasibility of F-EvoRecSys to produce more diversified recommendations, while maintaing a balance between adapting to the user health needs and matching her/his individual preferences. We finally provide a discussion about challenges and future directions for personalized well-being recommender systems, under three points of view: AI and data approaches, role of fuzzy systems, and application domain considerations.},

Considering the characteristics of correlations and kurtosis of returns in the long run, we employ the fractional Brownian motion to model the dynamic price of underlying assets. Then, a trapezoidal fuzzy stochastic process is employed to depict the fuzziness of underlying asset price. Involving the decision-maker’s subjective judgment, the mean value with the possibility–necessity weight and pessimistic–optimistic index is expressed. Further, the formulas of N-fold compound option price are derived by martingale method. Moreover, the valuation and properties of the formulas are analyzed under some reasonable assumptions. In the end, some numerical examples are provided to support our theoretical results and illustrate the mean of N-fold compound option pricing in fuzzy and fractional environments.},

Recently, a least-squares fuzzy transform that combines a fuzzy transform with a least-squares algorithm for function reconstruction has been proposed. However, the least-squares fuzzy transform has a drawback because it uses an estimation process based on the least-squares algorithm, unlike the fuzzy transform that uses the weighted average of the original function over the fuzzy partition. In this paper, we discuss the similarities and differences between fuzzy transform and least-squares fuzzy transform. Simulation results for various image sizes and noisy images show that the fuzzy transform outperforms the least-squares fuzzy transform in terms of image reconstruction and image denoising.},

An AF comprises three essential elements, including the identification phase, the modulation method, and the inverter. In the identification phase, an appropriate control reference signal is generated via temporal or frequency methods. Then the inverter block produces this control signal in the form of power by using a modulation method and injects it into the line so that the current harmonics will be reduced. In the AF for generating reference signals of the inverter, the frequency spectrum of line current is used. Current reference signals are converted to voltage reference signals by a PI controller. Afterwards, these signals are generated by using an inverter and an appropriate modulation method. The important point is to determine the coefficients of the PI controller. It is noteworthy that the determination of such coefficients and their effects on the overall performance of the filter has seldom been studied. In this study, the PI controller coefficients have been determined using an optimization fuzzy particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. This manuscript has been simulated by MATLAB software.},

Firstly, the measurement data of multiple sensors are unified in time and space through space-time registration. Secondly, the measurement data of each sensor are separated into different target sets by Mahalanobis distance discriminant method. And each target is modeled by grey prediction GM (1,1) model subsequently, and the noise of data are filtered by Kalman filter (KF). Thirdly, it preliminarily determines the type of targets by Hungarian algorithm. Finally, the D–S evidence theory based on the Angle cosine and Lance distance (ALDS) is used to further determines the target type. The proposed methods can be applied when there is inconsistent evidence. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm is effective in decision support for sea target classification.},

Next, we develop an ensemble ranking approach to overcome the limitation of the original CoCoSo method regarding aggregation bias.

  abstract     = {Fuzzy association rule mining is one of the important problems in fuzzy machine learning. The fuzzy association rule is intended to handle quantitative data that was indecisive in the classical association rule. However, the fuzzy set of quantitative attributes and their membership functions depends on expert opinion, subjective or available. In this paper, we propose a Node-list Pre-order Size Fuzzy Frequent (NPSFF) algorithm in fuzzy association rule mining based on Node-list data structure combined with the Pre-order Size Code structure suitable for the organization of fuzzy data and the manipulation of this structure. This organization speeds up tree building and finds frequent fuzzy item sets. To increase the efficiency of the NPSFF algorithm, we performed the data preprocessing by applying affinity propagation clustering (AP) technique to specify the suitable number of clusters. Next, we convert the quantitative values of the clusters to the fuzzy values using fuzzy partitioning method. Experiment results show that NPSFF algorithm efficiency is always better than FFP Growth and MFFP algorithms in execution time and memory usage.},

  abstract     = {Numerous deaths are being reported at sites where safety helmets are important for workers. Though these sites are usually equipped with closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras, real-time monitoring of these feeds proves to be a mammoth task as it requires large human personnel leading to financial burdens. This work harnesses the object detection abilities of various deep learning models to propose a robust solution for safety helmet detection problem. This work divides the overall task into three sub problems, where the first two sub problems explore various object detection models including Single Shot Detector (SSD), Faster Region Based Convolutional Neural Networks (FRCNN), YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and YOLOv5 over multiple benchmark datasets. In Sub Problem 1, the YOLOv5 model achieved a mAP of 93.5%, 94.1% and 92.7% on the three selected datasets, while it achieved a mAP of 93.8% over the selected dataset of the Sub Problem 2. In both these sub problems, the YOLOv5 model outperformed all the recently proposed models for helmet detection task and hence was selected as the model for further experiments. In the final sub problem, a novel fusion of YOLOv5 and a fuzzy based image enhancement module, was further fine-tuned to create a robust model (FD-YOLOv5 M) that worked visibly better than simple YOLOv5 even over real site noisy CCTV feeds. The proposed FD-YOLOv5 model, when tried over an enhanced dataset, efficiently detected safety helmets worn by humans and even differentiated them from various types of other common headgears. These observations strongly support the application of the proposed model at real site scenarios to detect workers wearing safety helmets.},

  abstract     = {With the anticipated increment in connected devices for the Internet of Things (IoT) applications, ensuring low power consumption with long-range data transmission is needed. An low power wide area network (LPWAN) technology is well suited to fulfill this requirement. LoRa is known to customize its physical layer settings to achieve desired transmission range, coverage, and energy consumption. For large-scale realistic deployments, LoRa based Industrial IoT (IIoT) solution needs to offer configurable granularity and compatibility with legacy systems and processes. However, the requirement of a seam-less handoff across end-to-end (E2E) systems is usually based on dense short-range wireless systems. As IIoT applications typically experience varying environmental conditions, we consider four scenarios, namely line-of-sight (LOS), non-LOS (NLOS), obstruction, and conventional environment, to present the variation in the network efficiency (NE). This paper aims to implement the fuzzy inference system algorithm as a controller in an IIoT-based based application. The Mamdani fuzzy inference system algorithm is implemented on the gateway node that receives sensor values and computes network parameters to predict NE. The result of the FIS is then analyzed for tuning hardware settings on LoRa nodes. These settings are then propagated to the actuator nodes to set optimal tuning of the spreading factor, bandwidth, and coding rate for maximizing lifetime and optimizing data flow. We also study and ascertain that the parameters under different network conditions need to be observed to interpret the results predicted from the FIS model.},

However, the attribute-based clustering is recently challenging to data clustering. The present paper contributes to considering a novel data clustering algorithm, called FBC-Cluster, based on fuzzy multigraphs in terms of both structural and attribute similarities. In the proposed algorithm, attribute similarity is achieved through m-polar fuzzy T-equivalences among alternatives (objects) and structural similarity is defined based on a new similarity measurement, called behavioral similarity index, using closed neighborhood in the attributed clusters. The output of the proposed clustering algorithm includes two main categories, namely certain and possible clusters, based on threshold level $$\beta$$ given on the behavioral similarity index. A numerical example is discussed to demonstrate the performance of the designed clustering algorithm. The quality of resultant clusters is also evaluated through density and entropy functions.},

Many researchers experienced that traditional vision-based parking slot status detection approaches are more time consuming and cannot handle large video frames in practical applications, which diverted many researchers toward deep learning methods that can extract features and classify it. This study proposes an ensemble model based on deep learning to tackle weather condition effects. In most cases, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN’s) models used Red, Green, Blue frames, but it was observed that many more techniques like Hue Saturation Value, Discrete Wavelet Transform, Discrete Cosine Transform and GRADIENT also play an important role, if trained well using deep learning. Proposed study includes training of CNN’s network considering five techniques followed by weighted fuzzy model. In this research, experiments have been conducted on a publicly available &quot;PKLot&quot; dataset, which consisted of 12,417 images which have been segmented into 695,899 images such that each segmented image represents the individual parking slot. Images have been taken from three different camera locations in two different parking lots in Brazil, under different weather conditions such as sunny, cloudy and rainy. The experimental results show significant improvement in terms of accuracy as compared with existing state-of-art methods. In the end, real-time images of outdoor parking lot of Panjab University Swami Sarvanand Giri Regional Centre, Hoshiarpur, Punjab, India have been collected for implementation of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Many real-life optimization problems in different fields of engineering, science, business, and economics are challenging to solve, due to the complexity and as such they are classified as non-deterministic polynomial-time hard. In recent years, nature-inspired metaheuristics are proved to be robust solvers for global optimization problems. Hybridization is a commonly used technique that can further improve metaheuristic algorithms. Hybrid algorithms are designed by combining the advantages of various algorithms, which produce a synergistic effect. Hybridization results in intensifying specific advantages in different algorithms and the hybridized algorithm implementation often performs better than the original version. In this paper, we present the hybridized artificial flora optimization algorithm, named genetically guided best artificial flora. This hybridization is achieved by using a uniform crossover and mutation operators from the genetic algorithms that facilitate exploration of the search space and make the right balance between diversification and intensification. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid algorithm is adopted for two real-world problems, artificial neural network training, and feature selection problem. Following good practice, proposed method was first tested on standard unconstrained functions before it was evaluated for these two very important machine learning challenges. The experimental results show that the proposed hybridized algorithm is highly competitive and that it establishes a better balance between exploration and exploitation than the original one and that it is superior over other state-of-the-art methods in artificial neural network training and feature selection.},

The automation of polyp classification is challenging due to the limitations associated with the traditional handcrafted image features. This paper proposes a deep learning model for colorectal polyp classification, referred to as DeepCPC. This model consists of three main stages: image pre-processing using patch extraction and data augmentation; model initialization using six pre-trained CNNs to generate the fine-tuned baseline model; and formulating and learning generic yet discriminating image descriptors extracted and fused from the convolutional layers of two efficient CNNs architectures to classify colorectal polyps. The DeepCPC architecture has been fine-tuned on the CVC-Clinic dataset through a complete end-to-end training in which the patch extraction and image augmentation have been applied to generate more colonoscopy images for the patients. The experimental results show that the baseline fine-tuned model achieves an accuracy of 97.6%, and the final DeepCPC model achieves an accuracy of 98.4%. The reported results also demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach in identifying polyps in terms of precision, recall, and f-score. The DeepCPC helps the endoscopic physicians in classifying polyps and decreasing the colorectal polyp miss rate.},

  abstract     = {A large number of researchers recently focused on intelligent analysis about algorithms for path-finding concerning games. Currently, the most modern application in game map path-finding is based on the fuzzy logic (FL) algorithm. It demonstrates that these strategies increase the quest performance and have a simpler direction to enhance the algorithm’s game. Hence, in this paper, a Fuzzy logic-based game path-finding Framework (FLGPFF) has been proposed to reduce the search space to improve search speed and path planning on uneven surfaces. The suggested FLGPFF method uses computer vision to simulate the fuzzy dynamic game path’s algorithm using possible multi-purpose platforms. A computer vision explores the whole game map path and finds a way between two remote places. The fuzzy method uses a fuzzier, center average demulsifier, and product inference engine. The ant colony algorithm is used for the complex environment with many moving obstacles and, using a weighted artificial field method, it calculates a trajectory from the target’s initial location. Thus, the experimental results show the FLGPFF to enhance path allocation prediction and less delay time than other popular methods. The simulation outcome recommended that FLGPFF can improve the accuracy ratio (95.2%), search timer per map (96.3%), game quality improvement ratio (98.5%), performance ratio (97.8%), and comparison of the path-finding model (95.1%).},

Though various similarity measures have already been suggested, still a lot of scope is there because some of them could not satisfy the properties of similarity measures and provide contradictory results. In this paper, we suggested new similarity measures having ability to contrast intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) sets. Furthermore, we have also analyzed their properties to validate the existence of proposed measure. After that, we provided some experimental analysis to verify the effectiveness of proposed measures which includes numerical experiment pattern recognition and clustering analysis. In experimental analysis, firstly we included numerical experiment by taking different cases to study the performance of proposed measures. Then, we dealt with the problems of pattern recognition and incorporated a performance index in terms of “Degree of Confidence” (DOC). Furthermore, we introduced a IF-MST clustering algorithm to deal with IFSs using the notion of MST (“Maximum Spanning Tree”). Additionally, we have modified similarity measure into knowledge measure and contrasted its performance with others knowledge measures to show the superiority of proposed measure.},

  abstract     = {In conventional robot arm control, inverse kinematics (IK) is used as the basis for computing arm joint angles. However, IK can be used to compute joint angles only after the terminal point has been reached, and it cannot optimize arm movements. Furthermore, the singularity problem is sometimes encountered when using IK. For example, if a robot arm in motion passes through a singularity, the next step’s movement is incomputable, which results in errors. Therefore, this study did not use IK for computing the joint angles of humanoid robot arms. Instead, this paper proposes a motion controller based on machine learning and fuzzy logic for the aforementioned purpose. Conventional reinforcement learning can provide satisfactory results for a single state but cannot be used to perform optimized calculations for infinite states. To solve this problem, this study used the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm and allowed a humanoid robot to self-learn and autonomously plan the movement of and joint angles in its arm. A state and its action can be calculated in a hyperplane by using the developed neural network. A continuous mapping relationship exists between the state and its action in this hyperplane. Thus, the humanoid robot obtained optimal learning experiences in multiple self-learning processes. Finally, the concept was incorporated into a visual feedback system to achieve object grasping by the humanoid robot. The humanoid robot exhibited satisfactory learning outcomes—as well as satisfactory motion control performance—in experiments when combining fuzzy logic with the DDPG algorithm.},

The system identification problem of F-HCAR model is constructed by defining a merit or fitness function using mean square error approximation between the actual and calculated parameters of F-HCAR models. The decision variables of F-HCAR models are determined by optimization of merit function with the knacks of global search with GAs for sundry scenarios on noiseless and noisy environment in the system dynamics. Comparison of results between estimated and predicted responses of F-HCAR systems endorsed the accurate, stable and robust performance fuzzy-evolutionary GAs.

  abstract     = {In this paper, radial models of multi-stage fuzzy DEA and DEA-R networks are first proposed based on liquidity ratios with desirable and undesirable outputs for evaluating a set of decision-making units (DMUs). Second, non-radial models are proposed based on the Slacks-Based Measure of Inefficiency (SBMI) and a Directional Non-Radial (DNR) model. On the one hand, the similarity of DEA and DEA-R models, as well as adherence to the axioms in constructing the production possibility set (PPS), has provided the possibility to model the restrictions of the aforementioned models; on the other hand, for efficiency calculation, different objective functions (radial and non-radial) have been used in a multi-stage network structure with fuzzy data. The models proposed for calculating the efficiency of the first, second, and third stages, as well as the overall network, in multi-stage networks therefore take the form of a fuzzy linear programming model that has been converted into linear programming. The advantage to the present article, aside from the linearity of the multi-stage fuzzy network models, is that we can model the corresponding models in DEA and DEA-R-based purely on liquidity ratios with desirable and undesirable outputs. Finally, focusing on a multi-stage network in the Iranian education system while considering fuzzy data, the efficiency and inefficiency of the DMUs are calculated based on liquidity ratios with desirable and undesirable outputs. It can be observed that in the SBMI model, the overall efficiency scores in DEA and DEA-R models are 58% and 45%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The new operations based on the Aczel–Alsina t-norm and t-conorm show the advantage of flexible operations by adjusting different parameter values. Motivated based on the new operations, we propose the Aczel–Alsina operations and weighted aggregation operators of neutrosophic Z-numbers (NZNs) to solve the flexible decision-making problem by adjusting different parameter values depending on the decision maker’s preference under the environment of NZNs. To do so, this paper first proposes the Aczel–Alsina t-norm and t-conorm operations of NZNs and develops the NZN Aczel–Alsina weighted arithmetic averaging (NZNAAWAA) and NZN Aczel–Alsina weighted geometric averaging (NZNAAWGA) operators to aggregate NZNs. Then, a multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) method is developed by the NZNAAWAA and NZNAAWGA operators under the NZN environment. Finally, a numerical example is provided to verify the influence of different parameter values on decision-making results. Compared with existing MADM methods, the new MADM method shows its feasibility and flexibility in MADM applications. Moreover, the new MADM approach can not only extend the existing MADM methods, but also overcome the lack of decision-making flexibility of the existing MADM methods.},

To provide an in-depth discussion, based on the retrieved 1080 papers from the Web of Science (WoS), this paper first investigates what topics are the research interested in and how they have changed over the past decade in the hesitant fuzzy area. Main path analysis is adopted further to identify the most influential connections between papers and analyze the knowledge diffusion trajectories in the past decade, including the local and global main paths and the key-route main path. The results show that there are five hot topics which are decision-making, information measure, aggregation operator, extensions of HFS and preference relation. Among them, decision-making and extensions of HFS are two topics that are beginning more and more prevalent. The result of main path analysis consolidates the findings, showing that the application of hesitant fuzzy theory in the decision-making field has been and remains the most popular, and the object of the research has shifted to different types of HFSs being hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) the most remarkable one. This paper not only provides a framework to investigate the research in a certain field, but also provides an in-depth summary of the field to provide theoretical guidance for researchers and practitioners.},

  abstract     = {In group decision-making (GDM) problems, the elicitation of preferences from decision makers (DMs) and consensus reaching process are two critical issues to be resolved. Many kinds of preference relations have been proposed in the recent two decades. In this paper, we propose a novel pairwise comparison structure called fuzzy-uncertainty-based distributed preference relation (FUDPR), which could not only indicate the intensity of preferred, non-preferred, indifferent and uncertain information of one alternative against another simultaneously, but also has the ability to represent local ignorance expressed by DMs. The FUDPR introduces the set of consecutive evaluation grades into the distributed preference relation (DPR) where only discrete single evaluation grades and global ignorance can be modeled in the preference relation. The missing values in FUDPR are estimated by the defined score function. Two kinds of consensus reaching process (CRP) are then proposed, namely soft and hard consensus mechanism, respectively, which are suitable for different decision-making situations. Both of them consider the individual dissimilarity, trust relations and self-confidence in the designed feedback mechanism. Comparative analysis is performed between the proposed method and other state-of-the-art pairwise comparison GDM models. An illustrative example of life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) is proposed to demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed method in supporting real-world GDM problems.},

For typical Type-1 Fuzzy sets, fuzzy variable partition and fuzzy rules are a little less fine. In order to improve PID parameter regulation, decomposed fuzzy system (DFS) is introduced to design PID controller. Furthermore, a simplified decomposed fuzzy PID (SDFPID) controller is designed considering the computational complexity.

CP is also related to the use of less but more efficient energy and materials and the substitution of products harmful to the environment/health with less dangerous ones. The Hamacher Aggregation (HA) operator is an easy technique that permits several comparison declarations to be prepared while yet securing an overall confidence coefficient is sustained. The major benefit of HA operator based on Hamacher t‐norm and Hamacher t‐conorm is that they provide a lot of specific aggregation operators due to their parameters included in the mathematical form of HA operator. Another hand, the conception of complex T-spherical fuzzy (CTSF) strategy is a novel and original technique that exists with a well-known theme and advantages in the circumstance of fuzzy set theory. The key influence of this hypothesis is to evaluate the conception of Hamacher operational laws and their influential results. Moreover, the theory of CTSF Hamacher weighted averaging (CTSFHWA) and CTSF Hamacher weighted geometric (CTSFHWG) operators and described their influential properties with several strong results. Moreover, a strategic decision-making technique is evaluated in the existence of the deliberated operators for CTSF settings.

Whenever obstacles present in every period, a neural network with multithreading is one of the optimization procedures to find the best optimal solution with an inflation and time value of money. A fuzzy approach is used here to deal with the uncertainty, and the total cost of the system is calculated using the bi-objective constraint objective function. The first objective is to find the minimum cost of the system with the optimum space, which is the second objective. The solutions of the mathematical model are obtained by generating multiple threads that every thread is a possible solution. The numerical experiment chooses the best fit from the multiple solutions. An illustrative comparative study with the existing methodologies is provided. Results show that the proposed approach is the best for cost optimization and time minimization. It is found that the neural network with multithreading converges over other algorithms and the results obtain within less than 30% time of the existing algorithm.},

The modes of devised fuzzy controller run asynchronously with the modes of controlled plant, which is described through a hidden Markov model. Dynamic output feedback control is that the output feedback only takes the output signal that the object can detect as the feedback signal. Because the measurement output is local information, the feedback is also local. Although it is feasible, it cannot reflect the overall situation. The fuzzy dynamic output feedback adopts parallel distribution compensation technique, which can realize global feedback, but realizing this feedback control is full of difficulties and challenges. And although introducing more variables can make the condition less conservative, it also increases the number of linear matrix inequalities and computational complexity. Improved conditions are acquired to ensure the robust exponential mean-square stability and $$H_{\infty }$$ performance index for the closed-loop fuzzy uncertain stochastic Markov jump systems. Based on exponential mean-square stability, the asynchronous fuzzy dynamic output feedback controller is realized in terms of linear matrix inequalities. A numerical example and a single-link robot arm are employed to show the effectiveness and correctness of the method proposed in this paper.},

Soft subspace clustering can efficiently extract the important subspace by allocating a weight to each dimension on the basis of the contribution of this dimension to the cluster identification. However, this kind of method does not consider the correlations between data dimensions in the clustering process. In high-dimensional data, when two dimensions are closely correlated, they should have similar weight assignments, and vice versa. Inspired by the way of clustering with graph embedding technique, we present a novel soft subspace clustering algorithm with considering the correlations between data dimensions. In this method, a novel dimension affinity regularization term is included into the objective function to further highlight those correlated dimensions that are important to the formation of clusters and compress the feature subspaces. Moreover, the alternating direction method of multipliers is adopted to solve the linear optimization problem regarding the dimension weight lasso regularization. In addition, as an extension, the kernelized version is explored to address the non-linear data clustering. Experiments on the real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the presented algorithms in comparison with the conventional clustering methods.},

  abstract     = {As the digital world becomes the main complement to the physical world, establishing a solid line of defense against cyber attacks becomes critical and arduous. The intrusion detection systems (IDSs) based on the supervised learning method have achieved excellent performance, which requires a large amount of labeled data in the training phase. However, attacks occur much less frequently than normal behaviors, and it is difficult to obtain accurate labels. In addition, IDSs based on supervised learning cannot identify unknown attacks. At the same time, the problem that detection accuracy varies greatly with different applications is very significant in traditional unsupervised learning methods. Therefore, it is necessary to perform high-precision anomaly detection on unlabeled samples. This paper proposes a traffic anomaly detection model using K-means and Active Learning Method (ALM), which is mainly composed of a feature extraction module and an anomaly detection module. Firstly, the Pearson correlation coefficient and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) are used in the feature extraction module to select important features. Secondly, K-means divides the characteristic-processed traffic into normal or abnormal categories. Finally, the results of K-means are diffused through ALM, and new classification results are obtained after defuzzification, thereby improving the accuracy of anomaly detection. The latest CICDDoS2019 data set is used in the experiment. Experimental results show that the detection accuracy of the proposed model is above 90%, and the F1 score is above 95%, regardless of whether it is a binary classification of a single attack or a mixed classification of multiple attacks. Compared with three unsupervised learning methods K-means, Auto-encoder and short-term memory (LSTM) and three supervised learning methods Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), the proposed model has higher classification accuracy and better generalization effect. This article is very helpful for exploring the application of unsupervised learning methods in network intrusion detection systems based on the characteristics of the data itself.},

However, research on the selection of internal auditors has limited exposure in the literature. In addition, prior research on personnel selection has only focused on applying traditional ranking methods, which calculate the overall utility value for each candidate and rank candidates in terms of the score. Little has been done for considering management’s goals regarding the attributes of the desired candidate. A robust model has not been constructed to address multiple aspiration levels for each goal in the classical personnel selection process. To fill these gaps, a novel generic framework is presented to evaluate and select ideal internal auditors, based on the analytic hierarchy process, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, and weighted multi-choice goal programming. A case study is conducted to validate the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed hybrid approach can assist decision-makers in selecting the candidate who is a good match for organizational needs.

The forward induction arbitrage-free method for the Ho–Lee calibration of interest rates, the binomial model and the two-person zero-sum games are used. An application example of the fuzzy-stochastic soft bond game option model from the buyer perspective based on the power triangle numbers for three variants of fuzziness is developed and computed. Inclusion of vagueness allows reflecting better valuation conditions and getting a more complex valuation picture. The developed model can adequately reflect valuation conditions and considers all aspects of the complex valuation problem of the bond game options, besides risk, flexibility, interactivity and vagueness.},

Impulsive effects are added to the fractional adaption laws to accelerate the identification process. Dynamics of each node of the network are considered as chaotic dynamic and circuit realization of this time-delayed fractional-order dynamic is implemented. Based on T–S fuzzy modeling, a new representation of fractional-order chaotic systems is presented. An impulsive control method is extended to the synchronization of fractional-order networks.

  abstract     = {Green supplier selection (GSS) plays an irreplaceable role in green supply chain management and environmental protection. Simultaneously, it is widely studied as a typical multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem. In this paper, the qualitative flexible multiple criteria (QUALIFLEX) method is used to solve the problem of green suppliers which the number of alternatives is far smaller than the number of attributes. Firstly, the normal q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (q-RONFNs) is proposed to overcome the limitation of normal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (NIFNs) that it cannot handle situation where the sum of the membership degree and non-membership degree is greater than or equal to 1. Secondly, we adopt the combination weight which takes into account subjective and objective weights in MADM, where the subjective weight and objective weight are calculated by fuzzy best–worst method (FBWM) and q-RONF criteria importance through inter-criteria correlation (q-RONFNs-CRITIC) method, respectively, and the combination weight is calculated based on the maximum comprehensive evaluation values. Furthermore, based on QUALIFLEX as the decision-making framework, the q-RONFNs-QUALIFLEX method for GSS is proposed. Finally, this model is applied to the GSS, and the effectiveness and superiority of this model are proved by the comparison with the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Hybridization in brain-computer interface (BCI) is an active research assessed by integrating more than two modalities to control multiple user commands and enhance the BCI performance. However, evaluation of these hybrid modalities is substantially challenging which necessitates robust techniques that can efficiently analyze the underlying dynamics of the brain signal. Fuzzy entropy based approaches are the objective measurements of evaluating the dynamic electroencephalography (EEG) complexity reflecting its ability to adapt to the variabilities of the brain. In this study, we proposed an empirical mode decomposition (EMD) featured fuzzy entropy method by applying coarse-graining to the time series signal at a multi-scale level (EMFuzzyEn) to efficiently discriminate the target and non-target events, and improve classification performance during simultaneous steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) and rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) BCI system framework. The proposed hybrid BCI framework with applied canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and EMFuzzyEn algorithm to the SSVEP and RSVP classifications achieved an offline accuracy of 87.41% for 12-channel combination and an online accuracy of 84.69% for 2-channel combination. The results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm enhanced the BCI performance by 5.85% (offline) and 6.78% (online) compared to our previous ERP-based classification results. Further, the EMFuzzyEn algorithm achieved highest classification accuracy across all channel combinations compared to the multi-scale fuzzy (MFuzzyEn) and non-fuzzy (ShEn, AppEn, CondEn) entropy algorithms. Overall, our empirical results confirmed that the proposed EMFuzzyEn algorithm significantly increased the EEG complexity during target tasks thereby enhancing the discrimination between target and non-target tasks, which might be a potential indicator to measure the brain dynamics and enhance the BCI performance.},

This paper aims at facilitating the measurement of good governance practices in NPOs by a fuzzy linguistic consensus-based group multi-criteria decision-making (MCGDM) model that will provide agreed and easy-understanding weights for a list of indicators proposed by the stakeholders and entities in such good governance practices. To do that, a linguistic 2-tuple BWM method with a consensus reaching process (CRP) will be developed and then applied to a real-world case in Spain, in which a group of experts from significant Spanish NPOs will assess the list of indicators proposed by the most representative entities (the alliance between the non-governmental organizations (NGO) Platform for Social Action, and the NGO Coordinator for Development (CONGDE) to obtain a prioritization of such indicators for measuring the good governance practices in Spanish NPOs.},

The considered method is Razumikhin for time-varying delay large-scale systems, in which it includes a Lyapunov function associated with the original non-augmented state space of system dynamics in comparison with the Krasovskii method. As a rule, the Razumikhin method has a perfect potential to avoid the inherent complexity of the Krasovskii method especially in the presence of large delays and disturbances. The considered large-scale system in this manuscript is decomposed into several subsystems, each of which is represented by a fuzzy Takagi–Sugeno (T-S) model and the interconnection between any two subsystems is considered. Because the main section of the model predictive control is optimization, the hierarchical scheme is performed for the optimization problem. Furthermore, persistent disturbances are considered that robust positive invariance and input-to-state stability under such circumstances are studied. The linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) method is performed for our computations. So the closed-loop large-scale system is asymptotically stable. Ultimately, by two examples, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated, and a comparison with other papers is made by remarks.},

This current article makes an initiation to develop an economic production quantity model with deterioration under Marxian approach of socio-political economy. Here, two Marxian economic production quantity models are developed aiming at the minimization of exploitation rate and reduction of social surplus. The notion of marginal profit is considered here to reduce the social surplus (Net profit) incurred in the production plant itself.

  abstract     = {Heronian mean (HM) operators are powerful aggregation operators that consider the interrelationship of two input arguments. HM operators have been utilized to solve many multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems under different environments. However, the existing HM does not take into consideration the overall interaction of input arguments. Therefore, to address this issue, the Shapley fuzzy measure (SFM) is combined with an improved generalized weighted HM (IGWHM) operator under an interval neutrosophic vague set (INVS). The INVS is structured into several membership degrees appropriate for dealing with incomplete and inconsistent information as well as reducing the information loss during the decision elicitations. This paper introduces two aggregation operators: interval neutrosophic vague Shapley improved generalized weighted HM (INVSIGWHM) and interval neutrosophic vague Shapley improved generalized geometric-weighted HM (INVSIGGWHM). Then, the three essential algebraic properties of the proposed aggregation operators are also discussed for both operators. Furthermore, based on the proposed INVSIGWHM and INVSIGGWHM operators, we suggest two multi-criteria decision-making methods in which information is given in interval neutrosophic vague. A numerical example of investment decision is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of developed methods. It is found that the car company is the best alternative among the others. Besides, sensitivity analysis using two existing parameters is performed on the proposed method to demonstrate the effect of ranking order on alternatives. From this analysis, it can be seen that the parameter $$p,q$$ significantly influences the aggregation results. Finally, a comparative analysis is presented in two approaches: to validate the proposed method and to demonstrate the advantages. The comparative analysis shows that the proposed method is reliable and practical in solving decision-making problems involving the total interaction of decision-makers and criteria weights. The suggested decision-making framework under INVS has effectively handled the overall criteria interactions. In future, the proposed method can be integrated with other neutrosophic sets.},

However, the degree of conflict or external forces cannot be expressed precisely, so this model does not describe the situation appropriately. Therefore, this paper applies fuzzy theory to this model to describe the vagueness that the degree of confliction or external force has. For this, we observed the chaotic behaviors of the model by varying the values of the parameters. We also verify chaotic behaviors through route of chaos; periodic motion (growing stage of confliction), chaotic motion (explosive stage or maximum stage of confliction), and periodic window (temporary coordinate stage of confliction) using phase portrait, bifurcation diagram and Lyapunov exponent.},

In recent years, neutrosophic soft sets (NS-sets), a combination of soft and neutrosophic sets, have emerged as outstanding candidates in this field. If neutrosophic sets are used to handle problems involving imprecise, indeterminate, and inconsistent data, soft sets are used to deal with uncertainties that classical tools cannot control. This paper defines a new concept based on NS-sets, called the sequence of NS-sets (NSS-sequence). Their inclusions, special types, operations, distances are determined with reasonable, convincing, and well-proven properties. Furthermore, we also propose an algorithm for the decision-making problem on NS-sequence and apply it in medical diagnosis by a real-life experiment. Finally, intending to verify its validity and feasibility, we compare our algorithm to the algorithm for the decision-making problem on time NS-set (tNS-set) through the real-life mentioned earlier by Alkhazaleh. Our work also shows that the proposed algorithm on NS-sequence has the same results as that offered by Alkhazaleh, and the tNS-set is just a particular case of the NSS-sequence.},

The TSMDM problems where the subjects are composed of multiple participants are called the multi-participant two-sided matching decision-making (MPTSMDM) problems. The task of intermediary is to match two sides of subjects one by one and make the matching scheme satisfy all subjects. Due to the linguistic evaluations of the participants constitute the probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs), considering the risk attitude of subjects, we propose a MPTSMDM approach under the probabilistic linguistic environment based on prospect theory. The PLTSs are firstly normalized by using the novel normalization method. Then, the weight-determining model is solved to obtain the weighting vectors of the criteria. Hereafter, the prospect values of the subjects can be calculated by combining the prospect theory and the defined distance measure. Afterward, the satisfaction degrees can be obtained by integrating groups of prospect values under all criteria. Furthermore, the multi-objective model is built and transformed into the single-objective model, the optimal solution of the later is derived. An intelligent technology transfer problem is resolved by using the proposed MPTSMDM approach. The sensitivity analysis and several comparison analyses are conducted to verify the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed MPTSMDM approach.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model based on the 2-tuple linguistic model and grey target decision method (2TL-GTD) for evaluating the comprehensive application effect of the connected vehicle system. Since the evaluation indicator system of the research problem belongs to multi-source heterogeneous data, the original data is firstly converted into a unified 2-tuple form using linguistic 2-tuple model, which can avoid information distortion or loss. Second, the deviation maximization method is used to objectively determine the weight of each indicator. Then, the grey target decision-making method is used to deal with the uncertain information in the data and select the optimal solution according to the bullseye degree, which allows a comprehensive evaluation of the application effectiveness of the connected vehicle system. Taking the tunnel scenario as an example to verify the effectiveness of 2LT-GTD, it is found that in the tunnel scenario, the connected vehicle system can remind the driver to prepare in advance, effectively reducing traffic accidents and pollutant emissions. Based on the results, it can provide technical improvement directions for relevant technical departments to achieve the coordinated development of safe driving, efficient driving and ecological driving.},

By introducing time-varying delays into the system where the economic profit is variable, a new stochastic descriptor biological economic system with time-varying delays is presented. Considering the nonlinearity of such systems, the fuzzy stochastic models are established via the Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy control approach. And then, the T–S fuzzy stochastic models are transformed into the equivalent subsystems by restricted equivalent transformation. Through the subsystems, by using a novel delay-dependent Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, the new sufficient condition is obtained to enable the considered systems to be mean-square admissible and stochastic strictly dissipative. Furthermore, the fuzzy state feedback controller is designed to ensure the population and price are stable by the regulation control for the biological resource. In the end, simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control design method.},

The portfolio is modified in this paper using the possibility theory instead of the probability theory by formulating the risk return as fuzzy numbers, and we also take into account the V-shaped transaction costs. The possibilistic semi-absolute deviation portfolio selection technique is used to develop a portfolio selection framework by considering the investor demands and stock characteristics. The higher computational complexity associated with the possibilistic mean semi-absolute deviation portfolio model is reduced using the hybris salp swarm-based Coot algorithm (SCOOT). The main aim of the hybrid SCOOT algorithm is to reduce the risk and increase the expected return. The salp swarm algorithm is integrated with the coot algorithm to enhance the global search capability. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated with the extensive experiments conducted on the Bombay Stock Exchange dataset. The results obtained show that the proposed methodology offers better performance when considering the transaction costs, and its performance is very high when compared to the conventional metaheuristic techniques.},

  abstract     = {Software evolution, an integral part of the software development process, encompasses frequent and numerous changes and updates that may lead to complex and poor-quality systems. Software engineers and quality practitioners continually refactor the software components to mitigate the negative effects of code and design smells. Although these smells are not directly connected to design and coding bugs, they are high indicators of technical debt that may arise as bugs in future software releases. Therefore, refactoring plays a significant role in the overall software evolution process. To fix the underlying code and design smells, they must be first detected and classified. As code smells have been the focus of research in the literature, this paper focuses on detecting design smells. A novel design smell detection scheme is proposed using adaptive neuro-fuzzy approaches. This scheme can be seamlessly integrated with any refactoring scheduling and prioritization models as it is efficiently designed using a fast-training scheme based on a neuro-fuzzy architecture. In addition, the design smell detection solution relies on a reduced set of software metrics. A large custom dataset with more than 30,000 class records is created to assess the performance of the design smell detection solution. The reported performance scores confirm the superiority of the proposed technique over the existing ones. The accuracy, precision, recall, and area-under-the-curve (AUC) scores attained 0.97, 0.98, 0.98, and 0.99, respectively. Thanks to the high detection scores, design smell refactoring sequencing and prioritization routines can be further enhanced.},

  abstract     = {Many of the current fuzzy sets based on intuitionistic fuzzy concepts suffer from different limitations. Different approaches towards that end in the form of scientific works have been introduced, and many other fuzzy sets were extended to address such limitations. In this study, the Cubic Pythagorean fuzzy sets (CPFS) are introduced as one of the proposed solutions and among the most powerful tools to address uncertainty, especially in complex and difficult situations by using both interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy set and Pythagorean fuzzy set to represent vagueness or ill-defined information. Considering all the merits of CPFS and its flexibility, this study aimed to integrate it with two profound multi-criteria decision-making methods. Fuzzy-weighted zero-inconsistency (FWZIC) and decision by opinion score method (FDOSM) are both extended based on CPFS, called CP-FWZIC and CP-FDOSM. Two methodological phases are performed in two phases. The first phase discusses all the necessary CP-FWZIC steps to determine the evaluation criteria weights, followed by alternatives ranking using CP-FDOSM. The second phase discusses a case study used in this research for sign language recognition systems. Finally, two methods were used to assess the extended multi-criteria decision-making methods, namely, systematic ranking assessment and sensitivity analysis. The assessment findings suggest that the ranking results are supported by both systematic ranking and high correlation results which were performed using different criteria weight-changing scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Implementation of integrated Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) management plays a major part in reducing potential risks to humans and the environment resulting from a workplace in different industries. One of the most common techniques in controlling and prioritizing workplace risks is Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). This proactive technique provides a list of critical risks so as to plan corrective and preventive measures to mitigate them. Despite its simplicity, it has some shortcomings that can turn the results away from the existing reality. This study tries to present a novel approach in three phases to prioritize the identified risks with the aim of covering conventional FMEA’s drawbacks, including lack of considering uncertainty in the risk analysis process and inability to assign different weights to risk factors. In the first phase, risks and their effects are identified using the FMEA technique, and then their related risk factors are determined. In the second phase of this approach, the weights of five risk factors are calculated using an extended version of the Best–Worst Method (BWM) based on the G-number theory and experts’ opinions. In the third phase, using the outputs of the previous two phases, the identified risks are prioritized using the Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS) method developed by the G-number theory. This approach, in addition to adding two new risk factors including pollution ratio and cost, which are identified based on research and industrial nature, by assigning different weights to the risk factors and also considering the importance and necessity concepts in the fuzzy environment using G-number theory. The results of the implementation of the proposed approach in a real-world case study demonstrate its ability and applicability to analyze risks in comparison with conventional FMEA fuzzy COPRAS methods.},

The study of clustering validity function is the process of evaluating the clustering quality and determining the optimal clustering number. Based on the idea of components, six cluster performance evaluation components are proposed to define compactness, variation, similarity, overlap and separation of data sets, respectively. Then a new validity function based on FCM clustering algorithm is synthesized by these six components. Finally, the proposed validity function and eight typical validity functions are compared on five artificial data sets and eight UCI data sets. The simulation results show that the proposed clustering validity function can evaluate the clustering results more effectively and determine the optimal clustering number of different data sets.},

To enable that more better performance is realized while one copes with the filtering error, an error-compensation mechanism is concerned. Besides, in the fuzzy composite learning, fuzzy logic system is exploited to approximate each of the unknown functions in the dynamic system. Meanwhile, the online historical data and instantaneous data are applied to induce the prediction errors, and the tracking error and the prediction errors are used to update the parameters of fuzzy logic systems. The stability analysis is established on the basis of fractional-order Lyapunov method, and the boundedness of all signals is guaranteed.

  abstract     = {Fuzzy sets underlie uncertainty analysis and intelligent processing. Their generalizations have become a valuable topic, and there are multiple types of generalized fuzzy sets. Representative q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFSs) have been widely utilized and include intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs), Pythagorean fuzzy sets, and Fermatean fuzzy sets. q-ROFSs are a special case of orthopair fuzzy sets (OFSs), but the latter are only preliminarily formulated at present; q-ROFSs carry restricted power function conditions, so they have a simplification space as a result of linear computations. This paper reconstructs OFSs to propose specific models, i.e., linear OFSs (LOFSs) as well as symmetrical LOFSs (SLOFSs), so that we can achieve both fuzziness extensions and q-ROFS simplification. Moreover, we emphatically discuss order-reversing involutionary negations, simply called negations. First, for OFSs, their basic definitions and usual operations are formally determined to extend q-ROFSs, and their negations acquire basic properties in terms of the bijective mapping, equivalent rule, dual monotonicity, and rectangular description. Then, for LOFSs, their natural definitions and usual operations are realized by linear constraints to extend the IFSs of q-ROFSs. They exhibit four common types, i.e., LOFSs (1), (2), (3) and (4), and three symmetrical types, i.e., SLOFSs (1), (2) and (3); LOFSs (4) and degenerate SLOFSs (2) are the main models. Their negations achieve further properties in terms of the single direction, equivalent rule, and continuous bijection; thus, the negations are realized in LOFSs (1) and (4) and all SLOFSs but never in surplus LOFSs (2) and (3). In summary, OFSs are explicitly defined to generalize q-ROFSs, while LOFSs are further established to both enrich OFSs and simplify q-ROFSs, so relevant negations yield axiomatic definitions and thorough properties. The obtained results of generalized frameworks, linear constraints, unsymmetrical representations, and operational properties facilitate fuzziness uncertainty applications.},

The cost of the inventory-production system in the multi-echelon Supply Chain (SC) was reduced Using game theory and fuzzy demand forecasting. The findings revealed that the level of inventory maturity control has a strong relationship with accurate forecasting of fuzzy demand. As a result, precise forecasting of the ambiguous demands related to increasing price elasticity inevitably lowers retailer performance in SC. As price elasticity rises in response to market demand, all retailers should take the required steps to avoid losing sales.

Additionally, the definition of granular fuzzy consensus surface is proposed which determines the robustness of the consensus protocol to changes in the communication topology. Necessary and sufficient conditions are proposed to ensure that an unbounded fuzzy consensus surface can be reached with the proposed consensus protocol.

  abstract     = {Hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTSs) and double hierarchy hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (DHHFLTSs) are two frequently used linguistic information forms in uncertain decision-making environments. However, they only include membership grades and cannot yield fuzzy information from a negative aspect. A bipolar fuzzy set can quantify evaluation information from positive and negative sides using positive and negative memberships, respectively. To address this issue, double hierarchy bipolar hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (DHBHFLTSs) are proposed, which can highlight the importance of the negative membership degree, and the objects can be evaluated from positive and negative aspects. Furthermore, DHBHFLTSs increase the reasonableness and comprehension of the evaluation information in the process of optimal talent selection. This paper proposed a framework involving the stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) method and the extended weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) method. The extended WASPAS method is utilized to aggregate the evaluation information of all the alternatives under the DHBHFLTSs context. So, this proposed method increases the ranking accuracy. The SWARA method is extended to DHBHFLTSs to rank and determine the criteria. This weight determination method is helpful for coordinating and gathering data from experts. Therefore, the proposed method can obtain the weight values efficiently. Subsequently, a case of talent selection is utilized to show the feasibility and applicability of the proposed framework. Finally, the accuracy and comparison analyses with other methods illustrate the superiority of this framework.},

The intent of this paper is to measure the uncertainty of a set-valued information system (SVIS) from the perspective of “The similarity between information values is fed back to the feature set” and consider its application in feature selection. Based on the similarity between information values, fuzzy symmetry relations on the object set of an SVIS are first established. Secondly, $$\theta$$ -information granules based on the fuzzy symmetry relations are obtained. Thirdly, four UMs for an SVIS, including $$\theta$$ -information granulation ( $$G^\theta$$ ), $$\theta$$ -information entropy ( $$H^\theta$$ ), $$\theta$$ -rough entropy ( $$E_\mathrm{{r}}^\theta$$ ) and $$\theta$$ -information amount ( $$E^\theta$$ ), are proposed. Moreover, numerical experiments and statistical tests to evaluate the performance of the proposed measurements are carried out. Finally, an application in feature selection for an SVIS is given and the corresponding algorithms based on $$G^\theta$$ and $$H^\theta$$ are presented, clustering analysis on the reduced SVIS is conducted. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms are effective according to three evaluation indicators of clustering performance.},

The FMA outputs an additional force accompanying with the MacPherson struts so that FMASS has much powerful strength to stabilize the vehicle body. To regulate the vehicle body, a parallel type adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy sliding mode control (parallel-AIT2FSC) is presented in this paper. It has two AIT2FSCs in parallel: one controls the position and the other reduces acceleration. A fully functional test-rig is constructed to verify the feasibility of the FMASS using self-generated road conditions. In the experiments, the characteristics of the FMASS, such as the position and the vertical acceleration of the sprung mass, are demonstrated on two different road conditions and are presented in the time and frequency domains.

To address these challenges, this study proposes a fuzzy broad learning adaptive control (FBLAC) system consisting of a fuzzy broad controller and a robust controller. The fuzzy broad controller uses a fuzzy broad-learning system (FBLS) to approximate an ideal controller online, and the robust controller is designed to keep the system stable. The gradient descent method and the chain rule are applied to adjust all the FBLS parameters online to increase its approximation and learning capacities. Furthermore, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FBLAC system has good tracking performance and uncertainty rejection properties. The main contributions of this study are as follows: (1) An FBLS with a simple structure and full-tuned parameter learning laws to improve its learning ability was investigated. (2) Stability analysis of the closed-loop FBLAC system was proved based on the gradient descent method and the Lyapunov stability theorem.

In this research, a 3-phase fuzzy-based framework is proposed to address the product completion time problem. In the first phase, using quantitative research, human resource, machinery, material, technology, and social environment are identified as the group factors that can have the most impact on product completion time. Then, in the next phase, a supervised machine-learning algorithm is proposed to classify the production alternatives according to their actual status of the effective internal factor. Then, in the third phase, a new fuzzy-based heuristic is developed to generate production alternatives and evaluate and select the best one. The outcomes show that the layout (0.636), material (0.602), maintenance (0.584), human resource (0.56), and technology (0.553) affect the product completion time, respectively. The findings also indicated that the proposed Fuzzy-TOPSIS heuristic is capable of reducing the product completion time in a range between 0 and 10.3%.},

In this paper, by analyzing the complex non-linear relationship between performance metrics and pc and pm in the search process of many-objective evolutionary algorithms. A fuzzy inference system is constructed to dynamically update the pc and pm in the iterative process. Therefore, a fuzzy adaptive NSGA-III algorithm is proposed and used to solve large-scale optimization problems. For the construction of fuzzy systems, this paper takes the number of iterations, convergence metric, and diversity metric as inputs, and pc and pm as outputs. Four different fuzzy systems are obtained, and the best fuzzy system is selected through experiments. In order to further verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, the proposed algorithm and the existing literature are tested on LSMOP problems. The results show that the fuzzy system can well describe the complex non-linear relationship between the performance metrics and the pc and the pm in the search process of the many-objective evolutionary algorithm.

  abstract     = {A hybrid PSO–GWO PID-type fuzzy logic controller (FLC) with a new online fuzzy tuner is proposed in this study to control a second-order system with varying parameters. Initially, the output scaling factors and the universe of discourse of membership functions for the PID-type FLC are optimized employing a hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO) and grey wolf optimization (GWO) technique. The superiority of the hybrid PSO–GWO has been demonstrated by comparing with other methods, namely PSO, GWO, and hybrid CS (cuckoo search)–GWO. Additionally, a new online fuzzy tuner structure is proposed by tuning a single output scaling factor to overcome the major disadvantages of the previous approach using the relative rate observer and fuzzy parameter regulator (RRO–FPR). Simulation results show that all the given optimal PID-type FLCs with the proposed new fuzzy tuner produce a better system performance and exhibit a shorter settling time/rise time than the RRO–FPR approach. The proposed optimal PID-type FLC with a fuzzy tuner, which is optimized by the hybrid PSO–GWO method, proves to be superior to others given in this study by exhibiting the shortest settling time/rise time and the lowest overshoot in a practical application to the speed control of a nonlinear DC motor system. Therefore, utilization of the proposed, improved controller to nonlinear systems in dealing with dead-zone and unexpected disturbance is highly feasible.},

Second, for fuzzy scheduling, the previous uncertain forms had difficulty presenting the distributed features of collected data, we use the cloud model to perform the uncertain data. Third, previous studies proposed that satisfaction was linear with the index value, such as tardiness or earliness, but nonrational customers were not considered. We use prospect theory to calculate the satisfaction of nonrational customers. Finally, to solve the scheduling problem, we design an enhanced gray wolf optimization with a parallel searching mechanism. The advantages of our algorithm are verified by comparison with other similar algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In order to control the systematic divergence among decision makers (DMs) and preserve the original decision preference, this paper proposes a novel decision information fusion framework under the hesitant fuzzy environment. First, a maximum compactness-based normalization method is presented to normalize hesitant fuzzy elements (HFEs) as pretreatment of decision data. Second, prospect theory is introduced to assign the optimal aggregation weights to maximize the efficiency of the preference aggregation process, in which the expected consensus threshold is viewed as a reference point estimated through statistic inference to distinguish DMs’ status. Third, an effective feedback mechanism is designed to improve group consensus, and the dichotomy algorithm is utilized to search optimal feedback weight to preserve original decision information. Finally, a case study and comparison analysis are illustrated to show the efficiency of the proposed hesitant fuzzy information fusion method.},

A novel dynamic event-triggered transmission protocol is firstly offered to further decrease the data transmission percentage over the communication channels. To better depict the practical communication situations, the mutually independent random variables that subject to the Bernoulli distribution are adopted to formulate the occurrence of deception attacks. And an asynchronous and resilient filter is properly constructed, which yields that the filtering error systems are converted into the T–S fuzzy MJSPSs with time-varying delays. Then, the criteria of stochastically stable for the filtering error systems are presented concerning a group of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). By solving the LMIs, the nonsynchronous and resilient dissipative filter, the weighting matrix of dynamic event-triggered transmission protocol can be concurrently determined. Eventually, an example is provided to verify the validity of the developed theoretical results. Further, for the prescribed dissipative performance, state trajectoires, filter trajectories, and filter errors are presented for MJSPSs involving deception attacks under different transmission protocols, which illustrate that both of them almost have the same decay rates. However, for the prescribed dissipative performance, the transmission rates are so different for two transmission protocols that the dynamic event-triggered transmission protocol is much lower than that of the static one.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) in an imprecise and random environment. The deterministic version of the problem deals with finding a set of routes in such a way that the demand of all the customers present in the network are satisfied and the cost incurred in performing these operations comes out to be a minimum. In practical life situations, problems are not always defined in crisp form. Phenomena like randomness and impreciseness are quite natural to arise in real life. This work presents CVRP in such a mixed environment, such type of CVRP may be called as Fuzzy Stochastic Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem. In this work, the demands of the customers are assumed to be stochastic and are revealed only when a vehicle arrives at the customer location. Moreover, the edge weights represent time required to traverse the edge and hence are both imprecise and random in nature. Factors like traffic conditions, weather conditions, are responsible for the random nature of the edge weights and the varying speed of the vehicle is responsible for impreciseness. Thus, the work presents CVRP with stochastic demands and stochastic and imprecise travel times. In this paper, an expectation-based approach has been used to deal with the randomness of edge weights. A two-stage model is used to solve the problem where the first stage corresponds to finding an optimal tour and recourse actions are planned in the second stage. A procedure based on Branch and Bound algorithm has been used to find minimum cost route. A small numerical example is presented to explain the working of the method proposed and the proposed solution approach is further tested on modified fuzzy versions of some benchmarks datasets.},

  abstract     = {In qualitative, non-numerical models, there are numerous challenges raised by the ambiguity, uncertainty, and risk within variables. The root of this ambiguity may lie in the variable itself or other related variables, or be due to expert opinions. Fuzzy cognitive maps allow better understanding of such problems, determining the cause-effect relationships between variables. When dealing with problems where the associated numerical data are unavailable, or the nature of the problem is qualitative, cognitive maps are constructed based on the statements of related experts. One of the problems with using the common cognitive maps model that it fails to consider uncertainty, risk and error within expert comments. This problem affects the quality and credibility of the models applied to complex issues. This paper proposes an R-cognitive maps approach, based on the distance-based automatic construction approach and R-numbers, in order to capture possible risks, uncertainty and ambiguity of expert opinions, with regard to variables and causality relationships. The proposed approach can function as a decision support tool for risk-based cognitive maps problems involving expert opinions, and is tested numerically with an engineering problem.},

Researchers used input-output data as fuzzy values in fuzzy DEA (FDEA) models, whereas weights (decision variables) associated with these input-output data were crisp. However, in the physical world, weights can also take the form of fuzzy numbers. To overcome this shortcoming of FDEA models, fully fuzzified DEA (FFDEA) models are introduced where all input-output data and weights are considered fuzzy values. We extended FDEA to FFDEA in which all variables along with input-output data are fuzzy numbers, in particular, triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs). With the help of the $$ \alpha - {\text{cut}} $$ approach, we developed left and right-hand efficiency models for measuring the relative performance of each DMU and rank them according to their efficiencies. Finally, the developed FFDEA model is compared with existing approaches with the help of an example; and a real-life application of developed FFDEA model in the education sector is presented.},

  abstract     = {The two-dimension 2-tuple linguistic (TD2L) label, based on the traditional 2-tuple linguistic representation model, adds another 2-tuple linguistic term to express the reliability degree of the assessments. However, the reliability degree is a subjective evaluation on reliability of the given assessments and variables due to the limitations in cognitions and the complexity of decision objects. All assessments without total reliability degree are viewed as uncertain ones. Based on this idea, this paper proposes a new TD2L representation model from a stochastic perspective. The assessment expressed by TD2L is a variable that fluctuates around the given linguistic term, and the fluctuation range is decided by the reliability of the assessment. Therefore, the assessments are regarded as stochastic variables, where the expectancy and deviation of the stochastic variable are corresponding to the first dimension and the second dimension information of TD2Ls, respectively. Consequently, two new aggregation functions for aggregating TD2L labels based on the algorithms among stochastic variables are proposed. In addition, the comparison and similarity measure between TD2L labels are developed, which considers the relative importance of the two dimensions of TD2L labels. Finally, the proposed method is applied to an investment decision of medium sized enterprise and alternatives ranking is provided with the probability of superiority. A comparison analysis conducted from three aspects illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Due to the shortcomings of conventional machine hearing methods in tackling data with high-dimension search space, such as the need for initial configuration and feature extraction manually, high complexity, and long processing time, real-time processing is challenging in the field of sonar image processing. Therefore, this paper proposes a hierarchical three-stage deep learning (DL)-based approach for real-time accurate sonar image recognition. A conventional deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is used as an automatic feature extractor in the first stage. In the second stage, ELM replaces the last fully connected layer to reduce tuning and testing time. Due to the uncertainty imposed via the addition of ELM to the model, in the third stage, the slime mould algorithm (SMA) will be used to tune the input weights and biases of the ELM. Finally, fuzzy maps are used to balance the relationship between the SMA’s exploration and exploitation phases. For evaluating the efficiency of the designed fuzzy SMA (FSMA), we first use 23 standard benchmark mathematical optimization functions. Subsequently, we employ three experimental sonar datasets to examine the efficiency of DCNN–ELM–FSMA in dealing with high-dimensional datasets. For a comprehensive investigation, we compare FSMA to the standard SMA, whale optimization algorithm (WOA), gray wolf optimizer (GWO), kalman filter (KF), henry gas solubility optimization (HGSO), Harris Hawks optimization (HHO), chimp optimization algorithm (ChOA), genetic algorithm (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO), with respect to convergence rate, entrapment in local minima, and detection accuracy. The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy performs better in detecting underwater anomaly targets by an average of 2.11 percent compared to the best benchmark model.},

  abstract     = {Shunt Active Power Filters (SAPF) is a prominent solution for improving power quality in power network by mitigating harmonics generated by nonlinear loads. Even though Multilevel Inverter (MLI)-based SAPF produces low distortion waveforms, switching signal generation with more number of driver units makes the compensation unit more complex. Hence, to override this problem, Packed U Cell inverters are emerged. This paper formulated Packed U Cell inverter with five level output (PUC5)-based SAPF for harmonics reduction and power quality enhancement. This formulated SAPF comprises two control loops namely an inner current loop that acts as a source current shaping loop and an outer voltage control loop, which regulates the DC link capacitor voltage. Thus, in this work, Ancillary Proportional Integral Current Controller (APICC) and Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) are tailored as a current and voltage controller, respectively. The reference current for the inner current loop of the proposed SAPF is derived from the outer loop. Simulation modeling using MATLAB simulation and experimental setup is realized to verify the efficiency of the proposed system. A comparative analysis is carried out with PI controller to show the betterment of the proposed FLC controller. From the results, it is found that the THD is reduced to 1.79% with the implementation of FLC with SAPF. Hence, it is proven that SAPF with APICC plus FLC controller shows excellent performance in power quality improvement.},

The proposed approach work on the principle that the decision set is the confluence of objectives and constraints while membership functions are defined according to the aspiration of decision-maker. Since current work discusses the interval neutrosophic optimization, therefore, the aspiration levels for interval-valued true, interval-valued falsity and interval-valued indeterminacy solely depends on the confluence criteria and algebra of interval neutrosophic sets. Denominators of each membership function are chosen so that it expresses the limit of the probable violation of the inequalities given in the problem. Several real life applications are given to justify the legitimacy, applicability and validity of proposed approach and a comparative study has been made between newly proposed and existed techniques.

Generally, how to score the words in a document has a significant influence on the word graph modeling. In this paper, we improve TM in two aspects with TRS theory that is used to mine vocabulary, semantics, grammar and other information in the corpus. First, the degree of words belonging to each document is calculated to form a fuzzy membership matrix, which helps to characterize the incipient word importance. Second, the fuzzy membership of words to each word tolerance class is calculated to form a semantic correlation matrix, which contributes to optimize the transition probability of all graph edges. We apply the proposed methods to the clustering tasks of two datasets, outperforming the strong baselines.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, some scholars have put forward the concept of green finance, which is to integrate the environmental protection concept of green development into the traditional financial industry. Green credit is one of the important financial services in green finance. In order to construct a more perfect multiple attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) method, this paper proposes a new evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) model based on prospect theory and probabilistic uncertain linguistic term set (PT-PULTS-EDAS model). The PT-PUTLS-EDAS model fully takes the psychological state of decision-makers into account the mathematical logic of the method, which is more suitable for the problem of MAGDM in reality. In addition, the new PT-PULTS-EDAS model reduces the decision-maker&#39;s subjective judgment on some objective situations as much as possible. The model uses Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) method to obtain the initial attribute weights and makes use of the weighting function to alter the initial weights so that successfully avoids the distortion of subjective judgment to the actual probability to some extent. Moreover, different parameters are introduced in this method to further deal with the part above and below the standard point respectively so that different types of decision-makers&#39; attitudes towards gains and losses are taken into account. In the fifth part, we focus on green finance, prove the usability of this method through an example, and draw a reasonable and scientific conclusion based on the results of comparative analysis. In the future, we will continue to focus on the relevant theories and methods about MADM or MAGDM.},

First, the definitions about PHFS and probabilistic hesitant fuzzy element (PHFE) are introduced, and some corresponding operations are given. Second, we adopt BWM to obtain subjective weights and ITARA approach to obtain objective weights, by combining the subjective weights and objective weights together; we can derive the final weights.

  abstract     = {This article proposes a general gH-gradient efficient-direction method and a $${\mathcal{W}}$$ -gH-gradient efficient method for the optimization problems with interval-valued functions. The convergence analysis and the step-wise algorithms of both methods are presented. It is observed that the $${\mathcal{W}}$$ -gH-gradient efficient method converges linearly for a strongly convex interval-valued objective function. To develop the proposed methods and to study their convergence, the ideas of strong convexity and sequential criteria for gH-continuity of interval-valued function are illustrated. In the sequel, a new definition of gH-differentiability for interval-valued functions is also proposed. The new definition of gH-differentiability is described with the help of a newly defined concept of linear interval-valued function. It is noticed that the proposed gH-differentiability is superior to the existing ones. For a gH-differentiable interval-valued function, the relation of convexity with the gH-gradient of an interval-valued function and an optimality condition of an interval optimization problem is derived. For the derived optimality condition, a notion of efficient direction for interval-valued functions is introduced. The idea of efficient direction is used to develop the proposed gradient methods. As an application of the proposed methods, the least-square problem for interval-valued data by $${\mathcal{W}}$$ -gH-gradient efficient method is solved. The proposed method for least square problems is illustrated by a polynomial fitting and a logistic curve fitting.},

Usually, selecting a process as a subject of improvement is a multi-criteria problem. While there is a planetary of methods for process portfolio selection, in the current study, an extended hybrid fuzzy multi-criteria model is proposed. The main novelty of the proposed method is consideration of the effects of processes on sustainability and the strength of relationship among them. Paying attention to the principles of sustainable development and considering social and environmental criteria along with economic criteria will lead to the selection of a sustainable process portfolio. Therefore, criteria for selecting the process portfolio based on three pillars of sustainability, i.e., economic, social and environmental, were identified. Since the selection process can be considered as a complex and uncertain problem, after identification of process evaluation criteria, the magnitude of interrelationship among processes is determined by fuzzy Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL). Then, using a fuzzy inference system, a rule base is developed for evaluating the process importance considering its statues in a set of criteria. The proposed hybrid methodology is applied in a real-word case. The main contribution of the proposed methodology is to consider the interrelationship among process along with their impact on sustainability dimensions in a comprehensive framework.},

Therefore, a hybrid fuzzy and data-driven robust optimization for Resilience and Sustainable Health Care Supply Chain (RSHCSC) with VMI approach is appropriate for improving the inventory management system and tackling uncertainty and disruption in this situation. Three RSHCSC models are suggested using hybrid fuzzy and data-driven robust optimization with a stochastic programming approach. The first model is average and mean absolute function, the second model is Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), the third model is Minimax model, and the final model is the traditional inventory model. Each of the proposed models has advantages and disadvantages that depend on the conservative level of decision-maker. Sensitivity analysis is done on essential parameters like fuzzy cut, confidence level, robust and resilience coefficient, and size models. The results show that increasing fuzzy cut, confidence level, robustification coefficient, resiliency coefficient, and CVaR confidence level amount of costs grows. The Minimax function is suitable for conservative decision-makers.},

Rather than going to the hospital, it is possible to remotely track patients’ health-related criteria and move them to medical data centers using cloud storage.

This means higher disclosure of confidential data; consequently, data protection and privacy obtained from MIoT devices are major unresolved concerns. As classification systems are growing rapidly, the need to apply machine learning algorithms to large-scale industrial data is also expanding. In this paper, we classify medical data into disease-free individuals from affected ones. To securely store this information in the cloud, we introduce a novel Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for data protection to improve and determine the degree of security like breaches, data integrity, etc. Results indicate that with the 6.2506e−06 training error and 0.3429 testing error, ANFIS performs extremely well in improving the degree of security parameters for a secure path to the cloud.},

The following research has collected 62 attributes and 15 criteria for three sustainability dimensions. A new implementation method is also proposed to make this approach applicable in real-world problems. The contributions of this paper can be distinguished as the healthcare system’s sustainability level in imprecise conditions is obtained, the capability of identifying the weak points in implementing sustainability aspects is presented, and a new methodology for collecting the fundamental data for measuring the sustainability level in healthcare systems is given.

  abstract     = {Recently, the soft drink industry has been confronted with a rapidly changing business climate and increased competition, creating risks and uncertainties in its supply chain. Thus, immediate actions are required to handle these risks and uncertainties. The purpose of this paper is to identify and classify these risks in the soft drink supply chain and to develop a methodology comprising a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of these risks. FAHP was used to determine the weights of five major risk categories and 23 sub risks under these major categories. Afterward, a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method (FCEM) was applied for the assessment of overall risk level, risk levels of the five major categories and relative risk levels of the 23 sub risks. This research has been conducted focusing on the soft drink industry of Bangladesh, a developing country with an emerging economy. In the existing literature, this work contributes by identifying and evaluating risks in the soft drink supply chain in the context of Bangladesh. The outcome of this study indicates that the overall risk level in the supply chain of the soft drink industry is between low and medium, and the risk level of the demand risks is the highest whereas the risk level of infrastructural risks is the lowest. It was also found that loss of reputation and brand image is the most significant sub risk, and natural disasters are the least significant sub risk.},

  abstract     = {The set covering problem is a fundamental model which comprises a wide range of important applications such as crew scheduling problems that need to cover a set of trips. It is one of the most common issues in the facility location problem, which requires further investigations, particularly in emergency and service facilities. As such, the objective of this study is to propose a new coefficient-based heuristic algorithm for the set covering problems. This paper has accordingly presented the algorithm that evaluates the qualification of subsets by directly applying a fitness function. This fitness function is formulated based on sets and subsets coefficients in a way that the subsets of selected sets have the lowest probability to be selected in the next iteration. The algorithm is not only capable of constructing an answer within polynomial time, but can solve complex set covering problems without conventional restrictions. The performance of this algorithm is evaluated on benchmark instances including a set of reproduced and selected OR-library problems within different sizes. Computational results indicate that the proposed heuristic algorithm produces better solutions, especially in large-scale problems comparing simulated annealing in terms of quality and time.},

Often, the consensus is reached by the experts adjusting their assessments to the extent of mutual agreement. Accordingly, the purpose of this article is to develop an improved consensus-based method with interval fuzzy number judgment matrix (IFJM). To determine the disputes between experts, the consensus measure of IFJM based on objective and subjective compatibility degrees is defined. According to the consensus measure, a consensus improving algorithm is presented to assist each IFJM in reaching acceptable consensus. Subsequently, an optimization model based on the criterion of minimizing the consensus measure of IFJM with acceptable consensus is established to determine weights of experts in MCGDM. To rank and select alternatives, the possibility degree matrix is used to obtain the priority vector. Thus, a new consensus-based approach is put forward to solve MCGDM with IFJM. In this context, a case of express packaging recycling in circular economy and some comparisons are analyzed to demonstrate the availability and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In particular, a well-managed operator distribution is required for improving the performance of the fuzzy complex event processing-based decision-making systems. However, the intrinsic uncertainty in dynamic input events increases the difficulties of operator distribution problem. To address these issues, a cost-aware, fault-tolerant and reliable strategy, called CaFtR is proposed for operator scheduling on fuzzy complex event processing systems based on the Technique for Order Preferences by Similarity to an Ideal Solution. The proposed CaFtR method adequately makes use of network resources to achieve continuous and highly available complex event processing regardless of dynamic operator migrations under fuzzy environment. Finally, a case study is provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method, and the utility of our work is demonstrated through an application on the StreamBase system.},

  abstract     = {The proper selection of a renewable energy project (REP) is the key to give play to regional resource advantages and optimize the energy consumption structure. As a complex multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) problem, the choice of REP involves many influencing factors such as economy, society, and environment. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a social network MCGDM framework based on social network analysis (SNA) and hesitant probabilistic fuzzy set (HPFS). Firstly, the HPFS is introduced into the social network and constructs the hesitant probabilistic fuzzy trust function to represent the trust relationship between decision-makers. Secondly, the trust propagation operator of the hesitant probabilistic fuzzy trust function is constructed using the idea of conditional probability; then a dual feedback mechanism including opinion modification and weight adjustment is proposed to improve the group consensus level. On this basis, a social network MCGDM framework for REP selection is further proposed, and the SNA method is applied to the selection of REP for the first time. Following this, a case in Zhejiang Province, China, is presented to prove the rationality and effectiveness of the framework. The results show that the proposed hesitant probabilistic fuzzy trust function can better reflect the trust relationship between decision-makers and better describe the process of trust transmission, which is of great significance for solving the MCGDM problems such as REP selection.},

Fuzzy-logic systems are employed to approximate uncertain nonlinear functions, and a fractional-order fuzzy state observer based on the structure of the considered systems is framed to estimate the unmeasurable states. In each step of backstepping procedure, a barrier Lyapunov function is introduced in the design of the controller and the adaptation laws to satisfy the condition of the state constraints. Based on the fractional-order Lyapunov stability theory, a fractional-order adaptive fuzzy controller is constructed to guarantee that all the states remain in their constraint bounds, the tracking error converges to a bounded compact set containing the origin, and all signals in the closed-loop system are ensured to be bounded. Finally, a simulation example verifies the effectiveness of the proposed control design.},

This paper introduced a multi-objective linear programming model to prioritize and weigh suppliers using the modified best–worst method (BWM). The proposed model uses evaluation criteria and used fuzzy variables to determine the right numbers of suppliers as well as order quantity of raw materials each supplier should provide. The model has been made up of four objective functions, and the required constraints have been solved using the goal programming method. The proposed model can take a set of opposing goals into account and prioritize the goals to maximize access to each goal. The uncertain concepts such as fuzzy and rough theories in some criteria enabled the proposed model to use the imprecise information in the best possible manner. This study has solved an example using the proposed model through analytic network process and BWM. Then, the obtained results were compared with our findings for adopting interval-valued fuzzy-rough numbers BWM (IVFRN-BWM) and it was shown that the modified BWM approach generates lower costs and better criteria.},

Utilizing a polytopic representation, sufficient conditions to ensure the stability of the input constrained system are derived in the proposed optimizer. Furthermore, the resultant design criteria are relaxed by utilizing the membership-function-dependent analysis and the parameterized LMI technologies.

  abstract     = {To overcome the insufficiencies of existing information expression and operations of single-valued neutrosophic multisets (SVNMs) and multi-valued/hesitant neutrosophic sets (MVNSs), this study first introduces neutrosophic multi-valued sets (NMVSs), including SVNMs and MVNSs, as a general concept. Then, we propose a method that transforms NMVSs into consistency single-valued neutrosophic sets (CSVNSs) based on the average values and consistency degrees (complement of standard deviations) of the truth, indeterminacy, falsity multi-valued sequences in NMVSs. CSVNSs not only can realize the reasonable information expression and operation of different sequence lengths/cardinalities between neutrosophic multi-valued elements, but also can reflect the multi-valued sequences close to corresponding average levels in each neutrosophic multi-valued element. Next, we present two correlation coefficients between CSVNSs in the setting of NMVSs. Based on the correlation coefficients of CSVNSs, a decision-making (DM) approach is established in the NMVS setting. Lastly, an illustrative example and comparison with existing methods are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of the established DM method in the NMVS setting. The developed DM approach not only makes the DM process more reasonable and credible, but also provides the new modeling method for multi-attribute DM problems in NMVS setting.},

  abstract     = {Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) has been prevailing in multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. Meanwhile, the fuzzy sets family has shown great power in representing vagueness and advancing the decision quality under uncertainties. The literature well documented the foundation and advantages of their integration, such as Fuzzy AHP. However, under what conditions do such integrations surely perform better than AHP in the MCDM process is still unclear. In this paper, we pick intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) sets—one of the advanced and most prevailing members of the fuzzy sets family, and further investigate when and how to integrate IF and AHP (IF-AHP) to the best advantage. We illustrate the formulated quantitative differences between the weight of AHP and the normalized defuzzified weight of IF-AHP. We uncover the qualitative and quantitative differences between AHP and IF-AHP, and identify the conditions and strategies of using IF-AHP instead of AHP. We use data experiments to illustrate our findings and further implement two case studies based on the real scenarios of supplier selection for validation and explanation.},

  abstract     = {Although in line with the resource-based view (RBV), the impact of different HPWS practices on the innovation success of SMEs has been approved by researchers, investigating the previous studies indicates that the relation between these two areas has been more widely considered and less attention has been paid to the impact mechanism. Lack of real data and focus of analysis on respondents’ opinions, lack of process perspective and focus on innovation output criteria, lack of attention to uncertainty in the impact chain, and most importantly lack of a method to prioritize HPWS practices are among the most important constraints identified. So, this study proposes a framework for prioritizing innovation-oriented high-performance human resource practices by combining fuzzy DEA and fuzzy ARAS methods. This paper also presents an objective approach to investigate the impact of High-Performance Work system (HPWS) practices on innovation performance of small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) by considering organizational innovation as a process. After preparing the list of HPWS practices and innovation performance criteria through reviewing the literature and obtaining expert opinions, the fuzzy DEA method was used to model the innovation process performance and calculate the weight of each innovation input criteria. Then, considering the impact of HPWS practices on these input criteria, HPWS practices were ranked using the fuzzy ARAS method. The results of applying this framework to SMEs in the field of nanotechnology in Iran show that top management support is the most important input criteria and the financial results of innovation are the most important output of organizational innovation criteria. In addition, based on the results of this study, the most important effective HPWS practices for SME innovation can be considered as: employee training and development, information sharing and employee participation. The consistency of final ranking of practices and criteria importance with the findings of previous research, the results of sensitivity analysis and comparison of the results of proposed framework and four other multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) methods show the robustness and reliability of the findings of this research.},

  abstract     = {Robustness is a major concern when engineers design lateral stability controllers for intelligent vehicles. The system uncertainty derives from the internal parametric perturbation and the external disturbance. The fuzzy set theory is adopted to describe the bound of the uncertainty. Hence the vehicle lateral dynamical system becomes a fuzzy dynamical system. An explicit robust optimal control law is then proposed to ensure the uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness of the system. The control law is deterministic and is not IF-THEN fuzzy rule based. A two-player cooperative game is established to determine the optimal value of tunable parameters. The cost functions of the players are developed based on the system performance and the control cost. The Pareto optimal is then obtained using the cooperative game theory. The effectiveness of the proposed method is proven by numerical simulations and Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments. This paper makes a breakthrough by casting the cooperative game theory and the fuzzy set theory into vehicle lateral stability control.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a fault-tolerant control scheme is presented for a boiler-turbine unit of a thermal power plant covering a wide range of operations: at low, medium, and high loads. The approach is based on the use of an observer-based actuator fault estimation system to detect and estimate the fault magnitude for a posteriori compensation via a fault-tolerant control scheme. The performance of both, the observer for actuator fault estimation and the fault-tolerant control scheme are evaluated in a practical scenario using a simulator of the dynamics of the critical variables of the process: the main steam flow, the first stage turbine pressure, the super-heated steam pressure, the drum pressure, and the electric power. The main contribution of this work is to develop an integral, practical methodology for analysis and design of a simultaneous actuator fault estimation and fault-tolerant control system for nonlinear processes. The originality with respect to other works is the regulation of the electric power demand in a thermometric steam generator by means of a fault-tolerant control (FTC) approach. The FTC is based on the knowledge of the fault magnitude on actuators via an observer-based fault estimation scheme. On the other hand, the use of the Takagi-Sugeno approach allows to extend these results to a wider variety of processes with strong nonlinear dynamics.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a descriptor form design methodology for polynomial fuzzy-model-based (FMB) control systems. To begin with, the closed-loop polynomial fuzzy system is cast into the descriptor form representation. Applying the commonly used Lyapunov function of the polynomial fuzzy model, the first sum-of-squares (SOS) based stabilization control design approach is proposed. Through the redundancy of descriptor form representation, polynomial fuzzy slack matrices are brought into the stabilization analysis for relaxation. Applying fuzzy slack matrices for the stabilization analysis causes the double fuzzy summation problem which can be seen as the copositivity problem. Therefore, the copositivity relaxation is applied in the stabilization control design. In addition, for the special cases that all membership functions are functions of the states being not related to the inputs, the second SOS-based stabilization control design approach is proposed by applying a novel fuzzy Lyapunov function. As the novel fuzzy Lyapunov function contains the commonly used Lyapunov function as a special case, the second design approach is guaranteed to be less conservative than the first one. Since the novel fuzzy Lyapunov function is applied, the time derivatives of membership functions are necessary to be considered in the stabilization analysis. Hence, the sector nonlinearity technique is applied to deal with the rest part of the membership function time derivative after extracting the polynomial common factors. Finally, three examples are given to shown the effectiveness and relaxation of the proposed descriptor form control design methodology.},

The geomantic property of SEMF has shown faster convergence and less computation load. The simulated results of each subsystem governed by the SEMF are compared with Gaussian membership function (GMF) to evaluate its potential. The research out comes confirms that the computation load of IT2FLS is considerably reduced based on the implementation of Wu–Mendel uncertainty bounds.},

We show how the performance of VSSO is based on the frontal and rotational movement of the shark when navigating a dimensional search domain, which is based on the food-seeking behavior of sharks. The optimization of the design of a Mamdani interval type-2 fuzzy controller (IT2-FLC) applying VSSO is also described. The optimized controller is tested with the navigation of an autonomous mobile robot (AMR) in an unknown and changing environment. This work was developed as follows: first, the VSSO algorithm is improved by adjusting its main alpha and beta parameters with a fuzzy system, later the parameter values of the fuzzy controller input/output membership functions are optimized. Finally, a comparison is made between the results of type-1 (T1) and interval type-2 fuzzy controllers applying the proposed methodology. When comparing the T1 and IT2-FLC controllers, the application of the VSSO algorithm in T1-FLC shows good performance in robot navigation; however, IT2-FLC presents better performance due to its ability to handle higher levels of uncertainty. The performance evaluation of the proposed method and its application in different navigation problems has been carried out through computer simulations using Matlab-Simulink.},

There are three phases of patch learning mechanism embedded in AFNA, including (1) training an initial global model, (2) training a patch model for each identified patch, and (3) updating the global model using the training data that do not fall into any patch. The AFNA can be applied to construct the student and robot co-learning regression model, as well as the regression model for the dataset retrieved from the game of Go. First, students generate human learning data through interactions with handheld devices or robots based on the AFNA in Taiwan and Japan. Then, the AFNA utilizes the student learning data collected in the classroom and the Go game data provided by both Google DeepMind and Facebook AI Research open-source OpenGo to train the Fuzzy Machine-Learning Model. In addition, the trained Fuzzy Machine-Learning Model of AFNA is deployed to the robots to make students and machines co-learn together based on IEEE 1855 FML. The experiments show that the AFNA with Patch Learning Mechanism and Fuzzy Machine-Learning Model can improve the performance of regression model based on the datasets of student learning and Go game. In the future, we hope to apply the AFNA with robots to the other domain areas, embed it with the Artificial Intelligence of Things devices, and introduce it to more teaching fields in various countries.},

However, it is almost impossible for a potential tourist to look through the massive online reviews related to tourist attractions (TAs) so that he/she can make the most appropriate decision. To this end, this paper proposes a recommender system to rank the alternative TAs through online reviews based on aspect-level sentiment analysis and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) with intuitionistic and hesitant fuzzy information. In this methodology, the aspects that the experienced tourists concern are extracted from online reviews to construct a three-level evaluation system (including target layer, criteria layer and sub-criteria layer), which not only ensures the comprehensive evaluation of TAs as much as possible, but also reduces the complexity of the decision-making process. Then, the online reviews related to these sub-criteria are transformed into the corresponding intuitionistic and hesitant fuzzy performance scores through aspect-level sentiment analysis. Furthermore, in order to obtain the final ranking result that more in line with the expectations of the potential tourist, the preference information from the potential tourist and experienced tourists is integrated to determine the weights of criteria. Subsequently, the intuitionistic and hesitant fuzzy TOPSIS (IHF-TOPSIS) method is proposed to rank the alternative TAs. Finally, a case study is provided to verify the validity and applicability of the methodology.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the finite-time adaptive fuzzy control for multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) nonstrict-feedback nonlinear systems with fuzzy dead zones. Combining the semi-global practical finite-time stability criterion with the condition of variable partition, a feasible finite-time adaptive fuzzy control scheme is proposed for the developed MIMO system. The designed control algorithm guarantees that the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin in finite time. Compared with existing research results, the main advantage of this paper lies in that the finite-time control issue is considered for MIMO nonstrict-feedback systems with input nonlinearities. Two simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the suggested approach.},

The variants of matrix factorization (MF) techniques incorporating the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) are exploited to improve the efficacy of recommender systems through effectively dealing the fuzzy behavior. The iterative update mechanism of MF-based SGD techniques involves current but limited information for providing related recommendations. The strength of sliding window and multi-innovation-based approximations with memory can improve the accuracy of the recommender systems through prior knowledge by utilizing the fuzziness among ratings. In this work, a moving-information-based computing paradigm is presented to effectively handle the fuzzy nature of preferences by recommender systems with the ability to capture the collective effect of ratings of previous update history obtained for a defined information length to provide fast and precise recommendations.},

  abstract     = {With the deepening of the research on clustering algorithm, clustering validity has become an indispensable part of cluster analysis. However, due to the complexity of data structure and different attributes, any clustering validity function cannot be applied to all datasets, so clustering validity function has been bringing forth new ones. Therefore, this paper proposes a clustering validity function fusion model based on D–S evidence theory (DS-CVFFM), which adopts FCM clustering algorithm as the base algorithm, calculates the values of different validity functions, and then uses the values of different clustering validity functions as the evidence source to construct the basic probability assignment function (BPA). Finally, it integrates with the fusion rules of D–S evidence theory, and outputs the optimal clustering number according to the decision conditions. DS-CVFFM uses the information fusion of multiple clustering validity functions to judge the number of optimal clusters without the need to propose complex validity functions, and avoid the influence of expert factors in the weighted combination clustering validity evaluation method. Finally, 4 sets of artificial datasets and 14 sets of UCI datasets are selected to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional clustering validity evaluation methods, the proposed fusion model has a significant improvement in the accuracy of judging the optimal number of clusters, and the stability is improved under different values of fuzzy exponent, which can overcome the shortcomings of traditional clustering validity evaluation methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the cost consensus model by considering the uncertain initial opinions and uncertain unit adjustment cost in group decision making. In the past consensus model based on optimization, the initial opinion and unit adjustment cost are usually assumed to be a crisp number for each expert. However, the speed of knowledge updating is often faster than people’s cognitive speed, it is difficult and impractical to ask experts to provide a clear initial opinion and determine the unit adjustment cost of each expert. In this paper, a new consensus approach is proposed to solve the above problems. First, a new distance measure is given based on interval-valued initial opinion, which retains the expert’s initial judgment and is consistent with most practical decision problems. Second, a linear analytical formula is given to reduce the computational cost of the piecewise function. Third, given the advantages of robust optimization in uncertain optimization, three robust cost consensus models are established to deal with the uncertain cost problem in consensus reaching progress. Finally, the proposed method is applied to P2P loan consensus, and sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis are presented.},

To augment the rule generation and fuzzy parameter estimation, we propose an enhanced evolutionary computing algorithm named Hierarchical Adaptive Genetic Algorithm (HAGA). The proposed HAGA model was applied to augment T–S fuzzy controller that in conjunction with Fuzzy Clustering Mean (FCM) has enabled optimal rule generation and control parameter estimation. The proposed HAGA model exploits Hierarchical concept-based AGA implementation that itself embodies novelties like adaptive crossover and mutation probability, to enable accurate, swift, and efficient control function by T–S Fuzzy controller. These novelties strengthen the proposed HAGA-TS fuzzy controller to exhibit time efficient and accurate control function that could be of utmost significance for non-linear process control. The proposed controller design is examined for its efficacy over automotive or vehicle data containing fuel injection rate, throttle angle, emission products etc., where considering current emission and/or torque requirements, the throttle angle is varied to achieve environmentally friendly and cost-efficient vehicle design. The simulation results revealed that the proposed HAGA TS-fuzzy controller outperforms other state of art evolutionary computing-based approaches such as GA, PSO based T–S fuzzy controller.},

Calculating the centroids of GT2 FSs is an important block for theoretical research of GT2 FLSs. Noniterative algorithms can overcome the disadvantages of being computationally intensive and time consuming. The paper discovers the relations between discrete types of noniterative algorithms and continuous types of noniterative algorithms. In terms of the Newton–Cotes quadrature formulas, three types of weighted-based noniterative algorithms are proposed to compute the centroids. In case of choosing the same sampling rate of primary variable, four computer simulation instances illustrate that, the proposed weighted-based noniterative algorithms have higher calculation accuracies and faster convergence speeds in contrast to the original noniterative algorithms.},

Fuzzy logic systems and disturbance observers are used to deal with unknown nonlinear functions and external disturbances, respectively. By using the second-order tracking differentiators, the containment control scheme is developed to guarantee that all followers converge to the dynamic convex hull formed by the leaders, and containment errors can converge to the boundary with prescribed performance. It is theoretically shown that all the signals of the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly bounded.

Firstly, all basic theories of PLZNs are shown, where the possibility degree of PLZNs is defined. Then, an integration model based on evidential reasoning theory is constructed to aggregate numerous PLZNs, which fully considers the incomplete probability distributions in PLZNs. The mathematical programming model with the generalized Shapley function is introduced to determinate the important degrees of attributes and reflect the interactive characteristics among them. In addition, the probabilistic linguistic Z QUALIFLEX (PLZ-QUALIFLEX) method with the generalized Shapley function is proposed to rank small numbers of alternatives with respect to large numbers of attributes with heterogeneous relationships.

For a given inconsistent PLPR, we first propose an optimization model to obtain a complete consistent PLPR. And then we use the proposed consistency adjustment algorithm to get a PLPR with acceptable consistency. Subsequently, we develop a transformation function that can transform PLPRs into multiplicative preference relations (MPRs). Furthermore, we put forward an improved multiplicative DEA model to obtain the priority vector of MPR, and the reliable ranking order of all alternatives is determined.

To solve this problem, a quantum-like probabilistic linguistic term decision-making framework is proposed, in which the quantum state, quantum data processing, and quantum interference effect are analyzed in detail. The decision-making beliefs of decision-makers are in a superposition state and their subjective relationships are depicted in the interference term. A multi-attribute decision-making method in this framework is then proposed for practical applications. Then the applications for sea-battlefield situation assessment are presented as the illustration and validation. A comparative analysis is also provided to depict the advantages of the proposed method, based on which appropriate conclusions and remarks are drawn.},

  abstract     = {Compensatory Fuzzy Logic is a transdisciplinary axiomatic theory, different from the Classical Norm and Conorm approach to improving interpretability by natural language. Archimedean Compensatory Fuzzy Logic (ACFL), introduced recently, uses different properties and interpretations of involved truth values. Membership functions involved are not studied explicitly in fuzzy theories, even though it is essential in solving problems. The definition of parameterized families of membership functions is not rare in fuzzy literature. However, according to our review, each of those families has the same shape except the recently introduced Continuous Linguistic Variables. That has been a limitation in the expressiveness of linguistic values. Besides, except for Dombi’s theory, these functions are often not related to logical operators. This paper aims to use ACFL to overcome each of these drawbacks. We generalize some fuzzy concepts, only using the ACFL generator function. A Generalized Sigmoidal Function and a Generalized Linguistic Modifier are s-shaped functions generated by it. Those elements define a parameterized family containing different shape functions like an increasing sigmoidal, decreasing sigmoidal and convex function; we call it a Generalized Continuous Linguistic Variable. This paper improves ACFL by unifying it into single theory elements like logic generator functions, linguistic modifiers, membership functions, and linguistic variables. The improved ACFL is not just a Pluralist Logic that makes compatible the classical approach of Norm and Conorm with CFL theory, but a contextual pluralist logic able to select a logic that better expresses specific contextual knowledge. This theory is valuable in Knowledge Discovery; because it creates new searching elements that allow selecting the `best logic´ for a particular dataset. We develop knowledge discovery cases for different databases to illustrate it and show its data sensitivity.},

The IoE industry decision making is all important for enterprises or countries to heighten the efficacy of leadership, which can tremendously expedite the large-scale development and industrialization. When considering the IoE companies’ assessment in the IoE industry, the fundamental issue involves enormous indeterminacy. Hesitant fuzzy soft set (HFSS), portrayed by the parameterized form of multiple membership degree, is a more useful pattern for seizing indeterminacy. In this paper, the objective weight is determined by CRITIC (Criteria Importance Through Inter-criteria Correlation) approach while the integrated weight is calculated by synchronously revealing subjective weight and objective weight. Then, hesitant fuzzy soft decision-making approach based on CoCoSo (Combined Compromise Solution) is introduced for solving the low discrimination issue, counterintuitive phenomena, and parameter type requirements. Finally, the availability of algorithm is verified by IoE companies’ evaluation issue, along with their sensitivity analysis.},

  abstract     = {The aggregation of fuzzy information is a key process of MCDM methods used to deal with uncertainties. A class of aggregation methods for fuzzy information is fuzzy distance aggregation operators in which distance values are argument variables. This class of aggregation operators permits us to consider an ideal alternative in the aggregation process. But these operators fall in dealing with situations among which distance values cannot be aggregated directly. Therefore, we proposed some distance induced fuzzy operators in which distance values are order-inducing variables so that we can also consider an ideal alternative but take other parameters, also including distance values, as argument variables in an aggregation process. We analyzed the concepts, properties, and generalized forms of proposed distance induced fuzzy operators in this paper. Moreover, aiming at multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM), three frameworks of MCGDM methods with the proposed distance induced fuzzy operators are constructed for three different MCGDM situations, respectively. At the end of this paper, an example is used to explain the detailed processes of using the proposed frameworks to make a decision.},

  abstract     = {Oil spills on the ground cause significant damage to the geological environment, including groundwater, contaminating it and making it uninhabitable. Therefore, it is necessary to predict the scale of the oil spill and the consequences of contamination of the geological environment to minimize the damage. In the literature, there are plenty of approaches for oil spill prediction on the water. However, there is a lack of approaches for predicting oil spills in the geological environment. This paper proposes a new fuzzy model for predicting oil spills on the ground. It uses fuzzy set theory to express the uncertainty of the spilled oil volume and the specific oil capacity to make predictions more efficient and effective. It consists of the following parts: formulating a hypothesis based on initial oil spill data, fuzzy modelling of oil spill penetration, evaluating the hypothesis of whether the spilled oil will penetrate the ground layer and groundwater and finally evaluating the effectiveness of the proposition. The accuracy and reliability of the proposed model were assessed using synthetic data of oil spill penetrations into the ground and predictions of nine experts. The obtained experimental results show that the proposed fuzzy model is valid and does not contradict reality. Furthermore, statistical parameter (MAE and RMSE) shows that the proposed fuzzy model can predict the geological oil spill consequences with sufficient accuracy. It is practical and contributes to the body of knowledge in predicting geological oil spills. In addition, it will assist the practitioner in making decisions about how to respond to an oil spill.},

  abstract     = {Probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS), an efficient tool to describe decision information, can sufficiently express decision makers’ hesitation and preference. Probabilistic linguistic preference relation (PLPR) is based on PLTSs to describe the preference information of experts for paired alternatives. However, in practice, due to the complexity of the problem, the incompleteness of information and the lack of professional knowledge, the incomplete PLPR (InPLPR) with missing information often appears. Therefore, this paper proposes a decision-making method under InPLPR. Firstly, in order to fully consider the specific situation of missing values, missing linguistic term-InPLTS (MLT-InPLTS) is subdivided into missing single linguistic term-InPLTS (MSLT-InPLTS) and missing multiple linguistic terms-InPLTS (MMLT-InPLTS). Then, a two-stage mathematical optimization model of missing information estimation based on additive consistency, fuzzy entropy and hesitation entropy is established. Subsequently, aiming at the unacceptable consistency of complete PLPR (CPLPR) after filling in the missing values, a consistency improvement method based on the idea of gradient descent is proposed. Afterward, probabilistic linguistic weighted averaging (PLWA) operator is used to rank alternatives. Finally, medical supplier selection is taken as an example to verify the effectiveness of the proposed decision-making method, and the robustness and advantages of this method are illustrated by sensitivity analysis and comparison with other methods.},

In previous work, swarm control, which can change the distance between agents when swarm moves, is discussed. However, in practical applications, the high-order states of agents are not easy to be measured, and the unknown nonlinear dynamics in the system are also not conducive to the efficient and reliable operation of the system. To solve the problem that the high-order states of agents are not available when designing the controller, a high-gain state observer is designed to estimate those unmeasurable states. And to overcome the negative impact of unknown nonlinear dynamics on system performance, the fuzzy logic system is introduced to approximate the unknown nonlinear dynamics. Based on the sliding mode control theory, we design a distributed fuzzy adaptive swarm controller. And the stability of the proposed controller is proved. Finally, the self-organized system based on mecanum wheeled omnidirectional vehicles is taken as an example for numerical simulation, and the simulation results show that the proposed fuzzy adaptive swarm control law is effective.},

  abstract     = {A certain flexibility of decision makers (DMs) is usually requisite for reaching the consensus in group decision making (GDM). When the judgments of DMs are expressed as fuzzy-valued quantities, the required flexibility has been shown. In this paper, we report a quantification approach to flexibility degrees (FDs) of fuzzy numbers and a consensus model in GDM with fuzzy-valued judgments. First, an axiomatic definition of FDs is proposed for fuzzy numbers. Based on a bounded positive scale, the novel formulae are constructed for quantifying the FDs of interval numbers, triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs), and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (TPFNs), respectively. The effects of the prototypical values of TFNs and TPFNs on the FDs are addressed. Second, by considering confidence levels and multiplicative reciprocity, the FD of triangular fuzzy multiplicative reciprocal preference relations (TFMRPRs) is calculated. A flexibility-degree-driven operator is provided to aggregate individual TFMRPRs. Third, the consensus degree of DMs is defined and a nonlinear optimization model is constructed to achieve the largest consensus degree. A new algorithm for the consensus model in GDM is elaborated on and the case study is made to illustrate the proposed method. Finally, the sensitivity of the centroid of TFNs on the final solution of a GDM problem is analyzed by numerical examples. The observations reveal that the position of the centroid plays a great role on the FD of TFNs.},

Specifically, MWCNTs exhibit excellent thermophysical properties to effectively remove the heat generated by cutting and reduce the friction coefficient, and MoS2 has excellent lubricating properties to generate film layers with high wear resistance to protect the workpiece and avoid plowing. The parameters of multiple performance characteristics were optimized through applications of the Taguchi robust design method, grey relational analysis, and a fuzzy inference system. The control parameters comprised nozzle angle, distance of the nozzle, type of nanoparticle, fraction of the nanofluid, value of atomization, tangential velocity, table rate, and air pressure. Subsequently, the optimized result was compared with basefluid/ultrasonic atomization MQL and nanofluid MQL. The results revealed that nanofluid/ultrasonic atomization MQL yields the optimal grinding force ratio, grinding temperature, and surface roughness.},

  abstract     = {The warning of membrane fouling is of great important to maintain the stable operation of membrane bioreactor (MBR). However, traditional methods are so error-prone that probably do not acquire reliable solutions of membrane fouling due to its uncertainties. To overcome this problem, an intelligent warning method is proposed to monitor the status of MBR in this paper. The main advantages in this paper are as follows. First, an identification method, based on robust deep neural network (RDNN), is developed to diagnose the different types of membrane fouling. Second, a decision-making method, based on the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), is designed to distinguish the operational suggestion. Third, an intelligent warning system, based on the above two methods and some sensors, is developed to mitigate the membrane fouling in real wastewater treatment plants. Finally, the simulation and experimental results demonstrate the proposed warning method can obtain the higher identification accuracy of membrane fouling than other methods.},

An auxiliary system is introduced to counteract the influence of input saturation, and a novel stability criterion is used to achieve practical finite-time stable in mean square.

In order to reduce the influence of actuator faults on system stability and performance, a fault-tolerant feedback controller is designed. Based on Lyapunov function approach and Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy technique, some sufficient conditions are obtained, which can ensure the exponentially stable and $${H_\infty }$$ performance of the closed-loop system. In addition, the fault-tolerant slow state variables feedback (SSVF) controller is obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

Nominal dynamics of the controlled piezoelectric actuators are described by adopting Takagi and Sugeno fuzzy models initially. Via interpolating Takagi and Sugeno local fuzzy model, a robust fuzzy-based controller is developed to eliminate hysteresis, modeling uncertainties and external disturbances. Meanwhile, the tracking error is expected to be reduced as small as possible with respect to all bounded desired trajectories. This proposed fuzzy-based controller has an easy to implement control structure. The trajectory tracking design problem of piezoelectric actuators of this study is transferred to a linear matrix inequality problem, and based on the convex optimization technique, the solution of the trajectory tracking design problem of piezoelectric actuators can be solved efficiently. From the simulation results, it is obvious that this proposed fuzzy-based control design possesses robustness property and can converge tracking errors to zero in micrometer level.},

  abstract     = {The close combination of internet technology and traditional industrial control system (ICS) is a double-edged sword, which not only improves the accuracy of the control system, but also brings great danger. According to the statistics of the authoritative industrial security incident information database, Repository of Industrial Security Incidents (RISI), as of October 2011, there have been more than 200 attacks on industrial control systems around the world. It is obviously a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem to select the appropriate industrial control system security supplier (ICSSS) for ensuring the safety of ICS. In this paper, the traditional TODIM method is improved and reconstructed in the probabilistic linguistic environment by incorporating the prospect theory (PT) which has received close attention recently. In this new model, the entropy weight method is used to obtain the attribute weight under complete information. And based on the ideas of PT as well as traditional TODIM method, the distortion of decision results caused by the risk attitude and psychological state of decision makers is corrected as far as possible. In my opinion, probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS) ensures that the model can better cope with the real environment and the complexity and ambiguity of decision makers’ thinking. Finally, the successful application of this new probabilistic linguistic TODIM method based on PT (PT-PL-TODIM method) in the selection of ICSSS proves that the model is practical and is also of great value to the decision-making research related to ICS. Moreover, the comparative analysis between the proposed model and the existing model effectively confirms the reliability of the proposed method. In the future, it is hoped that this method can be successfully applied to more decision-making fields.},

  abstract     = {Permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) is one of the most viable motion control products due to the inherent benefits of low rotor inertia, high efficiency and high-power density in industrial applications. The speed control for PMSM is a significant task. Many researchers carried out their research for improving performance of PMSM through speed control. But, the performance and efficiency of PMSM are reduced due to the external load disturbances and parameter deviation like nonlinear, time-varying, strong coupling of PMSM. In order to address these problems, Particle Swarm Maxpooling Fully Connective Deep Convolutional Neural Learnt Sugeno-Takagi Fuzzy Controller (PSMFCDCNLSTFC) model is introduced. The key objective of PSMFCDCNLSTFC model is to regulate the speed of PMSM for obtaining the highest current value. PSMFCDCNLSTFC model comprises two processes, namely Particle Swarm Weight and Hidden Neuron Optimization process and Maxpooling Fully Connective Deep Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network-based Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Controller process. In the former process, weight parameters and number of hidden neurons are optimized to design efficient deep convolutional neural network. In the latter process, four layers are used to regulate the speed of PMSM through Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Controller. After that, the soft sign activation function is used to find the minimum mean square error for attaining the rated current value of PMSM. Finally, the performance of PMSM gets improved. The performance of PSMFCDCNLSTFC model is performed with PMSM data and measured in terms of rise time, peak time, peak value, peak overshoot and settling time. The simulation results show that the PSMFCDCNLSTFC model increases the performance of PMSM with higher output current value when compared to state-of-the-art works.},

This paper develops an emergency group decision-making method to help decision-makers choose the optimal emergency plan under probabilistic hesitant fuzzy environment. In the beginning, we offer a novel concept called probabilistic hesitant fuzzy cumulative residual entropy (PHFCRE) to measure the degree of uncertainty for probabilistic hesitant fuzzy elements (PHFEs). Then, incomplete probabilities for PHFEs are obtained by integrating the PHFCRE with the principle of maximum entropy. In addition, an enhanced weight determination method based on PHFCRE is proposed to obtain the attribute weights. Besides, to rank the alternatives, an enhanced satisfaction degree function based on PHFCRE is proposed. Finally, a real case concerning the snowstorm disaster is provided, and some comparison analyses are conducted to study the reasonability and practicality of the proposed method.},

A serial-parallel estimation model of PMSM is established. The prediction error between PMSM and the serial-parallel estimation model is utilized to construct the adaptive law of FLSs, which can improve the approximate accuracy of FLSs. Moreover, by introducing a new fuzzy adaptive law, the algebraic loop problem in the existing backstepping based control approaches is overcome. It is proven that all signals of closed-loop systems are uniformly ultimately bounded, and the position tracking error can converge to a small neighborhood of the origin in finite time. Finally, the simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control approach, and some comparisons are given to show the rapid and accurate position tracking performance.},

More precisely, the sliding mode control (SMC) approach is employed to develop an observer-based (SMC) strategy for this class of models with the assumption that the sub-model-input matrices can be different. First, an observer is designed to reconstruct the unmeasured states, and a novel integral sliding function, which involves a non-linear term to compensate the matched uncertainty, is formulated. Based on an appropriate fuzzy Lyapunov function, sufficient conditions are established in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI) to ensure the robust admissibility of the closed-loop system with a satisfactory mixed $$H_\infty $$ /passivity performance and determine the sliding function parameters. Then, an adaptive observer-based SMC law is synthesized to adaptively ensure the reachability of the sliding surface and completely compensate for the influence of the previously mentioned factors. Finally, the efficiency of the theoretical findings is shown by the implementation of the proposed reliable SMC controller for practical systems about the pendulum and truck-trailer.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the adaptive fuzzy control issue for a category of stochastic nonlinear multi-agent systems with input hysteresis and saturations in non-affine form. Fuzzy logic systems are employed to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions. By introducing a Nussbaum function, the unknown gain problem caused by input hysteresis and saturation hybrid term can be solved effectively. Based on the backstepping scheme, dynamic surface control approach, and by introducing performance function, an adaptive fuzzy consensus controller is constructed to guarantee that the synchronize error converges to a prescribed performance. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, it is testified that all the closed-loop system variables are uniformly ultimately bounded in probability; meanwhile, the followers’ outputs ultimately synchronize for the leader with bounded tracking errors. Finally, two examples are presented to verify the availability of the presented method.},

  abstract     = {T-spherical fuzzy set (T-SFS) is suitable for the situation where human opinions are not limited to yes or no, but include abstinence and refusal, and can be viewed as a generalization of fuzzy set (FS), intuitionistic FS and picture FS. Normal fuzzy number (NFN) is a useful tool to character phenomenon with normal distribution. Based on the advantages of T-SFS and NFN, we first propose the normal T-spherical fuzzy numbers (NT-SFNs) which can depict both normal distribution phenomenon and neutral information with a considerably large expression domain. Then, we define the operational laws, score function, accuracy function, expectation as well as distance measure of NT-SFNs. To deal with multiple-attribute decision-making (MADM) problems with NT-SFNs and unknown weights of attributes, we use the best worst method (BWM) to obtain the subjective weights, the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation (CRITIC) method to obtain the objective weights, and the minimum total deviation method to calculate the combination weights of attributes. Then, the Taxonomy method is used to rank the alternatives and the normal T-spherical fuzzy Taxonomy (NTSF-Taxonomy) method is proposed. Finally, two numerical examples and comparative analysis are conducted to verify the validity of the NTSF-Taxonomy method.},

  abstract     = {Electrically stimulated lower limb systems contain higher order nonlinearities and uncertainties in their physical parameters. Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy models are used to model nonlinear systems. Techniques such as parallel distributed compensation (PDC) are dependent on the membership functions that constitute the TS fuzzy model. When the exact representation approach is used to electrical stimulation applications, the system’s performance under PDC control can be deteriorated, because the membership functions may be uncertain, besides a high computational cost be required to compute them. In this paper, we propose a robust switched control subject to actuator saturation and fault (RSwASF) that effectively handles system uncertainties and nonidealities, such as fatigue, spasms, tremor, and muscle recruitment. Control techniques based on TS fuzzy modeling (PDC and robust PDC), as well as other approaches, such as sliding-mode control, backstepping, super-twisting, gain-scheduling, and proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control were compared to RSwASF through the root-mean-squared error (RMSE). The results indicate that RSwASF minimizes the influence of the parametric uncertainties and presents the lowest RMSE for healthy and paraplegic individuals.},

Sometimes, the supplier may offer the retailer to pay the entire amount or the fraction of acquiring cost in advance as equal number of payments. The present research discusses the EOQ model with substandard products under fuzzy situation. This model deals with the advance payment on acquiring cost, products with substandard quality, and misclassification errors under repair option without scarcity by providing two models. The first model hypothesizes a remittance situation where the advance payment should be paid before the cycle time with some rate of interest which incurred by the supplier while the second model scrutinizes a situation where the prepayment occurs during the time length of the prior cycle which leads the supplier who would offer some price rebate on prepaid quantities. The proportion of improper items and the two kinds of screening errors are considered as the pentagonal fuzzy numbers [PFNs]. A fuzzy EOQ is framed for analyzing the sample, which can obtain the optimal solution. The impact of fuzziness on fraction of substandard products and investigation errors are illustrated for two models with appropriate examples.},

Accordingly, the virus has substantially threatened the Malaysians’ public health and contributed considerably to increased healthcare expenses. Since the novel coronavirus was found in China, Malaysia’s government has started its actions according to the World Health Organization procedures and concentrated on addressing and preventing the spread of the infection. The present paper aims to find and evaluate the factors to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak in Malaysia, limiting the outspread of the disease in this country. This study used the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Fuzzy Rule-Based techniques to evaluate the factors through a set of questionnaires completed by the health care professionals. According to the data analysis results, movement control order, international travel restrictions, and the mass gathering cancellations were of most importance in the prevention of COVID-19 infections transmission.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes an efficient estimator and uses it to estimate the health of a lithium-ion battery and a supercapacitor in the hybrid energy storage system (HESS). A new type of online health estimator that uses a fuzzy brain emotional learning neural network (FBELNN) is proposed. This neural network is different to a conventional brain emotional learning neural network where the fuzzy inference system and a new reward signal are used. The effect capacity fading on the output of energy storage components is also determined. The proposed method uses a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and principal component analysis (PCA) to extract features from the response signal for the impulse load. The DWT-PCA can reduce the workload for feature extraction. The parameter adaptation laws and convergence analysis for the FBELNN are derived and the internal parameters for the FBELNN are optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA). A neural network estimates the capacity of a supercapacitor and lithium-ion battery in real-time to better ensure the safety of HESS. The sample set is collected from the voltage response signal in the HESS simulation platform and practical experimental platform. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method has a faster learning speed and is more accurate than other methods.},

Third, by employing Lyapunov theory, a sufficient condition is derived to guarantee the asymptotic stabilization of the closed-loop system, and the control gain and observer gain matrices are obtained via linear matrix inequalities approach.
