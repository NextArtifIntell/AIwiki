  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider conditional selective inference (SI) for a linear model estimated after outliers are removed from the data. To apply the conditional SI framework, it is necessary to characterize the events of how the robust method identifies outliers. Unfortunately, the existing conditional SIs cannot be directly applied to our problem because they are applicable to the case where the selection events can be represented by linear or quadratic constraints. We propose a conditional SI method for popular robust regressions such as least-absolute-deviation regression and Huber regression by introducing a new computational method using a convex optimization technique called homotopy method. We show that the proposed conditional SI method is applicable to a wide class of robust regression and outlier detection methods and has good empirical performance on both synthetic data and real data experiments.},

We derive sufficient conditions which imply asymptotic equivalence of the two models. We verify these conditions for the special cases of Sobolev ellipsoids and Hölder classes with smoothness index $$&gt;1/2$$ under mild assumptions on the Gauss–Markov process. To give a counterexample, we show that asymptotic equivalence fails to hold for the special case of Brownian bridge.

Inference with this model is typically done based on asymptotic theory, assuming that the number of clusters tends to infinity with the sample size. However, when the number of clusters is fixed, classical asymptotic theory developed under a divergent number of clusters is no longer valid and can lead to erroneous conclusions. In this paper, we establish the asymptotic properties of the ML estimators of random-effects parameters under a general setting, which can be applied to conduct valid statistical inference with fixed numbers of clusters. Our asymptotic theorems allow both fixed effects and random effects to be misspecified, and the dimensions of both effects to go to infinity with the sample size.},

This proves that in image classification, it is possible to circumvent the curse of dimensionality by convolutional neural networks. Furthermore, the obtained result gives an indication why convolutional neural networks are able to outperform the standard feedforward neural networks in image classification.

When a new edge is created, with probability $$p\in (0,1)$$ , it follows the PA rule. Otherwise, this new edge is added between two uniformly chosen nodes. Such mixture makes the in- and out-degrees of a fixed node grow at a slower rate, compared to the pure PA case, thus leading to lighter distributional tails. For estimation and inference, we develop two numerical methods which are applied to both synthetic and real network data. We see that with extra flexibility given by the parameter p, the hybrid random network provides a better fit to real-world scenarios, where lighter tails from in- and out-degrees are observed.},

  abstract     = {In various applications of regression analysis, in addition to errors in the dependent observations also errors in the predictor variables play a substantial role and need to be incorporated in the statistical modeling process. In this paper we consider a nonparametric measurement error model of Berkson type with fixed design regressors and centered random errors, which is in contrast to much existing work in which the predictors are taken as random observations with random noise. Based on an estimator that takes the error in the predictor into account and on a suitable Gaussian approximation, we derive finite sample bounds on the coverage error of uniform confidence bands, where we circumvent the use of extreme-value theory and rather rely on recent results on anti-concentration of Gaussian processes. In a simulation study we investigate the performance of the uniform confidence sets for finite samples.},

In the presence of multiscale change points with both large jumps over short intervals and small jumps over long intervals, multiscale methods achieve good adaptivity but require a model selection step for removing false positives and duplicate estimators. We propose a localised application of the Schwarz criterion, which is applicable with any multiscale candidate generating procedure fulfilling mild assumptions, and establish its theoretical consistency in estimating the number and locations of multiple change points under general assumptions permitting heavy tails and dependence. In particular, combined with a MOSUM-based candidate generating procedure, it attains minimax rate optimality in both detection lower bound and localisation for i.i.d. sub-Gaussian errors. Overall competitiveness of the proposed methodology compared to existing methods is shown through its theoretical and numerical performance.},

We consider the Bayes factor route to variable selection, and develop a general asymptotic theory for the Gaussian process framework in the “large p, large n” settings even with $$p\gg n$$ , establishing almost sure exponential convergence of the Bayes factor under appropriately mild conditions. The fixed p setup is included as a special case. To illustrate, we apply our result to variable selection in linear regression, Gaussian process model with squared exponential covariance function accommodating the covariates, and a first-order autoregressive process with time-varying covariates. We also follow up our theoretical investigations with ample simulation experiments in the above regression contexts and variable selection in a real, riboflavin data consisting of 71 observations and 4088 covariates. For implementation of variable selection using Bayes factors, we develop a novel and effective general-purpose transdimensional, transformation-based Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, which has played a crucial role in simulated and real data applications.},

In such cases, an ideal model should be able to encourage the bi-level variable selection consistently. Bi-level variable selection has become even more challenging when data have heavy-tailed distribution or outliers exist in random errors and covariates. In this paper, we study a framework of high-dimensional M-estimation for bi-level variable selection. This framework encourages bi-level sparsity through a computationally efficient two-stage procedure. In theory, we provide sufficient conditions under which our two-stage penalized M-estimator possesses simultaneous local estimation consistency and the bi-level variable selection consistency if certain non-convex penalty functions are used at the group level. Both our simulation studies and real data analysis demonstrate satisfactory finite sample performance of the proposed estimators under different irregular settings.},

Under some conditions, it is proved that the model selection by the proposed method is consistent and the estimator for population parameter vector is consistent and asymptotically normal.

These solutions will then be minimizers under all loss functions simultaneously as long as the loss functions have the requested functional as the Bayes act. For the functional, the only requirement is that it can be defined via an identification function, with examples including the expectation, quantile, and expectile functionals. Generalizing classical results, we characterize the optimal solutions to the isotonic regression problem for identifiable functionals by rigorously treating these functionals as set-valued. The results hold in the case of totally or partially ordered explanatory variables. For total orders, we show that any solution resulting from the pool-adjacent-violators algorithm is optimal.},

To utilize the information from both populations, we model the positive components of the two mixture distributions via a semiparametric density ratio model. Under this model setup, we construct the maximum empirical likelihood estimators of the linear functionals. The asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators is established and is used to construct confidence regions and perform hypothesis tests for these functionals.

  abstract     = {Rank regression is a robust modeling tool; it is challenging to implement it for the distributed massive data owing to memory constraints. In practice, the massive data may be distributed heterogeneously from machine to machine; how to incorporate the heterogeneity is also an interesting issue. This paper proposes a distributed rank regression ( $$\mathrm {DR}^{2}$$ ), which can be implemented in the master machine by solving a weighted least-squares and adaptive when the data are heterogeneous. Theoretically, we prove that the resulting estimator is statistically as efficient as the global rank regression estimator. Furthermore, based on the adaptive LASSO and a newly defined distributed BIC-type tuning parameter selector, we propose a distributed regularized rank regression ( $$\mathrm {DR}^{3}$$ ), which can make consistent variable selection and can also be easily implemented by using the LARS algorithm on the master machine. Simulation results and real data analysis are included to validate our method.},

In this article, we develop a surrogate-variable-based model-free feature screening approach for the censored data under the general censoring mechanism, where the censoring variable may depend on the survival variable and the covariates. This approach is developed by finding some observable variables whose active covariates contain the active covariates of the survival variable as a subset, respectively. Then, any existing model-free feature screening method with the sure screening property for full data can be applied to estimating the sets of the active covariates of the observable variables and hence the set of the active covariates of the survival variable. The sure screening property of the proposed approach is established, and its finite sample performances are demonstrated through some simulations. Further, we illustrate the proposed approach by analyzing two real datasets.},

The aim of this paper is twofold: to study in detail the use of local polynomial fitting in the context of expectile regression and to contribute to the important issue of bandwidth selection, from theoretical and practical points of view. We discuss local polynomial expectile regression estimators and establish an asymptotic normality result for them. The finite-sample performance of the estimators, combined with various bandwidth selectors, is investigated in a simulation study. Some illustrations with real data examples are given.},

Our goal is to identify relevant main effects and corresponding interactions associated with the response variable. Heredity is a natural assumption in many statistical models involving two-way or higher-order interactions. Inspired by this, we propose an adaptive group Lasso method for the multiple functional linear model that adaptively selects important single functional predictors and pairwise interactions while obeying the strong heredity constraint. The proposed method is based on the functional principal components analysis with two adaptive group penalties, one for main effects and one for interaction effects. With appropriate selection of the tuning parameters, the rates of convergence of the proposed estimators and the consistency of the variable selection procedure are established. Simulation studies demonstrate the performance of the proposed procedure and a real example is analyzed to illustrate its practical usage.},

The Schweder–Spjøtvoll estimator $${\hat{\pi }}_0$$ utilizes marginal p-values and relies on the assumption that p-values corresponding to true nulls are uniformly distributed on [0, 1]. In the case of composite null hypotheses, marginal p-values are usually computed under least favorable parameter configurations (LFCs). Thus, they are stochastically larger than uniform under non-LFCs in the null hypotheses. When using these LFC-based p-values, $${\hat{\pi }}_0$$ tends to overestimate $$\pi _{0}$$ . We introduce a new way of randomizing p-values that depends on a tuning parameter $$c \in [0,1]$$ . For a certain value $$c = c^{\star }$$ , the resulting bias of $${\hat{\pi }}_0$$ is minimized. This often also entails a smaller mean squared error of the estimator as compared to the usage of LFC-based p-values.

In our context, the driving process is a Lévy process which allows flexible margins of the underlying model. The Lévy process is supposed to have finite second moments. Then, the classes of stationary solutions of linear state space models and of multivariate CARMA processes coincide. We prove that the Whittle estimator, which is based on the periodogram, is strongly consistent and asymptotically normal. A comparison with ARMA models shows that in the continuous-time setting the limit covariance matrix of the estimator has an additional term for non-Gaussian models. Thereby, we investigate the asymptotic normality of the integrated periodogram. Furthermore, for univariate processes we introduce an adjusted version of the Whittle estimator and derive its asymptotic properties. The practical applicability of our estimators is demonstrated through a simulation study.},

Their Gâteaux derivative, i.e., their influence curve linearizes the asymptotic bias of the estimator, but only up to a remainder term which is not guaranteed to tend (sufficiently fast) to zero uniformly on suitable tangent sets without profound arguments. We fill this gap by studying, in a unified framework, under which conditions the M-functionals corresponding to convex penalties as regularization are compactly differentiable, so that the estimators admit an asymptotically linear expansion. This key ingredient allows influence curves to reasonably enter model diagnosis and enable a fast, valid update formula, just requiring an evaluation of the corresponding influence curve at new data points. Moreover, this paves the way for optimally-robust estimators, bounding the influence curves in a suitable way.},

In this paper, we propose a full likelihood approach to meta-analysis by integrating the conditional likelihood and a marginal semi-parametric empirical likelihood under a Copas-like selection model. We show that the maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) of all the underlying parameters have a jointly normal limiting distribution, and the full likelihood ratio follows an asymptotic central chi-square distribution. Our simulation results indicate that compared with the conditional likelihood method, the proposed MLEs have smaller mean squared errors and the full likelihood ratio confidence intervals have more accurate coverage probabilities.

Because such data structures reflect the complicated impact of confounding variables, such as weather, demographic variables, life styles, and other cultural and environmental factors, they are usually too complicated to describe by parametric models. In this paper, we suggest a general modelling framework for estimating the mean and covariance functions of spatio-temporal data using a three-step local smoothing procedure.

  abstract     = {Wasserstein geometry and information geometry are two important structures to be introduced in a manifold of probability distributions. Wasserstein geometry is defined by using the transportation cost between two distributions, so it reflects the metric of the base manifold on which the distributions are defined. Information geometry is defined to be invariant under reversible transformations of the base space. Both have their own merits for applications. In this study, we analyze statistical inference based on the Wasserstein geometry in the case that the base space is one-dimensional. By using the location-scale model, we further derive the W-estimator that explicitly minimizes the transportation cost from the empirical distribution to a statistical model and study its asymptotic behaviors. We show that the W-estimator is consistent and explicitly give its asymptotic distribution by using the functional delta method. The W-estimator is Fisher efficient in the Gaussian case.},

  abstract     = {We provide finite sample properties of general regularized statistical criteria in the presence of pseudo-observations. Under the restricted strong convexity assumption of the unpenalized loss function and regularity conditions on the penalty, we derive non-asymptotic error bounds on the regularized M-estimator. This penalized framework with pseudo-observations is then applied to the M-estimation of some usual copula-based models. These theoretical results are supported by an empirical study.},
