A mixed regular-singular control formulation with a state constraint and regime switching is introduced. The decision-makers either harvest or renew with finite or infinite harvesting/renewing rates. The payoff functions depend on the harvesting/renewing rates. Several properties of the value function are established. The limiting value function as the white noise intensity approaches infinity is identified. The Markov chain approximation method is used to find numerical approximation of the value function and optimal strategies.},

  abstract     = {Currently, few approaches are available for mixed-integer nonlinear robust optimization. Those that do exist typically either require restrictive assumptions on the problem structure or do not guarantee robust protection. In this work, we develop an algorithm for convex mixed-integer nonlinear robust optimization problems where a key feature is that the method does not rely on a specific structure of the inner worst-case (adversarial) problem and allows the latter to be non-convex. A major challenge of such a general nonlinear setting is ensuring robust protection, as this calls for a global solution of the non-convex adversarial problem. Our method is able to achieve this up to a tolerance, by requiring worst-case evaluations only up to a certain precision. For example, the necessary assumptions can be met by approximating a non-convex adversarial via piecewise relaxations and solving the resulting problem up to any requested error as a mixed-integer linear problem. In our approach, we model a robust optimization problem as a nonsmooth mixed-integer nonlinear problem and tackle it by an outer approximation method that requires only inexact function values and subgradients. To deal with the arising nonlinear subproblems, we render an adaptive bundle method applicable to this setting and extend it to generate cutting planes, which are valid up to a known precision. Relying on its convergence to approximate critical points, we prove, as a consequence, finite convergence of the outer approximation algorithm. As an application, we study the gas transport problem under uncertainties in demand and physical parameters on realistic instances and provide computational results demonstrating the efficiency of our method.},

  abstract     = {The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a powerful splitting algorithm for linearly constrained convex optimization problems. In view of its popularity and applicability, a growing attention is drawn toward the ADMM in nonconvex settings. Recent studies of minimization problems for nonconvex functions include various combinations of assumptions on the objective function including, in particular, a Lipschitz gradient assumption. We consider the case where the objective is the sum of a strongly convex function and a weakly convex function. To this end, we present and study an adaptive version of the ADMM which incorporates generalized notions of convexity and penalty parameters adapted to the convexity constants of the functions. We prove convergence of the scheme under natural assumptions. To this end, we employ the recent adaptive Douglas–Rachford algorithm by revisiting the well-known duality relation between the classical ADMM and the Douglas–Rachford splitting algorithm, generalizing this connection to our setting. We illustrate our approach by relating and comparing to alternatives, and by numerical experiments on a signal denoising problem.},

This work is dedicated to investigating the convergence of Majorization-Minimization (MM) schemes when stochastic errors affect the gradient terms. We introduce a general stochastic optimization framework, called StochAstic suBspace majoRIzation-miNimization Algorithm SABRINA that encompasses MM quadratic schemes possibly enhanced with a subspace acceleration strategy. New asymptotical results are built for the stochastic process generated by SABRINA. Two sets of numerical experiments in the field of machine learning and image processing are presented to support our theoretical results and illustrate the good performance of SABRINA with respect to state-of-the-art gradient-based stochastic optimization methods.},

A collection of edge disjoint subgraphs $$(G_1,\ldots ,G_k)$$ of G is called a k-locally irregular decomposition of G if $$(E(G_1),\ldots ,E(G_k))$$ is an edge partition of G and each $$G_i$$ is locally irregular for $$i\in \{1,\ldots ,k\}$$ . The locally irregular chromatic index of G, denoted by $$\chi &#39;_{irr}(G)$$ , is the smallest integer k such that G can be decomposed into k locally irregular subgraphs. A graph G is said to be decomposable if $$\chi &#39;_{irr}(G)$$ is finite, otherwise, G is exceptional. The Local Irregularity Conjecture states that all connected graphs admit a 3-locally irregular decomposition except for odd paths, odd cycles, and a certain subclass of cacti. Recently, Sedlar and Škrekovski showed that there exists a graph G which is a cactus such that $$\chi &#39;_{irr}(G)=4$$ . In this paper, we mainly prove that if G is a decomposable cactus, then $$\chi &#39;_{irr}(G)\le 4$$ ; if G is a decomposable cactus without nontrivial cut edges, then $$\chi &#39;_{irr}(G)\le 3$$ . In addition, we show that in a decomposable subcubic graph G if each vertex of degree 3 lies on a triangle, then $$\chi &#39;_{irr}(G)\le 3$$ . By establishing algorithms, we obtain $$\chi &#39;_{irr}(K_n-C_\ell )\le 3$$ for $$3\le \ell \le n-1$$ .},

The literature has highlighted that, since side payments are not allowed, the design of such an agreement is very challenging. To address this issue, we introduce different notions for the temporal stability of an agreement and determine endogenously the duration of the agreement. We illustrate our general results with a linear-quadratic difference game and show that an agreement’s duration can be easily assessed using the problem data. We also study the effect of information structure on the endogenous duration of the agreement. We illustrate our results with a numerical example.},

  abstract     = {Since the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, some people who have dropped out of online game have become re-addicted to it due to the order of stay-at-home, making the phenomenon of online game addiction even worse. Controlling the prevalence of online game addiction is of great significance to protect people’s healthy life. For this purpose, a mathematical model of online game addiction with incomplete recovery and relapse is established. First, we analyze the basic properties of the model and obtain the expression of the basic reproduction number and all equilibria. By constructing suitable Lyapunov functions, the global asymptotical stability of the equilibria are proved. Then in the numerical simulation, we use the least squares estimation method to fit the real data of e-sports users in China from 2010 to 2020, and obtain the estimated value of all parameters. The approximation value of the basic reproduction number is obtained as $$R_{0}\approx 5.05$$ . The result reflects that the spread of game addiction in China is very serious. The stability of the equilibria are proved by using the estimated parameter values. Finally, the simulation results between with control and without control during 2020 to 2050 are compared, and the optimal control strategy is found by comparing the total infectious people. The results of optimal control suggest that if we increase our continuous attention to incompletely recovered people, we can prevent more people from becoming addicted to games. The findings in this paper reveal new mechanisms of game addiction transmission and demonstrate a more detailed and reliable control strategy.},

  abstract     = {The density matrix least squares problem arises from the quantum state tomography problem in experimental physics and has many applications in signal processing and machine learning, mainly including the phase recovery problem and the matrix completion problem. In this paper, we first reformulate the density matrix least squares problem as an equivalent convex optimization problem and then design an efficient semismooth Newton-based augmented Lagrangian (Ssnal) algorithm to solve the dual of its equivalent form, in which an inexact semismooth Newton (Ssn) algorithm with superlinear or even quadratic convergence is applied to solve the inner subproblems. Theoretically, the global convergence and locally asymptotically superlinear convergence of the Ssnal algorithm are established under very mild conditions. Computationally, the costs of the Ssn algorithm for solving the subproblem are significantly reduced by making full use of low-rank or high-rank property of optimal solutions of the density matrix least squares problem. In order to verify the performance of our algorithm, numerical experiments conducted on randomly generated quantum state tomography problems and density matrix least squares problems with real data demonstrate that the Ssnal algorithm is more effective and robust than the Qsdpnal solver and several state-of-the-art first-order algorithms.},

In this paper, we address the enhanced index tracking problem based on uncertainty theory where stock returns are treated as uncertain variables instead of random variables. First, we propose a nonlinear uncertain optimization model, i.e., uncertain mean-absolute downside deviation enhanced index tracking model. Then, we give the analytical solution of the proposed optimization model when stock returns take linear uncertainty distributions. Based on the solution, we find that tracking portfolio frontier is a continuous curve composed of at most $$n-1$$ different line segments. Furthermore, we give the condition that tracking portfolio return and risk increase with benchmark return and risk, respectively. Finally, we offer some experiments and show that our proposed model is effective in controlling the tracking error.},

The available convergence theory associated with these methods (mostly) requires the derivative of the smooth part of the objective function to be (globally) Lipschitz continuous, and this might be a restrictive assumption in some practically relevant scenarios. In this paper, we readdress this classical topic and provide convergence results for the classical (monotone) proximal gradient method and one of its nonmonotone extensions which are applicable in the absence of (strong) Lipschitz assumptions. This is possible since, for the price of forgoing convergence rates, we omit the use of descent-type lemmas in our analysis.},

If the feasible region is cube-shaped, the worst case occurs when the global optimum point is located at the vertex of a cube. In these cases, the sample size for the pure random search should be increased significantly because the success probability of the single trial is decreased. The proposed modification is based on the virtual extension of the feasible region. The extended region contains $$\varepsilon $$ -neighbourhoods of all points of the original region. All random points that fall outside the original feasible region are mapped to the nearest points on its boundary before the values of an objective function at these points are calculated. This extension of the feasible region also leads to an increase in the sample size due to the increased volume. We compare sample sizes required to hit into the neighbourhood of the global optimum point with a given probability for the proposed method and the original pure random search algorithm with a corrected sample size. We consider ball-shaped and cube-shaped feasible regions and find the sufficient conditions for the proposed algorithm to be more efficient. We offer a practical recommendation for cases, in which the feasible region is defined by a system of linear inequalities.},

From this result, a method with non-asymptotic convergence with high probability, as well as a method with asymptotic convergence to a Clarke stationary point almost surely are developed. Our results hold under the assumption that the stochastic loss function is a Carathéodory function which is almost everywhere Lipschitz continuous in the decision variables.

  abstract     = {For the problem to find an m-clique in an m-partite graph, staircase compatibility has recently been introduced as a polynomial-time solvable special case. It is a property of a graph together with an m-partition of the vertex set and total orders on each subset of the partition. In optimization problems involving m-cliques in m-partite graphs as a subproblem, it allows for totally unimodular linear programming formulations, which have shown to efficiently solve problems from different applications. In this work, we address questions concerning the recognizability of this property in the case where the m-partition of the graph is given, but suitable total orders are to be determined. While finding these total orders is NP-hard in general, we give several conditions under which it can be done in polynomial time. For bipartite graphs, we present a polynomial-time algorithm to recognize staircase compatibility and show that staircase total orders are unique up to a small set of reordering operations. On m-partite graphs, where the recognition problem is NP-complete in the general case, we identify a polynomially solvable subcase and also provide a corresponding algorithm to compute the total orders. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our ordering algorithm for m-partite graphs on a set of artificial instances as well as real-world instances from a railway timetabling application. It turns out that applying the ordering algorithm to the real-world instances and subsequently solving the problem via the aforementioned totally unimodular reformulations indeed outperforms a generic formulation which does not exploit staircase compatibility.},

We build from the euclidean norm piecewise linearization proposed by Camino et al. (Comput. Optim. Appl. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10589-019-00083-z , 2019) that allows to solve such nonconvex problems via mixed-integer linear programming with an arbitrary approximation guarantee. Theoretical results are established that prove that this linearization is able to satisfy any given approximation level with the minimum number of pieces. An extension of the piecewise linearization approach is proposed. It shares the same theoretical properties for elliptic constraints and/or objective. An application shows the practical appeal of the elliptic linearization on a nonconvex beam layout mixed optimization problem coming from an industrial application.},

In some situations, our conditions will imply also the existence of points where the value $$\psi (0)$$ is achieved. In convex optimization, it is known that zero duality gap is equivalent to the lower semicontinuity of $$\psi $$ at 0. Here, the dual problem is defined in terms of the linear Lagrangian. We recall that convexity of the closure of the set $$(f,g_1,\ldots ,g_m)({\mathbb {R}}^n)+{\mathbb {R}}_+^{1+m}$$ and lower semicontinuity of $$\psi $$ at 0 imply zero duality gap. In addition, our results provide much more information than those existing in the literature. Several examples showing the applicability of our approach and the non applicability of any other result elsewhere are exhibited. Furthermore, we identify a suitable large class of functions (quadratic linear fractional) to which f and $$g_i$$ could belong to and our results apply.},

The necessary and sufficient conditions are purely topological and, in the case of constrained greatest elements, are formulated by making use of a preorder relation on the set of all topologies that can be defined on the ground set of the objective relation. Observing that every function into a totally ordered set can be naturally conceived as a total preorder, we then reformulate the mentioned characterizations in the more restrictive case of an objective function with a totally ordered codomain. The reformulations are expressed in terms of upper semi- and pseudo-continuity by showing a topological connection between the two notions of generalized continuity.},

The novelties of the results are in both theoretical and application aspects.

Although chemotherapy is the most common method of cancer treatment, the drug-resistant nature of tumor cells and the toxic effect of chemotherapeutic drugs on normal cells are major threats to the success of chemotherapy. In this paper, we propose a multi-drug chemotherapy model combined with an optimal control approach in which the amount of drugs is taken as control functions. The underlying mathematical model discusses the evolution of a heterogeneous tumor population and the dynamics of normal cells under chemotherapy. The model incorporates the pharmacokinetics of the anticancer agents as well. The proposed optimal control approach ensures maximum decay of the tumor cells while preserving a sufficient level of normal cells that would help faster recovery.},

  abstract     = {We consider minimizing the sum of three convex functions, where the first one F is smooth, the second one is nonsmooth and proximable and the third one is the composition of a nonsmooth proximable function with a linear operator L. This template problem has many applications, for instance, in image processing and machine learning. First, we propose a new primal–dual algorithm, which we call PDDY, for this problem. It is constructed by applying Davis–Yin splitting to a monotone inclusion in a primal–dual product space, where the operators are monotone under a specific metric depending on L. We show that three existing algorithms (the two forms of the Condat–Vũ algorithm and the PD3O algorithm) have the same structure, so that PDDY is the fourth missing link in this self-consistent class of primal–dual algorithms. This representation eases the convergence analysis: it allows us to derive sublinear convergence rates in general, and linear convergence results in presence of strong convexity. Moreover, within our broad and flexible analysis framework, we propose new stochastic generalizations of the algorithms, in which a variance-reduced random estimate of the gradient of F is used, instead of the true gradient. Furthermore, we obtain, as a special case of PDDY, a linearly converging algorithm for the minimization of a strongly convex function F under a linear constraint; we discuss its important application to decentralized optimization.},

  abstract     = {In Andreani et al. (Weak notions of nondegeneracy in nonlinear semidefinite programming, 2020), the classical notion of nondegeneracy (or transversality) and Robinson’s constraint qualification have been revisited in the context of nonlinear semidefinite programming exploiting the structure of the problem, namely its eigendecomposition. This allows formulating the conditions equivalently in terms of (positive) linear independence of significantly smaller sets of vectors. In this paper, we extend these ideas to the context of nonlinear second-order cone programming. For instance, for an m-dimensional second-order cone, instead of stating nondegeneracy at the vertex as the linear independence of m derivative vectors, we do it in terms of several statements of linear independence of 2 derivative vectors. This allows embedding the structure of the second-order cone into the formulation of nondegeneracy and, by extension, Robinson’s constraint qualification as well. This point of view is shown to be crucial in defining significantly weaker constraint qualifications such as the constant rank constraint qualification and the constant positive linear dependence condition. Also, these conditions are shown to be sufficient for guaranteeing global convergence of several algorithms, while still implying metric subregularity and without requiring boundedness of the set of Lagrange multipliers.},

We prove probabilistic bounds on the out-of-sample loss and the estimation bias, and establish the grouping effect of our estimator, showing that coefficients in the same group converge to the same value as the sample correlation between covariates approaches 1. Based on this result, we propose to use the spectral clustering algorithm with the Gaussian similarity function to perform grouping on the predictors, which makes our approach applicable without knowing the grouping structure a priori. We compare our approach to an array of alternatives and provide extensive numerical results on both synthetic data and a real large dataset of surgery-related medical records, showing that our formulation produces an interpretable and parsimonious model that encourages sparsity at a group level and is able to achieve better prediction and estimation performance in the presence of outliers.},

We consider a broad class of generalized differentiable loss functions that can be non-convex and non-smooth, involving upward and downward cusps, and we develop an efficient stochastic subgradient method for distributionally robust problems with such functions. We prove that it converges to a point satisfying the optimality conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first method with rigorous convergence guarantees in the context of generalized differentiable non-convex and non-smooth distributionally robust stochastic optimization. Our method allows for the control of the desired level of robustness with little extra computational cost compared to population risk minimization with stochastic gradient methods.

The problem is modeled as a continuous two-stage game. In the first stage, the set of strategies for each sector consists of its possible conjectures about its influence on the prices. The second stage is the financial model’s equilibrium problem where, according to the conjectures selected in the first stage, each sector decides its portfolio composition.

To properly understand the impact of the two capital stocks, we consider six information structures which differ in whether a firm takes into account that their competitor’s strategy depends only on time or on one or both capital stocks. We find that if firms are aware that their own capital stock makes investments of the competitor more efficient, a firm would invest less. Due to this effect, information only pays off if it is taken into account by both competitors, because otherwise the less informed and therefore less cautious player invests more and has a higher capital stock and revenues in the long run.},

  abstract     = {This work studies solution methods for approximating a given tensor by a sum of R rank-1 tensors with one or more of the latent factors being orthonormal. Such a problem arises from applications such as image processing, joint singular value decomposition, and independent component analysis. Most existing algorithms are of the iterative type, while algorithms of the approximation type are limited. By exploring the multilinearity and orthogonality of the problem, we introduce an approximation algorithm in this work. Depending on the computation of several key subproblems, the proposed approximation algorithm can be either deterministic or randomized. The approximation lower bound is established, both in the deterministic and the expected senses. The approximation ratio depends on the size of the tensor, the number of rank-1 terms, and is independent of the problem data. When reduced to the rank-1 approximation case, the approximation bound coincides with those in the literature. Moreover, the presented results fill a gap left in Yang (SIAM J Matrix Anal Appl 41:1797–1825, 2020), where the approximation bound of that approximation algorithm was established when there is only one orthonormal factor. Numerical studies show the usefulness of the proposed algorithm.},

We investigate an adaptive scheme for PANOC-type methods (Stella et al. in Proceedings of the IEEE 56th CDC, 2017), namely accelerated linesearch algorithms requiring only the simple oracle of proximal gradient. While including the classical proximal gradient method, our theoretical results cover a broader class of algorithms and provide convergence guarantees for accelerated methods with possibly inexact computation of the proximal mapping.

  abstract     = {A mathematical model of cancer chemotherapy is considered as an optimal control problem with the objective of either minimizing a weighted sum of tumor cells and drug dosage or the terminal tumor volume. The control process is subject to three state constraints involving an upper bound on drug toxicity, a lower bound on the white blood cells (WBCs) population, and a constraint to prevent the WBCs count from staying too long below a fixed upper level. The state constraints are imposed for safeguarding the health of patients during treatment. The dynamics of the WBCs population involves delays due to the delay chain of granulocyte development. The control problem is based on a similar model presented in Iliadis and Barbolosi (Comput. Biomed. Res. 33(3):211–226, 2000). However, the authors do not treat necessary conditions which only recently have been presented in the literature. We introduce two variants of the control problem imposing different state constraints. For a basic control problem, we give a thorough discussion of the necessary optimality conditions. Discretization and nonlinear programming methods are employed to determine extremal solutions that precisely satisfy the necessary conditions. It is surprising that in both control problems the time-delayed solution agrees with the non-delayed solution except for the WBCs which are obtained as backward time shifts of the non-delayed WBCs. Since the control variable appears linearly in the Hamiltonian, we find that the control is a combination of bang-bang arcs and boundary arcs of the state constraints. The direct optimization of the switching times and junction times with the boundary defines a finite-dimensional optimization problem for which we can verify second-order sufficient conditions (SSC). To obtain a more practical protocol, we construct an approximative control with fewer control sub-arcs resulting in only a marginal increase in the cost function.},

The results just obtained are then applied to a general class of composed constrained vector optimization problems. For this class of problems, two concrete perturbation mappings are proposed. These perturbation mappings give rise to variants of dual problems including the Lagrange dual problem and several kinds of Fenchel–Lagrange dual problems of the problem under consideration. Stable strong duality results for these pairs of primal–dual problems are derived. Several classes of concrete vector (and scalar) optimization problems are also considered at the end of the paper to illustrate the significance of our approach.},

This method is motivated by the well-known iteratively regularized Landweber iteration method. We analyze the convergence of our novel method by assuming the conditional stability of the inverse problem on a convex and compact set. Further, we consider a nested family of convex and compact sets on which stability holds, and based on this family, we develop a multi-level algorithm with nearly optimal accuracy. To enhance the accuracy between neighboring levels, we couple the increase in accuracy with the growth of stability constants. This ensures that the algorithm terminates within a finite number of iterations after achieving a certain discrepancy criterion. Moreover, we discuss example of an ill-posed problem on which our both the methods are applicable and deduce various constants appearing in our work.},

We address a stochastic version of this problem where the follower’s profits are uncertain from the leader’s perspective, and only a probability distribution is known. Assuming that the leader aims at optimizing the expected value of her objective function, we first observe that the stochastic problem is tractable as long as the possible scenarios are given explicitly as part of the input, which also allows to deal with general distributions using a sample average approximation. For the case of independently and uniformly distributed item values, we show that the problem is #P-hard in general, and the same is true even for evaluating the leader’s objective function. Nevertheless, we present pseudo-polynomial time algorithms for this case, running in time linear in the total size of the items.

  abstract     = {This paper explores a new approach to reduce the maximum clique problem associated with permutation Hamming graphs to smaller clique problems. The vertices of a permutation Hamming graph are permutations of n integers and the edges connect pairs of vertices at a Hamming distance greater than or equal to a threshold d. The maximum clique problem for permutation Hamming graphs is a challenging task due to the size, density and regularity of the graphs. However, symmetry properties, which are still partly unexplored, can help to reduce the problems’ size and hardness. A property of edge transitivity with respect to automorphisms is proven and leads to a classification for cycle-equivalent edges. This property enables to reduce the full-size clique problem to a set of significantly smaller (and easier to solve) clique problems. The number of reduced problems can be expressed by means of the partition function of integer numbers. Computational experiments confirm that additional knowledge on the automorphism group leads to a more targeted and efficient solving method for the maximum clique problem associated with permutation Hamming graphs.},

It is worth emphasizing here that the class of minimal time functions can be interpreted as a general type of directional distance functions recently used to develop new applications in optimization theory. The obtained results are applied in two directions. First, we derive sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions to optimization-related problems without convexity. As an easy corollary, we get a directional Ekeland variational principle. Second, we propose a new type of global error bounds for inequalities which allows us to simultaneously study nonconvex and convex functions. Several examples and comparison remarks are included as well to explain advantages of our results with existing ones in the literature.},

The key method is the equivalence between optimal stopping problems on sMPs and a special class of semi-Markov decision processes (sMDPs). We first introduce the optimality equation and show the existence of the optimal policies of finite-horizon sMDPs with additional terminal costs. Based on the optimal stopping problems on sMPs, we give an explicit construction of sMDPs such that the optimal stopping times of sMPs are equivalent to the optimal policies of the constructed sMDPs. Then, using the results of sMDPs developed here, we not only prove the existence of the optimal stopping times of sMPs, but also provide an algorithm for computing the optimal stopping times of sMPs. Moreover, we show that the optimal and $$\varepsilon $$ -optimal stopping time can be characterized by the hitting time of some special sets.

To satisfy increasing demands and to handle more diverse transport situations, operators of energy networks regularly expand the capacity of their network by building new network elements, known as the expansion planning problem. A key constraint function in expansion planning problems is a nonlinear and nonconvex potential loss function. In order to improve the algorithmic performance of state-of-the-art MINLP solvers, this paper presents an algebraic description for the convex envelope of this function. Through a thorough computational study, we show that this tighter relaxation tremendously improves the performance of the MINLP solver SCIP on a large test set of practically relevant instances for the expansion planning problem. In particular, the results show that our achievements lead to an improvement of the solver performance for a development version by up to 58%.},

We apply this condition to generalize Prager’s theorem for Hadamard manifolds and generalize Sakai’s theorem for a larger class of the sequences with full measure with respect to Bernoulli measure. In particular, we answer to a long-standing open problem concerning the convergence of the successive projection method (Aleyner and Reich in J Convex Anal 16:633–640, 2009).

(J Optim Theory Appl 188:378–401, 2021), we showed that the quadratic growth condition plays a key role in obtaining Q-linear convergence of the widely used forward–backward splitting method with Beck–Teboulle’s line search. In this paper, we analyze the property of quadratic growth condition via second-order variational analysis for various structured optimization problems that arise in machine learning and signal processing. This includes, for example, the Poisson linear inverse problem as well as the $$\ell _1$$ -regularized optimization problems. As a by-product of this approach, we also obtain several full characterizations for the uniqueness of optimal solution to Lasso problem, which complements and extends recent important results in this direction.},

  abstract     = {We provide two closed-form geodesic formulas for a family of metrics on Stiefel manifolds recently introduced by Hüper, Markina and Silva Leite, reparameterized by two positive numbers, having both the embedded and canonical metrics as special cases. The closed-form formulas allow us to compute geodesics by matrix exponential in reduced dimension for low-rank Stiefel manifolds. We follow the approach of minimizing the square Frobenius distance between a geodesic ending point to a given point on the manifold to compute the logarithm map and geodesic distance between two endpoints, using Fréchet derivatives to compute the gradient of this objective function. We focus on two optimization methods, gradient descent and L-BFGS. This leads to a new framework to compute the geodesic distance for manifolds with known geodesic formula but no closed-form logarithm map. We show the approach works well for Stiefel as well as flag manifolds. The logarithm map could be used to compute the Riemannian center of mass for these manifolds equipped with the above metrics. The method to translate directional derivatives using Fréchet derivatives to a gradient could potentially be applied to other matrix equations.},

First, we consider three alternative methods for aggregating the players’ beliefs and assume that the players agree to adopt one of them if they decide to cooperate. Second, we determine the Nash bargaining outcomes for the whole duration of the game. Finally, to insure sustainability of cooperation throughout the whole duration of the game, we propose two time-consistent decompositions over nodes of each player’s cooperative share, namely a proportion-consistent and a node-consistent allocation schemes.

  abstract     = {This paper treats a distributed optimal control problem for a tumor growth model of Cahn–Hilliard type. The evolution of the tumor fraction is governed by a variational inequality corresponding to a double obstacle nonlinearity occurring in the associated potential. In addition, the control and state variables are nonlinearly coupled and, furthermore, the cost functional contains a nondifferentiable term like the $$L^1$$ -norm in order to include sparsity effects which is of utmost relevance, especially time sparsity, in the context of cancer therapies as applying a control to the system reflects in exposing the patient to an intensive medical treatment. To cope with the difficulties originating from the variational inequality in the state system, we employ the so-called deep quench approximation in which the convex part of the double obstacle potential is approximated by logarithmic functions. For such functions, first-order necessary conditions of optimality can be established by invoking recent results. We use these results to derive corresponding optimality conditions also for the double obstacle case, by deducing a variational inequality in terms of the associated adjoint state variables. The resulting variational inequality can be exploited to also obtain sparsity results for the optimal controls.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we focus on the linear functionals defining an approximate version of the gradient of a function. These functionals are often used when dealing with optimization problems where the computation of the gradient of the objective function is costly or the objective function values are affected by some noise. These functionals have been recently considered to estimate the gradient of the objective function by the expected value of the function variations in the space of directions. The expected value is then approximated by a sample average over a proper (random) choice of sample directions in the domain of integration. In this way, the approximation error is characterized by statistical properties of the sample average estimate, typically its variance. Therefore, while useful and attractive bounds for the error variance can be expressed in terms of the number of function evaluations, nothing can be said on the error of a single experiment that could be quite large. This work instead is aimed at deriving an approximation scheme for linear functionals approximating the gradient, whose error of approximation can be characterized by a deterministic point of view in the case of noise-free data. The previously mentioned linear functionals are no longer considered as expected values over the space of directions, but rather as the filtered derivative of the objective function by a Gaussian kernel. By using this new approach, a gradient estimation based on a suitable linear combination of central finite differences at different step sizes is proposed and deterministic bounds that do not depend on the particular sample of points considered are computed. In the noisy setting, on the other end, the variance of the estimation error of the proposed method is showed to be strictly lower than the one of the estimation error of the Central Finite Difference scheme. Numerical experiments on a set of test functions are encouraging, showing good performances compared to those of some methods commonly used in the literature, also in the noisy setting.},

Then, an existence theorem for (QVHVI) is established by using Kluge’s fixed point theorem for set-valued operators. As an application, an abstract optimal control problem for the (QVHVI) is investigated.

The corresponding dynamics brings into play three general time-varying parameters, each with specific properties, and which are, respectively, associated with viscous damping, extrapolation and temporal scaling. By appropriately adjusting these parameters, we develop a Lyapunov analysis which provides fast convergence properties of the values and of the feasibility gap. These results will naturally pave the way for developing corresponding accelerated ADMM algorithms, obtained by temporal discretization.},

When both diminishing stepsize and extrapolation stepsize are decaying as a power function, we obtain explicit iteration complexities. When diminishing stepsize is decaying as a power function and the extrapolation stepsize is decreasing not less than a power function, the diminishing stepsize provides a rate of convergence $${\mathcal {O}}\left( \tau ^{k^{s}}\right) (s \in (0,1))$$ to an optimal solution or to a ball of the optimal solution set, which is faster than $${\mathcal {O}}\left( {1}/{k^\beta }\right) $$ (for each $$\beta &gt;0$$ ). With geometrically decreasing extrapolation stepsize, we obtain a linear rate of convergence to a ball of the optimal solution set for the constant stepsize and dynamic stepsize. Our numerical testing shows that the performance with extrapolation is much more efficient than that without extrapolation in terms of the number of iterations needed for reaching an approximate optimal solution.},

  abstract     = {The features that characterize the onset of Huntington disease (HD) are poorly understood yet have significant implications for research and clinical practice. Motivated by the need to address this issue, and the fact that there may be inaccuracies in clinical HD data, we apply robust optimization and duality techniques to study support vector machine (SVM) classifiers in the face of uncertainty in feature data. We present readily numerically solvable semi-definite program reformulations via conic duality for a broad class of robust SVM classification problems under a general spectrahedron uncertainty set that covers the most commonly used uncertainty sets of robust optimization models, such as boxes, balls, and ellipsoids. In the case of the box-uncertainty model, we also provide a new simple quadratic program reformulation, via Lagrangian duality, leading to a very efficient iterative scheme for robust classifiers. Computational results on a range of datasets indicate that these robust classification methods allow for greater classification accuracies than conventional support vector machines in addition to selecting groups of highly correlated features. The conic duality-based robust SVMs were also successfully applied to a new, large HD dataset, achieving classification accuracies of over 95% and providing important information about the features that characterize HD onset.},

  abstract     = {The class of quaternion matrix optimization (QMO) problems, with quaternion matrices as decision variables, has been widely used in color image processing and other engineering areas in recent years. However, optimization theory for QMO is far from adequate. The main objective of this paper is to provide necessary theoretical foundations on optimality analysis, in order to enrich the contents of optimization theory and to pave way for the design of efficient numerical algorithms as well. We achieve this goal by conducting a thorough study on the first-order and second-order (sub)differentiation of real-valued functions in quaternion matrices, with a newly introduced operation called R-product as the key tool for our calculus. Combining with the classical optimization theory, we establish the first-order and the second-order optimality analysis for QMO. Particular treatments on convex functions, the $$\ell _0$$ -norm and the rank function in quaternion matrices are tailored for a sparse low rank QMO model, arising from color image denoising, to establish its optimality conditions via stationarity.},

Then, we prove the convergence of the proposed procedures when the matrices of the problem satisfy some assumptions of strict or irreducible diagonal dominance. In this context, for simplicity, we first analyze the convergence in the special case of VLCPs of dimension $$2n\times n$$ , and we then generalize the results to VLCPs of an arbitrary dimension $$\ell n\times n$$ . Finally, we provide several numerical experiments (involving both full and sparse matrices) that show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. In this context, our methods are compared with existing solution methods for VLCPs. A parallel implementation of the projected Jacobi method in CUDA is also presented and analyzed.},

A new sequential FLQP algorithm is introduced for computing a stationary point (SP) of a fractional quadratic program (FQP) on the simplex. Global convergence for this algorithm is established. This sequential algorithm is recommended for the solution of the symmetric eigenvalue complementarity problem (EiCP), as this problem is equivalent to the computation of an SP of an FQP on the simplex. Computational experience reported in this paper indicates that the implementation of Dinkelbach’s method for the FLQP and the sequential FLQP algorithm are quite efficient in practice. An extension of the sequential FLQP algorithm for solving the nonsymmetric EiCP is also introduced. Since this method solves a special variational inequality (VI) problem in each iteration, it can be considered as a sequential VI algorithm. Although the convergence of this algorithm has yet to be established, preliminary computational experience indicates that the sequential VI algorithm is quite a promising technique for the solution of the nonsymmetric EiCP.},

Previous results for this version required twice differentiability of the problem data, the linear independence constraint qualification, strict complementarity, and second-order sufficiency; or the linear independence constraint qualification and strong second-order sufficiency. We obtain a set of convergence properties under significantly weaker assumptions: once (not twice) differentiability of the problem data, uniqueness of the Lagrange multiplier, and second-order sufficiency (no linear independence constraint qualification and no strict complementarity); or even second-order sufficiency only. Another version to which the general framework applies is the smoothed augmented Lagrangian method, where the plus-function associated with penalization of inequality constraints is approximated by a family of smooth functions (so that the subproblems are twice differentiable if the problem data are). Furthermore, for all the modifications, inexact solution of subproblems is handled naturally. The presented framework also subsumes the basic augmented Lagrangian method, both exact and inexact.},

In the strongly convex case, these functions also have different condition numbers that eventually define the iteration complexity of first-order methods and the number of oracle calls required to achieve a given accuracy. Motivated by the desire to call more expensive oracles fewer times, we consider the problem of minimizing the sum of two functions and propose a generic algorithmic framework to separate oracle complexities for each function. The latter means that the oracle for each function is called the number of times that coincide with the oracle complexity for the case when the second function is absent. Our general accelerated framework covers the setting of (strongly) convex objectives, the setting when both parts are given through full coordinate oracle, as well as when one of them is given by coordinate derivative oracle or has the finite-sum structure and is available through stochastic gradient oracle. In the latter two cases, we obtain accelerated random coordinate descent and accelerated variance reduced methods with oracle complexity separation.},

It is well-known that there are many examples where the ordering cone of the image space has an empty (topological/algebraic) interior, for instance in optimal control, approximation theory, duality theory. Our aim is to consider Pareto-type solution concepts for such vector optimization problems based on the intrinsic core notion (a well-known generalized interiority notion). We propose a new Henig-type proper efficiency concept based on generalized dilating cones which are relatively solid (i.e., their intrinsic cores are nonempty). Using linear functionals from the dual cone of the ordering cone, we are able to characterize the sets of (weakly, properly) efficient solutions under certain generalized convexity assumptions. Toward this end, we employ separation theorems that are working in the considered setting.},

We investigate basic properties of MESOC including computation of its Lyapunov rank and proving its reducibility. Moreover, we show that in an ambient space, a cylinder is an isotonic projection set with respect to MESOC. We also examine a nonlinear complementarity problem on a cylinder, which is equivalent to a suitable mixed complementarity problem, and provide a computational example illustrating applicability of MESOC.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the competition of healthcare institutions for medical supplies in emergencies caused by natural disasters. In particular, we develop a two-stage procurement planning model in a random environment. We consider a pre-event policy, in which each healthcare institution seeks to minimize the purchasing cost of medical items and the transportation time from the first stage, and a recourse decision process to optimize the expected overall costs and the penalty for the prior plan, in response to each disaster scenario. Thus, each institution deals with a two-stage stochastic programming model that takes into account the unmet demand at the first stage, and the consequent penalty. Then, the institutions simultaneously solve their own stochastic optimization problems and reach a stable state governed by the stochastic Nash equilibrium concept. Moreover, we formulate the problem as a variational inequality; both the discrete and the general probability distribution cases are described. We also present an alternative formulation using infinite-dimensional duality tools. Finally, we discuss some numerical illustrations applying the progressive hedging algorithm.},

We propose a specific proximal linearized alternating direction method of multipliers in which the proximal parameter is generated dynamically, and we design an explicit and tractable backtracking procedure to generate it. We prove subsequent convergence of the method to a critical point of the problem, and global convergence when the problem’s data are semialgebraic. These results are obtained with no dependency on the explicit manner in which the proximal parameter is generated. As a byproduct of our analysis, we also obtain global convergence guarantees for the proximal gradient method with a dynamic proximal parameter under local Lipschitz continuity of the gradient of the smooth part of the nonlinear sum composite minimization model.},

We show that the overall algorithm has the same convergence properties as ALGENCAN and an asymptotic quadratic convergence rate under suitable assumptions. The numerical results confirm that the proposed algorithm is a viable alternative to ALGENCAN with greater robustness.},

Our new lower bound provides a computable expression for the exact modulus (as far as it only depends on the nominal data) in two important cases: when the feasible set has extreme points and when we deal with the Euclidean norm. In these two cases, we are able to compute or estimate the global Lipschitz modulus of the optimal value function in different perturbations frameworks.},

In this work, we define a monotone accelerated coordinate gradient descent-type method for problems consisting of minimizing $$f+g$$ , where f is quadratic and g is nonsmooth and non-separable and has a low-complexity proximal mapping. The algorithm is enabled by employing the forward–backward envelope, a composite envelope that possess an exact smooth reformulation of $$f+g$$ . We prove the algorithm achieves a convergence rate of $$O(1/k^{1.5})$$ in terms of the original objective function, improving current coordinate descent-type algorithms. In addition, we describe an adaptive variant of the algorithm that backtracks the spectral information and coordinate Lipschitz constants of the problem. We numerically examine our algorithms on various settings, including two-dimensional total-variation-based image inpainting problems, showing a clear advantage in performance over current coordinate descent-type methods.},

In this way, we derive necessary optimality conditions for nonconvex problems of the calculus of variations with velocity constraints under the weakest metric subregularity-type constraint qualification. The developed approach leads us to a short and simple proof of first-order necessary optimality conditions for such and related problems in broad spaces of functions including those of class $${{\mathcal {C}}}^k$$ as $$k\ge 1$$ .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, for a continuous function defined on a closed subset of a Banach space and differentiable on the interior of the domain, the infimum of the norm of the first derivative is estimated through the variation of the function on the boundary of the domain. A similar result is obtained for locally Lipschitz functions. These results generalize the previously known estimates of the infimum of the norm of the derivative in terms of the variation of the function on the entire domain. Under the assumption that the considered function is twice differentiable on the interior of the domain, similar estimates for the infimum of the norm of the first-order derivative and the estimates of the values of the second-order derivative are obtained. The proof of these results is based on the application of the modifications of the Bishop–Phelps variational principle and the Borwein–Preiss smooth variational principle. As applications of these results, we obtain second-order necessary optimality conditions for minimizing sequences. This proposition is proved under an additional assumption on the norm of the Banach space valid for a wide class of function spaces. In addition, some of the described results are generalized for mappings, acting in Banach spaces ordered by pointed closed convex cones.},

By bilevel, it is meant that the optimization of the upper level problem is carried out over the solution set of the lower level problem.This problem instance arises in structured crowd motion control problems in a confined space. We establish the corresponding necessary optimality conditions in the Gamkrelidze’s form. The analysis relies on the smooth approximation of the lower level sweeping control system, thereby dealing with the resulting lack of Lipschitzianity with respect to the state variable inherent to the sweeping process, and on the flattening of the bilevel structure via an exact penalization technique. Necessary conditions of optimality in the Gamkrelidze’s form are applied to the resulting standard approximating penalized state-constrained single-level problem, and the main result of this article is obtained by passing to the limit.},

This is not possible if the shear wind strength is too low. Engine thrust is introduced as a means to augment dynamic soaring in shear winds with insufficient strength. Appropriate models of the vehicle dynamics and the shear wind are developed, and an optimization method is used to construct results on optimal thrust-augmented dynamic soaring. The minimum energy required from the propulsion system is determined for the entire region of insufficient shear wind strength down to zero wind. Solutions of the characteristics of the motion including states and controls are presented.

Because there will always exist a sawtooth function that exactly fits a given data set, one is led to bounding the maximum number of jumps the sawtooth function can have in order to obtain reasonable practical estimates. The main contribution of the paper is a proof that cardinality of the optimal solutions to a relaxation of the associated least-squares problem in which a constraint on the cardinality of the solutions is replaced by a 1-norm constraint on the vector of jumps is a monotonic function of the parameter of the relaxation. This property allows one to avoid dealing with the combinatorial cardinality constraint and quickly explore solutions using the proposed convex relaxation.

By using a conventional semidefinite program (SDP) relaxation, QCQFP is reformulated as a class of linear fractional programming problems over the cone of positive semidefinite matrices, which we refer to these problems as SDFP. After expatiating the properties of SDFP, we transform SDFP into its equivalent problem (ESDFP) whose non-convexity is mainly reflected in the newly added nonlinear equality constraints. By relaxing these nonlinear equality constraints into linear constraints, a special SDP relaxation is generated for ESDFP. Based on these results, an effective branch-and-bound algorithm is designed, and its theoretical convergence and worst-case complexity are proved.

  abstract     = {Conditional gradient algorithms (aka Frank–Wolfe algorithms) form a classical set of methods for constrained smooth convex minimization due to their simplicity, the absence of projection steps, and competitive numerical performance. While the vanilla Frank–Wolfe algorithm only ensures a worst-case rate of $${\mathcal {O}}(1/\epsilon )$$ , various recent results have shown that for strongly convex functions on polytopes, the method can be slightly modified to achieve linear convergence. However, this still leaves a huge gap between sublinear $${\mathcal {O}}(1/\epsilon )$$ convergence and linear $${\mathcal {O}}(\log 1/\epsilon )$$ convergence to reach an $$\epsilon $$ -approximate solution. Here, we present a new variant of conditional gradient algorithms that can dynamically adapt to the function’s geometric properties using restarts and smoothly interpolates between the sublinear and linear regimes. These interpolated convergence rates are obtained when the optimization problem satisfies a new type of error bounds, which we call strong Wolfe primal bounds. They combine geometric information on the constraint set with Hölderian error bounds on the objective function.},

While nominally the movement between each two fourth-dimensional points (positions and velocities) can be treated as a 1D projection of the movement on the vector connecting the two points, in the presence of arbitrary disturbance the full problem on a plane must be considered. The mixed minimum time–energy optimal solution is now dependent on the value and direction of the disturbance, which naturally affects the structure and completion of the movement task. In this work, we address the minimum time–energy problem of a movement on a 2D plane with quadratic drag, under norm state (velocity) and norm control (acceleration) constraints. The structure and properties of the optimal solution are found and analyzed. The Pontryagin’s maximum principle (PMP) with control and state constraints is utilized.

Its largest C-eigenvalue determines the highest piezoelectric coupling constant. However, computing the largest C-eigenvalue is NP-hard. This paper addresses this problem using convex relaxation. To this end, we first establish an equivalence property that helps to rewrite the problem as a matrix optimization over rank-1 together with the partially symmetric tensor constraints. Then, via Lagrangian dual, convex relaxations are derived, yielding the problems of maximization of a linear function over one or two matrix nuclear norm constraint(s), together with a partially symmetric tensor constraint. Such relaxations define new norms, which are smaller than the spectral norms of the corresponding unfolding matrices. Several insights are provided for the tightness issues of the convex relaxations, including a certification, a sufficient criterion, and an equivalence condition. The spectral property of the dual variable, in particular, determines the tightness. When the convex relaxations are not tight, an approximation algorithm is proposed to extract a feasible approximation solution, with a theoretical lower bound provided. We provide several types of tensors to justify the tightness of the convex relaxations. In case that the relaxations are not tight, their optimal values, serving as upper bounds, are still tighter than those in the literature.},

First of all, we develop a pollution generation (PG) model with the help of existing initial pollution status of the environment, and then we use it as an essential constraint in the proposed EPQ model. The model has also been studied in two different scenarios: (a) when unit selling price is given and (b) when unit selling price is associated with marginal profit respectively. However, in this article, the concept of manpower exploitation, law of surplus value and their impacts on profit function has been discussed. In fact, after the invention of Marxian production theory (1867), not a single article has been developed for studying inventory management problems/operations research using this theory. Thus, in this study, focussing Marxian principle we have developed a new production inventory model named Marxian economic production quantity (M-EPQ) model incorporating the extensions of the models developed by Harris (Mag Manag 10(2):135–136, 1913) and Taft (Iron Age 101:1410–1412, 1918) exclusively. Moreover, to deal with the non-random uncertainties of several cost components of production process we have utilized fuzzy system explicitly. A case study has been performed for numerical illustrations and we have developed a solution algorithm for numerical computations. Finally, sensitivity analysis and graphical illustrations are made to validate the new M-EPQ model followed by a conclusion.},

As a strict refinement of Nash equilibrium, a perfect equilibrium always yields a sequential equilibrium. The selection of a perfect equilibrium thus plays an essential role in the applications of game theory. Moreover, a different procedure may select a different perfect equilibrium. The existence of Nash equilibrium was proved by Nash (Ann Math 54:289–295, 1951) through the construction of an elegant continuous mapping and an application of Brouwer’s fixed point theorem. This paper intends to enhance Nash’s mapping to select a perfect equilibrium. By incorporating the complementarity condition into the equilibrium system with Nash’s mapping through an artificial game, we successfully eliminate the nonnegativity constraints on a mixed strategy profile imposed by Nash’s mapping. In the artificial game, each player solves against a given mixed strategy profile a strictly convex quadratic optimization problem. This enhancement enables us to derive differentiable homotopy systems from Nash’s mapping and establish the existence of smooth paths for selecting a perfect equilibrium. The homotopy methods start from an arbitrary totally mixed strategy profile and numerically trace the smooth paths to a perfect equilibrium. Numerical results show that the methods are numerically stable and computationally efficient in search of a perfect equilibrium and outperform the existing differentiable homotopy method.},

  abstract     = {In the present paper, we propose two new methods for tensor completion of third-order tensors. The proposed methods consist in minimizing the average rank of the underlying tensor using its approximate function, namely the tensor nuclear norm. The recovered data will be obtained by combining the minimization process with the total variation regularization technique. We will adopt the alternating direction method of multipliers, using the tensor T-product, to solve the main optimization problems associated with the two proposed algorithms. In the last section, we present some numerical experiments and comparisons with the most known image video completion methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a multi-scale method to design a continuous-time distributed algorithm for constrained convex optimization problems by using multi-agents with Markov switched network dynamics and noisy inter-agent communications. Unlike most previous work which mainly puts emphasis on dealing with fixed network topology, this paper tackles the challenging problem of investigating the joint effects of stochastic networks and the inter-agent communication noises on the distributed optimization dynamics, which has not been systemically studied in the past literature. Also, in sharp contrast to previous work in constrained optimization, we depart from the use of projected gradient flow which is non-smooth and hard to analyze; instead, we design a smooth optimization dynamics which leads to easier convergence analysis and more efficient numerical simulations. Moreover, the multi-scale method presented in this paper generalizes previously known distributed convex optimization algorithms from the fixed network topology to the switching case and the stochastic averaging obtained in this paper is a generalization of the existing deterministic averaging.},

We investigate the derived sufficient global optimality conditions by exploiting the particular form of the Moreau envelope (L-subdifferential) of the quadratic function and abstract convexity, also to develop a new algorithm for solving the original problem without transforming it, that we call adaptive global algorithm, which can effectively find one global minimizer of the problem. Furthermore, the research of the convex support of the objective function allows us to characterize the global optimum and reduce the complexity of the big size problems.

  abstract     = {Tenfold improvements in computation speed can be brought to the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for Semidefinite Programming with virtually no decrease in robustness and provable convergence simply by projecting approximately to the Semidefinite cone. Instead of computing the projections via “exact” eigendecompositions that scale cubically with the matrix size and cannot be warm-started, we suggest using state-of-the-art factorization-free, approximate eigensolvers, thus achieving almost quadratic scaling and the crucial ability of warm-starting. Using a recent result from Goulart et al. (Linear Algebra Appl 594:177–192, 2020. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.laa.2020.02.014 ), we are able to circumvent the numerical instability of the eigendecomposition and thus maintain tight control on the projection accuracy. This in turn guarantees convergence, either to a solution or a certificate of infeasibility, of the ADMM algorithm. To achieve this, we extend recent results from Banjac et al. (J Optim Theory Appl 183(2):490–519, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10957-019-01575-y ) to prove that reliable infeasibility detection can be performed with ADMM even in the presence of approximation errors. In all of the considered problems of SDPLIB that “exact” ADMM can solve in a few thousand iterations, our approach brings a significant, up to 20x, speedup without a noticeable increase in ADMM’s iterations.},

Thus, it is crucial to understand what condition ensures that all weakly efficient solutions are efficient. In this paper, we give a condition to verify when efficiency coincides with weak efficiency, provided that the free disposal hull of a given set is convex. By using this characterization, we obtain various applications to multi-objective optimization problems under some convex conditions. We also apply the main theorem to the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and show that for a multi-objective version of LASSO, all weakly efficient solutions are efficient. Numerical simulation demonstrates that this equivalence is helpful to accelerate the hyper-parameter search for LASSO.},

The most well-known member of this family is the so-called nuclear norm. To solve optimization problems involving such norms with proximal splitting methods, efficient ways of evaluating the proximal mapping of the low-rank inducing norms are needed. This is known for the nuclear norm, but not for most other members of the low-rank inducing family. This work supplies a framework that reduces the proximal mapping evaluation into a nested binary search, in which each iteration requires the solution of a much simpler problem. The simpler problem can often be solved analytically as demonstrated for the so-called low-rank inducing Frobenius and spectral norms. The framework also allows to compute the proximal mapping of increasing convex functions composed with these norms as well as projections onto their epigraphs.},

Moreover, we describe the evolution of log-capitalization by using a system of coupled diffusions. The model incorporates a game feature with homogeneity within groups and heterogeneity among groups where banks search for the optimal strategies for lending to or borrowing from a central bank by minimizing the heterogeneous linear quadratic costs to avoid approaching the default barrier. The importance of relative concerns causes the relative ensemble average to be the critical determinant for lending and borrowing. The existence of closed- and open-loop Nash equilibria for the two-group case is validated by the solvability for the coupled Riccati equations. Both equilibria comprise the mean-reverting terms identical to the homogeneous game and all group averages owing to heterogeneity. The comparison of the obtained open- and closed-loop Nash equilibria is discussed. Furthermore, the existence of an approximate Nash equilibrium of the mean field games in the general d heterogeneous groups is verified. Finally, in financial implications, we study the influence of the incentive and relative parameters and also the number of banks on the corresponding liquidity rates through numerical analysis.},

We apply some iterations of an IPM to each sub-problem of the PMM until a satisfactory solution is found. We then update the PMM parameters, form a new IPM neighbourhood, and repeat this process. Given this framework, we prove polynomial complexity of the algorithm, under mild assumptions, and without requiring exact computations for the Newton directions. We furthermore provide a necessary condition for lack of strong duality, which can be used as a basis for constructing detection mechanisms for identifying pathological cases within IP-PMM.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a numerical approach for solving composite primal-dual monotone inclusions with a priori information. The underlying a priori information set is represented by the intersection of fixed point sets of a finite number of operators, and we propose an algorithm that activates the corresponding set by following a finite-valued random variable at each iteration. Our formulation is flexible and includes, for instance, deterministic and Bernoulli activations over cyclic schemes, and Kaczmarz-type random activations. The almost sure convergence of the algorithm is obtained by means of properties of stochastic Quasi-Fejér sequences. We also recover several primal-dual algorithms for monotone inclusions without a priori information and classical algorithms for solving convex feasibility problems and linear systems. In the context of convex optimization with inequality constraints, any selection of the constraints defines the a priori information set, in which case the operators involved are simply projections onto half spaces. By incorporating random projections onto a selection of the constraints to classical primal-dual schemes, we obtain faster algorithms as we illustrate by means of a numerical application to a stochastic arc capacity expansion problem in a transport network.},

  abstract     = {The paper is devoted to Lagrange problem of optimal control theory with higher-order differential inclusions (HODI) and special boundary conditions. Optimality conditions are derived for HODIs, as well as for their discrete analogy. In this case, discretization method of the second-order differential inclusion is used to form sufficient optimality conditions for HODIs and periodic boundary conditions, the so-called transversality conditions. And to construct an Euler–Lagrange-type inclusion, a locally adjoint mapping is used, which is closely related to the coderivative concept of Mordukhovich. In turn, this approach requires several important equivalence results concerning LAMs to the discrete and discrete-approximate problems. The results obtained are demonstrated by the optimization of some “linear” optimal control problems, for which the Weierstrass–Pontryagin maximum principle and transversality conditions are formulated.},

  abstract     = {The trade-off between the fuel consumption and drag coefficient makes the investigations of drag reduction of utmost importance. In this paper, the rear-end shape optimization of Ahmed body is performed. Before changing the geometry, to identify the suitable simulation method and validate it, the standard Ahmed body is simulated using k − ω shear stress transport (SST) and k-epsilon turbulence models. The slant angle, rear box angle, and rear box length as variables were optimized simultaneously. Optimizations conducted by genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) methods indicate a 26.3% decrease in the drag coefficient. To ensure the validity of the results, a numerical-experimental study is conducted on the optimized model. Thereafter, the velocity profiles and flow structure in the boundary layers of the original geometry were compared to those of the optimized geometry at different sections. The results indicate that there are points where the velocity profile in the boundary layer can exceed the free stream velocity and return to it again, an overlooked observation in the previous studies. In addition to the streamlines, to better understand the formation of three-dimensional vortexes, the Q-criterion factor is computed and illustrated.},
