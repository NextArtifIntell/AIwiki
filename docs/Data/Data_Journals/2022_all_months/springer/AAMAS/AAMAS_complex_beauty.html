  abstract     = {We provide an in-depth study of Nash equilibria in multi-objective normal-form games (MONFGs), i.e., normal-form games with vectorial payoffs. Taking a utility-based approach, we assume that each player’s utility can be modelled with a utility function that maps a vector to a scalar utility. In the case of a mixed strategy, it is meaningful to apply such a scalarisation both before calculating the expectation of the payoff vector as well as after. This distinction leads to two optimisation criteria. With the first criterion, players aim to optimise the expected value of their utility function applied to the payoff vectors obtained in the game. With the second criterion, players aim to optimise the utility of expected payoff vectors given a joint strategy. Under this latter criterion, it was shown that Nash equilibria need not exist. Our first contribution is to provide a sufficient condition under which Nash equilibria are guaranteed to exist. Secondly, we show that when Nash equilibria do exist under both criteria, no equilibrium needs to be shared between the two criteria, and even the number of equilibria can differ. Thirdly, we contribute a study of pure strategy Nash equilibria under both criteria. We show that when assuming quasiconvex utility functions for players, the sets of pure strategy Nash equilibria under both optimisation criteria are equivalent. This result is further extended to games in which players adhere to different optimisation criteria. Finally, given these theoretical results, we construct an algorithm to compute all pure strategy Nash equilibria in MONFGs where players have a quasiconvex utility function.},

  abstract     = {We study the problem of exchange when agents are endowed with heterogeneous indivisible objects, and there is no money. In this setting, no rule satisfies Pareto-efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy-proofness; there is no consensus in the literature on satisfactory second-best mechanisms. A natural generalization of the ubiquitous Top Trading Cycles (TTC) satisfies the first two properties on the lexicographic domain, rendering it manipulable. We characterize the computational complexity of manipulating this mechanism; we show that it is $$\mathbf {W[P]}$$ -hard by reduction from MONOTONE WEIGHTED CIRCUIT SATISFIABILITY. We provide a matching upper bound for a wide range of preference domains. We further show that manipulation by groups (when parameterized by group size) is $$\mathbf {W[P]}$$ -hard. This provides support for TTC as a second-best mechanism. Lastly, our results are of independent interest to complexity theorists: there are few natural $$\mathbf {W[P]}$$ -complete problems and, as far as we are aware, this is the first such problem arising from the social sciences.},

In state of the art cppp algorithms, the agents avoid explicitly sharing the value of private state variables. However, they may implicitly reveal dependencies between actions, that is, which action facilitates achieving the preconditions of another action. Previous work in cppp did not limit the disclosure of such dependencies. In this paper, we explicitly limit the amount of disclosed dependencies, allowing agents to publish only some of the dependencies between their actions. We investigate different strategies for deciding which dependencies to publish, and how they affect the ability to find solutions. We evaluate the ability of two solvers — distribute forward search and centralized planning based on a single-agent projection — to produce plans under this constraint. Experiments over standard cppp domains show that the proposed dependency-sharing strategies enable generating plans while sharing only a small fraction of all dependencies.},

We summarize the general topology categories for communication structures, which are often manually specified in MARL literature. A novel framework termed Learning Structured Communication (LSC) is proposed by learning a flexible and efficient communication topology (hierarchical structure). It contains two modules: structured communication module and communication-based policy module. The structured communication module learns to form a hierarchical structure by maximizing the cumulative reward of the agents under the current communication-based policy. The communication-based policy module adopts hierarchical graph neural networks to generate messages, propagate information based on the learned communication structure, and select actions. In contrast to existing communication mechanisms, our method has a learnable and hierarchical communication structure. Experiments on large-scale battle scenarios show that the proposed LSC has high communication efficiency and global cooperation capability.},

Our proposed concept and algorithmic contribution are tested on a real-world multi-item capacitated resource planning problem, appearing at a large aerospace company manufacturing high precision engine parts.

A natural notion of strength of alternatives in a tournament is a generalized king: an alternative is said to be a k-king if it can reach every other alternative in the tournament via a directed path of length at most k. In this paper, we provide an almost complete characterization of the probability threshold such that all, a large number, or a small number of alternatives are k-kings with high probability in two random models. We show that, perhaps surprisingly, all changes in the threshold occur in the range of constant k, with the biggest change being between $$k=2$$ and $$k=3$$ . In addition, we establish an asymptotically tight bound on the probability threshold for which all alternatives are likely able to win a single-elimination tournament under some bracket.},

To support users’ privacy management, we propose a novel agent-based negotiation framework to negotiate privacy permissions between users and service providers using a new multi-issue alternating-offer protocol based on exchanges of partial and complete offers. Additionally, we introduce a novel approach to learning users’ preferences in negotiation and present two variants of this approach: one variant personalised to each individual user, and one personalised depending on the user’s privacy type. To evaluate them, we perform a user study with participants, using an experimental tool installed on the participants’ mobile devices. We compare the take-it-or-leave-it approach, in which users are required to accept all permissions requested by a service, to negotiation, which respects their preferences. Our results show that users share personal data 2.5 times more often when they are able to negotiate while maintaining the same level of decision regret. Moreover, negotiation can be less mentally demanding than the take-it-or-leave-it approach and it allows users to align their privacy choices with their preferences. Finally, our findings provide insight into users’ data sharing strategies to guide the future of automated and negotiable privacy management mechanisms.},

We show that when rational behavior of the agents and private information are considered, the optimal social law synthesizing problem naturally evolves into a setting which can be handled by the framework of algorithmic mechanism design. We focus on the Bayesian case in this paper, that is, the probability distribution of each agent’s private cost is known by the public. In this case, our problem closely relates to path/spanning-tree auctions and Myerson’s optimal auction mechanism, but the optimization objective is new, that is, we focus on profit maximization instead of payment maximization in a reverse auction, and as far as we know in this setting no existing mechanism can be directly applied. By studying this problem: We further extend the logic-based framework of social law optimization problem to the strategic case, and show that it becomes a new problem of algorithmic mechanism design; We find out a mechanism that is incentive compatible, individually rational and maximize the expected profit for all input cost profiles; However, we can show that this mechanism is computational intractable (FP $$^{NP}$$ -complete); So, we try to specify Computation Tree Logic semantics as a set of linear-integer constraints, design a Integer-Linear Programming based algorithm for computing the proposed mechanism, enabling it to be handled by current ILP solvers, and finally find out a tractable 2-approximation mechanism.},

While the majority of prior work focuses on the coordination and control of such multi-robot systems, to date, these UAV teams have not been given the ability to reason about a fire’s track (i.e., location and propagation dynamics) to provide performance guarantee over a time horizon. Motivated by the problem of aerial wildfire monitoring, we propose a predictive framework which enables cooperation in multi-UAV teams towards collaborative field coverage and fire tracking with probabilistic performance guarantee. Our approach enables UAVs to infer the latent fire propagation dynamics for time-extended coordination in safety-critical conditions. We derive a set of novel, analytical temporal, and tracking-error bounds to enable the UAV-team to distribute their limited resources and cover the entire fire area according to the case-specific estimated states and provide a probabilistic performance guarantee. Our results are not limited to the aerial wildfire monitoring case-study and are generally applicable to problems, such as search-and-rescue, target tracking and border patrol. We evaluate our approach in simulation and provide demonstrations of the proposed framework on a physical multi-robot testbed to account for real robot dynamics and restrictions. Our quantitative evaluations validate the performance of our method accumulating $$7.5\times$$ and $$9.0\times$$ smaller tracking-error than state-of-the-art model-based and reinforcement learning benchmarks, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Residential segregation is a wide-spread phenomenon that can be observed in almost every major city. In these urban areas residents with different racial or socioeconomic background tend to form homogeneous clusters. Schelling’s famous agent-based model for residential segregation explains how such clusters can form even if all agents are tolerant, i.e., if they agree to live in mixed neighborhoods. For segregation to occur, all it needs is a slight bias towards agents preferring similar neighbors. Very recently, Schelling’s model has been investigated from a game-theoretic point of view with selfish agents that strategically select their residential location. In these games, agents can improve on their current location by performing a location swap with another agent who is willing to swap. We significantly deepen these investigations by studying the influence of the underlying topology modeling the residential area on the existence of equilibria, the Price of Anarchy and on the dynamic properties of the resulting strategic multi-agent system. Moreover, as a new conceptual contribution, we also consider the influence of locality, i.e., if the location swaps are restricted to swaps of neighboring agents. We give improved almost tight bounds on the Price of Anarchy for arbitrary underlying graphs and we present (almost) tight bounds for regular graphs, paths and cycles. Moreover, we give almost tight bounds for grids, which are commonly used in empirical studies. For grids we also show that locality has a severe impact on the game dynamics.},

In this paper, we ask: are there safe Pareto improvements on this default way of giving instructions? That is, we imagine that the original players can coordinate to tell their representatives to only consider some subset of the available strategies and to assign utilities to outcomes differently than the original players. Then can the original players do this in such a way that the payoff is guaranteed to be weakly higher than under the default instructions for all the original players? In particular, can they Pareto-improve without probabilistic assumptions about how the representatives play games? In this paper, we give some examples of safe Pareto improvements. We prove that the notion of safe Pareto improvements is closely related to a notion of outcome correspondence between games. We also show that under some specific assumptions about how the representatives play games, finding safe Pareto improvements is NP-complete.},

  abstract     = {It is essential for agents to work together with others to accomplish common objectives, without pre-programmed coordination rules or previous knowledge of the current teammates, a challenge known as ad-hoc teamwork. In these systems, an agent estimates the algorithm of others in an on-line manner in order to decide its own actions for effective teamwork. A common approach is to assume a set of possible types and parameters for teammates, reducing the problem into estimating parameters and calculating distributions over types. Meanwhile, agents often must coordinate in a decentralised fashion to complete tasks that are displaced in an environment (e.g., in foraging, de-mining, rescue or fire control), where each member autonomously chooses which task to perform. By harnessing this knowledge, better estimation techniques can be developed. Hence, we present On-line Estimators for Ad-hoc Task Execution (OEATE), a novel algorithm for teammates’ type and parameter estimation in decentralised task execution. We show theoretically that our algorithm can converge to perfect estimations, under some assumptions, as the number of tasks increases. Additionally, we run experiments for a diverse configuration set in the level-based foraging domain over full and partial observability, and in a “capture the prey” game. We obtain a lower error in parameter and type estimation than previous approaches and better performance in the number of completed tasks for some cases. In fact, we evaluate a variety of scenarios via the increasing number of agents, scenario sizes, number of items, and number of types, showing that we can overcome previous works in most cases considering the estimation process, besides robustness to an increasing number of types and even to an erroneous set of potential types.},

  abstract     = {The problem of truth discovery, i.e., of trying to find the true facts concerning a number of objects based on reports from various information sources of unknown trustworthiness, has received increased attention recently. The problem is made interesting by the fact that the relative believability of facts depends on the trustworthiness of their sources, which in turn depends on the believability of the facts the sources report. Several algorithms for truth discovery have been proposed, but their evaluation has mainly been performed experimentally by computing accuracy against large datasets. Furthermore, it is often unclear how these algorithms behave on an intuitive level. In this paper we take steps towards a framework for truth discovery which allows comparison and evaluation of algorithms based instead on their theoretical properties. To do so we pose truth discovery as a social choice problem, and formulate various axioms that any reasonable algorithm should satisfy. Along the way we provide an axiomatic characterisation of the baseline ‘Voting’ algorithm—which leads to an impossibility result showing that a certain combination of the axioms cannot hold simultaneously—and check which axioms a particular well-known algorithm satisfies. We find that, surprisingly, our more fundamental axioms do not hold, and propose modifications to the algorithms to partially fix these problems.},

  abstract     = {In a decision-making problem, there is often some uncertainty regarding the user preferences. We assume a parameterised utility model, where in each scenario we have a utility function over alternatives, and where each scenario represents a possible user preference model consistent with the input preference information. With a set $$A$$ of alternatives available to the decision-maker, we can consider the associated utility function, expressing, for each scenario, the maximum utility among the alternatives. We consider two main problems: firstly, finding a minimal subset of $$A$$ that is equivalent to it, i.e., that has the same utility function. We show that for important classes of preference models, the set of possibly strictly optimal alternatives is the unique minimal equivalent subset. Secondly, we consider how to compare $$A$$ to another set of alternatives $$B$$ , where $$A$$ and $$B$$ correspond to different initial decision choices. This is closely related to the problem of computing setwise max regret. We derive mathematical results that allow different computational techniques for these problems, using linear programming, and especially, with a novel approach using the extreme points of the epigraph of the utility function.},

  abstract     = {In interactive multiobjective optimization methods, the preferences of a decision maker are incorporated in a solution process to find solutions of interest for problems with multiple conflicting objectives. Since multiple solutions exist for these problems with various trade-offs, preferences are crucial to identify the best solution(s). However, it is not necessarily clear to the decision maker how the preferences lead to particular solutions and, by introducing explanations to interactive multiobjective optimization methods, we promote a novel paradigm of explainable interactive multiobjective optimization. As a proof of concept, we introduce a new method, R-XIMO, which provides explanations to a decision maker for reference point based interactive methods. We utilize concepts of explainable artificial intelligence and SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) values. R-XIMO allows the decision maker to learn about the trade-offs in the underlying problem and promotes confidence in the solutions found. In particular, R-XIMO supports the decision maker in expressing new preferences that help them improve a desired objective by suggesting another objective to be impaired. This kind of support has been lacking. We validate R-XIMO numerically, with an illustrative example, and with a case study demonstrating how R-XIMO can support a real decision maker. Our results show that R-XIMO successfully generates sound explanations. Thus, incorporating explainability in interactive methods appears to be a very promising and exciting new research area.},

We contest the underlying assumption of Silver et al. that such reward can be scalar-valued. In this paper we explain why scalar rewards are insufficient to account for some aspects of both biological and computational intelligence, and argue in favour of explicitly multi-objective models of reward maximisation. Furthermore, we contend that even if scalar reward functions can trigger intelligent behaviour in specific cases, this type of reward is insufficient for the development of human-aligned artificial general intelligence due to unacceptable risks of unsafe or unethical behaviour.},

A number of techniques to preserve private information throughout the planning process have emerged. One major difficulty of such research is the comparison of properties related to privacy among such techniques. A metric allowing for comparison of such privacy preservation was introduced only recently, having a number of drawbacks such as prohibitive computational complexity. In this work we strengthen the theoretical foundations and simplify the metric in order to be practically usable. Moreover, we test the usability of the metric in an analysis of various techniques in multi-agent heuristic computation and search, determining which are the most beneficial in terms of privacy preservation. We also evaluate the techniques in terms of the classical IPC score to assess their impact on the overall planning performance. The results are somewhat surprising and show that extracting any privacy-related information even from the simplest variant of heuristic search is a very complicated task. Existing techniques such as distributed heuristic and sending only relevant states is shown to reduce the privacy leakage even more.},

  abstract     = {As part of the DARPA SocialSim challenge, we address the problem of predicting behavioral phenomena including information spread involving hundreds of thousands of users across three major linked social networks: Twitter, Reddit and GitHub. Our approach develops a framework for data-driven agent simulation that begins with a discrete-event simulation of the environment populated with generic, flexible agents, then optimizes the decision model of the agents by combining a number of machine learning classification problems. The ML problems predict when an agent will take a certain action in its world and are designed to combine aspects of the agents, gathered from historical data, with dynamic aspects of the environment including the resources, such as tweets, that agents interact with at a given point in time. In this way, each of the agents makes individualized decisions based on their environment, neighbors and history during the simulation, although global simulation data is used to learn accurate generalizations. This approach showed the best performance of all participants in the DARPA challenge across a broad range of metrics. We describe the performance of models both with and without machine learning on measures of cross-platform information spread defined both at the level of the whole population and at the community level. The best performing model overall combines learned agent behaviors with explicit modeling of bursts in global activity. Because of the general nature of our approach, it is applicable to a range of prediction problems that require modeling individualized, situational agent behavior from trace data that combines many agents.},

Whether it is desirable or undesirable, the winning candidate should either minimize or maximize its aggregate distance to the agents. The goal is to understand the optimal distortion, which evaluates how good an algorithm that determines the winner based only on the agent rankings performs against the optimal solution. We give a characterization of the distortion in the case of latent Euclidean distances such that the candidates are aligned, but the agent locations are not constrained. This setting generalizes the well-studied setting where both agents and candidates are located on the real line. Our bounds on the distortion are expressed with a parameter which relates, for every agent, the distance to her best candidate to the distance to any other alternative.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of cooperation among self-interested agents has been a key concern of the multi-agent systems community for decades. With the increased importance of network-mediated interaction, researchers have shifted the attention to the impact of social networks and their dynamics in promoting or hindering cooperation, drawing various context-dependent conclusions. For example, some lines of research, theoretical and experimental, suggest the existence of a threshold effect in the ratio of timescales of network evolution, after which cooperation will emerge, whereas other lines dispute this, suggesting instead a Goldilocks zone. In this paper we provide an evolutionary game theory framework to understand coevolutionary processes from a bottom up perspective - in particular the emergence of a cooperator-core and defector-periphery - clarifying the impact of partner selection and imitation strategies in promoting cooperative behaviour, without assuming underlying communication or reputation mechanisms. In doing so we provide a unifying framework to study imitation-based cooperation in dynamic social networks and show that disputes in the literature can in fact coexist in so far as the results stem from different equally valid assumptions.},

MASs often use GCMs to support their operation, but are not usually viewed as tools for enhancing their execution. We argue that the definition of a GCM should include its update mechanism, an often-overlooked component. We review a wide range of GCMs to validate this definition and point out limitations that they face when applied to the social and psychological dimensions of causality. Then we describe Social Causality using Agents with Multiple Perspectives (SCAMP), a causal language and multi-agent simulator that satisfies our definition and overcomes the limitations of other GCMs for social simulation.},

  abstract     = {In social interactions, people often reason about the beliefs, goals and intentions of others. This theory of mind allows them to interpret the behavior of others, and predict how they will behave in the future. People can also use this ability recursively: they use higher-order theory of mind to reason about the theory of mind abilities of others, as in “he thinks that I don’t know that he sent me an anonymous letter”. Previous agent-based modeling research has shown that the usefulness of higher-order theory of mind reasoning can be useful across competitive, cooperative, and mixed-motive settings. In this paper, we cast a new light on these results by investigating how the predictability of the environment influences the effectiveness of higher-order theory of mind. Our results show that the benefit of (higher-order) theory of mind reasoning is strongly dependent on the predictability of the environment. We consider agent-based simulations in repeated one-shot negotiations in a particular negotiation setting known as Colored Trails. When this environment is highly predictable, agents obtain little benefit from theory of mind reasoning. However, if the environment has more observable features that change over time, agents without the ability to use theory of mind experience more difficulties predicting the behavior of others accurately. This in turn allows theory of mind agents to obtain higher scores in these more dynamic environments. These results suggest that the human-specific ability for higher-order theory of mind reasoning may have evolved to allow us to survive in more complex and unpredictable environments.},

We consider two dialogue participants who may have different views regarding the beliefs, plans and external events which drove agent action (encoded via traces). These participants make utterances which incrementally reveal their traces to each other, allowing them to identify divergences in the traces, or to conclude that their traces agree. In practice, we envision a human taking on the role of a dialogue participant, with the BDI agent itself acting as the other participant. The dialogue then facilitates explanation, understanding and debugging of BDI agent behaviour. After presenting our formalism and its properties, we describe our implementation of the system and provide an example of its use in a simple scenario.},

  abstract     = {For cooperative games with externalities, the problem of optimally partitioning a set of players into disjoint exhaustive coalitions is called coalition structure generation, and is a fundamental computational problem in multi-agent systems. Coalition structure generation is, in general, computationally hard and a large body of work has therefore investigated the development of efficient solutions for this problem. However, the existing methods are mostly limited to deterministic environments. In this paper, we focus attention on uncertain environments. Specifically, we define probabilistically monotone partition function games, a subclass of the well-known partition function games in which we introduce uncertainty. We provide a constructive proof that an exact optimum can be found using a greedy approach, present an algorithm for finding an optimum, and analyze its time complexity.},

  abstract     = {Real-world sequential decision-making tasks are generally complex, requiring trade-offs between multiple, often conflicting, objectives. Despite this, the majority of research in reinforcement learning and decision-theoretic planning either assumes only a single objective, or that multiple objectives can be adequately handled via a simple linear combination. Such approaches may oversimplify the underlying problem and hence produce suboptimal results. This paper serves as a guide to the application of multi-objective methods to difficult problems, and is aimed at researchers who are already familiar with single-objective reinforcement learning and planning methods who wish to adopt a multi-objective perspective on their research, as well as practitioners who encounter multi-objective decision problems in practice. It identifies the factors that may influence the nature of the desired solution, and illustrates by example how these influence the design of multi-objective decision-making systems for complex problems.},

  abstract     = {Virtual advisors (VAs) are being utilised almost in every service nowadays from entertainment to healthcare. To increase the user’s trust in these VAs and encourage the users to follow their advice, they should have the capability of explaining their decisions, particularly, when the decision is vital such as health advice. However, the role of an explainable VA in health behaviour change is understudied. There is evidence that people tend to change their intentions towards health behaviour when the persuasion message is linked to their mental state. Thus, this study explores this link by introducing an explainable VA that provides explanation according to the user’s mental state (beliefs and goals) rather than the agent’s mental state as commonly utilised in explainable agents. It further explores the influence of different explanation patterns that refer to beliefs, goals, or beliefs&amp;goals on the user’s behaviour change. An explainable VA was designed to advise undergraduate students how to manage their study-related stress by motivating them to change certain behaviours. With 91 participants, the VA was evaluated and the results revealed that user-specific explanation could significantly encourage behaviour change intentions and build good user-agent relationship. Small differences were found between the three types of explanation patterns.},

We suggest to fix a rank k, to ask all voters to specify their best k candidates, and then to consider “top-k approximations” of rules, which take only into account the top-k candidates of each ballot. The questions are then: Are these k-truncated approximations good predictors of the approximated rule? For which values of k and under which assumptions can we expect to output the correct winner with high probability? For different voting rules, we study these questions theoretically, by giving tight approximation ratios, and empirically, based on randomly generated profiles and on real data. We consider two measures of the quality of the approximation: the probability of selecting the same winner as the original rule, and the score ratio. We do a worst-case study (for the latter measure only), and for both measures, an average-case study and a study from real data sets.},

We propose Axies, a hybrid (human and AI) methodology to identify context-specific values. Axies simplifies the abstract task of value identification as a guided value annotation process involving human annotators. Axies exploits the growing availability of value-laden text corpora and Natural Language Processing to assist the annotators in systematically identifying context-specific values. We evaluate Axies in a user study involving 80 human subjects. In our study, six annotators generate value lists for two timely and important contexts: Covid-19 measures and sustainable Energy. We employ two policy experts and 72 crowd workers to evaluate Axies value lists and compare them to a list of general (Schwartz) values. We find that Axies yields values that are (1) more context-specific than general values, (2) more suitable for value annotation than general values, and (3) independent of the people applying the methodology.},

The fairness constraints are usually captured by absolute upper bounds and/or lower bounds on the number of selected candidates in specific attributes. In many scenarios, however, the total number of selected candidates is not predetermined. It is, therefore, more natural to express these fairness constraints in terms of proportions of the final selection size. In this paper, we study the proportional candidate selection problem, where the goal is to select a subset of candidates with maximum cardinality while meeting certain proportional fairness constraints. We first analyze the computational complexity of the problem and show strong inapproximability results. Next, we investigate the algorithmic aspects of the problem in two directions. First, by treating the proportional fairness constraints as soft constraints, we devise two polynomial-time algorithms that could return (near) optimal solutions with bounded violations on each fairness constraint. Second, we design an exact algorithm with a fast running time in practice. Simulations based on both synthetic and publicly available data confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative privacy preserving planning (cppp) gained much attention in the past decade. cppp aims to create solutions for multi agent planning problems where cooperation is required to achieve an efficient solution, without exposing information that the agent considers private in the process. To date, cppp has focused on domains with deterministic action effects. However, in real-world problems action effects are often non-deterministic, and actions can have multiple possible effects with varying probabilities. In this paper, we introduce Stochastic cppp (scppp), which is an extension of cppp to domains with stochastic action effects. We show how scppp can be modeled as a Markov decision process (mdp) and how the value-iteration algorithm can be adapted to solve it. This adaptation requires extending value-iteration to support multiple agents and privacy. Then, we present two adaptions of the real-time dynamic programming (rtdp) algorithm, a popular algorithm for solving mdps, designed to solve scppp problems. The first rtdp adaptation, called distributed rtdp (drtdp), yields identical behavior to applying rtdp in a centralized manner on the joint problem. To preserve privacy, drtdp uses a message passing mechanism adopted from the mafs algorithm. The second rtdp adaptation is an approximation of drtdp called public synchronization rtdp (ps-rtdp). ps-rtdp differs from drtdp mainly in its message passing mechanism, where ps-rtdp sends significantly fewer messages than drtdp. We experimented on domains adapted from the deterministic cppp literature by adding different stochastic effects to different actions. The results show that ps-rtdp can reduce the amount of messages compared to drtdp by orders of magnitude thus improving run-time, while producing policies with similar expected costs.},

In this paper, we investigate and quantify the relationship between generalization and diversity in the multi-agent domain. Across the range of multi-agent environments considered here, procedurally generating training levels significantly improves agent performance on held-out levels. However, agent performance on the specific levels used in training sometimes declines as a result. To better understand the effects of co-player variation, our experiments introduce a new environment-agnostic measure of behavioral diversity. Results demonstrate that population size and intrinsic motivation are both effective methods of generating greater population diversity. In turn, training with a diverse set of co-players strengthens agent performance in some (but not all) cases.},

  abstract     = {The goal of this paper is to propose a framework for representing and reasoning about the rules of auction-based protocols. Such a framework is of interest for building digital marketplaces based on this type of mechanism. Hence the framework should fulfill two requirements: (i) it should enable bidders to express their preferences over combinations of items and (ii) it should allow the mechanism designer to describe the rules governing the market, namely the legality of bids, the allocative choice, and the payment rule. To do so, we define a logical language in the spirit of the Game Description Language, namely Auction Description Language with a set of functions $$\mathcal {F}_{\mathcal {B}}$$ (ADL $$[\mathcal {F}_{\mathcal {B}}]$$ ). ADL $$[\mathcal {F}_{\mathcal {B}}]$$ is the first language for describing auctions in a logical framework. With our approach, each stage in a protocol is seen as an independent direct revelation mechanism. Our contribution is three-fold: first, we illustrate the general dimension by representing different kinds of protocols. Second, we show how this machine-processable language enables reasoning about auction properties, including playability, termination, and classical conditions from mechanism design (e.g., budget-balance and individual rationality). Finally, we develop a model-checking algorithm for ADL $$[\mathcal {F}_{\mathcal {B}}]$$ , with complexity in PTIME when the functions in $$\mathcal {F}_{\mathcal {B}}$$ can be computed in polynomial time.},

In the first study, animation was varied between manually created, procedural, or no animations; voice quality was varied between recorded audio and synthetic speech; and rendering style was varied between realistic and toon-shaded. In the second study, simulated empathy of the agent was varied between no empathy, verbal-only empathic responses, and full empathy involving verbal, facial, and immediacy feedback. Results show that natural animations and recorded voice are more appropriate for the agent’s general acceptance, trust, credibility, and appropriateness for the task.

  abstract     = {We conceptualize a decentralized software application as one constituted from autonomous agents that communicate via asynchronous messaging. Modern software paradigms such as microservices and settings such as the Internet of Things evidence a growing interest in decentralized applications. Constructing a decentralized application involves designing agents as independent local computations that coordinate successfully to realize the application’s requirements. Moreover, a decentralized application is susceptible to faults manifested as message loss, delay, and reordering. We contribute Mandrake, a programming model for decentralized applications that tackles these challenges without relying on infrastructure guarantees. Specifically, we adopt the construct of an information protocol that specifies messaging between agents purely in causal terms and can be correctly enacted by agents in a shared-nothing environment over nothing more than unreliable, unordered transport. Mandrake facilitates (1) implementing protocol-compliant agents by introducing a programming model; (2) transforming protocols into fault-tolerant ones with simple annotations; and (3) a declarative policy language that makes it easy to implement fault-tolerance in agents based on the capabilities in protocols. Mandrake’s significance lies in demonstrating a straightforward approach for constructing decentralized applications without relying on coordination mechanisms in the infrastructure, thus achieving some of the goals of the founders of networked computing from the 1970s.},

  abstract     = {The class of assignment problems is a fundamental and well-studied class in the intersection of Social Choice, Computational Economics and Discrete Allocation. In a general assignment problem, a group of agents expresses preferences over a set of items, and the task is to allocate items to agents in an “optimal” way. A verification variant of this problem includes an allocation as part of the input, and the question becomes whether this allocation is “optimal”. In this paper, we generalize the verification variant to the setting where each agent is equipped with multiple incomplete preference lists: Each list (called a layer) is a ranking of items in a possibly different way according to a different criterion. In particular, we introduce three multi-layer verification problems, each corresponds to an optimality notion that weakens the notion of global optimality (that is, pareto optimality in multiple layers) in a different way. Informally, the first notion requires that, for each group of agents whose size is exactly some input parameter k, the agents in the group will not be able to trade their assigned items among themselves and benefit in at least $$\alpha $$ layers; the second notion is similar, but it concerns all groups of size at most k rather than exactly k; the third notion strengthens these notions by requiring that groups of k agents will not be part of possibly larger groups that benefit in at least $$\alpha $$ layers. We study the three problems from the perspective of parameterized complexity under several natural parameterizations such as the number of layers, the number of agents, the number of items, the number of allocated items, the maximum length of a preference list, and more. We present an almost comprehensive picture of the parameterized complexity of the problems with respect to these parameters.},

  abstract     = {Can artificial agents benefit from human conventions? Human societies manage to successfully self-organize and resolve the tragedy of the commons in common-pool resources, in spite of the bleak prediction of non-cooperative game theory. On top of that, real-world problems are inherently large-scale and of low observability. One key concept that facilitates human coordination in such settings is the use of conventions. Inspired by human behavior, we investigate the learning dynamics and emergence of temporal conventions, focusing on common-pool resources. Extra emphasis was given in designing a realistic evaluation setting: (a) environment dynamics are modeled on real-world fisheries, (b) we assume decentralized learning, where agents can observe only their own history, and (c) we run large-scale simulations (up to 64 agents). Uncoupled policies and low observability make cooperation hard to achieve; as the number of agents grow, the probability of taking a correct gradient direction decreases exponentially. By introducing an arbitrary common signal (e.g., date, time, or any periodic set of numbers) as a means to couple the learning process, we show that temporal conventions can emerge and agents reach sustainable harvesting strategies. The introduction of the signal consistently improves the social welfare (by $$258\%$$ on average, up to $$3306\%$$ ), the range of environmental parameters where sustainability can be achieved (by $$46\%$$ on average, up to $$300\%$$ ), and the convergence speed in low abundance settings (by $$13\%$$ on average, up to $$53\%$$ ).},

The facility location problem models such scenarios and it is a well-studied problem in social choice. We study mechanisms for facility location on unweighted undirected graphs that are resistant to manipulations (strategy-proof, abstention-proof, and false-name-proof) by both individuals and coalitions on one hand and anonymous and efficient (Pareto-optimal) on the other. We define a new family of graphs, $$ZV$$ -line graphs, and show a general facility location mechanism for these graphs that satisfies all these desired properties. This mechanism can also be computed in polynomial time and it can equivalently be defined as the first Pareto-optimal location according to some predefined order. Our main result, the $$ZV$$ -line graphs family and the mechanism we present for it, unifies all works in the literature of false-name-proof facility location on discrete graphs including the preliminary (unpublished) works we are aware of. In particular, we show mechanisms for all graphs of at most five vertices, discrete trees, bicliques, and clique tree graphs. Finally, we discuss some generalizations and limitations of our result for facility location problems on other structures: Weighted graphs, large discrete cycles, infinite graphs; and for facility location problems concerning infinite societies.},

This paper considers revenue maximization in the online stochastic setting with non-preemptive jobs and a unit capacity server. One agent/job arrives at every time step, with parameters drawn from the underlying distribution. We design a posted-price mechanism which can be efficiently computed and is revenue-optimal in expectation and in retrospect, up to additive error. The prices are posted prior to learning the agent’s type, and the computed pricing scheme is deterministic, depending only on the length of the allotted time interval and on the earliest time the server is available. We also prove that the proposed pricing strategy is robust to imprecise knowledge of the job distribution and that a distribution learned from polynomially many samples is sufficient to obtain a near-optimal truthful pricing strategy.},

Previous studies show that in most cases MP conflicts could be avoided, and are mainly due to the difficulty for the uploader to select appropriate sharing policies. For this reason, we present ELVIRA, the first fully explainable personal assistant that collaborates with other ELVIRA agents to identify the optimal sharing policy for a collectively owned content. An extensive evaluation of this agent through software simulations and two user studies suggests that ELVIRA, thanks to its properties of being role-agnostic, adaptive, explainable and both utility- and value-driven, would be more successful at supporting MP than other approaches presented in the literature in terms of (i) trade-off between generated utility and promotion of moral values, and (ii) users’ satisfaction of the explained recommended output.},

The main focus of this paper is the study of unravelling procedures that transform the delegation ballots received from the agents into a profile of direct votes, from which a winning alternative can then be determined by using a standard voting rule. We propose and study six such unravelling procedures, two based on optimisation and four using a greedy approach. We study both algorithmic and axiomatic properties, as well as related computational complexity problems of our unravelling procedures for different restrictions on the types of ballots that the agents can submit.},

We propose a new ICO mechanism which uses the concept of Gini index for the very first time as a mechanism design constraint to control allocation inequality. Our mechanism has an elegant and straightforward structure, which makes it explainable. It allows the agents to modify their bids as a price discovery process, while limiting the bids of whales. Under natural technical assumptions, we show that under our mechanism most agents have simple dominant strategies and the equilibrium revenue approaches the optimal revenue asymptotically in the number of agents.

  abstract     = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are commonly thought of as adaptive decision procedures. They work on input/output data streams called “states”, “actions” and “rewards”. Most current research about RL adaptiveness to changes works under the assumption that the streams signatures (i.e. arity and types of inputs and outputs) remain the same throughout the agent lifetime. As a consequence, natural situations where the signatures vary (e.g. when new data streams become available, or when others become obsolete) are not studied. In this paper, we relax this assumption and consider that signature changes define a new learning situation called Protean Learning (PL). When they occur, traditional RL agents become undefined, so they need to restart learning. Can better methods be developed under the PL view? To investigate this, we first construct a stream-oriented formalism to properly define PL and signature changes. Then, we run experiments in an idealized PL situation where input addition and deletion occur during the learning process. Results show that a simple PL-oriented method enables graceful adaptation of these arity changes, and is more efficient than restarting the process.},

In this paper, we consider a more general scenario in which an agent may have positive or negative utility for each item. This framework captures, e.g., fair task assignment, where agents can experience both positive and negative utility for each task. We demonstrate that whereas some of the positive axiomatic and computational results extend to this more general setting, others do not. We present several new and efficient algorithms for finding fair allocations in this general setting.

To assess effectiveness, we propose to employ new noise models that are specifically tailored for approval votes and committees. These models take as input a ground truth committee and return random approval votes to be thought of as noisy estimates of the ground truth. A minimum robustness requirement for an approval-based multiwinner voting rule is to return the ground truth when applied to profiles with sufficiently many noisy votes. Our results indicate that approval-based multiwinner voting can indeed be robust to reasonable noise. We further refine this finding by presenting a hierarchy of rules in terms of how robust to noise they are.},
