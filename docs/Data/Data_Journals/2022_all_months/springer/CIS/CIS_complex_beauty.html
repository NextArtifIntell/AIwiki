  abstract     = {Online group streaming feature selection, as an essential online processing method, can deal with dynamic feature selection tasks by considering the original group structure information of the features. Due to the fuzziness and uncertainty of the feature stream, some existing methods are unstable and yield low predictive accuracy. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel online group streaming feature selection method (FNE-OGSFS) using fuzzy neighborhood entropy-based uncertainty measures. First, a separability measure integrating the dependency degree with the coincidence degree is proposed and introduced into the fuzzy neighborhood rough sets model to define a new fuzzy neighborhood entropy. Second, inspired by both algebra and information views, some fuzzy neighborhood entropy-based uncertainty measures are investigated and some properties are derived. Furthermore, the optimal features in the group are selected to flow into the feature space according to the significance of features, and the features with interactions are left. Then, all selected features are re-evaluated by the Lasso model to discard the redundant features. Finally, an online group streaming feature selection algorithm is designed. Experimental results compared with eight representative methods on thirteen datasets show that FNE-OGSFS can achieve better comprehensive performance.},

  abstract     = {One of the crucial challenges of solving many-objective optimization problems is uniformly well covering of the Pareto-front (PF). However, many the state-of-the-art optimization algorithms are capable of approximating the shape of many-objective PF by generating a limited number of non-dominated solutions. The exponential increase of the population size is an inefficient strategy that increases the computational complexity of the algorithm dramatically—especially when solving many-objective problems. In this paper, we introduce a machine learning-based framework to cover sparse PF surface which is initially generated by many-objective optimization algorithms; either by classical or meta-heuristic methods. The proposed method, called many-objective reverse mapping (MORM), is based on constructing a learning model on the initial PF set as the training data to reversely map the objective values to corresponding decision variables. Using the trained model, a set of candidate solutions can be generated by a variety of inexpensive generative techniques such as Opposition-based Learning and Latin Hypercube Sampling in both objective and decision spaces. Iteratively generated non-dominated candidate solutions cover the initial PF efficiently with no further need to utilize any optimization algorithm. We validate the proposed framework using a set of well-known many-objective optimization benchmarks and two well-known real-world problems. The coverage of PF is illustrated and numerically compared with the state-of-the-art many-objective algorithms. The statistical tests conducted on comparison measures such as HV, IGD, and the contribution ratio on the built PF reveal that the proposed collaborative framework surpasses the competitors on most of the problems. In addition, MORM covers the PF effectively compared to other methods even with the aid of large population size.},

  abstract     = {Uninterpretability has become the biggest obstacle to the wider application of deep neural network, especially in most human–machine interaction scenes. Inspired by the powerful associative computing ability of human brain neural system, a novel interpretable semantic representation model of noun context, associative knowledge network model, is proposed. The proposed network structure is composed of only pure associative relationships without relation label and is dynamically generated by analysing neighbour relationships between noun words in text, in which incremental updating and reduction reconstruction strategies can be naturally introduced. Furthermore, a novel interpretable method is designed for the practical problem of checking the semantic coherence of noun context. In proposed method, the associative knowledge network learned from the text corpus is first regarded as a background knowledge network, and then the multilevel contextual associative coupling degree features of noun words in given detection document are computed. Finally, contextual coherence detection and the location of those inconsistent noun words can be realized by using an interpretable classification method such as decision tree. Our sufficient experimental results show that above proposed method can obtain excellent performance and completely reach or even partially exceed the performance obtained by the latest deep neural network methods especially in F1 score metric. In addition, the natural interpretability and incremental learning ability of our proposed method should be extremely valuable than deep neural network methods. So, this study provides a very enlightening idea for developing interpretable machine learning methods, especially for the tasks of text semantic representation and writing error detection.},

Research on DMOPs has attracted a great interest from academic, due to widespread applications of DMOPs. Recently, a few learning-based approaches have been proposed to predict new solutions in the following environments as an initial population for a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. In this paper, we propose an alternative learning-based method for DMOPs, a deep multi-layer perceptron-based predictor to generate an initial population for the MOEA in the new environment. The historical optimal solutions are used to train a deep multi-layer perceptron which then predicts a new set of solutions as the initial population in the new environment. The deep multi-layer perceptron is incorporated with the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition to solve DMOPs. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is effective in tracking varying solutions over time and shows great superiority comparing with state-of-the-art methods.},

The utilization of Fermatean fuzzy numbers is successfully treated with the qualitative data and uncertain information that often occur in realistic MCDM problems. In this paper, an extended complex proportional assessment (COPRAS) approach is developed to treat the decision-making problems in a Fermatean fuzzy set (FFS) context. First, to aggregate the Fermatean fuzzy information, a new Fermatean fuzzy Archimedean copula-based Maclaurin symmetric mean operator is introduced with its desirable characteristics. This proposed operator not only considers the interrelationships between multiple numbers of criteria, but also associates more than one marginal distribution, thus avoiding information loss in the process of aggregation. Second, new similarity measures are developed to quantify the degree of similarity between Fermatean fuzzy perspectives more effectively and are further utilized to compute the weights of the criteria. Third, an integrated Fermatean fuzzy-COPRAS approach using the Archimedean copula-based Maclaurin symmetric mean operator and similarity measure has been developed to assess and rank the alternatives under the FFS perspective. Furthermore, a case study of RES selection is presented to validate the feasibility and practicality of the developed model. Comparative and sensitivity analyses are used to check the reliability and strength of the proposed method.},

A complex system has diverse observation features and complex internal structures, which have been difficult to study with regard to health condition estimation. To describe continuous and gradually changing time-based characteristics of a complex system’s health condition, this study develops a feature selection model based on the information amount and stability. Then, a reliability tree analysis model is designed according to the selected relevant features, the reliability tree is developed using expert knowledge, and the node weight is calculated by the correlation coefficient generated during the feature selection process. Using the simple recurrent unit (SRU), which is a time series machine learning algorithm that achieves a high operating efficiency, the results of the reliability tree analysis are combined to establish a tree-structure SRU (T-SRU) model for complex system health condition estimation. Finally, NASA turbofan engine data are used for verification. Results show that the proposed T-SRU model can more accurately estimate a complex system’s health condition and improve the execution efficiency of the SRU networks by approximately 46%.},

The current investigation presents a novel artificial neural network-based solution methodology for the presented problem addressing the properties of Hall current on magneto hydrodynamics (MHD) flow with Jeffery fluid towards a nonlinear stretchable sheet with thickness variation. Generalized heat flux characteristics employing Cattaneo–Christov heat flux model (CCHFM) along with modified Ohms law have been studied. The modelled PDEs are reduced into a dimensionless set of ODEs by introducing appropriate transformations. The temperature and velocity profiles of the fluid are examined numerically with the help of the Adam Bashforth method for different values of physical parameters to study the Hall current with Jeffrey fluid and CCHFM. The examination of the nonlinear input–output with neural network for numerical results is also conducted for the obtained dataset of the system by using Levenberg Marquardt backpropagated networks. The value of Skin friction coefficient, Reynold number, Deborah number, Nusselt number, local wall friction factors and local heat flux are calculated and interpreted for different parameters to have better insight into flow dynamics. The precision level is examined exhaustively by mean square error, error histograms, training states information, regression and fitting plots. Moreover, the performance of the designed solver is certified by mean square error-based learning curves, regression metrics and error histogram analysis. Several significant results for Deborah number, Hall parameters and magnetic field parameters have been presented in graphical and tabular form.},

To do so, most existing studies have used the traditional machine learning algorithms to predict students’ achievement based on their behavior data, from which behavior features are extracted manually thanks to expert experience and knowledge. However, owing to an increase in the varieties and overall volume of behavioral data, it has become more and more challenging to identify high-quality handcrafted features. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning model that automatically extracts features from students’ multi-source heterogeneous behavior data to predict academic performance. The key innovation of this model is that it uses long short-term memory networks to capture inherent time-series features for each type of behavior, and it takes two-dimensional convolutional networks to extract correlation features among different behaviors. We conducted experiments with four types of daily behavior data from students of the university in Beijing. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed deep model method outperforms several machine learning algorithms.},

This method makes graph convolution more similar to conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in Euclidean feature spaces. STC learns subgraphs which have a star topology rather than learning a fixed graph like most spectral methods. Due to the properties of a star topology, STC is graph-scale free (without a fixed graph size constraint). It has fewer parameters in its convolutional filter and is inductive, so it is more flexible and can be applied to large and evolving graphs. The convolutional filter is learnable and localized, similar to CNNs in Euclidean feature spaces, and can share weights across graphs. To test the method, STC was compared with the state-of-the-art graph convolutional methods in a supervised learning setting on nine node properties prediction benchmark datasets: Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, PPI, Arxiv, MAG, ACM, DBLP, and IMDB. The experimental results showed that STC achieved the state-of-the-art performance on all these datasets and maintained good robustness. In an essential protein identification task, STC outperformed the state-of-the-art essential protein identification methods. An application of using pretrained STC as the embedding for feature extraction of some downstream classification tasks was introduced. The experimental results showed that STC can share weights across different graphs and be used as the embedding to improve the performance of downstream tasks.},

To assess controller performance—once the 3-DOF underactuated manipulator robot starts its trajectory—after t = 4.5 s, a fault is activated in its joint No. 2, converting it into a passive joint.

In addition, the cost effectiveness of a CMfg application has rarely been assessed. As a result, a manufacturer is not sure whether to adopt a CMfg application or not. To address this issue, an optimally rectified fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (OR-FAHP) approach is proposed in this study to assess a CMfg application.

  abstract     = {As a first, the paper proposes modelling and learning of specific behaviors for dynamic obstacle avoidance in end-to-end motion planning. In the literature many end-to-end methods have been used in simulators to drive a car and to apply the learnt strategies to avoid the obstacles using the lane changing, following the vehicle as per the traffic rules, driving in-between the lane boundaries, and many more behaviors. The proposed method is designed to avoid obstacles in the scenarios where a dynamic obstacle is headed directly towards the robot from different directions. To avoid the critical encounter of the dynamic obstacles, we trained a novel deep neural network (DNN) with two specific behavioral obstacle avoidance strategies, namely “head-on collision avoidance” and “stop and move”. These two strategies of obstacle avoidance come from the human behavior of obstacle avoidance. Looking at the current frame only, for a very similar visual display of the scenario, the two strategies have contrasting outputs and overall outcomes that makes learning very difficult. A random data recording over general simulations is unlikely to record the corner cases of both behaviors that rarely occur, and a behavior-specific training used in this paper intensifies the same cases for a better learning of the robot in such corner cases. We calculate the intention of the obstacle, whether it will move or not. This proposed method is compared with three state-of-the-art methods of motion planning, namely Timed-Elastic Band, Dynamic Window Approach and Nonlinear Probabilistic Velocity Obstacle. The proposed method beats all the state-of-the-art methods used for comparisons.},

The surrogate-assisted optimization methods have attracted extensive attention as they can get satisfyingly optimal solutions in a limited computing resource. In this paper, we propose a two-stage infill strategy and surrogate-ensemble assisted optimization algorithm for solving expensive many-objective optimization problems. In this method, the population is optimized by a surrogate ensemble. Then a two-stage infill strategy is proposed to select individuals for real evaluations. The infill strategy considers individuals with better convergence or greater uncertainty. To calculate the uncertainty, we consider two aspects. One is the approximate variance of the current surrogate ensemble and the other one is the approximate variance of the historical surrogate ensemble. Finally, the population is revised by the recently updated surrogate ensemble. In experiments, we testify our method on two sets of many-objective benchmark problems. The results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms for solving computationally expensive many-objective optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, large-scale group decision making (LSGDM) has been researched in various fields. Probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS) is an useful tool to describe evaluation information of experts when solving the LSGDM problem. As decision-making becomes more complex, in most cases, decision makers are unable to give complete evaluations over alternatives, which leads to the lack of evaluation information. To estimate missing information, this paper proposes a new method based on knowledge-match degree with reliability that knowledge-match degree means the matching level between evaluation values provided by individual and ones from group. The possession of reliability associated with evaluation information depends on fuzzy entropy of PLTS. Compared with previous methods, this approach can enhance accuracy and reliability of estimated values of missing evaluation information. Based on this method, we develop a complete decision process of LSGDM including information collection, subgroup detecting, consensus reaching process (CRP), information aggregation and ranking alternatives. Subsequently, a case about pharmaceutical manufacturer selection is used to illustrate the proposed decision method. To verify effectiveness and superiority, we make a comparative analysis with other methods and finally draw a conclusion.},

To develop the automatic data volley system, the vision-based game data acquisition is a key technology, which includes the 3D multiple objects tracking, event detection and quality evaluation. This paper combines temporal and spatial features of the game information to achieve the game data acquisition. First, the time-vary fission filter is proposed to generate the prior state distribution for tracker initialization. By using the temporal continuity of image features, the variance of team state distribution can be approximated so that the initial state of each player can be filtered out. Second, the team formation mapping with sequential motion feature is proposed to deal with the detection of event type, which represents the players’ distribution from the spatial concept and the temporal relationship. At last, to estimate the quality, the relative spatial filters are proposed by extracting and describing additional features of the subsequent condition in different situations. Experiments are conducted on game videos from the Semifinal and Final Game of 2014 Japan Inter High School Games of Mens Volleyball in Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium. The results show 94.1% rounds are successfully initialized, the event type detection result achieves the average accuracy of 98.72%, and the success rate of the events’ quality evaluation achieves 97.27% on average.},

As a member of swarm intelligence algorithms, ABC has some advantages in handling optimization problems. However, it has the exploration capacity over the exploitation capacity, which may lead to slow convergence speed and lower solution accuracy. Hence, to enhance the performance of the algorithm, a novel ABC based on Bayesian estimation (BEABC) is presented in this paper. First, instead of using the fitness ratio, the selection probability in ABC is replaced with a new probability calculated by Bayesian estimation. Second, to help the bees adopt more useful information during updating new food sources, a directional guidance mechanism is designed for onlooker bees and scout bees. Finally, the comprehensive performance of BEABC is evaluated by 24 single-objective test functions. The numerical experiment results indicate that BEABC dominates its peers over most test functions, and the significant statistics show that the significant excellence rate of BEABC is $$76\%$$ in the overall comparison. In addition, to further test the performance of BEABC, seven multi-objective problems and two real-word optimization problems are solved. The comparison results show that BEABC can achieve better results than other EA competitors.},

  abstract     = {The selection and assessment process of appropriate robots became a more complex and complicated task due to various available alternatives and conflicting attributes which must take into consideration. Also, uncertainty which exists usually in the selection process is an unavoidable component that needs to be thoughtfully measured and traditional multi-attribute decision-making approaches failed to deal precisely with it. Since almost all decisions originate from subjective ordinal preferences, handling uncertainty using linguistic variables is also not enough. Thus, the objective of the current study is to present a new extended ordinal priority approach in the neutrosophic environment for the first time to select an appropriate robot. Since neutrosophic is one of the most effective and accommodating tools for handling uncertainty, thus, this method goes to transform linguistic information into triangular neutrosophic numbers using a new presented scale. This scale was used to determine the importance degree of attributes and alternatives regarding experts&#39; opinions. Also, the score function of the triangular neutrosophic number is used for prioritizing attributes and alternatives. The experts in our proposed method have the same degree of importance, since each expert is a person with special skills and knowledge representing mastery of a particular subject. To measure the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach, an experimental case study has been established for the robot selection problem of a new pharmaceutical city in Egypt for the first time. The source of data in this case study is experts, interviews, and questionnaires. Also, sensitivity and comparative analysis are further made for verifying the power of the proposed approach. The outcome of this study shows that the suggested approach for robot selection is quite helpful and has a great performance under uncertainty over classical and fuzzy ordinal priority approaches. Also, the suggested approach is less consumption of time and simpler than the fuzzy ordinal priority approach. Therefore, we recommend firms and governments to apply it for increasing product quality, hence the profitability of manufacturing industries and decrease needless costs.},

  abstract     = {Uncertainty is everywhere in the food delivery process, which significantly influences decision-making for complex on-demand food delivery problems, affecting delivery efficiency and customer satisfaction. Especially, the service time is an indispensable part of the delivery process impacted by various uncertain factors. Due to the simplicity and high accuracy requirement, we model the uncertain service time as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). In detail, we transform the distribution estimation problem into a clustering problem by determining the probability of each data belonging to each component (each cluster as well). A hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm is proposed to intelligently solve the clustering problem with the criterion to optimize quality and simplicity simultaneously. First, to optimize the simplicity, problem-specific encoding and decoding methods are designed. Second, to generate initial solutions with good clustering results, a Chinese restaurant process-based initialization mechanism is presented. Third, a weighted-learning mechanism is proposed to effectively guide the update of the probability model. Fourth, a local intensification based on maximum likelihood is used to exploit better solutions. The effect of critical parameters on the performances of the proposed algorithm is investigated by the Taguchi design of the experimental method. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we carry out extensive offline experiments on real-world historical data. Besides, we employ the GMMs obtained by our algorithm in a real-world on-demand food delivery platform, Meituan, to assist decision-making for order dispatching. The results of rigorous online A/B tests verify the practical value of introducing the uncertainty model into the real-life application.},

Indecisive situations are generally undergone when the picture processes with profuse noise. Neutrosophic set (NS), a part of neutrosophy theory, studies the scope of neutralities and is essential to reasoning with incomplete and uncertain information. However, the linguistic neutrosophic cubic set (LNCS) is one of the extensions of the NS. In LNCS, each element is characterized by the interval-valued and single-valued neutrosophic numbers to handle the data uncertainties. Keeping these features in mind, we apply LNCS for image processing after defining their aggregation operators and operations. In this study, noisy grey-scale images were transformed into the LNCS domain using three membership degrees, then aggregated using aggregation operators. The proposed method clarifies the noise in the Lena image and three other test images. It has justified the utilization of operators based on visual clarity obtained. Suitable comparison analysis and efficiency testing is performed on the proposed theory by considering noise types, such as Gaussian, Poisson, and Speckle. In addition, we have also compared the computational efficiency of our proposed method with existing ones. The results show that our approach consumes less memory and executes quicker than the existing methods.

In addition, rumors and incorrect medical information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic are widely shared on social media leading to people’s fear and confusion. Thus, filtering spam content is vital to reduce risks and threats. Previous studies relied on machine learning and deep learning approaches for spam classification, but these approaches have two limitations. Machine learning models require manual feature engineering, whereas deep neural networks require a high computational cost. This paper introduces a dynamic deep ensemble model for spam detection that adjusts its complexity and extracts features automatically. The proposed model utilizes convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction along with base classifiers such as random forests and extremely randomized trees for classifying texts into spam or legitimate ones. Moreover, the model employs ensemble learning procedures like boosting and bagging. As a result, the model achieved high precision, recall, f1-score and accuracy of 98.38%.},

  abstract     = {Most defence mechanisms such as a network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) are often sub-optimal for the detection of an unseen malicious pattern. In response, a number of studies attempt to empower a machine-learning-based NIDS to improve the ability to recognize adversarial attacks. Along this line of research, the present work focuses on non-payload connections at the TCP stack level, which is generalized and applicable to different network applications. As a compliment to the recently published investigation that searches for the most informative feature space for classifying obfuscated connections, the problem of class imbalance is examined herein. In particular, a multiple-clustering-based undersampling framework is proposed to determine the set of cluster centroids that best represent the majority class, whose size is reduced to be on par with that of the minority. Initially, a pool of centroids is created using the concept of ensemble clustering that aims to obtain a collection of accurate and diverse clusterings. From that, the final set of representatives is selected from this pool. Three different objective functions are formed for this optimization driven process, thus leading to three variants of FF-Majority, FF-Minority and FF-Overall. Based on the thorough evaluation of a published dataset, four classification models and different settings, these new methods often exhibit better predictive performance than its baseline, the single-clustering undersampling counterpart and state-of-the-art techniques.

  abstract     = {The theory-guided neural network (TgNN) is a kind of method which improves the effectiveness and efficiency of neural network architectures by incorporating scientific knowledge or physical information. Despite its great success, the theory-guided (deep) neural network possesses certain limits when maintaining a tradeoff between training data and domain knowledge during the training process. In this paper, the Lagrangian dual-based TgNN (TgNN-LD) is proposed to improve the effectiveness of the training process. We convert the original loss function into a constrained form with several items, in which partial differential equations (PDEs), engineering controls (ECs), and expert knowledge (EK) are regarded as constraints, with one Lagrangian variable per constraint. These Lagrangian variables are incorporated to achieve an equitable trade-off between observation data and corresponding constraints, to improve prediction accuracy and training efficiency. To investigate the performance of the proposed method, the original TgNN model with a set of optimized weight values adjusted by ad-hoc procedures is compared on a subsurface flow problem, with their L2 error, R square (R2), and computational time being analyzed. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the Lagrangian dual-based TgNN.},

  abstract     = {The study of fault diagnosis and classification has gained tremendous attention in various aspects of modern industry. However, the performance of traditional fault diagnosis technique solely depends on handcrafted features based on expert knowledge which is difficult to pre-design and has failed in several applications. Deep learning (DL) has achieved remarkable performance in hierarchical feature extraction and learning distinctive feature of dataset from related distribution. However, the challenge associated with DL models is that max-pooling operation usually leads to loss of spatial details during high-level feature extraction. Another concern is the low quality characteristics of 2D time-frequency image which is mostly caused by the presence of noise and poor resolution. This paper proposes a modified wavelet convolutional capsule network with modified enhanced super resolution generative adversarial network plus for fault diagnosis and classification. It uses continuous wavelet transform to convert raw data signals to 2D time-frequency images and applies super resolution generative adversarial technique to enhance the quality of the time-frequency images and finally, the convolutional capsule network learns the extracted high-level features without loss of spatial details for the diagnosis and classification of faults. We validated our proposed model on the famous motor bearing dataset from the Case Western Reserve University. The experimental results show that our proposed fault diagnostic model obtains higher diagnosis accuracy of 99.84% outweighing most traditional deep learning models including state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Electronic countermeasure (ECM) has become one of the most significant factors in modern warfare, in the course of combat, the electronic jamming allocation tasks need to be flexibly adjusted with the change of combat stage, which puts forward higher requirements for the modeling and solution method of this kind of problems. To solve the ECM dynamic weapon target assignment (ECM-DWTA) problem, a hybrid multi-target bi-level programming model is established. The upper level takes the sum of the electronic jamming effects in the whole combat stage as an optimization objective, and locally optimizes the ECM weapon (ECM-WP) assignment scheme in each stage. The lower level takes the importance expectation value of the target subjected to interference and combat consumption as double optimization objectives to globally optimize the ECM-WP assignment scheme. Focus on solving this complex model, a hybrid multi-objective bi-level interactive fuzzy programming algorithm (HMOBIF) is proposed, in this method, exponential membership function is used to describe the satisfaction degree of each level. When solving the multi-objective optimization problem composed of membership functions in the upper and lower levels, we use the MOEA/D algorithm to obtain the Pareto Front (PF) solution set, and then each solution in PF is evaluated and selected by the TOPSIS multi-criteria evaluation method. This local and global interactive optimization process of bi-level model is actually the process of executing observation-orientation-decision-action loop in practical combat. According to the current example, we conduct numerical simulation on the parameters in the model and obtain the parameter values suitable for the model solution. The computational experiments on different scale ECM-DWTA problems show that HMOBIF method is superior to four bi-level programming algorithms in terms of performance index, and can better solve ECM-DWTA problems.},

When the predicted center deviates from the ground truth in the testing phase, the CSP model generates deviated pedestrian bounding box, which leads to false detection in occlusion situations. To handle this problem, we refine the scale regression branch of the CSP model to generate a more accurate prediction. The new scale regression branch outputs the distances between the center and the four edges of the pedestrian bounding box. Even if the predicted center deviates from the ground truth, an accurate bounding box can still be obtained. Moreover, we integrate a self-attention module into our model to take full advantage of the features in different depth layers. Our proposed model achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art detectors in comparison experiments on the two datasets, i.e., Citypersons and Caltech.},

  abstract     = {For the past few years, image fusion technology has made great progress, especially in infrared and visible light image infusion. However, the fusion methods, based on traditional or deep learning technology, have some disadvantages such as unobvious structure or texture detail loss. In this regard, a novel generative adversarial network named MSAt-GAN is proposed in this paper. It is based on multi-scale feature transfer and deep attention mechanism feature fusion, and used for infrared and visible image fusion. First, this paper employs three different receptive fields to extract the multi-scale and multi-level deep features of multi-modality images in three channels rather than artificially setting a single receptive field. In this way, the important features of the source image can be better obtained from different receptive fields and angles, and the extracted feature representation is also more flexible and diverse. Second, a multi-scale deep attention fusion mechanism is designed in this essay. It describes the important representation of multi-level receptive field extraction features through both spatial and channel attention and merges them according to the level of attention. Doing so can lay more emphasis on the attention feature map and extract significant features of multi-modality images, which eliminates noise to some extent. Third, the concatenate operation of the multi-level deep features in the encoder and the deep features in the decoder are cascaded to enhance the feature transmission while making better use of the previous features. Finally, this paper adopts a dual-discriminator generative adversarial network on the network structure, which can force the generated image to retain the intensity of the infrared image and the texture detail information of the visible image at the same time. Substantial qualitative and quantitative experimental analysis of infrared and visible image pairs on three public datasets show that compared with state-of-the-art fusion methods, the proposed MSAt-GAN network has comparable outstanding fusion performance in subjective perception and objective quantitative measurement.},

  abstract     = {To tackle the problem of range anxiety of a driver of an electric vehicle (EV), it is necessary to accurately estimate the power/energy consumption of EVs in real time, so that drivers can get real-time information about the vehicle’s remaining range. In addition, it can be used for energy-aware routing, i.e., the driver can be provided with information that on which route less energy consumption will take place. In this paper, an integrated system has been proposed which can provide reliable and real-time estimate of the energy consumption for an EV. The approach uses Deep Auto-Encoders (DAE), cross-connected using latent space mapping, which consider historical traffic speed to predict the traffic speed at multiple time steps in future. The predicted traffic speed is used to calculate the future vehicle speed. The vehicle speed, acceleration along with wind speed, road elevation, temperature, battery’s SOC, and auxiliary loads are used as input to a multi-channel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict the energy consumption. The prediction is further fine-tuned using a Bagged Decision Tree (BDT). Unlike other existing techniques, the proposed system can be easily generalized for other vehicles as it is independent of internal vehicle parameters. Comparison with other benchmark techniques shows that the proposed system performs better and has a least mean absolute percentage error of 1.57%.},

  abstract     = {Although multiobjective particle swarm optimizers (MOPSOs) have performed well on multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) in recent years, there are still several noticeable challenges. For example, the traditional particle swarm optimizers are incapable of correctly discriminating between the personal and global best particles in MOPs, possibly leading to the MOPSOs lacking sufficient selection pressure toward the true Pareto front (PF). In addition, some particles will be far from the PF after updating, this may lead to invalid search and weaken the convergence efficiency. To address the abovementioned issues, we propose a competitive swarm optimizer with probabilistic criteria for many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs). First, we exploit a probability estimation method to select the leaders via the probability space, which ensures the search direction to be correct. Second, we design a novel competition mechanism that uses winner pool instead of the global and personal best particles to guide the entire population toward the true PF. Third, we construct an environment selection scheme with the mixed probability criterion to maintain population diversity. Finally, we present a swarm update strategy to ensure that the next generation particles are valid and the invalid search is avoided. We employ various benchmark problems with 3–15 objectives to conduct a comprehensive comparison between the presented method and several state-of-the-art approaches. The comparison results demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in terms of searching efficiency and population diversity, and especially shows promising potential for large-scale multiobjective optimization problems.},

In addition, the dynamic collaborative mechanism that contains two methods is designed to enhance the co-evolution of the heterogeneous populations. One, called public path recommendation strategy, is proposed to improve the astringency of Max–Min Ant System. The other is the pheromone fusion mechanism to regulate the pheromone distribution of Ant Colony System when the algorithm falls into stagnation, which can help the algorithm jump out of the local extremum effectively.

To this end, this paper addresses integrated release control and production scheduling problems with uncertain processing times and urgent orders and proposes a convolutional neural network and asynchronous advanced actor critic-based method (CNN-A3C) that involves a training phase and a deployment phase. In the training phase, actor–critic networks are trained to predict the evaluation of scheduling decisions and to output the optimal scheduling decision. In the deployment phase, the most appropriate release control and scheduling decisions are periodically generated according to the current production status based on the networks. Furthermore, we improve the four key points in the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, state space, action space, reward function, and network structure and design four mechanisms: a slide-window-based two-dimensional state perception mechanism, an adaptive reward function that considers multiple objectives and automatically adjusts to dynamic events, a continuous action space based on composite dispatching rules (CDR) and release strategies, and actor–critic networks based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed dynamic scheduling method, it is implemented on a simplified SMS. The simulation experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the unimproved A3C-based method and the common dispatching rules under the new uncertain scenarios.},

To improve the accuracy of cancer survival prediction, in this paper, we propose a priori knowledge- and stability-based feature selection (PKSFS) method and develop a novel two-stage heterogeneous stacked ensemble learning model (BQAXR) to predict the survival status of cancer patients. Specifically, PKSFS first obtains the optimal feature subsets from the high-dimensional cancer datasets to guide the subsequent model construction. Then, BQAXR seeks to generate five high-quality heterogeneous learners, among which the shortcomings of the learners are overcome by using improved methods, and integrate them in two stages through the stacked generalization strategy based on optimal feature subsets. To verify the merits of PKSFS and BQAXR, this paper collected the real survival datasets of gastric cancer and skin cancer from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database of the National Cancer Institute, and conducted extensive numerical experiments from different perspectives based on these two datasets. The accuracy and AUC of the proposed method are 0.8209 and 0.8203 in the gastric cancer dataset, and 0.8336 and 0.8214 in the skin cancer dataset. The results show that PKSFS has marked advantages over popular feature selection methods in processing high-dimensional datasets. By taking full advantage of heterogeneous high-quality learners, BQAXR is not only superior to mainstream machine learning methods, but also outperforms improved machine learning methods, which indicates can effectively improve the accuracy of cancer survival prediction and provide a reference for doctors to make medical decisions.},

  abstract     = {Cloud healthcare system (CHS) can provide the telemedicine services, which is helpful to cope with the difficulty of patients getting medical service in the traditional medical systems. However, resource scheduling in CHS has to face with a great of challenges since managing the trade-off of efficiency and quality becomes complicated due to the uncertainty of patient choice behavior. Motivated by this, a resource scheduling problem with multi-stations queueing network in CHS is studied in this paper. A Markov decision model with uncertainty is developed to optimize the match process of patients and scarce resources with the objective of minimizing the total medical costs that consist of three conflicting sub-costs, i.e., medical costs, waiting time costs and the penalty costs caused by unmuting choice behavior of patients. For solving the proposed model, a three-stage dynamic scheduling method is designed, in which an improved Q-learning algorithm is employed to achieve the optimal schedule. Numerical experimental results show that this Q-learning-based scheduling algorithm outperforms two traditional scheduling algorithms significantly, as well as the balance of the three conflicting sub-costs is kept and the service efficiency is improved.},

  abstract     = {Recently, numerous investors have shifted from active strategies to passive strategies because the passive strategy approach affords stable returns over the long term. Index tracking is a popular passive strategy. Over the preceding year, most researchers handled this problem via a two-step procedure. However, such a method is a suboptimal global-local optimization technique that frequently results in uncertainty and poor performance. This paper introduces a framework to address the comprehensive index tracking problem (IPT) with a joint approach based on metaheuristics. The purpose of this approach is to globally optimize this problem, where optimization is measured by the tracking error and excess return. Sparsity, weights, assets under management, transaction fees, the full share restriction, and investment risk diversification are considered in this problem. However, these restrictions increase the complexity of the problem and make it a nondeterministic polynomial-time-hard problem. Metaheuristics compose the principal process of the proposed framework, as they balance a desirable tradeoff between the computational resource utilization and the quality of the obtained solution. This framework enables the constructed model to fit future data and facilitates the application of various metaheuristics. Competitive results are achieved by the proposed metaheuristic-based framework in the presented simulation.},

To illustrate the applicability and validity of the proposed model, a study case is conducted on three joint hospitals in Chengdu, Chongzhou, and Guanghan, Sichuan Province. The results show that the stochastic programming model and the distributionally robust model can reduce the cost by 78.71% and 38.92%, respectively.

We investigate the contingent sourcing strategy for the manufacturer to cope with the disruption. To this end, we first discuss the optimal post-disruption stockpiling decision for customers. In view of expected disruption duration, price rise, and inventory holding cost, three types of stockpiling behavior are analytically provided for the customers: non-stockpiling, gradual stockpiling, and instantaneous stockpiling. Next, a model is formulated to optimize the joint decision of contingent sourcing time and quantity, with the objective of maximizing profit expectation. Finally, by conducting numerical analysis, we generate further insights into the role of relative factors and provide specific managerial suggestions on how to adapt dynamic contingent sourcing strategies to alleviate different disruptions, under different market environments and customer behaviors.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a retailer who sells perishable fresh products directly to customers through an online channel and encounters a transportation disruption. Products shipped during the disruption period come with an uncontrollable delivery lead time, resulting in product quality degradation. To balance the compensation price provided to customers because of quality losses, the retailer might employ freshness-keeping efforts to reduce the quality loss during transportation. Therefore, it raises several fundamental questions for the retailer in mitigating the disruption. Is it always optimal to satisfy those customers who are willing to purchase during disruption? If it is profitable to fulfill orders along with an extra delivery lead time, and with a quality loss compensation, what is the optimal freshness-keeping effort? If it is preferable to deliberately create unsatisfied demand by announcing shortages (rationing) to customers, when is the optimal time to do so? To answer these questions, we first present the dynamics of post-disruption inventory and demand, taking into account the demand learning effect facilitated from negative word-of-mouth during disruption and the demand recovery after disruption ends. Afterward, we develop a model to achieve the optimal selling strategy for maximizing post-disruption profit, identifying the joint decision of the rationing period and freshness-keeping effort. Finally, by numerical analysis, three types of selling strategies are visually provided to hedge against disruptions of different lengths.},

Remanufacturing systems have recently received much attention, because they play significant roles in end-of-life product recovery, environment protection and resource conservation. Disassembly is treated as a critical step in remanufacturing systems. In practice, it is difficult to know the accurate data of end-of-life products such as disassembly time because of their various usage processes, leading to the great difficulty of making effective and reliable decisions. Thus, it is necessary to model the disassembly process with stochastic programming method where the past collected data are fitted into stochastic distributions of parameters by applying big data technology. Additionally, designing and applying highly efficient intelligent optimization algorithms to handle a variety of complex problems in the disassembly process are urgently needed. To achieve the global optimization of disassembling multiple products simultaneously, this work studies a stochastic multi-product disassembly line balancing problem with maximal disassembly profit while meeting disassembly time requirements. Moreover, a chance-constrained programming model is correspondingly formulated, and then, an enhanced group teaching optimization algorithm incorporating a stochastic simulation method is developed by considering this model’s features. Via performing simulation experiments on real-life cases and comparing it with five popularly known approaches, we verify the excellent performance of the designed method in solving the studied problem.},

Next, we use the dataset to measure the efficiency of highly funded scientists based on the data envelopment analysis. In this way, highly funded scientists are placed into several levels according to their research inputs and outputs. We also give their attractiveness and progress scores compared to other grades.

In this paper, we present a problem integrating order selection and delivery path planning for deliverymen, the objective of which is to maximize the revenue per unit time subject to maximum delivery path length, overdue penalty, reward/penalty for large/small number of orders, and high customer scoring reward. Particularly, we consider uncertain order ready time and customer satisfaction level, which are estimated based on historical habit data of stores and customers using a machine-learning approach. To efficiently solve this problem, we propose a hybrid evolutionary algorithm, which adapts the water wave optimization (WWO) metaheuristic to evolve solutions to the main order selection problem and employs tabu search to route the delivery path for each order selection solution. Experimental results on test instances constructed based on real food delivery application data demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed algorithm compared to a set of popular metaheuristic optimization algorithms.},

Usually the Karnik–Mendel algorithms are the most prevalent approach to complete the type-reduction. Nonetheless, the iterative quality of these types of computational intensive algorithms might impede applying them. For the improved types of algorithms, some noniterative algorithms can enhance the calculation efficiencies greatly, while it is still an open problem for comparing the relation between the discrete TR algorithms and corresponding continuous TR algorithms. First, the sum and integral operations in discrete and continuous noniterative algorithms are compared. Then, three kinds of noniterative algorithms originate from the type-reduction of interval type-2 FLSs are extended to complete the centroid type-reduction of general T2 FLSs. Four computer simulations prove that while changing the number of samples suitably, the calculational results of discrete types of algorithms may accurately gain on the related continuous types of algorithms, and the calculational times of discrete types of algorithms are obviously less than the continuous types of algorithms, this may offer the possible meaning for designing and applying T2 FLSs.},

  abstract     = {Recently, variational autoencoder (VAE), a model that supports Bayesian inference and variational posterior distribution approximation, has been used to address the prevailing challenge of inefficient modelling of non-linear user-item interactions in collaborative filtering (CF). However, the choices of prior distributions in these VAE-based CF models are inadequate to determine the underlying distributions, leading to skewed maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters. In this paper, we present an Implicit Optimal Variational autoencoder model for collaborative filtering (IOVA-CF) to alleviate this challenge. Specifically, IOVA-CF utilizes a novel implicit optimal prior, which aids in generating excellent latent representations. This implicit optimal prior (IoP) is an aggregated posterior prior (AP), that is, the posterior’s expectation of the data distribution. However, unlike previous AP, IoP utilizes the density ratio technique to compute the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence without explicitly capturing the aggregated posterior. Besides, we can calculate the KL divergence between the aggregated posterior and the inference network in a closed-form using the density ratio technique, making IoP an optimal prior for maximizing the objective function. Additionally, unlike earlier VAE-based recommendation models, IOVA-CF significantly alleviates the over-regularization issue. Furthermore, IOVA-CF can adequately capture the latent space’s uncertainty. Finally, empirical evaluations with several competitive baseline models on four (4) real-world datasets reveal the superior performance of IOVA-CF.},

This paper presents various methodologies for source code auto-completion using different Deep Learning models for Python and CSharp Programming Languages. In a resource-limited environment, it is paramount to reduce various overheads: one way of achieving that is to use the code sequences to train and evaluate rather than using other code structures such as semantics. This paper compares various deep learning architectures like CodeGPT [1] from Microsoft, Roberta [2] from huggingface [3] and GPT2 [4] for source code auto-completion. Different dataset strategies are employed for comparison, such as (1) treating the whole code file as a single line, (2) using each line as single individual inputs, and (3) tokenizing the codes snippets before feeding them into the models. We consider the task of autocompletion on two different datasets: (1) Python dataset; (2) CSharp dataset. The Python dataset is processed by a fine-tuned CodeGPT with an overall accuracy of 71%. For the CSharp dataset with the GPT2 model, a PPL of 2.14 and 4.082 on the training and evaluation dataset is observed. Considering the results, we discuss the strength and weaknesses of different approaches in their application in the real world programming context.},

Because of the influence of noises, the evaluations are inaccurate. It is challenging for the existing surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms. Due to the influence of noises, the performance of the surrogate model constructed by these algorithms is degraded. At the same time, noises would mislead the evolution direction. More importantly, because of the limitations of function evaluations, noise treatment methods consuming many function evaluations cannot be applied. An adaptive model switch-based surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm is proposed to solve such problems in this paper. The algorithm establishes radial basis function networks for denoising. An adaptive model switch strategy is adopted to select suited surrogate model from Gaussian regression and radial basis function network. It adaptively selects the sampling strategies based on the maximum improvement in the convergence, diversity, and approximation uncertainty to make full use of the limited number of function evaluations. The experimental results on a set of test problems show that the proposed algorithm is more competitive than the five most advanced surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms.},

In reality, time-sequence is one important sector to reflect hesitant situations as decision makers might have different knowledges of the same alternative at different moments. To perfect the description of such hesitant situations and obtain more reasonable results of decision making, we define a new kind of hesitant fuzzy set, namely, time-sequential hesitant fuzzy set. Meanwhile, its corresponding basic operators, score function and distance measures are proposed. We also propose the concept of fluctuated hesitant information to describe hesitant degrees of decision makers on time-sequences. By comprehensively utilizing the score function, fluctuated hesitant information and distance measures under time-sequential hesitant fuzzy set, a synthetic decision model is proposed. Two illustrated examples and one real-application are utilized to illustrate the effectiveness and advantage of the synthetic decision model under time-sequential hesitant fuzzy set.},

  abstract     = {Portfolio optimization is about building an investment decision on a set of candidate assets with finite capital. Generally, investors should devise rational compromise to return and risk for their investments. Therefore, it can be cast as a biobjective problem. In this work, both the expected return and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) are considered as the optimization objectives. Although the objective of CVaR can be optimized with existing techniques such as linear programming optimizers, the involvement of practical constraints induces challenges to exact mathematical methods. Hence, we propose a new algorithm named F-MOEA/D, which is based on a Pareto front evolution strategy and the decomposition based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. This strategy involves two major components, i.e., constructing local Pareto fronts through exact methods and picking the best one via decomposition approaches. The empirical study shows F-MOEA/D can obtain better approximations of the test instances against several alternative multiobjective evolutionary algorithms with a same time budget. Meanwhile, on two large instances with 7964 and 9090 assets, F-MOEA/D still performs well given that a multiobjective mathematical method does not finish in 7 days.},

Due to its potential and practical applications, this task has attracted much attention. Most of the existing DBD models have achieved competitive performance by aggregating multi-level features extracted from fully convolutional networks. However, they also suffer from several challenges, such as coarse object boundaries of the defocus blur regions, background clutter, and the detection of low contrast focal regions. In this paper, we develop a hierarchical edge-aware network to solve the above problems, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first trial to develop an end-to-end network with edge awareness for DBD. We design an edge feature extraction network to capture boundary information, a hierarchical interior perception network is used to generate local and global context information, which is helpful to detect the low contrast focal regions. Moreover, a hierarchical edge-aware fusion network is proposed to hierarchically fuse edge information and semantic features. Benefiting from the rich edge information, the fused features can generate more accurate boundaries. Finally, we propose a progressive feature refinement network to refine the output features. Experimental results on two widely used DBD datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.},

However, due to the interference of shadow, dynamic background, and camera jitter, constructing a suitable detection network is still challenging. Recently, convolution neural networks have proved its reliability in many fields with their powerful feature extraction ability. Therefore, an interactive spatio-temporal feature learning network (ISFLN) for VFD is proposed in this paper. First, we obtain the deep and shallow spatio-temporal information of two paths with multi-level and multi-scale. The deep feature is conducive to enhancing feature identification capabilities, while the shallow feature is dedicated to fine boundary segmentation. Specifically, an interactive multi-scale feature extraction module (IMFEM) is designed to facilitate the information transmission between different types of features. Then, a multi-level feature enhancement module (MFEM), which provides precise object knowledge for decoder, is proposed to guide the coding information of each layer by the fusion spatio-temporal difference characteristic. Experimental results on LASIESTA, CDnet2014, INO, and AICD datasets demonstrate that the proposed ISFLN is more effective than the existing advanced methods.},

Initially, we extract utterance-level log Mel-spectrograms and their first and second derivative (Static, Delta, and Delta-delta), represented as 3-D log Mel-spectrograms. We utilize deep convolutional neural networks deep convolutional neural networks to extract the deep features from 3-D log Mel-spectrograms. Then a bi-directional-gated recurrent unit network is applied to express long-term temporal dependency out of all features to produce utterance-level emotion. Finally, we use ensemble classifiers using Softmax and Support Vector Machine classifier to improve the final recognition rate. In this way, our proposed framework is trained and tested on Odia (Seven emotional states) and RAVDESS (Eight emotional states) dataset. The experimental results reveal that an ensemble classifier performs better instead of a single classifier.

However, the increasing adoption of smart sensing technologies with the Internet of Things (IoT) made VSN a high-value target for cybercriminals. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques attracted the research community to develop security solutions for IoT networks. Traditional ML and DL approaches that operate with data stored on a centralized server raise major privacy problems for user data. On the other hand, the resource-constrained nature of a smart sensing network demands lightweight security solutions. To address these issues, this article proposes a Federated Learning (FL)-based attack detection framework for VSN. The proposed scheme utilizes a group of Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) with a Random Forest (RF)-based ensembler unit. The effectiveness of the suggested framework is investigated through multiple performance metrics. Experimental findings indicate that the proposed FL approach successfully detected the cyberattacks in VSN with the highest accuracy of 99.52%. The other performance scores, precision, recall, and F1 are attained as 99.77%, 99.54%, and 99.65%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Data distribution presents sparsity in a high-dimensional space, thus difficulty affording sufficient information to distinguish anomalies from normal instances. Moreover, a high-dimensional space may exist many subspaces, obviously, anomalies can exist in any subspaces. This also creates trouble for anomaly mining. Consequently, it is a challenge for anomaly mining in a high-dimensional space. To address this, here proposed a deep hypersphere method fused with probabilistic approach for anomaly mining. In the proposed method, the deep neural network is used as a feature extractor to capture those layered low-dimensional features from the data lying in a high-dimensional space. To promote the ability of the deep neural network to capture these features, the probability approach of sample binary-classification is fused into the loss function, thereby forming the probability deep neural network Then, the hypersphere is used as an anomalous detector. In the low-dimensional features extracted by the deep neural network, the anomalous detector separates anomaly features from normal features. Finally, experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets show that the proposed method not only outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the precision of mined anomalies, but also this hybrid method consisting of deep neural networks and traditional detection methods has outstanding capabilities of mining high-dimensional anomalies. We find that deep neural networks fusing the probabilistic method of sample multi-classification can capture these desired low-dimensional features; moreover, these captured low-dimensional features present more obvious layered characteristics. We also demonstrate that as long as these captured features represent a fewer anomaly instances, it can sufficiently identify anomalies from normal instances.},

  abstract     = {With the vigorous development of the global economy, modern enterprises have agreed to implement green supply chain management. The evaluation and selection of green suppliers plays a vital role in successful green supply chain management. As a multi-attribute group decision-making green supplier selection problem, it is difficult to fully describe the evaluation factors using precise numerical values and classical fuzzy sets, so it cannot assist enterprise managers in making completely reasonable decisions. Therefore, this paper proposes a green supplier evaluation and selection method based on interval BPA-based intuitionistic fuzzy sets. First, build a green supplier evaluation index system based on the characteristics of the papermaking enterprise&#39;s suppliers. Then, the intuitionistic fuzzy number is used to express the indicators of the evaluator for each supplier, and the intuitionistic fuzzy information is integrated through the organic combination of the IIFWA integration operator and the structural entropy weight to obtain the comprehensive evaluation value of the evaluator. Finally, the interval BPA-based intuitionistic fuzzy set method ranks the candidate suppliers and determines the best green supplier. Applying this method to the field of green supplier evaluation and selection can provide an effective method for enterprises to select suppliers scientifically and reasonably, which has practical reference value and practical significance.},

  abstract     = {Person re-identification, one of the most challenging tasks in the field of computer vision, aims to recognize the same person cross different cameras. The local feature information has been proved that can improve performance efficiently. Image horizontal even division and pose estimation are two popular methods to extract the local feature. However, the former may cause misalignment, the latter needs much calculation. To fill this gap and improve performance, an efficient strategy is proposed in this work. First, a joint uneven channel information network consisting of an uneven channel information extraction network and a channel information fusion network is designed. Different from the traditional image division, the former can divide images horizontally and unevenly with strong alignment based on weak pose estimation, and extract multiple channel information. The latter can joint channel information based on channel validity and generate an efficient similarity descriptor. To optimize the joint uneven channel information network efficiently, this work proposes a blend metric loss. The extra image information is utilized to dynamically adjust the penalty for the sample distance and the distance margin based on the outlier of the hardest sample to construct i-TriHard loss. Besides, softmax loss and center loss are embedded in the blend metric loss, which can guide the network to learn more discriminative features. Our method achieves 89.6% mAP and 95.9% Rank-1 on Market-1501, 79.9% mAP and 89.4% Rank-1 on DukeMTMC. The proposed method also performs excellently on occluded datasets.},

  abstract     = {Precise prediction on vacant parking space (VPS) information plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems for it helps drivers to find the parking space quickly to reduce unnecessary waste of time and excessive environmental pollution. By analyzing the historical zone-wise VPS data, we find that for the number of VPSs, there is not only a solid temporal correlation within each parking lot, but also an obvious spatial correlation among different parking lots. Given this, this paper proposes a hybrid deep learning framework, known as the dConvLSTM-DCN (dual Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory with Dense Convolutional Network), to make short-term (within 30 min) and long-term (over 30 min) predictions on the VPS availability zone-wisely. Specifically, the temporal correlations of different time scales, namely the 5-min and daily-wise temporal correlations of each parking lot, and the spatial correlations among different parking lots can be effectively captured by the two parallel ConvLSTM components, and meanwhile, the dense convolutional network is leveraged to further improve the propagation and reuse of features in the prediction process. Besides, a two-layer linear network is used to extract the meta-info features to promote the prediction accuracy. For long-term predictions, two methods, namely the direct and iterative prediction methods, are developed. The performance of the prediction model is extensively evaluated with practical data collected from nine public parking lots in Santa Monica. The results show that the dConvLSTM-DCN framework can achieve considerably high accuracy in both short-term and long-term predictions.},

Carbon emission is restricted by the combination of several policies of carbon mechanism (carbon tax, cap-and-trade and offset policy). Various critical sitchs appear in such realistic process and uncertainty attached with related data. Here we prefer Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy environment to overcome deep uncertainty rather than single uncertainty. After that, we initiate a ranking approach to convert uncertain data into crisp data. To justify the appropriateness of the formulated model and to select the best policy of carbon mechanism, we study two industrial applications with various cases of such mechanism. To derive the Pareto-optimal solution of the problems, two fuzzy techniques, namely, fuzzy programming and Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy programming, are utilized here.

Then, we define new types of rough approximations and accuracy measures with respect to somewhat open and somewhat closed sets. We study their main properties and prove that the accuracy and roughness measures preserve the monotonic property. One of the unique properties of these approximations is the possibility of comparing between them. We also compare our approach with the previous ones, and show that it is more accurate than those induced from open, $$\alpha $$ -open, and semi-open sets.

  abstract     = {Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is one of the most applied techniques for cancer radiotherapy treatment. The fluence map optimization is an essential part of IMRT plan designing, which has a significant impact on the radiotherapy treatment effect. In fact, the treatment planing of IMRT is an inverse multi-objective optimization problem. Existing approaches of solving the fluence map optimization problem (FMOP) obtain a satisfied treatment plan via trying different coupling weights, the optimization process needs to be conducted many times and the coupling weight setting is completely based on the experience of a radiation physicist. For fast obtaining diverse high-quality radiotherapy plans, this paper formulates the FMOP into a three-objective optimization problem, and proposes a conjugate gradient-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (CG-MOEA) to solve it. The proposed algorithm does not need to set the coupling weights and can produce the diverse radiotherapy plans within a single run. Moreover, the convergence speed is further accelerated by an adaptive local search strategy based on the conjugate-gradient method. Compared with five state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), the proposed CG-MOEA can obtain the best hypervolume (HV) values and dose–volume histogram (DVH) performance on five clinical cases in cancer radiotherapy. Moreover, the proposed algorithm not only obtains the more optimal solution than traditional method used to solve the FMOP, but also can find diverse Pareto solution set which can be provided to radiation physicist to select the best treatment plan. The proposed algorithm outperforms dose-volume histogram state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms and traditional method for FMOP on five clinical cases in cancer radiotherapy.},

However, the flexibility of weights and the need for crisp input and output data in the evaluation process are two major shortcomings of classical network DEA models. This paper presents a common weights approach for a relational network DEA model in a fuzzy environment to measure the efficiencies of the system and the component processes. The proposed approach first finds upper bounds on input and output weights for a given cut level and then it determines a common set of weights (CSW) for all decision-making units (DMUs). Hence, the fuzzy efficiencies of all processes and systems for all DMUs are obtained based on the resulting CSW. The developed fuzzy relational network DEA and the proposed common weights approach are illustrated with a numerical example. The obtained results confirm that the fuzzy data affects over the efficiency scores and complete ranking of DMUs. The applicability of the proposed network model is illustrated by performance evaluation of gas refineries in Iran.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle re-identification (ReID) means to identify the target vehicle in large-scale surveillance videos captured by multiple cameras, where robust and distinctive visual features of vehicles are critical to the performance. Recently, the researchers have approached the problem with attention based models. However, most of these models use strongly-supervised methods, which rely on expensive extra labels, e.g., keypoints(vehicle wheels , logo and lamps) and attributes(e.g., color and type). Therefore, we propose a joint metric learning approach to solve the problem. We present an end-to-end Partition and Fusion Multi-branch Network (PFMN), a novel approach to effectively learn discriminative features without any annotations or additional attributes. For hard samples, which means different vehicles with similar appearance or the same vehicle with different appearances, a novel variant of hard sampling triplet loss is proposed. Based on extensive experiments, we have proved the effectiveness of our proposed method. On the challenging public data sets VeRi-776 and VehicleID, our model outperforms most state-of-the-art algorithms on mAP and rank-1. Especially on mINP, which measures the cost of model retrieval hard samples, we can achieve a significant improvement.},

  abstract     = {One important problem in financial optimization is to search for robust investment plans that can maximize return while minimizing risk. The market environment, namely the scenario of the problem in optimization, always affects the return and risk of an investment plan. Those financial optimization problems that the performance of the investment plans largely depends on the scenarios are defined as scenario-based optimization problems. This kind of uncertainty is called scenario-based uncertainty. The consideration of scenario-based uncertainty in multi-objective optimization problem is a largely under explored domain. In this paper, a nondominated sorting estimation of distribution algorithm with clustering (NSEDA-C) is proposed to deal with scenario-based robust financial problems. A robust group insurance portfolio problem is taken as an instance to study the features of scenario-based robust financial problems. A simplified simulation method is applied to measure the return while an estimation model is devised to measure the risk. Applications of the NSEDA-C on the group insurance portfolio problem for real-world insurance products have validated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Unreasonable distribution arises a series of problems such as reduction of tourist satisfaction and decrease of the income in tourist attractions. Based on consideration of tourism route planning, a mathematical model which takes the maximization of the overall satisfaction of all tourist groups as the objective function is established by taking the age and preferences of tourists, the upper limits of the tourist carrying capacity in various tourism routes, etc. as constraints. It aims to maximize income in tourist attractions while improving tourist satisfaction. Based on the tourist data of a travel agency, the statistical ideas of hierarchical clustering and random sampling are utilized to process the acquired data to obtain the simulation examples in the article. Aiming at this model, a knowledge-based hybrid ant colony algorithm is designed. On this basis, the mechanism of bacterial foraging algorithm is introduced. It improves the performance of the algorithm and avoids the generation of local optimal solution. At the same time, two knowledge models are in addition to improve the solution quality of the algorithm. Typical simulation indicates that the improved ant colony algorithm can find the optimal solution at a higher efficiency when solving the tourism route planning problem. The model can also satisfy the economic benefit of enterprises and achieves favorable path optimization effect under different optional routes, thus further verifying the effect liveness of the model.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a counseling (ro)bot called Visual Counseling Agent (VICA) which focuses on remote mental healthcare. It is an agent system leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to aid mentally distressed persons through speech conversation. The system terminals are connected to servers by the Internet exploiting Cloud-nativeness, so that anyone who has any type of terminal can use it from anywhere. Despite a promising voice communication interface, VICA shows limitations in conversation continuity on conventional 4G networks. Concretely, the use of the current 4G networks produces word dropping, delayed response, and the occasional connection failure. The objective of this paper is to mitigate these issues by leveraging a 5G/6G slice inclusive of mobile/multiple edge computing (MEC). First, we propose and partly implement the enhanced and advanced version of VICA. Servers of enhanced versions collaborate to increase speech recognition reliability. Although it significantly increases generated data volume, the advanced version enables a recognition of the facial expressions to greatly enhance counseling quality. Then, we propose a quality assurance mechanism using multiple levels of catalog, as well as 5G/6G slice inclusive of MEC, and conduct experiments to uncover issues related to the 4G. Results indicate that the number of speech recognition errors in Internet Cloud is more than twofold compared to edge computing, implying that quality assurance using 5G/6G in conjunction with VICA Counseling (ro)bot has higher efficiency.},

Dynamic power management is adopted to control the working state transition of Edge Data Center (EDC) servers. A load prediction model based on long-short term memory (LSTM) is creatively proposed. The innovation of the model is to shut down the server in idle state or low utilization in EDC, consider user mobility and EDC location information, learn the global optimal dynamic timeout threshold strategy and N-policy through trial and error reinforcement learning method, reasonably control the working state switching of the server, and realize load prediction and analysis. The results show that the performance of AdaGrad optimization solver is the best when the feature dimension is 3, the number of LSTM network layers is 6, the time series length is 30–45, the batch size is 128, the training time is 788 s, the number of units is 250, and the number of times is 350. Compared with the traditional methods, the proposed load prediction model and power management mechanism improve the prediction accuracy by 4.21%. Compared with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) load prediction, the dynamic power management method of LSTM load prediction can reduce energy consumption by 12.5% and realize the balance between EDC system performance and energy consumption. The system can effectively meet the requirements of multi-access edge computing (MEC) for low delay, high bandwidth and high reliability, reduce unnecessary energy consumption and waste, and reduce the cost of MEC service providers in actual operation.

Leveraging cloud computing, edge computing can be enabled to apply not only large-scale and personalized data but also intelligent algorithms based on offloading the intelligent models to high-performance servers for working with huge volumes of data in the cloud. In this paper, we propose a getaway-centric Internet of Things (IoT) system to enable the intelligent and autonomous operation of IoT devices in edge computing. In the proposed edge computing, IoT devices are operated by a decision-making model that selects an optimal control factor from multiple intelligent services and applies it to the device. The intelligent services are provided based on offloading multiple intelligent and optimization approaches to the intelligent service engine in the cloud. Therefore, the decision-making model in the gateway is enabled to select the best solution from the candidates. Also, the proposed IoT system provides monitoring and visualization to users through device management based on resource virtualization using the gateway. Furthermore, the gateway interprets scenario profiles to interact with intelligent services dynamically and apply the optimal control factor to the actual device through the virtual resource. For implementing the improved energy optimization using the proposed IoT system, we propose two intelligent models to learn parameters of a user’s residential environment using deep learning and derive the inference models to deploy in the intelligent service engine. The inference models are used for predicting a heater energy consumption that is applied to the heater. The heater updates the environment parameters to reach the user-desired values. Moreover, based on two energy consumption values, the decision-making model brings a smaller value to operate the heater to enable reducing the energy consumption as well as providing a user-desired environment.},

However, some local features may be abandoned while sampling. In this paper, We present one end-to-end 3D semantic segmentation framework based on dilated nearest neighbor encoding. Instead of down-sampling point cloud directly, we propose a dilated nearest neighbor encoding module to broaden the network’s receptive field to learn more 3D geometric information. Without increase of network parameters, our method is computation and memory efficient for large-scale point clouds. We have evaluated the dilated nearest neighbor encoding in two different networks. The first is the random sampling with local feature aggregation. The second is the Point Transformer. We have evaluated the quality of the semantic segmentation on the benchmark 3D dataset S3DIS, and demonstrate that the proposed dilated nearest neighbor encoding exhibited stable advantages over baseline and competing methods.},

The data collection process by the IoT sensors is giving access to the various services. However, due to the open communication medium, it is difficult to provide secure access to these services. In this paper, a data transmission technique has been proposed, which will provide secure communication in IoT infrastructure for smart city applications. In this method, each IoT sensor have to prove their legitimacy to the reader and the base station before the transmission of data. Hence, the IoT sensors can transmit the required data in a secure and efficient way. In the proposed technique, the proof of correction shows that the required information is not supposed to send through an online medium, it is obtained at the receiver using the Euclidean parameters shared by the IoT sensors. The proposed technique is compatible to provide the security against most of the attacks performed by the attackers. Two random variables and complex mathematical calculation are making the proposed technique more reliable than others.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of information technology construction, increasing specialized data in the field of informatization have become a hot spot for research. Among them, meteorological data, as one of the foundations and core contents of meteorological informatization, is the key production factor of meteorology in the era of digital economy as well as the basis of meteorological services for people and decision-making services. However, the existing centralized cloud computing service model is unable to satisfy the performance demand of low latency, high reliability and high bandwidth for weather data quality control. In addition, strong convective weather is characterized by rapid development, small convective scale and short life cycle, making the complexity of real-time weather data quality control increased to provide timely strong convective weather monitoring services. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposed the cloud–edge cooperation approach, whose core idea is to effectively combine the advantages of edge computing and cloud computing by taking full advantage of the computing resources distributed at the edge to provide service environment for users to satisfy the real-time demand. The powerful computing and storage resources of the cloud data center are utilized to provide users with massive computing services to fulfill the intensive computing demands.},

In this paper, we present a reconfigurable CRN-based cross-layer routing protocol with the purpose of increasing routing performance and optimizing data transfer in reconfigurable networks. Recently developed spotted hyena optimizer (SHO) is used for tuning the hyperparameters of machine-learning models. The system produces a distributor built with a number of tasks, such as load balance, quarter sensing and the development path of machine learning.

However, the existing DCF paradigm still suffers from dilemmas such as boundary effect, filter degradation, and aberrance. To address these problems, we propose a spatio-temporal joint aberrance suppressed regularization (STAR) correlation filter tracker under a unified framework of response map. Specifically, a dynamic spatio-temporal regularizer is introduced into the DCF to alleviate the boundary effect and filter degradation, simultaneously. Meanwhile, an aberrance suppressed regularizer is exploited to reduce the interference of background clutter. The proposed STAR model is effectively optimized using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Finally, comprehensive experiments on TC128, OTB2013, OTB2015 and UAV123 benchmarks demonstrate that the STAR tracker achieves compelling performance compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) trackers.},

  abstract     = {Edge computing is a distributed architecture that features decentralized processing of data near the source/devices, where data are being generated. These devices are known as Internet of Things (IoT) devices or edge devices. As we continue to rely on IoT devices, the amount of data generated by the IoT devices have increased significantly due to which it has become infeasible to transfer all the data over to the Cloud for processing. Since these devices contain insufficient storage and processing power, it gives rise to the edge computing paradigm. In edge computing data are processed by edge devices and only the required data are sent to the Cloud to increase robustness and decrease overall network overhead. IoT edge devices are inherently suffering from various security risks and attacks causing a lack of trust between devices. To reduce this malicious behavior, a lightweight trust management model is proposed that maintains the trust of a device and manages the service level trust along with quality of service (QoS). The model calculates the overall trust of the devices by using QoS parameters to evaluate the trust of devices through assigned weights. Trust management models using QoS parameters show improved results that can be helpful in identifying malicious edge nodes in edge computing networks and can be used for industrial purposes.},

  abstract     = {The Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) model attracts more users to its services due to its characteristics and rapid delivery approach. This network architecture capability enables users to access the information from the edge of the network. But, the security of this edge network architecture is a big challenge. All the MEC services are available in a shared manner and accessed by users via the Internet. Attacks like the user to root, remote login, Denial of Service (DoS), snooping, port scanning, etc., can be possible in this computing environment due to Internet-based remote service. Intrusion detection is an approach to protect the network by detecting attacks. Existing detection models can detect only the known attacks and the efficiency for monitoring the real-time network traffic is low. The existing intrusion detection solutions cannot identify new unknown attacks. Hence, there is a need of an Edge-based Hybrid Intrusion Detection Framework (EHIDF) that not only detects known attacks but also capable of detecting unknown attacks in real time with low False Alarm Rate (FAR). This paper aims to propose an EHIDF which is mainly considered the Machine Learning (ML) approach for detecting intrusive traffics in the MEC environment. The proposed framework consists of three intrusion detection modules with three different classifiers. The Signature Detection Module (SDM) uses a C4.5 classifier, Anomaly Detection Module (ADM) uses Naive-based classifier, and Hybrid Detection Module (HDM) uses the Meta-AdaboostM1 algorithm. The developed EHIDF can solve the present detection problems by detecting new unknown attacks with low FAR. The implementation results illustrate that EHIDF accuracy is 90.25% and FAR is 1.1%. These results are compared with previous works and found improved performance. The accuracy is improved up to 10.78% and FAR is reduced up to 93%. A game-theoretical approach is also discussed to analyze the security strength of the proposed framework.},

A large part of these vehicles will be electrically driven and connected to a vehicular network. Rapid advancements in vehicular technology and communications have led to the evolution of vehicular edge computing (VEC). Computation resource allocation is a vehicular network’s primary operations as vehicles have limited onboard computation. Different resource allocation schemes in VEC operate in different environments such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, software defined networks and require specific network performance characteristics for their operations to achieve maximum efficiency. At present, researchers have proposed numerous computation resource allocation schemes which optimize parameters such as power consumption, network stability, quality of service (QoS), etc. These schemes are based on widely used optimization and mathematical models such as the Markov process, Shannon’s law, etc. So, there is a need to present an organized overview of these schemes to help in the future research of the same. In this paper, we classify state-of-the-art computation resource allocation schemes based on three criteria: (1) Their optimization goal, (2) Mathematical models/algorithms used, and (3) Major technologies involved. We also identify and discuss current issues in computation resource allocation in VEC and mention the future research directions.},

Data collected over the IoT applications, mostly through the sensors connected over the devices, and with the increasing demand, it is not possible to process all the data on the devices itself. The data collected by the device sensors are in vast amount and require high-speed computation and processing, which demand advanced resources. Various applications and services that are crucial require meeting multiple performance parameters like time-sensitivity and energy efficiency, computation offloading framework comes into play to meet these performance parameters and extreme computation requirements. Computation or data offloading tasks to nearby devices or the fog or cloud structure can aid in achieving the resource requirements of IoT applications. In this paper, the role of context or situation to perform the offloading is studied and drawn to a conclusion, that to meet the performance requirements of IoT enabled services, context-based offloading can play a crucial role. Some of the existing frameworks EMCO, MobiCOP-IoT, Autonomic Management Framework, CSOS, Fog Computing Framework, based on their novelty and optimum performance are taken for implementation analysis and compared with the MAUI, AnyRun Computing (ARC), AutoScaler, Edge computing and Context-Sensitive Model for Offloading System (CoSMOS) frameworks.

Private number plates should be recognized and, monitored for several purposes including security as well as a well-developed traffic system. There is a challenging task for the authorities to recognize and trace the locations for the certain number plate vehicle. In a developing country like Pakistan, it is tough to have higher constraints on the efficiency of any license plate identification and recognition algorithm. Character recognition efficiency should be a route map for the achievement of the desired results within the specified constraints. The main goal of this study is to devise a robust detection and recognition mechanism for non-standard, transitional vehicle license plates generally found in developing countries. Improvement in the character recognition efficiency of drawn and printed plates in different styles and fonts using single using multiple state-of-the-art technologies including machine-learning (ML) models. For the mentioned study, 53-layer deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture based on the latest variant of object detection algorithm-You Only Look Once (YOLOv3) is employed. The proposed approach can learn the rich feature representations from the data of diversified license plates. The input image is first pre-processed for quality improvement, followed by dividing it into suitable-sized grid cells to find the correct location of the license plate. For training the CNN, license plate characters are segmented. Lastly, the results are post-processed and the accuracy of the proposed model is determined through standard benchmarks. The proposed method is successfully tested on a large image dataset consisting of eight different types of license plates from different provinces in Pakistan. The proposed system is expected to play an important role in implementing vehicle tracking, payment for parking fees, detection of vehicle over-speed limits, reducing road accidents, and identification of unauthorized vehicles. The outcome shows that the proposed approach achieves a plate detection accuracy of 97.82% and the character recognition accuracy of 96%.},

It is expected that a smart device will be able to do this evaluation more efficiently in the future. In this study, we evaluated and compared five deep learning algorithms for semantic segmentation of car parts. The baseline reference algorithm was Mask R-CNN, and the other algorithms were HTC, CBNet, PANet, and GCNet. Runs of instance segmentation were conducted with those five algorithms. HTC with ResNet-50 was the best algorithm for instance segmentation on various kinds of cars such as sedans, trucks, and SUVs. It achieved a mean average precision at 55.2 on our original data set, that assigned different labels to the left and right sides and 59.1 when a single label was assigned to both sides. In addition, the models from every algorithm were tested for robustness, by running them on images of parts, in a real environment with various weather conditions, including snow, frost, fog and various lighting conditions. GCNet was the most robust; it achieved a mean performance under corruption, mPC = 35.2, and a relative degradation of performance on corrupted data, compared to clean data (rPC), of 64.4%, when left and right sides were assigned different labels, and mPC = 38.1 and rPC = $$69.6\%$$ when left- and right-side parts were considered the same part.

  abstract     = {Propaganda is a rhetorical technique designed to serve a specific topic, which is often used purposefully in news article to achieve our intended purpose because of its specific psychological effect. Therefore, it is significant to be clear where and what propaganda techniques are used in the news for people to understand its theme efficiently during our daily lives. Recently, some relevant researches are proposed for propaganda detection but unsatisfactorily. As a result, detection of propaganda techniques in news articles is badly in need of research. In this paper, we are going to introduce our systems for detection of propaganda techniques in news articles, which is split into two tasks, Span Identification and Technique Classification. For these two tasks, we design a system based on the popular pretrained BERT model, respectively. Furthermore, we adopt the over-sampling and EDA strategies, propose a sentence-level feature concatenating method in our systems. Experiments on the dataset of about 550 news articles offered by SEMEVAL show that our systems perform state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {Graph entropy is an important measure of the evolution and complexity of networks. Bipartite graph is a special network and an important mathematical model for system resource allocation and management. In reality, a network system usually has obvious directionality. The direction of the network, or the movement trend of the network, can be described with spectrum index. However, little research has been done on the eigenvalue-based entropy of directed bipartite network. In this study, based on the adjacency matrix, the in-degree Laplacian matrix and the in-degree signless Laplacian matrix of directed bipartite graph, we defined the eigenvalue-based entropy for the directed bipartite network. Using the eigenvalue-based entropy, we described the evolution law of the directed bipartite network structure. Aiming at the direction and bipartite feature of the directed bipartite network, we improved the generation algorithm of the undirected network. We then constructed the directed bipartite nearest-neighbor coupling network, directed bipartite small-world network, directed bipartite scale-free network, and directed bipartite random network. In the proposed model, spectrum of those directed bipartite network is used to describe the directionality and bipartite property. Moreover, eigenvalue-based entropy is empirically studied on a real-world directed movie recommendation network, in which the law of eigenvalue-base entropy is observed. That is, if eigenvalue-based entropy value of the recommendation system is large, the evolution of movie recommendation network becomes orderless. While if eigenvalue-based entropy value is small, the structural evolution of the movie recommendation network tends to be regular. The simulation experiment shows that eigenvalue-based entropy value in the real directed bipartite network is between the values of a directed bipartite small world and a scale-free network. It shows that the real directed bipartite network has the structural property of the two typical directed bipartite networks. The coexistence of the small-world phenomena and the scale-free phenomena in the real network is consistent with the evolution law of typical network models. The experimental results show that the validity and rationality of the definition of eigenvalue-based entropy, which serves as a tool in the analysis of directed bipartite networks.},

The chaotic systems have been subedited as one is the master and the other is the slave. They both have different initial conditions and parameters. The variation in the initial conditions leads to the butterfly effect, the concept that is well known in the chaos field and means that both systems diverge over time. Therefore, AINF control scheme has been proposed in this paper as a powerful scheme to get over this problem effectively. The main objective of using the AINF control scheme is that it collects the features of its contents. As the intuitionistic fuzzy gives the system flexibility and helps the controller collecting more information about the problem. The neural networks give the controller the ability to learn over time. The experimental results were obtained to verify the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme against external disturbance and model uncertainties with comparative study.},

To ensure a steady performance of these techniques, it is essential to have knowledge about the range of variables, in which a particular algorithm always provides stable performance and performing stability analysis of an algorithm can help in providing some knowledge regarding the same. Many researchers have performed the stability analysis of several optimization algorithms and analyzed their behavior. Social Group Optimization (SGO) is a newly developed algorithm which has been proven to yield promising results when applied to many real world problems but in literature no work can be found on stability analysis of SGO. In this paper, Von Neumann stability analysis approach has been used for performing stability analysis of Social Group Optimization (SGO) to analyze the behavior of its algorithmic parameters and estimate the range in which they always give stable convergence. The results obtained have been supported by sufficient experimental analysis and simulated using eight benchmark function suite along with their shifted and rotated variations which prove that the algorithm performs better within the stable range and hence convergence is ensured.},

  abstract     = {Various deep neural network architectures (DNNs) maintain massive vital records in computer vision. While drawing attention worldwide, the design of the overall structure lacks general guidance. Based on the relationship between DNN design and numerical differential equations, we performed a fair comparison of the residual design with higher order perspectives. We show that the widely used DNN design strategy, constantly stacking a small design (usually, 2–3 layers), could be easily improved, supported by solid theoretical knowledge and with no extra parameters needed. We reorganise the residual design in higher order ways, which is inspired by the observation that many effective networks can be interpreted as different numerical discretisations of differential equations. The design of ResNet follows a relatively simple scheme, which is Euler forward; however, the situation becomes complicated rapidly while stacking. We suppose that stacked ResNet is somehow equalled to a higher order scheme; then, the current method of forwarding propagation might be relatively weak compared with a typical high-order method such as Runge–Kutta. We propose HO-ResNet to verify the hypothesis on widely used CV benchmarks with sufficient experiments. Stable and noticeable increases in performance are observed, and convergence and robustness are also improved. Our stacking strategy improved ResNet-30 by 2.15% and ResNet-58 by 2.35% on CIFAR-10, with the same settings and parameters. The proposed strategy is fundamental and theoretical and can, therefore, be applied to any network as a general guideline.},

In Bangladesh, the population is increasing rapidly and at the same time, the total cultivable land is decreasing significantly. To ensure maximum crop production using the limited land resources, it is essential to identify and select the appropriate type of soil because different crops need different soil types. Currently, there are two types of methods available to determine the soil type, namely chemical and image analysis. Although the first one is accurate, it is expensive and time consuming. On the other hand, image based soil classification is much cheaper and faster but its accuracy level is low. In this study, we present a novel feature based algorithm that combines quartile histogram oriented gradients (Q-HOG), most frequent $$\varphi $$ -Pixels and a new feature selection method for classifying soil types. We have used four machine learning algorithms and evaluated the performance with different sets of features. We have also compared our work with two prominent and recent works on image-based soil classification systems. The experimental results show that the performance of our proposed method in terms of four standard evaluation metrics, namely accuracy, precision, F1_score, and recall scores are higher than the existing image-based soil classification systems.},

This study aimed to enhance the microexpression features with the help of motion amplification technology. Also, a motion magnification multi-feature relation network (MMFRN) combining video motion amplification and two feature relation modules was proposed. The spatial feature is enlarged while completing the spatial feature extraction, which is used for classification. In addition, we transferred Resnet50 network to extract the global features and improve feature comprehensiveness. The magnification of the features is controlled through hyperparameter amplification factor α. The effects of different magnification factors on the results are compared, and the best is selected. The experiments have verified that the enlarged network can resolve the misclassification problem caused by the one-to-one correspondence between microexpressions and facial action coding units.

Firstly, the product features are extracted by the Apriori algorithm based on online reviews. The sentiment orientation and intensity of the sentiment words for the product features are identified by the lexicon-based sentiment analysis approach. Next, the sentiment orientation of the product features is represented by an intuitionistic fuzzy value. Then the intuitionistic fuzzy TODIM method is used to determine the ranking results of the alternative products. Finally, the case study of mobile phone selection is given to illustrate the proposed approach.

Software defect prediction is divided into traditional software defect prediction and just-in-time software defect prediction (JIT-SDP). However, most of the existing software defect prediction frameworks are relatively simplified, which makes it extremely difficult to provide developers with more detailed reference information. To improve the effectiveness of software defect prediction and realize effective software testing resource allocation, this paper proposes a software defect prediction framework based on Nested-Stacking and heterogeneous feature selection. The framework includes three stages: data set preprocessing and feature selection, Nested-Stacking classifier, and model classification performance evaluation. The novel heterogeneous feature selection and nested custom classifiers in the framework can effectively improve the accuracy of software defect prediction. This paper conducts experiments on two software defect data sets (Kamei, PROMISE), and demonstrates the classification performance of the model through two comprehensive evaluation indicators, AUC, and F1-score. The experiment carried out large-scale within-project defect prediction (WPDP) and cross-project defect prediction (CPDP). The results show that the framework proposed in this paper has an excellent classification performance on the two types of software defect data sets, and has been greatly improved compared with the baseline models.},

Specifically, this paper firstly proposes a novel cooperative multi-populations framework with dual elite selection named CMPMO/des. With four excellent strategies, namely the one-to-one correspondence framework between the optimization objectives and the subpopulations, the global archive for information exchange and cooperation among subpopulations, the logistic chaotic single-dimensional perturbation strategy, and the dual elite selection mechanism based on the fast non-dominated sorting and the reference point-based approach, CMPMO/des achieves considerably high performance on solutions convergence and diversity. Thereafter, in each subpopulation, HHO is used as the single objective optimizer for its impressive high performance. Notably, however, the proposed CMPMO/des framework can work with any other single objective optimizer without modification. We comprehensively evaluated the performance of CMPMO-HHO on 34 multi-objective and 19 many-objective benchmark problems and extensively compared it with 13 state-of-the-art multi/many-objective optimization algorithms, three variants of CMPMO-HHO, and a CMPMO/des based many-objective genetic algorithm named CMPMO-GA. The results show that by taking the advantages of the CMPMO/des framework, CMPMO-HHO achieves promising performance in solving multi/many-objective optimization problems.},

Also, T-SFS is quite effective in the modelling of the uncertainty for decision-making (DM) problems.

  abstract     = {This paper presents an optimization method to solve a multi-objective model of a bi-level linear programming problem with intuitionistic fuzzy coefficients. The idea is based on TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) method. TOPSIS method is a multiple criteria method that identifies a satisfactory solution from a given set of alternatives based on the minimization of distance from an ideal point and maximization of distance from the nadir point simultaneously. A new model of multi-objective bi-level programming problem in an intuitionistic fuzzy environment has been considered. The problem is first reduced to a conventional multi-objective bi-level linear programming problem using accuracy function. Then the modified TOPSIS method is proposed to solve the problem at both the leader and the follower level where various linear/non-linear membership functions are used to represent the flexibility in the approach of decision-makers (DMs). The problem is solved hierarchically, i.e., first the problem at the leader level is solved and then the feasible region is extended by relaxing the decision variables controlled by the leader. The feasible region is extended to obtain a satisfactory solution for the DMs at both levels. Finally, the application of the proposed approach in the production planning of a company has been presented. An illustrative numerical example is also given to explain the methodology defined in this paper.},

  abstract     = {In an asymmetric-key cryptosystem, the secure storage of private keys is a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach for generating the same public and private key pair on a need basis. Hence, the need for secure storage of the private key is done away with. The proposed approach for generating the key pair is based on two factors: fingerprint biometrics and password. A stable binary string is generated from the distances among pairs of minutiae points in a fingerprint using a gray code-based method. Experiments show that gray code representation significantly reduces the number of inconsistencies between the generated bit strings from two instances of the same fingerprint as against the binary code representation. Hence, the Reed–Solomon error correction code successfully corrects errors due to variations in multiple instances of the same fingerprint to induce stability in the generated string. Hash of the stable string generated from the fingerprint and the string generated from hashed password are XORed to derive a stable seed value. The proposed approach uses this seed value to generate two large prime numbers. These prime numbers are used to generate the public and private key pair using the RSA key generation method. This seed value ensures the generation of the same key pair every time. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can ensure a stable generation of the key. It is not required to store either the fingerprint template or the password. Moreover, the generated private key is also not stored. It can be regenerated on a need basis.},

This paper reports a consensus model in GDM, where the opinions of experts are expressed as fuzzy preference relations (FPRs) without additively reciprocal property to cope with the existing uncertainty. The concept of non-reciprocal fuzzy preference relations (NrFPRs) is proposed to capture the considered situation. A novel additive consistency index is constructed to quantify the inconsistency degree of NrFPRs using the relationship of two column/row vectors. An optimization model is constructed, where a new fitness function is proposed by considering the consistency degrees of NrFPRs and the consensus level of a group of experts. A novel concept of acceptable consensus standard is proposed to characterize the acceptance of the consensus process. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is utilized to solve the constructed optimization problem. As compared to the existing models, numerical results show that the proposed model can be used to effectively reach an optimal solution to a GDM problem with NrFPRs.},

In this paper, we introduce a new outlier detection algorithm based on an ensemble method and distance-based data filtering with an iterative approach to detect outliers in unlabeled data. The ensemble method is used to cluster the unlabeled data and to filter out potential isolated outliers from the same by iteratively using a cluster membership threshold until the Dunn index score for clustering is maximized. The distance-based data filtering, on the other hand, removes the potential outlier clusters from the post-clustered data based on a distance threshold using the Euclidean distance measure of each data point from the majority cluster as the filtering factor. The performance of our algorithm is evaluated by applying it to 10 real-world machine learning datasets. Finally, we compare the results of our algorithm to various supervised and unsupervised outlier detection algorithms using Precision@n and F-score evaluation metrics.},

Doc2Vec excellently learns semantically rich embedding (i.e., vector) space from the textual information of judgment corpus. During Doc2Vec learning, the practice of prior domain-specific knowledge can potentially enhance the embedding representation. This research thus proposes a pre-learned word embedding based LDRS (P-LDRS) that learns the Doc2Vec embedding using Legal domain-specific pre-learned word embedding possessing the Legal semantic knowledge. However, learning the judgment embedding from existing substantial Legal documents turns out to be a scalability issue for Doc2Vec. The proposed P-LDRS also provides additional functionality to learn the judgment embedding distributedly over the cluster of computing nodes using frameworks like MapReduce and Spark to address the scalability issue. The empirical analysis is performed with a non-distributed and a distributed variant of the proposed P-LDRS to validate the effectiveness and scalability. Experiment results showcase that proposed non-distributed P-LDRS perform significantly better than traditional Doc2Vec based LDRS with an Accuracy of 0.88, F1-Score of 0.82 and MCC Score of 0.73. They also demonstrate that the proposed distributed P-LDRS improves the time efficiency and achieves stable Accuracy of $$\approx $$ 0.88, F1-Score of $$\approx $$ 0.83 and MCC Score of $$\approx $$ 0.72, with an increasing number of nodes.},

  abstract     = {Identifying criminals in serious crimes from digital images is a challenging forensic task as their faces will be covered in most cases. In addition, the only available information will be hand. A single robust technique to identify the criminals from arm’s hair patterns can be a potential cost-effective and unobtrusive solution in various other areas such as in criminal psychiatric hospitals during rehabilitation to identify and track patients instead of using barcoding, radio frequency identification (RFID), and biometrics. The existing state-of-the-art methods for person identification uses convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM)-based architectures which require the entire data to be trained once again when new data comes. To address these issues, we proposed a novel Siamese network-based architecture which not only reduces this training paradigm but also performs better than several existing methods. Since there were no standard datasets for person identification from arm’s hair patterns, we created a database with several voluntary participants by collecting their hands’ images. Several data augmentation techniques are also used to make the database more robust. The experimental results show that the proposed architecture performs better for the created database with mAP, mINP, and R1 of 94.8, 90.0, and 93.5, respectively. The proposed CTTSN performs well for the closed world person re-identification problem using soft biometric features in real time (52 frames per second).},

These cells are our body&#39;s first line of defense against infections and diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, and fungi, as well as abnormal and external substances that may enter the bloodstream. A wrong WBC count can signify dangerous viral infections, autoimmune disorders, cancer, sarcoidosis, aplastic anemia, leukemia, tuberculosis, etc. A lot of these diseases and disorders can be extremely painful and often result in death. Leukemia is among the more common types of blood cancer and when left undetected leads to death. An early diagnosis is necessary which is possible by looking at the shapes and determining the numbers of young and immature WBCs to see if they are normal or not. Performing this task manually is a cumbersome, expensive, and time-consuming process for hematologists, and therefore computer-aided systems have been developed to help with this problem. This paper proposes an improved method of classification of WBCs utilizing a combination of preprocessing, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), feature selection algorithms, and classifiers. In preprocessing, contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) is applied to the input images. A CNN is designed and trained to be used for feature extraction along with ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0 networks. Ant colony optimization is used to select the best features which are then serially fused and passed onto classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) for classification. The classification accuracy achieved on the Blood Cell Images dataset is 98.44%, which shows the robustness of the proposed work.},

  abstract     = {White blood cells (WBCs) are a portion of the immune system which fights against germs. Leukemia is the most common blood cancer which may lead to death. It occurs due to the production of a large number of immature WBCs in the bone marrow that destroy healthy cells. To overcome the severity of this disease, it is necessary to diagnose the shapes of immature cells at an early stage that ultimately reduces the modality rate of the patients. Recently different types of segmentation and classification methods are presented based upon deep-learning (DL) models but still have some limitations. This research aims to propose a modified DL approach for the accurate segmentation of leukocytes and their classification. The proposed technique includes two core steps: preprocessing-based classification and segmentation. In preprocessing, synthetic images are generated using a generative adversarial network (GAN) and normalized by color transformation. The optimal deep features are extracted from each blood smear image using pretrained deep models i.e., DarkNet-53 and ShuffleNet. More informative features are selected by principal component analysis (PCA) and fused serially for classification. The morphological operations based on color thresholding with the deep semantic method are utilized for leukemia segmentation of classified cells. The classification accuracy achieved with ALL-IDB and LISC dataset is 100% and 99.70% for the classification of leukocytes i.e., blast, no blast, basophils, neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes, respectively. Whereas semantic segmentation achieved 99.10% and 98.60% for average and global accuracy, respectively.

  abstract     = {Medical imaging is an essential medical diagnosis system subsequently integrated with artificial intelligence for assistance in clinical diagnosis. The actual medical images acquired during the image capturing procedures generate poor quality images as a result of numerous physical restrictions of the imaging equipment and time constraints. Recently, medical image super-resolution (SR) has emerged as an indispensable research subject in the community of image processing to address such limitations. SR is a classical computer vision operation that attempts to restore a visually sharp high-resolution images from the degraded low-resolution images. In this study, an effective medical super-resolution approach based on weighted least squares optimisation via multiscale convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has been proposed for lesion localisation. The weighted least squares optimisation strategy that particularly is well-suited for progressively coarsening the original images and simultaneously extract multiscale information has been executed. Subsequently, a SR model by training CNNs based on wavelet analysis has been designed by carrying out wavelet decomposition of optimized images for multiscale representations. Then multiple CNNs have been trained separately to approximate the wavelet multiscale representations. The trained multiple convolutional neural networks characterize medical images in many directions and multiscale frequency bands, and thus facilitate image restoration subject to increased number of variations depicted in different dimensions and orientations. Finally, the trained CNNs regress wavelet multiscale representations from a LR medical images, followed by wavelet synthesis that forms a reconstructed HR medical image. The experimental performance indicates that the proposed model SR restoration approach achieve superior SR efficiency over existing comparative methods},

  abstract     = {Diabetes, the fastest growing health emergency, has created several life-threatening challenges to public health globally. It is a metabolic disorder and triggers many other chronic diseases such as heart attack, diabetic nephropathy, brain strokes, etc. The prime objective of this work is to develop a prognosis tool based on the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset that will help medical practitioners in reducing the lethality associated with diabetes. Based on the features present in the dataset, two prediction models have been proposed by employing deep learning (DL) and quantum machine learning (QML) techniques. The accuracy has been used to evaluate the prediction capability of these developed models. The outlier rejection, filling missing values, and normalization have been used to uplift the discriminatory performance of these models. Also, the performance of these models has been compared against state-of-the-art models. The performance measures such as precision, accuracy, recall, F1 score, specificity, balanced accuracy, false detection rate, missed detection rate, and diagnostic odds ratio have been achieved as 0.90, 0.95, 0.95, 0.93, 0.95, 0.95, 0.03, 0.02, and 399.00 for DL model respectively, However for QML, these measures have been computed as 0.74, 0.86, 0.85, 0.79, 0.86, 0.86, 0.11, 0.05, and 35.89 respectively. The proposed DL model has a high diabetes prediction accuracy as compared with the developed QML and existing state-of-the-art models. It also uplifts the performance by 1.06% compared to reported work. However, the performance of the QML model has been found as satisfactory and comparable with existing literature.},

However, insufficient high-quality training data are available for building EEG-based emotion recognition models via machine learning or deep learning methods. The artificial generation of high-quality data is an effective approach for overcoming this problem. In this paper, a multi-generator conditional Wasserstein GAN method is proposed for the generation of high-quality artificial that covers a more comprehensive distribution of real data through the use of various generators.

This tiresome assignment has fuelled the researcher’s efforts to present an automated technique for gastrointestinal infections detection. The segmentation of stomach infections is a challenging task because the lesion region having low contrast and irregular shape and size. To handle this challenging task, in this research work a new deep semantic segmentation model is suggested for 3D-segmentation of the different types of stomach infections. In the segmentation model, deep labv3 is employed as a backbone of the ResNet-50 model. The model is trained with ground-masks and accurately performs pixel-wise classification in the testing phase. Similarity among the different types of stomach lesions accurate classification is a difficult task, which is addressed in this reported research by extracting deep features from global input images using a pre-trained ResNet-50 model. Furthermore, the latest advances in the estimation of uncertainty and model interpretability in the classification of different types of stomach infections is presented. The classification results estimate uncertainty related to the vital features in input and show how uncertainty and interpretability might be modeled in ResNet-50 for the classification of the different types of stomach infections. The proposed model achieved up to 90% prediction scores to authenticate the method performance.},

  abstract     = {Multiclass classification of brain tumors is an important area of research in the field of medical imaging. Since accuracy is crucial in the classification, a number of techniques are introduced by computer vision researchers; however, they still face the issue of low accuracy. In this article, a new automated deep learning method is proposed for the classification of multiclass brain tumors. To realize the proposed method, the Densenet201 Pre-Trained Deep Learning Model is fine-tuned and later trained using a deep transfer of imbalanced data learning. The features of the trained model are extracted from the average pool layer, which represents the very deep information of each type of tumor. However, the characteristics of this layer are not sufficient for a precise classification; therefore, two techniques for the selection of features are proposed. The first technique is Entropy–Kurtosis-based High Feature Values (EKbHFV) and the second technique is a modified genetic algorithm (MGA) based on metaheuristics. The selected features of the GA are further refined by the proposed new threshold function. Finally, both EKbHFV and MGA-based features are fused using a non-redundant serial-based approach and classified using a multiclass SVM cubic classifier. For the experimental process, two datasets, including BRATS2018 and BRATS2019, are used without increase and have achieved an accuracy of more than 95%. The precise comparison of the proposed method with other neural nets shows the significance of this work.},

The unexpected joint lock may suddenly happen when quadruped robots are implementing normal gaits, and maintaining the primal movement patterns to finish targeted tasks could be disastrous. In this paper, a fault-tolerant motion planning and generation method for quadruped robots with joint lock is proposed. Fault-tolerant cases on three types of joints on legs are investigated, and equivalent geometric models are proposed to reconstruct kinematics. To make unnecessary deformation of gait patterns as small as possible, the body posture and standing height of quadruped robots are to be optimized based on the nonlinear equivalent geometry models with constraints. The proposed fault-tolerant method is applicable to constructing a quasi-static whole-body controller, and it does not require additional operations and constraints of the fault leg. To validate the consistency and stability of the proposed fault-tolerant method, the experiments are implemented on the three joint lock failure scenarios for quadruped robots.},

It is applied to bilateral teleoperation, with the goal of handling different object/tool/landmark locations in the user and robot workspaces while the remote objects are moving online. The proposed approach can generate trajectories in an online manner to adapt to moving objects, where impedance controllers allow the user to exploit the haptic feedback to teleoperate the robot. Teleoperation experiments of pick-and-place tasks and valve turning tasks are carried out with two 7-axis torque-controlled Panda robots.

In this paper, we present a probabilistic formulation for inferring the user intent by taking consideration of user behavior. In our approach, the user behavior is learned from demonstrations, which is then incorporated in goal prediction and path planning. Using maximum entropy principle, two goal prediction methods are tailored according to the similarity metrics between user’s short-term movements and the learned user behavior. We have validated the proposed approaches with a user study—examining the performance of our goal prediction methods in approaching tasks in multiple goals scenario. The results show that our approaches perform well in user goal prediction and are able to respond quickly to dynamic changing of the user’s goals.

Motion of the serial manipulator and SwarmItFIX robots’ coordinated locomotion are divided into three sub-problems, viz, trajectory planning of serial manipulator, task planning of SwarmItFIX robots, and homogenous prioritized multi-robot path planning of SwarmItFIX robots. Mathematical formulation of all the three sub-problems is developed and presented in this paper. A hexagonal segment that fits inside the boundaries of the workspace is considered as the machining trajectory. The tool velocity is assumed to be constant as it improves the quality of machining. The results obtained from the proposed planner is found to be efficient as the task planning module has computed the precise support locations and support duration for the SwarmItFIX robots. The multi-robot path planning module of the planner computes the optimal collision-free paths of SwarmItFIX robots for all goal positions. Finally, trajectories of SwarmItFIX robots are found to be completely in-line with the trajectory of tool center point (TCP) of the serial manipulator.},

However, the two-dimensional images acquired by endoscopy lack depth information. Future automatic robotic surgeries need three-dimensional information of the target area. This paper presents a method to reconstruct a 3D model of soft tissues from image sequences acquired from a robotic camera holder. In this algorithm, a sparse reconstruction module based on the SIFT and SURF features is designed, and a multilevel feature matching strategy is proposed to improve the algorithm efficiency. To recover the realistic effect of the soft-tissue model, a complete 3D reconstruction algorithm is implemented, including densification, meshing of the point cloud and texture mapping reconstruction. During the texture reconstruction stage, a mathematical model is proposed to achieve the repair of texture seams. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, we use a collaborative manipulator (AUBO i5) with a mounted camera to mimic an assistant surgeon holding an endoscope. To satisfy a pivotal constraint imposed by the remote center of motion (RCM), a kinematic algorithm of the manipulator is implemented, and the primary surgeon is provided with a voice control interface to control the directions of the camera with. We conducted an experiment to show a 3D reconstruction of soft tissue by the proposed method and the manipulator, which indicates that the manipulator works as a robotic assistant which can hold a camera to provide abundant information in the surgery.},

In this work, we present a scene-oriented grasp estimation scheme taking constraints of the grasp pose imposed by the environment into consideration and training on samples satisfying the constraints. We formulate valid grasps for a parallel-jaw gripper as vectors in a two-dimensional (2D) image and detect them with a fully convolutional network that simultaneously estimates the vectors’ origins and directions. The detected vectors are then converted to 6 degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) grasps with a tailored strategy. As such, the network is able to detect multiple grasp candidates from a cluttered scene in one shot using only an RGB image as input. We evaluate our approach on the GraspNet-1Billion dataset and archived comparable performance as state-of-the-art while being efficient in runtime.},

  abstract     = {Remote center of motion (RCM) constraint has attracted many research interests as one of the key challenges for robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS). Although it has been addressed by many studies, few of them treated the motion constraint with an independent workspace solution, which means they rely on the kinematics of the robot manipulator. This makes it difficult to replicate the solutions on other manipulators, which limits their population. In this paper, we propose a novel control framework by incorporating model predictive control (MPC) with the fuzzy approximation to improve the accuracy under the motion constraint. The fuzzy approximation is introduced to manage the kinematic uncertainties existing in the MPC control. Finally, simulations were performed and analyzed to validate the proposed algorithm. By comparison, the results prove that the proposed algorithm achieved success and satisfying performance in the presence of external disturbances.},

  abstract     = {Dual-arm robot manipulation is applicable to many domains, such as industrial, medical, and home service scenes. Learning from demonstrations is a highly effective paradigm for robotic learning, where a robot learns from human actions directly and can be used autonomously for new tasks, avoiding the complicated analytical calculation for motion programming. However, the learned skills are not easy to generalize to new cases where special constraints such as varying relative distance limitation of robotic end effectors for human-like cooperative manipulations exist. In this paper, we propose a dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) based skills learning framework for redundant dual-arm robots. The method, with a coupling acceleration term to the DMPs function, is inspired by the transient performance control of Barrier Lyapunov Functions. The additional coupling acceleration term is calculated based on the constant joint distance and varying relative distance limitations of end effectors for object-approaching actions. In addition, we integrate the generated actions in joint space and the solution for a redundant dual-arm robot to complete a human-like manipulation. Simulations undertaken in Matlab and Gazebo environments certify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Telemanipulation in power stations commonly require robots first to open doors and then gain access to a new workspace. However, the opened doors can easily close by disturbances, interrupt the operations, and potentially lead to collision damages. Although existing telemanipulation is a highly efficient master–slave work pattern due to human-in-the-loop control, it is not trivial for a user to specify the optimal measures to guarantee safety. This paper investigates the safety-critical motion planning and control problem to balance robotic safety against manipulation performance during work emergencies. Based on a dynamic workspace released by door-closing, the interactions between the workspace and robot are analyzed using a partially observable Markov decision process, thereby making the balance mechanism executed as belief tree planning. To act the planning, apart from telemanipulation actions, we clarify other three safety-guaranteed actions: on guard, defense and escape for self-protection by estimating collision risk levels to trigger them. Besides, our experiments show that the proposed method is capable of determining multiple solutions for balancing robotic safety and work efficiency during telemanipulation tasks.},

  abstract     = {For the lower limb rehabilitation robot, how to better realize intention recognition is the key issue in the practical application. Recognition of the patient’s movement intention is a challenging research work, which needs to be studied from the shallow to the deep. Specifically, it is necessary to ensure that the movement intention of the normal person can be accurately recognized, and then improve the model to realize the recognition of the movement intention of the patients. Therefore, before studying the patient’s movement intention, it is essential to consider the normal person first, which is also for safety considerations. In recent years, a new Hill-based muscle model has been demonstrated to be capable of directly estimating the joint angle intention in an open-loop form. On this basis, by introducing a recurrent neural network (RNN), the whole prediction process can achieve more accuracy in a closed-loop form. However, for the traditional RNN algorithms, the activation function must be convex, which brings some limitations to the solution of practical problems. Especially, when the convergence speed of the traditional RNN model is limited in the practical applications, as the error continues to decrease, the convergence performance of the traditional RNN model will be greatly affected. To this end, a projected recurrent neural network (PRNN) model is proposed, which relaxes the condition of the convex function and can be used in the saturation constraint case. In addition, the corresponding theoretical proof is given, and the PRNN method with saturation constraint has been successfully applied in the experiment of intention recognition of lower limb movement compared with the traditional RNN model.},

  abstract     = {Transportation electrification is known to be a viable alternative to deal with the alarming issues of global warming, air pollution, and energy crisis. Public acceptance of Electric Vehicles (EVs) requires the availability of charging infrastructure. However, the optimal placement of chargers is indeed a complex problem with multiple design variables, objective functions, and constraints. Chargers must be placed with the EV drivers’ convenience and security of the power distribution network being taken into account. The solutions to such an emerging optimization problem are mostly based on metaheuristics. This work proposes a novel metaheuristic considering the hybridization of Chicken Swarm Optimization (CSO) with Ant Lion Optimization (ALO) for effectively and efficiently coping with the charger placement problem. The amalgamation of CSO with ALO can enhance the performance of ALO, thereby preventing it from getting stuck in the local optima. Our hybrid algorithm has the strengths from both CSO and ALO, which is tested on the standard benchmark functions as well as the above charger placement problem.

  abstract     = {In recent years, evolutionary algorithms have shown great advantages in the field of feature selection because of their simplicity and potential global search capability. However, most of the existing feature selection algorithms based on evolutionary computation are wrapper methods, which are computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional biomedical data. To significantly reduce the computational cost, it is essential to study an effective evaluation method. In this paper, a two-stage improved gray wolf optimization (IGWO) algorithm for feature selection on high-dimensional data is proposed. In the first stage, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network with group lasso regularization terms is first trained to construct an integer optimization problem using the proposed algorithm for pre-selection of features and optimization of the hidden layer structure. The dataset is compressed using the feature subset obtained in the first stage. In the second stage, a multilayer perceptron network with group lasso regularization terms is retrained using the compressed dataset, and the proposed algorithm is employed to construct the discrete optimization problem for feature selection. Meanwhile, a rapid evaluation strategy is constructed to mitigate the evaluation cost and improve the evaluation efficiency in the feature selection process. The effectiveness of the algorithm was analyzed on ten gene expression datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm not only removes almost more than 95.7% of the features in all datasets, but also has better classification accuracy on the test set. In addition, the advantages of the proposed algorithm in terms of time consumption, classification accuracy and feature subset size become more and more prominent as the dimensionality of the feature selection problem increases. This indicates that the proposed algorithm is particularly suitable for solving high-dimensional feature selection problems.},

In this paper, we consider non-convex constrained search space and model a real aero-engine calibration problem as a many-objective optimisation problem. A fast many-objective evolutionary optimisation algorithm with shift-based density estimation, called fSDE, is designed to search for parameters with an acceptable performance accuracy and improve the calibration efficiency. Our approach is compared to several state-of-the-art many- and multi-objective optimisation algorithms on the well-known many-objective optimisation benchmark test suite and a real aero-engine calibration problem, and achieves superior performance. To further validate our approach, the studied aero-engine calibration is also modelled as a single-objective optimisation problem and optimised by some classic and state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms, compared to which fSDE not only provides more diverse solutions but also finds solutions of high-quality faster.},

It is very challenging to directly solve such large-scale problems using heuristic algorithms or commercial solvers. Considering that the decision space of such problems is usually sparse and has a block-like structure, we propose to use decomposition methods to accelerate the optimization process. However, the existing decomposition methods require that the problem has strict block structures, which is not suitable for our problem. To deal with problems with such block-like structures, we propose a game theory based decomposition algorithm. This new method can overcome the large-scale issue and guarantee convergence to some extent, as it can narrow down the search space and accelerate the convergence. Extensive experimental results on real-world industrial manufacturing planning problems show that our method is more effective than the world fastest commercial solver Gurobi. The results also indicate that our method is less sensitive to the problem scale comparing with Gurobi.},

Hence, a surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm is proposed in this paper for this kind of problem. Specifically, random forest models are embedded in the framework of the evolutionary algorithm as surrogates to improve approximate accuracy for discrete optimization problems. To enhance the optimization efficiency, an improved stochastic ranking strategy based on the fitness mechanism and adaptive probability operator is presented, which also takes into account both convergence and diversity to advance the quality of candidate solutions. To validate the proposed algorithm, it is comprehensively compared with several well-known optimization algorithms on several benchmark problems.

  abstract     = {Virtual environment (VE), as the proxy of slave contact environment, is the most promising technology to solve the time-delay problems in teleoperation. The accuracy of the predicted force depends not only on the reliability of the contact model but also on the estimation algorithm’s adaptability. A new contact model is proposed to be applicable in various materials, which includes both the Kelvin–Voigt model (KVM) and Hunt–Crossley model (HCM). An extra parameter is set in the model to express the capacity of continuous switching between KVM and HCM, whose rationality is proved based on the energy loss. The energy loss is proportional to a power of impact velocity, and the exponent is bounded at [2,3], which exactly lies between KVM and HCM. Furthermore, to estimate the parameters with a single-stage method, the nonlinear model is linearized approximatively with logarithm function and polynomials. Then, the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm combining forgetting factor and self-perturbing action is designed to identify the four parameters online. Finally, the model’s continuous switching is verified with ideal simulation, and the model parameters are continuously changed without jumpy switch error. In the experiment, sponge, foam, and human hand represent the complex contact materials of the slave environment where the predicted force is shown to follow the real contact force with enough accuracy. Therefore, the virtual model can be considered the substitution of slave contact environment so that the feedback force in master can be calculated in real-time.},

An immense number of frameworks are available for speech processing and recognition for languages persisting around the globe. However, a limited number of automatic speech recognition systems are available for commercial use. The gap between the languages being spoken around the globe and the technical support available to these languages are very few. This paper examined major challenges for speech recognition for different languages. Analysis of the literature shows that lack of standard databases availability of minority languages hinder the research recognition research across the globe. When compared with non-Indian languages, the research on speech recognition of Indian languages (except Hindi) has not achieved the expected milestone yet. Combination of MFCC and DNN–HMM classifier is most commonly used system for developing ASR minority languages, whereas in some of the majority languages, researchers are using much advance algorithms of DNN. It has also been observed that the research in this field is quite thin and still more research needs to be carried out, particularly in the case of minority languages.},

  abstract     = {We live in the era of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), which is an extension of Vehicular AdHoc Networks (VANETs). In VANETs, vehicles act as nodes connected with each other and sometimes with a public station. Vehicles continuously exchange and collect information to provide innovative transportation services; for example, traffic management, navigation, autonomous driving, and the generation of alerts. However, VANETs are extremely challenging for data collection, due to their high mobility and dynamic network topologies that cause frequent link disruptions and make path discovery difficult. In this survey, various state-of-the-art data collection protocols for VANETs are discussed, based on three broad categories, i.e., delay-tolerant, best-effort, and real-time protocols. A taxonomy is designed for data collection protocols for VANETs that is essential to add precision and ease of understandability. A detailed comparative analysis among various data collection protocols is provided to highlight their functionalities and features. Protocols are evaluated based on three parametric phases. First, protocols investigation based on six necessary parameters, including delivery and drop ratio, efficiency, and recovery strategy. Second, a 4-D functional framework is designed to fit most data collection protocols for quick classification and mobility model identification, thus eradicating the need to read extensive literature. In the last, in-depth categorical mapping is performed to deep dive for better and targeted interpretation. In addition, some open research challenges for ITS and VANETs are discussed to highlight research gaps. Our work can thus be employed as a quick guide for researchers to identify the technical relevance of data collection protocols of VANETs.},

The first channel follows a vendor managed inventory with consignment stock (VMI-CS) agreement between the vendor and buyers. The supply lead time between the vendor and the buyer is considered controllable, at a cost. Two models are analyzed: (1) in the first model, the standard and customized product’s demand rate is assumed to be price and lead time-sensitive, and (2) in the second model, the demands are uncertain or ambiguous and are treated as a trapezoidal fuzzy number. It is reasonably complex to obtain analytical solutions. Hence, two algorithms are proposed to obtain the numerical solution with the objective of maximizing total profit. Numerical examples, sensitivity analysis, and managerial insights are given to test the model. Finally, conclusions and directions for future research are provided.},

  abstract     = {For continuous growth and sustaining the competitiveness of a company, product developers spend most of their time making crucial decisions to address a great variety of unpredictable and uncontrollable information. Several mathematical approaches have already been adopted to aid the developers in selecting the best product concept for meeting customers’ requirements and exceeding their expectations. However, those methods do not cope with fully revealed developers’ preferences and do not take into account the random distribution of the target values of engineering characteristics (ECs). In this paper, the application of a quality function deployment (QFD)-based model and a stochastic dominance-based method is presented for product concept development. The first phase in the approach is to construct a product planning house of quality (PPHoQ), which is the core and the engine of the entire QFD model. This model depicts the relationship between the customers’ requirements (CRs) and the ECs for a product. The proposed approach addresses both the relationships between CRs and ECs, in addition to the correlations among the ECs. In this study, developers are invited to express their preferences using different types of linguistic terms dependent on their diverse backgrounds and understanding levels of the product. Based on the outcomes of the PPHoQ process, a variety of alternative concepts can be created. The alternatives are then prioritized and ranked in the second phase. The proposed approach facilitates the random distribution with stochastic variables rather than fuzzy methods to obtain more realistic product concept alternatives. Several examples and comparative results further illustrate that unbalanced linguistic terms and stochastic dominance efficiently endow the product concept selection model with uncertain information and the random distribution in a realistic style.},

  abstract     = {For motion control of uncertain servomechanisms, nonlinear dynamics including smooth and nonsmooth types, external disturbances, signal measurement noises, asymmetric input saturation, and so on seriously hinder the further development of high-performance closed-loop control algorithms. However, already existing control strategies cannot address the above-mentioned issues at the same time. It greatly increases the difficulty of controller design especially when some states are not measurable. Inspired by above motivations, this paper exploits neural networks to deal with nonlinear dynamics including discontinuous types, and combines extended state observers to estimate disturbances and unmeasurable states for uncertain nonlinear servomechanisms. Meanwhile, the desired-command-based model compensation approach is integrated into the controller design. It is worth noting that the neural network weights are updated by the combination of the estimation error and tracking error to acquire better approximation accuracy. According to above technologies, a novel extended-state-observer-based neural network adaptive motion control algorithm will be synthesized. The bounded stability of the whole closed-loop system is proved strictly. In addition, the comparisons of the application results on an electro-hydraulic servo system verify the availability and superiority of the developed control algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Automated segmentation of cardiac pathology in MRI plays a significant role for diagnosis and treatment of some cardiac disease. In clinical practice, multi-modality MRI is widely used to improve the cardiac pathology segmentation, because it can provide multiple or complementary information. Recently, deep learning methods have presented implausible performance in multi-modality medical image segmentation. However, how to fuse the underlying multi-modality information effectively to segment the pathology with irregular shapes and small region at random locations, is still a challenge task. In this paper, a triple-attention-based multi-modality MRI fusion U-Net was proposed to learn complex relationship between different modalities and pay more attention on shape information, thus to achieve improved pathology segmentation. First, three independent encoders and one fusion encoder were applied to extract specific and multiple modality features. Secondly, we concatenate the modality feature maps and use the channel attention to fuse specific modal information at every stage of the three dedicate independent encoders, then the three single modality feature maps and channel attention feature maps are together concatenated to the decoder path. Spatial attention was adopted in decoder path to capture the correlation of various positions. Once more, we employ shape attention to focus shape-dependent information. Lastly, the training approach is made efficient by introducing deep supervision mechanism with object contextual representations block to ensure precisely boundary prediction. Our proposed network was evaluated on the public MICCAI 2020 Myocardial pathology segmentation dataset which involves patients suffering from myocardial infarction. Experiments on the dataset with three modalities demonstrate the effectiveness of fusion mode of our model, and attention mechanism can integrate various modality information well. We demonstrated that such a deep learning approach could better fuse complementary information to improve the segmentation performance of cardiac pathology.},

Few frameworks can understand the financial terms in literature, and the volatile nature of stock markets further complicates this process. This paper has tried to overcome the existing challenges by introducing a DL-based framework using financial news articles to forecast the stock market. After performing preprocessing step, the deep contextualized word representation (DCWR) approach is applied for feature extraction. In the next step, the independent component analysis (ICA) method is used for feature reduction. Finally, the resultant features train the hierarchical attention networks (HANet) classifier to predict the stock movements.

  abstract     = {The incidence of inter-city bus accidents receives a lot of attention from the public because they often cause heavy casualties. The Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) is the prevailing tool used for traffic accident risk assessment. However, it has several shortcomings, for example: (1) it can only identify the potential failure modes, but lacks the capability for quantitative risk assessment; (2) it neglects the severity, occurrence and detection of different failure modes; (3) it is unable to identify the degree of risk and priorities of the failure modes. This study proposes a novel hybrid model to overcome these problems. First, the HFACS is applied to enumerate the failure modes of inter-city bus operation.

  abstract     = {Probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS) provides a much more effective model to compute with words and to express the uncertainty in the pervasive natural language by probability information. In this paper, to avoid loss of information, we redefine the classical probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) by multiple probability distributions from an ambiguity perspective and present some basic operations using Archimedean t-(co)norms. Different from the classical PLTSs, the reformulated PLTSs are not necessarily normalized beforehand for further investigations. Moreover, the multiple probability distributions based PLTSs facilitate the incorporation of the different attitudes of the DMs in their score values and the deviation, and thus the comparisons. Then the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method is extended to the reformulated PLTS frame by incorporating probability information. With these newly developed elements in the reformulated PLTSs, a DEMATEL based multiple attributes decision-making is proposed. The illustrative example and comparison analysis show that the method over the reformulated PLTSs is feasible and valid, and has the advantage in processing without any information loss (i.e., without normalization) and fully exploration of the DMs-preference and knowledge.},

In this article, in linear Diophantine fuzzy (LDF) graphs, we present special forms of linear Diophantine fuzzy bridges, cut-vertices, cycles, trees, forests, and introduce some of their characteristics. Also, one of the most researched issues in linear Diophantine fuzzy sets (LDFS) and systems is the minimum spanning tree (MST) problem, where the arc costs have linear Diophantine fuzzy (LDF) values. In this work, we focus on an MST issue on a linear Diophantine fuzzy graph (LDFG), where each arc length is allocated a linear Diophantine fuzzy number (LDFG) rather than a real number. The LDFN can reflect the uncertainty in the LDFG’s arc costs. Two critical issues must be addressed in the MST problem with LDFG. One issue is determining how to compare the LDFNs, i.e., the cost of the edges. The other question is how to calculate the edge addition to determine the cost of the LDF-MST. To overcome these difficulties, the score function representation of LDFNs is utilized and Prim’s method is a well-known approach for solving the minimal spanning tree issue in which uncertainty is ignored, i.e., precise values of arc lengths are supplied. This technique works by providing more energy to nodes dependent on their position in the spanning tree. In addition, an illustrated example is provided to explain the suggested approach.

  abstract     = {Epilepsy is a chronic nervous disorder, which disturbs the normal daily routine of an epileptic patient due to sudden seizure onset. In this era of smart healthcare, automated seizure prediction techniques could assist the patients, their family, and medical personnel to control and manage these seizures. This paper proposes a spectral feature-based two-layer LSTM network model for automatic prediction of epileptic seizures using long-term multichannel EEG signals. This model makes use of spectral power and mean spectrum amplitude features of delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands of 23-channel EEG spectrum for this task. Initially, the proposed single-layer and two-layer LSTM models have been evaluated for EEG segments having durations in the range of 5–50 s for 24 epileptic subjects, out of which EEG segments of 30 s duration are found to be useful for accurate seizure prediction using two-layer LSTM model. Afterwards, to validate the performance of this classifier, the spectral features of 30 s duration EEG segments are fed to random forest, decision tree, k-nearest neighbour, support vector machine, and naive Bayes classifiers, which are empowered with grid search-based parameter estimation. Finally, the iterative simulation results and comparison with recently published existing techniques firmly reveal that the proposed two-layer LSTM model with EEG spectral features is an effective technique for accurately predicting seizures in real time with an average classification accuracy of 98.14%, average sensitivity of 98.51%, and average specificity of 97.78%, thereby enabling the epileptic patients to have a better quality of life.},

Hence, it is feasible to use a polygonal fuzzy number to approximate a general fuzzy number. First, an extension theorem of continuous functions on a real compact set is given according to open set construction theorem. Then using Weierstrass approximation theorem and ordered representation of the polygonal fuzzy numbers, the convergence of a single hidden layer feedforward polygonal fuzzy neural network is proved. Secondly, the gradient vector of the approximation error function and the optimization parameter vector of the network are given by using the ordered representation of polygonal fuzzy numbers, and then the gradient descent algorithm is used to train the optimal parameters of the polygonal fuzzy neural network iteratively. Finally, two simulation examples are given to verify the approximation ability of the network.

  abstract     = {Recently, convolutional neural networks have shown good performance in many counterfeit detection tasks. However, accurate counterfeit detection is still challenging due to the following three issues: (1) fine-grained classification, (2) class imbalance, and (3) high imitation samples. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid attention network (HANet) for counterfeit luxury handbag detection. In HANet, a hybrid attention module is first designed. Compared with existing methods that directly use classic CNNs for counterfeit detection, the HA module jointly uses a channel attention unit and a spatial attention unit to learn important information on both the channel and spatial dimensions. The HA modules can be easily integrated into the ResNet architecture to enhance the discriminative representation ability of CNNs, so as to help the network find subtle differences between the real and counterfeit products. In addition, an appraiser-guided loss is proposed to train HANet. Considering the factor of class imbalance and high imitation samples, the proposed loss gives the counterfeit class a higher weighting, and meanwhile gives the high imitation samples a much higher weighting. The proposed loss introduces the knowledge of appraisers, which allows HANet to not only treat real and counterfeit samples relatively fairly, but also pay more attention to the learning of difficult samples. To evaluate the performance of our method, we have constructed a well-benchmarked luxury handbag dataset. On this dataset, the performance of HANet, ResNet50, and the state-of-the-art attention methods is compared. The results demonstrate that HANet achieve superior performance against all its competitors.},

The definition of q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (briefly, q-ROFS) is then declared to generalize and solve PFS and IFS failures. Using the concept of PF $$\beta $$ -neighborhood, Zhan et al. defined the description of the covering through the Pythagorean fuzzy rough set (briefly, CPFRS). Hussain et al. also developed the concept of q-ROF $$\beta $$ -neighborhood to build the concept of covering through q-rung orthopair fuzzy rough sets (Cq-ROFRS). To enhance the results in Zhan et al.’s and Hussain et al.’s method and in a related context, the concept of PF complementary $$\beta $$ -neighborhood is constructed. Hence, using PF $$\beta $$ -neighborhood and PF complementary $$\beta $$ -neighborhood, three novel kinds of CPFRS are investigated and the related characteristics are analyzed. The interrelationships between Zhan et al.’s approach and our approaches are also discussed. Besides, the concept of q-ROF complementary $$\beta $$ -neighborhood is examined. Three new Cq-ROFRS models are differentiated using the principles of q-ROF $$\beta $$ -neighborhood and q-ROF complementary $$\beta $$ -neighborhood. As a result, the related properties and relationships between these various models and Hussain et al.’s model are established. Because of these correlations, we may consider our approach to be a generalization of Zhan et al.’s and Hussain et al’s approaches. Finally, we developed applications to solve MADM problems using CPFRS and Cq-ROFRS, as well as variances of the two methods using numerical examples are presented.},

We study certain types of fuzzy soft competition hypergraphs to illustrate different relations in a directed fuzzy soft network using the concepts of height, depth, union, and intersection simultaneously. We introduce the notions of fuzzy soft k-competition hypergraphs and fuzzy soft neighborhood hypergraphs. We design certain algorithms to compute the strength of competition in fuzzy soft directed graphs that reduce the calculation complexity of existing fuzzy-based non-parameterized models.

The original image is converted to one low-frequency part and three high-frequency parts by DWT and then permutated by sorting-based chaotic sequences. Afterward, a novel measurement matrix optimization algorithm based on adaptive step size is presented to measure the high-frequency components. To enhance the security of the scheme, the DRPE, quantization, and diffusion are successively performed on the complex matrix composed of the shuffled low-frequency component and three measurement value matrices to obtain the cipher image. Logistic-Sine chaotic system is utilized to produce the chaotic keystreams for the encryption process, and its system parameter and initial value are determined by the information entropy of the plain image and external key parameters, so that the proposed cipher can withstand known-plaintext and chosen-plaintext attacks effectively.

  abstract     = {Training robots to safely navigate (Safe-Nav) in uncertain complex environments using the RGB-D sensor is quite challenging as it involves the performance of different tasks such as obstacle avoidance, optimal path planning, and control. Traditional navigation approaches cannot generate suitable paths which guarantee enough visible features. Recent learning-based methods are still not mature enough due to their proneness to collisions and prohibitive computational cost. This paper focuses on generating safe trajectories to the desired goal while avoiding collisions and tracking failure in unknown complex environments. We present Safe-Nav, a hierarchical framework composed of the visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) module, the global planner module and the local planner module. The visual SLAM module generates the navigation map and the robot pose. The global planner module plans a local waypoint on the real-time navigation map. In the local planner module, a deep-reinforcement-learning-based (DRL-based) policy is presented for taking safe actions towards local waypoints. Our DRL-based policy can learn different navigation skills (e.g., avoiding collisions and avoiding tracking failure) through specialized modes without any supervisory signals when the PointGoal-navigation-specied reward is provided. We have demonstrated the performance of our proposed Safe-Nav in the Habitat simulation environment. Our approach outperforms the recent learning-based method and conventional navigation approach with relative improvements of over 205% (0.55 vs. 0.18) and 139% (0.55 vs. 0.23) in the success rate, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Oversampling is a promising preprocessing technique for imbalanced datasets which generates new minority instances to balance the dataset. However, improper generated minority instances, i.e., noise instances, may interfere the learning of the classifier and impact it negatively. Given this, in this paper, we propose a simple and effective oversampling approach known as ASN-SMOTE based on the k-nearest neighbors and the synthetic minority oversampling technology (SMOTE). ASN-SMOTE first filters noise in the minority class by determining whether the nearest neighbor of each minority instance belongs to the minority or majority class. After that, ASN-SMOTE uses the nearest majority instance of each minority instance to effectively perceive the decision boundary, inside which the qualified minority instances are selected adaptively for each minority instance by the proposed adaptive neighbor selection scheme to synthesize new minority instance. To substantiate the effectiveness, ASN-SMOTE has been applied to three different classifiers and comprehensive experiments have been conducted on 24 imbalanced benchmark datasets. ASN-SMOTE is also extensively compared with nine notable oversampling algorithms. The results show that ASN-SMOTE achieves the best results in the majority of datasets.

  abstract     = {Aiming to build upon the slow convergence speed and low search efficiency of the potential function-based rapidly exploring random tree star (RRT*) algorithm (P_RRT*), this paper proposes a path planning method for manipulators with an improved P_RRT* algorithm (defined as improved P_RRT*), which is used to solve the path planning problem for manipulators in three-dimensional space. This method first adopts a random sampling method based on a potential function. Second, based on a probability value, the nearest neighbour node is selected by the nearest Euclidean distance to the random sampling point and the minimum cost function, and in the expansion of new nodes, twice expansion methods are used to accelerate the search efficiency of the algorithm. The first expansion adopts the goal-biased expansion strategy, and the second expansion adopts the strategy of random sampling in a rectangular area. Then, the parent node of the new node is reselected, and the path is rerouted to obtain a clear path from the initial point to the target point. Redundant node deletion and the maximum curvature constraint are used to remove redundant nodes and minimize the curvature on the generated path to reduce the tortuosity of the path. The Bezier curve is used to fit the processed path and obtain the trajectory planning curve for the manipulator. Finally, the improved P_RRT* algorithm is verified experimentally in Python and the Robot Operating System (ROS) and compared with other algorithms. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the improved algorithm.},

First, a new normalized method for HFPRs is developed to address the situation where the evaluation information has different number of elements. Second, for improving the unacceptable consistent HFPRs, an algorithm is designed to derive acceptable consistent HFPRs. The main characteristic of the design algorithm is that the values that need to be revised are identified first, and then design the local adjustment process. Third, an algorithm is developed to obtain a group of normalized HFPRs (NHFPRs), considering the additive consistency of HFPRs. Fourth, for improving the individual consistency and group consensus simultaneously, an algorithm is designed to obtain a group of HFPRs with acceptable consistency and consensus. Finally, the method of determining the decision makers’ weights and a procedure for MCDM problems with HFPRs are given. An illustrative example in conjunction with comparative analysis is used to demonstrate the proposed method which is feasible and efficient for practical MCDM problems.},

  abstract     = {Many models were recently proposed to classify students, relying on a large amount of pre-labeled data to verify their classification effectiveness. However, those models lack to accurately classify students into various behavioral patterns, employing nominal class labels, rather than ordinal ones. Meanwhile, such models cannot analyze high-dimensional learning behaviors among learners according to students’ interaction with course videos. Since online learning data are huge, the main challenges associated with data are insufficient labeling and classification using nominal class labels. In this study, we proposed a model based on Graph Convolutional Network, as a semi-supervised classification task to classify students’ engagement in various behavioral patterns. First, we proposed a label function to label datasets instead of manual labeling, in which input and output data are labeled for classification to provide a learning foundation for future data processing. Accordingly, we hypothesized four behavioral patterns, namely (“High-engagement”, “Normal-engagement”, “At-risk”, and “Potential-At-risk”) based on students&#39; engagement with course videos and their performance on the assessments/quizzes conducted after. Then, we built a heterogeneous knowledge graph representing learners, course videos as entities, and capturing semantic relationships among students according to shared knowledge concepts in videos. Our model intrinsically works for heterogeneous knowledge graphs as a semi-supervised node classification task. It was evaluated on a real-world dataset across multiple settings to achieve a better predictive classification model. Experiment results showed that the proposed model can predict with an accuracy of 84% and an f1-score of 78% compared to baseline approaches.},

It is an important index to describe the degradation state of a pure electric vehicle battery and has an important reference value in evaluating the health level of the retired battery and estimating the driving range. In this study, the random forest algorithm is first used to find the most important health factors to lithium-ion batteries based on the dataset released by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Then the support vector regression (SVR) algorithm is developed to predict the SOH of a lithium-ion battery. The genetic algorithm-particle swarm optimization (GA-PSO) algorithm is brought forward to optimize the parameter values of the SVR, which could improve the estimation accuracy and convergence speed. The proposed SOH estimation method is applied to four batteries and gets a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.40% and an average absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.56%. In addition, the method is also compared with genetic algorithm-support vector regression (GA-SVR) and particle swarm optimization-support vector regression (PSO-SVR), respectively. The results show that (i) compared with the PSO-SVR method, the proposed method can decrease the average RMSE by 0.10%, and the average MAPE by 0.17%; (ii) compared with the GA-PSO method, number of iterations under the proposed method can be reduced by 7 generations.},

  abstract     = {Decomposition hybrid algorithms with the recursive framework which recursively decompose the structural task into structural subtasks to reduce computational complexity are employed to learn Bayesian network (BN) structure. Merging rules are commonly adopted as the combination method in the combination step. The direction determination rule of merging rules has problems in using the idea of keeping v-structures unchanged before and after combination to determine directions of edges in the whole structure. It breaks down in one case due to appearances of wrong v-structures, and is hard to operate in practice. Therefore, we adopt a novel approach for direction determination and propose a two-stage combination method. In the first-stage combination method, we determine nodes, links of edges by merging rules and adopt the idea of permutation and combination to determine directions of contradictory edges. In the second-stage combination method, we restrict edges between nodes that do not satisfy the decomposition property and their parent nodes by determining the target domain according to the decomposition property. Simulation experiments on four networks show that the proposed algorithm can obtain BN structure with higher accuracy compared with other algorithms.

  abstract     = {Single-valued neutrosophic sets (SVNSs) and their application to material selection in engineering design. Liquid hydrogen is a feasible ingredient for energy storage in a lightweight application due to its high gravimetric power density. Material selection is an essential component in engineering since it meets all of the functional criteria of the object. Materials selection is a time-consuming as well as a critical phase in the design process. Inadequate material(s) selection can have a detrimental impact on a manufacturer’s production, profitability, and credibility. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) is an important tool in the engineering design process that deals with complexities in material selection. However, the existing MCDM techniques often produce conflicting results. To address such problems, an innovative aggregation technique is proposed for material selection in engineering design based on truthness, indeterminacy, and falsity indexes of SVNSs. Taking advantage of SVNSs and smooth approximation with interactive Einstein operations, single-valued neutrosophic Einstein interactive weighted averaging and geometric operators are proposed. Based on proposed AOs, a robust MCDM approach is proposed for material selection in engineering design. A practical application of the proposed MCDM approach for material selection of cryogenic storage containers is developed. Additionally, the authenticity analysis and comparison analysis are designed to discuss the validity and rationality of the optimal decision.},

(2) These methods select feature subsets according to the positive region, while ignoring the uncertainty implied by the upper approximation. To address these problems, a multi-label feature selection method based on fuzzy neighborhood rough set is developed in this article. First, the fuzzy neighborhood approximation accuracy and fuzzy decision are defined in the fuzzy neighborhood rough set model, and a new multi-label fuzzy neighborhood conditional entropy is designed. Second, a mixed measure is proposed by combining the fuzzy neighborhood conditional entropy from information view with the approximate accuracy of fuzzy neighborhood from algebra view, to evaluate the importance of features from different views. Finally, a forward multi-label feature selection algorithm is proposed for removing redundant features and decrease the complexity of multi-label classification. The experimental results illustrate the validity and stability of the proposed algorithm in multi-label fuzzy neighborhood decision systems, when compared with related methods on ten multi-label datasets.},

However, the existing OBL variants are population-based, which causes many shortcomings. The value of the jumping rate is not self-adaptively adjusted, so the algorithm easily traps into local optima. The population-based OBL wastes fitness evaluations when the algorithm converges to sub-optimal. In this paper, we proposed a novel OBL called subpopulation-based OBL (SPOBL) with a self-adaptive parameter control strategy. In SPOBL, the jumping rate acts on the individual, and the subpopulation is selected according to the individual’s jumping rate. In the self-adaptive parameter control strategy, the surviving individual’s jumping rate in each iteration will participate in the self-adaptive process. A generalized Lehmer mean is introduced to achieve an equilibrium between exploration and exploitation. We used DE and advanced DE variants combined with SPOBL to verify performance. The results of performance are evaluated on the CEC 2017 and CEC 2020 test suites. The SPOBL shows better performance compared to other OBL variants in terms of benchmark functions as well as real-world constrained optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Autoencoder has been widely used as a feature learning technique. In many works of autoencoder, the features of the original input are usually extracted layer by layer using multi-layer nonlinear mapping, and only the features of the last layer are used for classification or regression. Therefore, the features of the previous layer aren’t used explicitly. The loss of information and waste of computation is obvious. In addition, faster training and reasoning speed is generally required in the Internet of Things applications. But the stacked autoencoders model is usually trained by the BP algorithm, which has the problem of slow convergence. To solve the above two problems, the paper proposes a dense connection pseudoinverse learning autoencoder (DensePILAE) from reuse perspective. Pseudoinverse learning autoencoder (PILAE) can extract features in the form of analytic solution, without multiple iterations. Therefore, the time cost can be greatly reduced. At the same time, the features of all the previous layers in stacked PILAE are combined as the input of next layer. In this way, the information of all the previous layers not only has no loss, but also can be strengthened and refined, so that better features could be learned. The experimental results in 8 data sets of different domains show that the proposed DensePILAE is effective.},

  abstract     = {Mobile technology has revolutionised various business processes. Banking is one of them. Traditional banking operations are gradually changing with the introduction of efficient mobile technologies. Mobile banking (m-banking) has recently emerged as an innovative banking channel that provides continuous real-time customer service. It is expected that the market for m-banking will expand in the near future. There are currently various types of m-banking applications in the market. However, ranking and selecting efficient applications is difficult due to the involvement of multiple factors. As of now, very few studies have reported the m-banking application selection framework, left scope for further research. The current study proposes an m-banking application selection model based on a combined fuzzy best–worst method (fuzzy-BWM) and fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (fuzzy-TOPSIS). The research was carried out in several stages, beginning with the identification of potential factors and progressing to pair-wise comparisons and the final ranking of the applications. The fuzzy set theory was applied to handle the ambiguity of the decision maker. In the first stage, fuzzy-BWM was used to determine the weight of the factors. Further, fuzzy-TOPSIS was applied to rank the m-banking applications. The present study has adopted a new fuzzy BWM, which differs significantly from the existing fuzzy-BWM, to solve the nonlinearity problem of optimisation. The applicability of the proposed model has been demonstrated through a real-life case study. The efficacy of the model has been further examined by performing a sensitivity analysis. The study observed application functionality, convenience, and performance expectancy as significant factors in selecting an m-banking application, followed by performance quality, security, and compatibility. The proposed model can assist financial institutions and customers to overcome the challenges of choosing an appropriate m-banking application. The proposed model can be used to benchmark the m-banking applications in the market.},

To tackle this challenge, a social awareness-aided transmit power control policy for SUs is developed. First, a social network composed of a group of third-party sensing nodes that do not share the spectrum with the PU is established, which helps an SU collect the power information of the PU. Then, we design a Dueling Deep Q-Network (DQN) model to achieve efficient dynamic spectrum sharing between the PU and the SU with the power information collected in the social network. Experimental results show that the spectrum sharing success rate is higher and the comprehensive performance is improved with the sensing nodes selected by the social relationship. Moreover, compared with other deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, the performance of Dueling DQN is more stable on our targeted spectrum sharing problem.},

The adaptive robust term is added to guarantee the reachable condition of SM surface. For faulty MRR systems, the actuator failure is compensated online to avoid the fault detection and isolation mechanism.

From the point of space, first, appropriate channel number across all subjects is investigated. During this progress, an electrode channel selection method based on Spearman’s rank order correlation coefficient is utilized to detect signals from active muscle. Then, to reduce the computation and highlight the channel information, linear regression (LR) algorithm is conducted to weight each channel. Besides, the recurrent neural network (RNN) is used to capture the temporal information and model the relation between sEMG and output force. Experiments conducted on four subjects demonstrate that six channels are enough to characterize the muscle activity. By combining the selected channels with different weight coefficients, LR algorithm can fit the output force better than simply averaging them. Furthermore, RNN with long short-term memory cell shows the superiority in time series modeling, which can improve our results to a greater degree.

However, as clinical procedures are a subjective assessment, the accuracy depends highly on the doctor’s experience. Motivated by this, a deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis method was proposed for performing bone age assessment. Inspired by clinical approaches and aimed to reduce expensive manual annotations, informative regions localization based on a complete unsupervised learning method was firstly performed and an image-processing pipeline was proposed. Subsequently, an image model with pre-trained weights as a backbone was utilized to enhance the reliability of prediction. The prediction head was implemented by a Multiple Layer Perceptron with one hidden layer. In compliance with clinical studies, gender information was an additional input to the prediction head by embedded into the feature vector calculated from the backbone model. After the experimental comparison study, the best results showed a mean absolute error of 6.2 months on the public RSNA dataset and 5.1 months on the additional dataset using MobileNetV3 as the backbone.},

By analyzing the dynamic uncertainties, a local dynamic information-based robust controller is designed to engage the model uncertainty compensation.

In this paper, we propose a path planner for welding manipulators based on deep reinforcement learning for solving path planning problems in high-dimensional continuous state and action spaces. Compared with the sampling-based method, it is more robust and is less sensitive with state dimension. In detail, to improve the learning efficiency, we introduce the inverse kinematics module to provide prior knowledge while a gain module is also designed to avoid the local optimal policy, we integrate them into the training algorithm. To evaluate our proposed planning algorithm in multiple dimensions, we conducted multiple sets of path planning experiments for welding manipulators. The results show that our method not only improves the convergence performance but also is superior in terms of optimality and robustness of planning compared with most other planning algorithms.},

Recent studies have tended to adopt deep learning networks to obtain improved prediction models and more accurate prediction results, which have often required significant quantities of historical continuous glucose-monitoring (CGM) data. However, for new patients with limited historical dataset, it becomes difficult to establish an acceptable deep learning network for glucose prediction. Consequently, the goal of this study was to design a novel prediction framework with instance-based and network-based deep transfer learning for cross-subject glucose prediction based on segmented CGM time series. Taking the effects of biodiversity into consideration, dynamic time warping (DTW) was applied to determine the proper source domain dataset that shared the greatest degree of similarity for new subjects. After that, a network-based deep transfer learning method was designed with cross-domain dataset to obtain a personalized model combined with improved generalization capability. In a case study, the clinical dataset demonstrated that, with additional segmented dataset from other subjects, the proposed deep transfer learning framework achieved more accurate glucose predictions for new subjects with type 2 diabetes.},

  abstract     = {Current visual-based simultaneous localization and mapping(SLAM) system suffers from feature loss caused by fast motion and unstructured scene in complex environments. Addressing this problem, a fast semi-direct SLAM algorithm is proposed in this paper. The main idea of this method is to combine the feature point method with the direct method in order to improve the robustness of the system in the environment of scarce visual features and low texture. First, the feature enhancement module based on subgraph is developed to extract image feature points more stably. Second, an apparent shape weighted fusion method is proposed for camera pose estimation, which can still work robustly in the absence of feature points. Third, an incremental dynamic covariance scaling algorithm is studied for optimizing the error of camera pose estimation. Finally, based on the optimized camera pose, a face element model is designed to estimate and fuse the point cloud pose, and obtain an ideal three-dimensional point cloud map. The proposed algorithm has been tested extensively on the benchmark TUM dataset and the real environment. The results show that the algorithm has better performance than existing visual based SLAM algorithms.},

Many techniques have been incorporated to check for failed solder joints, such as X-ray imaging, optical imaging and thermal imaging, among which X-ray imaging can inspect external and internal defects. However, some advanced algorithms are not accurate enough to meet the requirements of quality control. A lot of manual inspection is required that increases the specialist workload. In addition, automatic X-ray inspection could produce incorrect region of interests that deteriorates the defect detection. The high-dimensionality of X-ray images and changes in image size also pose challenges to detection algorithms. Recently, the latest advances in deep learning provide inspiration for image-based tasks and are competitive with human level. In this work, deep learning is introduced in the inspection for quality control. Four joint defect detection models based on artificial intelligence are proposed and compared. The noisy ROI and the change of image dimension problems are addressed. The effectiveness of the proposed models is verified by experiments on real-world 3D X-ray dataset, which saves the specialist inspection workload greatly.},

  abstract     = {Currently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made remarkable achievements in skin lesion classification because of their end-to-end feature representation abilities. However, precise skin lesion classification is still challenging because of the following three issues: (1) insufficient training samples, (2) inter-class similarities and intra-class variations, and (3) lack of the ability to focus on discriminative skin lesion parts. To address these issues, we propose a deep metric attention learning CNN (DeMAL-CNN) for skin lesion classification. In DeMAL-CNN, a triplet-based network (TPN) is first designed based on deep metric learning, which consists of three weight-shared embedding extraction networks. TPN adopts a triplet of samples as input and uses the triplet loss to optimize the embeddings, which can not only increase the number of training samples, but also learn the embeddings robust to inter-class similarities and intra-class variations. In addition, a mixed attention mechanism considering both the spatial-wise and channel-wise attention information is designed and integrated into the construction of each embedding extraction network, which can further strengthen the skin lesion localization ability of DeMAL-CNN. After extracting the embeddings, three weight-shared classification layers are used to generate the final predictions. In the training procedure, we combine the triplet loss with the classification loss as a hybrid loss to train DeMAL-CNN. We compare DeMAL-CNN with the baseline method, attention methods, advanced challenge methods, and state-of-the-art skin lesion classification methods on the ISIC 2016 and ISIC 2017 datasets, and test its generalization ability on the PH2 dataset. The results demonstrate its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the multi-objective optimization for the road–rail intermodal routing problem that aims to minimize the total costs and carbon dioxide emissions of the routes. To achieve high timeliness of the entire transportation process, pickup and delivery services are simultaneously improved based on the employment of fuzzy soft time windows to measure their service levels. The modeling of road–rail intermodal routing considers fixed schedules of rail and time flexibility of road to match the real-world transportation scenario, in which travel times and carbon dioxide emission factors of road services are considered to be time-varying. To improve the feasibility of the routing, uncertainty of travel times and carbon dioxide emission factors of road services and capacities of rail services are incorporated into the problem. By applying trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to formulate the uncertainty, we propose a fuzzy multi-objective nonlinear optimization model for the routing problem that integrates the truck departure time planning for road services. After processing the model with fuzzy chance-constrained programming and linearization, we obtain an auxiliary equivalent crisp linear model and solve it by designing an interactive fuzzy programming approach with the Bounded Objective Function method. Based on an empirical case study, we demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach and discuss the effects of improving the confidence levels and service levels on the optimization results. The case analysis reveals several managerial insights that help to realize an efficient transportation organization by making effective trade-offs among lowering costs, reducing emissions, improving service levels, and enhancing feasibility.},

  abstract     = {The success of deep learning in skin lesion classification mainly depends on the ultra-deep neural network and the significantly large training data set. Deep learning training is usually time-consuming, and large datasets with labels are hard to obtain, especially skin lesion images. Although pre-training and data augmentation can alleviate these issues, there are still some problems: (1) the data domain is not consistent, resulting in the slow convergence; and (2) low robustness to confusing skin lesions. To solve these problems, we propose an efficient structural pseudoinverse learning-based hierarchical representation learning method. Preliminary feature extraction, shallow network feature extraction and deep learning feature extraction are carried out respectively before the classification of skin lesion images. Gabor filter and pre-trained deep convolutional neural network are used for preliminary feature extraction. The structural pseudoinverse learning (S-PIL) algorithm is used to extract the shallow features. Then, S-PIL preliminarily identifies the skin lesion images that are difficult to be classified to form a new training set for deep learning feature extraction. Through the hierarchical representation learning, we analyze the features of skin lesion images layer by layer to improve the final classification. Our method not only avoid the slow convergence caused by inconsistency of data domain but also enhances the training of confusing examples. Without using additional data, our approach outperforms existing methods in the ISIC 2017 and ISIC 2018 datasets.},

  abstract     = {The enormous energy consumed by cloud data centers (CDCs) increases the carbon footprints, operational cost and decreases the system reliability, so it becomes a great challenge for CDCs providers. Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is an efficient approach for energy efficiency, which reduces the operating frequency, and supply voltage of the processor during the task’s execution. Recent research shows that scaling of the supply voltage and operating frequency has negative impact on the system’s reliability as it increases transient fault rate of the resources. Thus, the system’s reliability and the energy consumption are two prime concerns in a cloud computing environment that requires attention. Most workflow scheduling algorithms in literature do not consider energy and reliability simultaneously. In this paper, we proposed the ε-fuzzy dominance based reliable green workflow scheduling (FDRGS) algorithm, which optimizes the application’s reliability and energy consumption simultaneously using the ε-fuzzy dominance mechanism. The simulation results obtained using fast Fourier transform (FFT) and gaussian elimination (GE) task graphs manifest that our scheduling algorithm is more efficient in optimizing energy consumption and lifetime system’s reliability jointly than several widely used algorithms. The proposed algorithm will help scientists and engineers for further insight into future research in the area of cloud.},

The contribution differences of different channels and different time steps to RUL prediction are not considered, and only use deep learning features or handcrafted statistical features for prediction. These limitations can lead to inaccurate prediction results. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an RUL prediction method based on multi-layer self-attention (MLSA) and temporal convolution network (TCN). The TCN is used to extract deep learning features. Dilated convolution and residual connection are adopted in TCN structure. Dilated convolution is an efficient way to widen receptive field, and the residual structure can avoid the gradient vanishing problem. Besides, we propose a feature fusion method to fuse deep learning features and statistical features. And the MLSA is designed to adaptively assign feature weights.

Congestion caused by traffic incidents has caused a waste of time and fuel and seriously affected transportation efficiency. At present, most methods use manual judgment or image features to detect traffic incidents, but these methods lack timeliness, leading to secondary incidents. For dangerous road sections such as ramp-free and long downhills, this paper proposes an algorithm to quickly detect traffic incidents based on a spatiotemporal map of vehicle trajectories. First, a vehicle dataset from the monitoring perspective is constructed, and an improved YOLOv4 detection algorithm is used to detect images organized as batches. Based on the detection result, the multi-object tracking method of vehicle speed prediction in key frames is used to obtain the vehicle trajectory. Then according to the vehicle trajectory obtained in a single scene, the vehicle trajectory is reidentified and associated in the continuous monitoring scene to construct a long-distance vehicle trajectory spatiotemporal map. Finally, according to the distribution and generation status of the trajectory in the spatiotemporal map, traffic incidents such as vehicle parking, vehicle speeding, and vehicle congestion are analyzed. Experimental results show that the proposed method greatly increases the speed of vehicle detection and tracking and obtains high mAP, MOTA, and MOTP indicators. The global spatiotemporal map constructed by trajectory reidentification can achieve high detection rates for traffic incidents, reduce the average elapsed time, and avoid the problems of the inaccuracy of analyzing image features.},

We collected 138 related online events with macro-level big data characteristics, and used Agent-Based Modeling to capture micro-level individual behaviors of netizens. We set two kinds of movable agents, Hots (events) and Netizens (individuals), which behave smartly and autonomously. Based on multiple simulations and parametric traversal, we obtained the optimal parameter solution. Under the optimal solutions, we repeated simulations by ten times, and took the mean values as robust outcomes. Simulation outcomes well match the real big data of life cycle trends, and validity and robustness can be achieved. According to multiple criteria (spans, peaks, ratios, and distributions), the fitness between simulations and real big data has been substantially supported. Therefore, our Agent-Based Modeling well grasps the micro-level mechanisms of real-world individuals (netizens), based on which we can predict individual behaviors of netizens and big data trends of specific online events.

To address the challenge continuously adapting to multiple tasks in MARL, we formalize the problem into a two-stage curriculum. Single-task policies are learned with MARL approaches, after that we develop a gradient-based Self-Adaptive Meta-Learning algorithm, SAML, that cannot only distill single-task policies into a unified policy but also can facilitate the unified policy to continuously adapt to new incoming tasks. In addition, to validate the continuous adaptation performance on complex task, we extend the widely adopted StarCraft benchmark SMAC and develop a new multi-task multi-agent StarCraft environment, Meta-SMAC, for testing various aspects of continuous adaptation method.

  abstract     = {In this paper, an identical parallel machine scheduling problem with step-deteriorating jobs is considered to minimize the weighted sum of tardiness cost and extra energy consumption cost. In particular, the actual processing time of a job is assumed to be a step function of its starting time and its deteriorating threshold. When the starting time of a job is later than its deteriorating threshold, the job faces two choices: (1) maintaining its status in holding equipment and being processed with a base processing time and (2) consuming an extra penalty time to finish its processing. The two work patterns need different amounts of energy consumption. To implement energy-efficient scheduling, the selection of the pre-processing patterns must be carefully considered. In this paper, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed to minimize the total tardiness cost and the extra energy cost. Decomposition approaches based on logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD) are developed by reformulating the studied problem into a master problem and some independent sub-problems. The master problem is relaxed by only making assignment decisions. The sub-problems are to find optimal schedules in the job-to-machine assignments given by the master problem. Moreover, MILP and heuristic based on Tabu search are used to solve the sub-problems. To evaluate the performance of our methods, three groups of test instances were generated inspired by both real-world applications and benchmarks from the literature. The computational results demonstrate that the proposed decomposition approaches can compute competitive schedules for medium- and large-size problems in terms of solution quality. In particular, the LBBD with Tabu search performs the best among the suggested four methods.},

  abstract     = {Blur detection is aimed to differentiate the blurry and sharp regions from a given image. This task has attracted much attention in recent years due to its importance in computer vision with the integration of image processing and artificial intelligence. However, blur detection still suffers from problems such as the oversensitivity to image noise and the difficulty in cost–benefit balance. To deal with these issues, we propose an accurate and efficient blur detection method, which is concise in architecture and robust against noise. First, we develop a sequency spectrum-based blur metric to estimate the blurriness of each pixel by integrating a re-blur scheme and the Walsh transform. Meanwhile, to eliminate the noise interference, we propose an adaptive sequency spectrum truncation strategy by which we can obtain an accurate blur map even in noise-polluted cases. Finally, a multi-scale fusion segmentation framework is designed to extract the blur region based on the clustering-guided region growth. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance and the best balance between cost and benefit. It offers an average F1 score of 0.887, MAE of 0.101, detecting time of 0.7 s, and training time of 0.5 s. Especially for noise-polluted blurry images, the proposed method achieves the F1 score of 0.887 and MAE of 0.101, which significantly surpasses other competitive approaches. Our method yields a cost–benefit advantage and noise immunity that has great application prospect in complex sensing environment.},

  abstract     = {In this current era, the concept of nonlinearity plays an important and essential role in intuitionistic fuzzy arena. This article portrays an impression of different representation of nonlinear pentagonal intuitionistic fuzzy number (PIFN) and its classification under different scenarios. A new de-intuitification technique of non-linear PIFN is addressed in this article along with its various graphical representations. Additionally, in this paper, we have observed this by applying it in an economic production quantity model where the production is not perfect and defective items are produced which are reworked. The model is considered under learning and forgetting, where learning is considered as linear, nonlinear PIFN and crisps arena. It is observed from the numerical study that high learning effects in rework lead to decrease in production of defective item, which, besides an economic advantage, may have a positive effect on the environment. Even though forgetting has an adverse effect, the average total cost is much less than that of the basic model which ignores worker learning and forgetting. Finally, comparative and sensitivity analysis result shows the utility of this noble work.},

In other words, the ranges of grades of membership, non-membership, and reference parameters in the structure of LDFS are extended from the interval [0, 1] to unit circle in the complex plane. Besides, this set approach is proposed to remove the conditions associated with the grades of complex-valued membership and complex-valued non-membership in the framework of complex intuitionistic fuzzy set (CIFS), complex Pythagorean fuzzy set (CPyFS), and complex q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (Cq-ROFS). It is proved that each of CIFS, CPyFS, and Cq-ROFS is a CLDFS, but not vice versa. In addition, some operations and relations on CLDFSs are derived and their fundamental properties are investigated. The intuitive definitions of cosine similarity measure (CSM) and cosine distance measure (CDM) between two CLDFSs are introduced and their characteristic principles are examined. An approach based on CSM is proposed to tackle medical diagnosis issues and its performance is tested by dealing with numerical examples. Finally, a comparative study of the proposed approach with several existing approaches is created and its advantages are discussed.},

In this paper, we propose an improved weighted optimization approach (LSWOA) for helping solve LSGO problems. Thanks to the dimensionality reduction of weighted optimization, LSWOA can optimize transformed problems quickly and share the optimal weights with the population, thereby accelerating the overall convergence. First, we concentrate on the theoretical investigation of weighted optimization. A series of theoretical analyses are provided to illustrate the search behavior of weighted optimization, and the equivalent form of the transformed problem is presented to show the relationship between the original problem and the transformed one. Then the factors that affect problem transformation and how they take affect are figured out. Finally, based on our theoretical investigation, we modify the way of utilizing weighted optimization in LSGO. A weight-sharing strategy and a candidate solution inheriting strategy are designed, along with a better allocation of computational resources. These modifications help take full advantage of weighted optimization and save computational resources. The extensive experimental results on CEC’2010 and CEC’2013 verify the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed LSWOA.},

This paper introduces an intelligent identity authentication method for vehicle security system based on wireless signals. Unlike past work, our approach combines car security with car owners and car keys. The intuition underlying our design is that when a user walks towards the car, the user’s gait information can be leveraged to identify the user. We capture the user’s gait information using wireless devices which can be deployed in the car, and then extract features from the received wireless signals using convolution kernel and apply artificial neural network to identify the user.

The traditional physical education monitoring environment creates crucial manual efforts on athletes&#39; activity observations and tracking consistently. Similarly, remote monitoring and assessment of athletes in sports training seem to be barriers to physical education monitoring and training. It creates various chances to improve training and education through technology advancements like IoT and deep learning. Students can efficiently monitor their physical behavior to increase their physical and psychological benefits. The IoT-assisted physical activity monitoring device is proposed to track students&#39; physical activity and enhance outcomes. The management ability allows students to organize and increase speed their physical activity in a wellness manner. In addition, this study examines the connections between monitoring ability which is an essential component for sports activities and physical activity. This system collects essential information from IoT-based wearable devices that interact with the data in real time by virtualizing the device. The IoT network includes several device activities and monitors the heartbeat and physical body temperature of a person. The analysis of specific studies and student feedback shows that the designed virtual system of physical educations is effective in its application and implementation and provides a reliable guide for developing student physical educational systems. The experimental analysis is evaluated; the solution offered is developing and supporting physical education and training approaches in reality and creates healthy environment systems to solve the health monitoring challenges posed by IoT devices. The proposed method has achieved extraordinary physical activity monitoring compared to the conventional systems, as shown by experimental findings. The simulation analysis of physical education can help students and improve the associated aspects of physical abilities with high accuracy ratio (98.3), prediction ratio (96.5%), interaction ratio (94.4%), performance ratio (95.1%), the efficiency ratio (93.2), F-score (92.2%), and reduce error rate (17.5%) and physical activity patterns.},

The velocity of the particle is updated according to the past momentum, the present positions (including the personal best position and the global best position), and the future trend of the positions, thereby accelerating the terminal convergence and adjusting the search direction to jump out of the area around the local optima. By using a combination of the Routh stability criterion and the final value theorem of the Z-transformation, the convergence conditions are obtained for the developed PIDLPSO algorithm. Finally, the experiment results reveal the superiority of the designed PIDLPSO algorithm over several other state-of-the-art PSO variants in terms of the population diversity, searching ability and convergence rate.},

  abstract     = {In missile guidance, pursuit performance is seriously degraded due to the uncertainty and randomness in target maneuverability, detection delay, and environmental noise. In many methods, accurately estimating the acceleration of the target or the time-to-go is needed to intercept the maneuvering target, which is hard in an environment with uncertainty. In this paper, we propose an assisted deep reinforcement learning (ARL) algorithm to optimize the neural network-based missile guidance controller for head-on interception. Based on the relative velocity, distance, and angle, ARL can control the missile to intercept the maneuvering target and achieve large terminal intercept angle. To reduce the influence of environmental uncertainty, ARL predicts the target’s acceleration as an auxiliary supervised task. The supervised learning task improves the ability of the agent to extract information from observations. To exploit the agent’s good trajectories, ARL presents the Gaussian self-imitation learning to make the mean of action distribution approach the agent’s good actions. Compared with vanilla self-imitation learning, Gaussian self-imitation learning improves the exploration in continuous control. Simulation results validate that ARL outperforms traditional methods and proximal policy optimization algorithm with higher hit rate and larger terminal intercept angle in the simulation environment with noise, delay, and maneuverable target.},

Different from existing works in explainable AI, XMAP is highly modularised and the interpretability for each step can be easily obtained and visualised. A number of core algorithms are developed in XMAP to capture the distributions and topological structures of data, define contexts that emerged from data, and build effective representations for classification tasks. The experiments show that XMAP can provide useful and interpretable insights across analytical steps. For the binary classification task, its predictive performance is very competitive as compared to advanced machine learning algorithms in the literature.

  abstract     = {Garbage detection and disposal have become one of the major hassles in urban planning. Due to population influx in urban areas, the rate of garbage generation has increased exponentially along with garbage diversity. In this paper, we propose a hardware solution for garbage segregation at the base level based on deep learning architecture. The proposed deep-learning-based hardware solution SmartBin can segregate the garbage into biodegradable and non-biodegradable using Image classification through a Convolutional Neural Network System Architecture using a Real-time embedded system. Garbage detection via image classification aims for quick and efficient categorization of garbage present in the bin. However, this is an arduous task as garbage can be of any dimension, object, color, texture, unlike object detection of a particular entity where images of objects of that entity do share some similar characteristics and traits. The objective of this work is to compare the performance of various pre-trained Convolution Neural Network namely AlexNet, ResNet, VGG-16, and InceptionNet for garbage classification and test their working along with hardware components (PiCam, raspberry pi, infrared sensors, etc.) used for garbage detection in the bin. The InceptionNet Neural Network showed the best performance measure for the proposed model with an accuracy of 98.15% and a loss of 0.10 for the training set while it was 96.23% and 0.13 for the validation set.},

  abstract     = {Due to the presence of two opposite directional thinking in relationships between countries and communication systems, the systems may not always be balanced. Therefore, the perfectness between countries relations are highly important. It comes from how much they were connected to each other for communication. In this study, first perfectly regular bipolar fuzzy graph is introduced and examined the regularity of nodes. Then, the relationship between the adjacent nodes and their regularity are visualized as a perfectly edge-regular bipolar fuzzy graphs. The totally accurate communication between all connected nodes is explained by introducing completely open neighborhood degree and completely closed neighborhood degree of nodes and edges in a bipolar fuzzy graph. Some algorithms and flowcharts of the proposed methods are given. Finally, two applications of these cogitation are exhibited in two bipolar fuzzy fields. The first one is in international relationships between some countries during cold-war era and the second one is in decision-making between teachers–students communication system for the improvement of teaching.},

  abstract     = {Scheduling of scientific workflows on hybrid cloud architecture, which contains private and public clouds, is a challenging task because schedulers should be aware of task inter-dependencies, underlying heterogeneity, cost diversity, and virtual machine (VM) variable configurations during the scheduling process. On the one side, reaching a minimum total execution time or makespan is a favorable issue for users whereas the cost of utilizing quicker VMs may lead to conflict with their budget on the other side. Existing works in the literature scarcely consider VM’s monetary cost in the scheduling process but mainly focus on makespan. Therefore, in this paper, the problem of scientific workflow scheduling running on hybrid cloud architecture is formulated to a bi-objective optimization problem with makespan and monetary cost minimization viewpoint. To address this combinatorial discrete problem, this paper presents a hybrid bi-objective optimization based on simulated annealing and task duplication algorithms (BOSA-TDA) that exploits two important heuristics heterogeneous earliest finish time (HEFT) and duplication techniques to improve canonical SA. The extensive simulation results reported of running different well-known scientific workflows such as LIGO, SIPHT, Cybershake, Montage, and Epigenomics demonstrate that proposed BOSA-TDA has the amount of 12.5%, 14.5%, 17%, 13.5%, and 18.5% average improvement against other existing approaches in terms of makespan, monetary cost, speed up, SLR, and efficiency metrics, respectively.},

Considering the dynamic charging behavior of EV users, a dynamic prediction method of EV charging demand is proposed by analyzing EV users’ travel law via the trip chain approach. In addition, a multi-objective charging station planing problem is formulated to achieve three objectives: (1) maximize the captured charging demands; (2) minimize the total cost of electricity and the time consumed for charging; and (3) minimize the load variance of the power grid. To solve such a problem, a novel method is proposed by combining the hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) algorithm with the entropy-based technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (ETOPSIS) method. Specifically, the HPSO algorithm is used to obtain the Pareto solutions, and the ETOPSIS method is employed to determine the optimal scheme. Based on the proposed method, the siting and sizing of the EV charging station can be planned in an optimal way. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified via the case study based on a test system composed of an IEEE 33-node distribution system and a 33-node traffic network system.},

  abstract     = {Polynomial Regression Surface (PRS) is a commonly used surrogate model for its simplicity, good interpretability, and computational efficiency. The performance of PRS is largely dependent on its basis functions. With limited samples, how to correctly select basis functions remains a challenging problem. To improve prediction accuracy, a PRS modeling approach based on multitask optimization and ensemble modeling (PRS-MOEM) is proposed for rational basis function selection with robustness. First, the training set is partitioned into multiple subsets by the cross validation method, and for each subset a sub-model is independently constructed by optimization. To effectively solve these multiple optimization tasks, an improved evolutionary algorithm with transfer migration is developed, which can enhance the optimization efficiency and robustness by useful information exchange between these similar optimization tasks. Second, a novel ensemble method is proposed to integrate the multiple sub-models into the final model. The significance of each basis function is scored according to the error estimation of the sub-models and the occurrence frequency of the basis functions in all the sub-models. Then the basis functions are ranked and selected based on the bias-corrected Akaike’s information criterion. PRS-MOEM can effectively mitigate the negative influence from the sub-models with large prediction error, and alleviate the uncertain impact resulting from the randomness of training subsets. Thus the basis function selection accuracy and robustness can be enhanced. Seven numerical examples and an engineering problem are utilized to test and verify the effectiveness of PRS-MOEM.},

Here, we propose AdjMix, a simple and attentional graph convolutional model, that is scalable to wider structure and captures more nodes features information, by simultaneously mixing the adjacency matrices of different powers. We point out that the key factor of over-smoothing is the mismatched weights of adjacency matrices, and design AdjMix to address the over-smoothing of SGC and GCNs by adjusting the weights to matching values. Experiments on citation networks including Pubmed, Citeseer, and Cora show that our AdjMix improves over SGC by 2.4%, 2.2%, and 3.2%, respectively, while achieving same performance in terms of parameters and complexity, and obtains better performance in terms of classification accuracy, parameters, and complexity, compared to other baselines.},

  abstract     = {The paper presents a hierarchical polynomial chaos expansion-based probabilistic approach to analyze the single diode solar cell model under Gaussian parametric uncertainty. It is important to analyze single diode solar cell model response under random events or factors due to uncertainty propagation. The optimal values of five electrical parameters associated with the single diode model are estimated using six deterministic optimization techniques through the root-mean-square minimization approach. Values corresponding to the best objective function response are further utilized to describe the probabilistic design space of each random electrical parameter under uncertainty. Adequate samples of each parameter corresponding Gaussian uncertain distribution are generated using Latin hypercube sampling. Furthermore, a multistage probabilistic approach is adopted to evaluate the model response using low-cost polynomial chaos series expansion and perform global sensitivity analysis under specified Gaussian distribution. Coefficients of polynomial basis functions are calculated using least square and least angle regression techniques. Unlike the highly non-linear and complex single diode representation of solar cells, the polynomial chaos expansion model provides a low computational burden and reduced complexity. To ensure reproducibility, probabilistic output response computed using proposed polynomial chaos expansion model is compared with the true model response. Finally, a multidimensional sensitivity analysis is performed through Sobol decomposition of polynomial chaos series representation to quantify the contribution of each parameter to the variance of the probabilistic response. The validation and assessment result shows that the output probabilistic response of the solar cell under Gaussian parametric uncertainty correlates to a Rayleigh probability distribution function. Output response is characterized by a mean value of 0.0060 and 0.0760 for RTC France and Solarex MSX83 solar cells, respectively. The standard deviation of $$ \pm $$ 0.0034 and $$ \pm $$ 0.0052 was observed in the probabilistic response for RTC France and Solarex MSX83 solar cells, respectively.},

In this article, the loss –aversion behavior of decision-makers and the non-compensation between attributes are considered. Furthermore, a novel generalized TODIM-ELECTRE II method under the linguistic Z-numbers environment is proposed based on Dempster–Shafer evidence theory for multi-criteria group decision-making problems with unknown weight information. Firstly, the evaluation information and its reliability are provided simultaneously by employing linguistic Z-numbers, which have the ability to capture the arbitrariness and vagueness of natural verbal information. Then, the evaluation information is used to derive basic probability assignments in Dempster–Shafer evidence theory, and with the consideration of both inner and outer reliability, this article employed Dempster’s rule to fuse evaluations. Subsequently, a generalized TODIM-ELECTRE II method is conceived under the linguistic Z-numbers environment, which considers both compensatory effects between attributes and the bounded rationality of decision-makers. In addition, criteria weights are obtained by applying Deng entropy which has the ability to deal with uncertainty. Finally, an example of terminal wastewater solidification technology selection is offered to prove this framework’s availability and robustness. The predominance is also verified by a comparative analysis with several existing methods.},

Most of the acquired shoeprints are found with low quality and/or in distorted forms. The high-fidelity shoeprint generation is of great significance in forensic science. A wide range of deep learning models has been suggested for super-resolution, being either generalized approaches or application specific. Considering the crucial challenges in shoeprint based processing and lacking specific algorithms, we proposed a deep learning based GUV-Net model for high-fidelity shoeprint generation. GUV-Net imitates learning features from VAE, U-Net, and GAN network models with special treatment of absent ground truth shoeprints. GUV-Net encodes efficient probabilistic distributions in the latent space and decodes variants of samples together with passed key features. GUV-Net forwards the learned samples to a refinement-unit proceeded to the generation of high-fidelity output. The refinement-unit receives low-level features from the decoding module at distinct levels. Furthermore, the refinement process is made more efficient by inverse-encoded in high dimensional space through a parallel inverse encoding network. The objective functions at different levels enable the model to efficiently optimize the parameters by mapping a low quality image to a high-fidelity one by maintaining salient features which are important to forensics. Finally, the performance of the proposed model is evaluated against state-of-the-art super-resolution network models.},

  abstract     = {Despite the wide range of research on pedestrian safety, previous studies have failed to analyse the real-time data of pedestrian walking misbehaviour on the basis of either pedestrian behaviour distraction or movements during specific activities to realise pedestrian safety for positive (normal) or aggressive pedestrians. Practically, pedestrian walking behaviour should be recognised, and aggressive pedestrians should be differentiated from normal pedestrians. This type of pedestrian behaviour recognition can be converted into a classification problem, which is the main challenge for pedestrian safety systems. In addressing the classification challenge, three issues should be considered: identification of factors, collection of data and exchange of data in the contexts of wireless communication and network failure. Thus, this work proposes a novel approach to pedestrian walking behaviour classification in the aforementioned contexts. Three useful phases are proposed for the methodology of this study. In the first phase involving factor identification, several factors of the irregular walking behaviour of mobile phone users are established by constructing a questionnaire that can determine users’ options (attitudes/opinions) about mobile usage whilst walking on the street. In the second phase involving data collection, four different testing scenarios are developed to acquire the real-time data of pedestrian walking behaviour by using gyroscope sensors. In the third phase involving data exchange, the proposed approach is presented on the basis of two modules. The first module for pedestrian behaviour classification uses random forest and decision tree classifiers part of machine learning techniques via wireless communication when a server becomes available. The developed module is then trained and evaluated using five category sets to obtain the best classification of pedestrian walking behaviour. The second module is based on four standard vectors for classifying pedestrian walking behaviour when a server is unavailable. Fault-tolerant pedestrian walking behaviour is identified and is initiated when failures occur in a network. Two sets of real-time data are presented in this work. The first dataset is related to the questionnaire data from 262 sampled respondents, and the second dataset comprises data on 263 sampled participants with pedestrian walking signals. Experimental results confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach relative to previous ones.},

The benefits from CSR like generating better public image, enhance in community support, enhance in market share, enhance in the satisfaction of the consumer, enhance in the exports, offering better quality services and products, and enhance in the productivity is not considered as the perception level consumers. This paper analyzes the effect of CSR activities on the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industries on the basis of the retention of the consumers of FMCG products. Initially, a questionnaire is prepared that consists of five categories. Each category is composed of more than ten questions. The information related to the questionnaire is obtained in the view of the professional students from Odisha. The customers are requested to fill the exact information as much as possible. Next, a higher-order statistical analysis is considered for realizing the behaviour of the categories. Additionally, the usage of deep learning called Optimized RNN (O-RNN) is used for predicting the customer retention in maintaining the CSR on FMCG industries. The improvement in the traditional RNN is done by optimizing the hidden neurons by the improved form of Sea Lion Optimization Algorithm (slno) called Modified slno (M-slno) with the intention of minimizing the error among the actual and the predicted outcome, hence it is called as O-RNN. The retention of the customers regarding the effect of CSR activities on FMCG companies and the benefits from CSR is investigated using the O-RNN prediction analysis against several traditional deep learning models as well as different statistical measures.},

  abstract     = {To represent qualitative aspect of uncertainty and imprecise information, linguistic preference relation (LPR) is a powerful tool for experts expressing their opinions in group decision-making (GDM) according to linguistic variables (LVs). Since for an LV, it generally means that membership degree is one, and non-membership and hesitation degrees of the experts cannot be expressed. Pythagorean linguistic numbers/values (PLNs/PLVs) are novel choice to address this issue. The aim of this paper which we propose a GDM problem involved a large number of the experts is called large-scale GDM (LSGDM) based on Pythagorean linguistic preference relation (PLPR) with a consensus model. Sometimes, the experts do not modify their opinions to achieve consensus. Therefore, the experts’ proper opinions’ management with their non-cooperative behaviors (NCBs) is necessary to establish a consensus model. At the same time, it is essential to ensure the proper adjustment of the credibility information. The proposed model using grey clustering method is divided with the experts’ similar evaluations into a subgroup. Then, we aggregate the experts’ evaluations in each cluster. A cluster consensus index (CCI) and a group consensus index (GCI) are presented to measure consensus level among the clusters. Then, we provide a mechanism for managing the NCBs of the clusters, which contain two parts: (1) NCB degree is defined using CCI and GCI for identifying the NCBs of the clusters; (2) implemented the weight punishment mechanism of the NCBs clusters to consensus improvement. Finally, an example is offered for usefulness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Finding the optimal size of a hybrid renewable energy system is certainly important. The problem is often modelled as an multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) in which objectives such as annualized system cost, loss of power supply probability etc. are minimized. However, the MOP model rarely takes the load characteristics into account. We argue that ignoring load characteristics may be inappropriate when designing HRES for a place with intermittent high load demand. For example, in a training base the load demand is high when there are training tasks while the demand decreases to a low level when there is no training task. This results in an interesting issue, that is, when the loss of power supply probability is determined at a specific value, say 15%, then it is very likely that most of loss of power supply would occur right in the training period which is unexpected. Therefore, this study proposes a constraint multi-objective model to deal with this issue—in addition to the general multi-objective optimization model, the loss of power supply probability over a critical period is set as a constraint. Correspondingly, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II with a relaxed $$\epsilon $$ constraint handling strategy is proposed to address the constraint MOP. Experimental results on a real world application demonstrate that the proposed model and algorithm are both effective and efficient.},

Then the layers constructed by the crossbars are adopted to build the memristor-based multi-layer neural network (MMNN) and the memristor-based convolutional neural network (MCNN). Two kinds of in-situ weight update schemes, which are the fixed-voltage update and the approximately linear update, respectively, are used to train the networks. Consider variations resulted from the inherent characteristics of memristors and the errors of programming voltages, the robustness of MMNN and MCNN to these variations is analyzed.

  abstract     = {Recently, tensor ring networks (TRNs) have been applied in deep networks, achieving remarkable successes in compression ratio and accuracy. Although highly related to the performance of TRNs, rank selection is seldom studied in previous works and usually set to equal in experiments. Meanwhile, there is not any heuristic method to choose the rank, and an enumerating way to find appropriate rank is extremely time-consuming. Interestingly, we discover that part of the rank elements is sensitive and usually aggregate in a narrow region, namely an interest region. Therefore, based on the above phenomenon, we propose a novel progressive genetic algorithm named progressively searching tensor ring network search (PSTRN), which has the ability to find optimal rank precisely and efficiently. Through the evolutionary phase and progressive phase, PSTRN can converge to the interest region quickly and harvest good performance. Experimental results show that PSTRN can significantly reduce the complexity of seeking rank, compared with the enumerating method. Furthermore, our method is validated on public benchmarks like MNIST, CIFAR10/100, UCF11 and HMDB51, achieving the state-of-the-art performance.},

Since the beginning of the 21st century, botnet activities have steadily increased, becoming one of the major concerns for Internet security. In fact, botnet activities are becoming more and more difficult to be detected, because they make use of Peer-to-Peer protocols (eMule, Torrent, Frostwire, Vuze, Skype and many others). To improve the detectability of botnet activities, this paper introduces the idea of association analysis in the field of data mining, and proposes a system to detect botnets based on the FP-growth (Frequent Pattern Tree) frequent item mining algorithm. The detection system is composed of three parts: packet collection processing, rule mining, and statistical analysis of rules. Its characteristic feature is the rule-based classification of different botnet behaviors in a fast and unsupervised fashion. The effectiveness of the approach is validated in a scenario with 11 Peer-to-Peer host PCs, 42063 Non-Peer-to-Peer host PCs, and 17 host PCs with three different botnet activities (Storm, Waledac and Zeus). The recognition accuracy of the proposed architecture is shown to be above 94%. The proposed method is shown to improve the results reported in literature.},

For better clustering performance on the dataset contaminated by outliers and noise, we propose a weighted constraint on the noise matrix and impose manifold learning into non-negative matrix factorization. Moreover, we utilize the discrete hashing learning method to constrain the learned subspace, which can achieve a binary subspace from the original data.

However, the classification accuracy based on this signal is relatively low. To improve the accuracy of classification, this paper proposes a new experimental paradigm and only uses fNIRS signals to complete the classification task of six subjects. Notably, the experiment is carried out in a non-laboratory environment, and movements of motion imagination are properly designed. And when the subjects are imagining the motions, they are also subvocalizing the movements to prevent distraction. Therefore, according to the motor area theory of the cerebral cortex, the positions of the fNIRS probes have been slightly adjusted compared with other methods. Next, the signals are classified by nine classification methods, and the different features and classification methods are compared. The results show that under this new experimental paradigm, the classification accuracy of 89.12% and 88.47% can be achieved using the support vector machine method and the random forest method, respectively, which shows that the paradigm is effective. Finally, by selecting five channels with the largest variance after empirical mode decomposition of the original signal, similar classification results can be achieved.},

  abstract     = {Multi-agent systems are widely studied due to its ability of solving complex tasks in many fields, especially in deep reinforcement learning. Recently, distributed optimization problem over multi-agent systems has drawn much attention because of its extensive applications. This paper presents a projection-based continuous-time algorithm for solving convex distributed optimization problem with equality and inequality constraints over multi-agent systems. The distinguishing feature of such problem lies in the fact that each agent with private local cost function and constraints can only communicate with its neighbors. All agents aim to cooperatively optimize a sum of local cost functions. By the aid of penalty method, the states of the proposed algorithm will enter equality constraint set in fixed time and ultimately converge to an optimal solution to the objective problem. In contrast to some existed approaches, the continuous-time algorithm has fewer state variables and the testification of the consensus is also involved in the proof of convergence. Ultimately, two simulations are given to show the viability of the algorithm.},

  abstract     = {To deploy deep neural networks to edge devices with limited computation and storage costs, model compression is necessary for the application of deep learning. Pruning, as a traditional way of model compression, seeks to reduce the parameters of model weights. However, when a deep neural network is pruned, the accuracy of the network will significantly decrease. The traditional way to decrease the accuracy loss is fine-tuning. When over many parameters are pruned, the pruned network’s capacity is reduced heavily and cannot recover to high accuracy. In this paper, we apply the knowledge distillation strategy to abate the accuracy loss of pruned models. The original network of the pruned network was used as the teacher network, aiming to transfer the dark knowledge from the original network to the pruned sub-network. We have applied three mainstream knowledge distillation methods: response-based knowledge, feature-based knowledge, and relation-based knowledge (Gou et al. in Knowledge distillation: a survey. arXiv:200605525 , 2020), and compare the result to the traditional fine-tuning method with grand-truth labels. Experiments have been done on the CIFAR100 dataset with several deep convolution neural network. Results show that the pruned network recovered by knowledge distillation with its original network performs better accuracy than it recovered by fine-tuning with sample labels. It has also been validated in this paper that the original network as the teacher performs better than differently structured networks with same accuracy as the teacher.},

  abstract     = {The problem of matching point clouds is an efficient way of registration, which is significant for many research fields including computer vision, machine learning, and robotics. There may be linear or non-linear transformation between point clouds, but determining the affine relation is more challenging among linear cases. Various methods have been presented to overcome this problem in the literature and one of them is the affine variant of the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. However, traditional affine ICP variants are highly sensitive to effects such as noises, deformations, and outliers; the least-square metric is substituted with the correntropy criterion to increase the robustness of ICPs to such effects. Correntropy-based robust affine ICPs available in the literature use point-to-point metric to estimate transformation between point clouds. Conversely, in this study, a line/surface normal that examines point-to-curve or point-to-plane distances is employed together with the correntropy criterion for affine point cloud registration problems. First, the maximum correntropy criterion measure is built for line/surface normal conditions. Then, the closed-form solution that maximizes the similarity between point sets is achieved for 2D registration and extended for 3D registration. Finally, the application procedure of the developed robust affine ICP method is given and its registration performance is examined through extensive experiments on 2D and 3D point sets. The results achieved highlight that our method can align point clouds more robustly and precisely than the state-of-the-art methods in the literature, while the registration time of the process remains at reasonable levels.},

  abstract     = {Enterprises are striving to remain protected against malware-based cyber-attacks on their infrastructure, facilities, networks and systems. Static analysis is an effective approach to detect the malware, i.e., malicious Portable Executable (PE). It performs an in-depth analysis of PE files without executing, which is highly useful to minimize the risk of malicious PE contaminating the system. Yet, instant detection using static analysis has become very difficult due to the exponential rise in volume and variety of malware. The compelling need of early stage detection of malware-based attacks significantly motivates research inclination towards automated malware detection. The recent machine learning aided malware detection approaches using static analysis are mostly supervised. Supervised malware detection using static analysis requires manual labelling and human feedback; therefore, it is less effective in rapidly evolutionary and dynamic threat space. To this end, we propose a progressive deep unsupervised framework with feature attention block for static analysis-based malware detection (PROUD-MAL). The framework is based on cascading blocks of unsupervised clustering and features attention-based deep neural network. The proposed deep neural network embedded with feature attention block is trained on the pseudo labels. To evaluate the proposed unsupervised framework, we collected a real-time malware dataset by deploying low and high interaction honeypots on an enterprise organizational network. Moreover, endpoint security solution is also deployed on an enterprise organizational network to collect malware samples. After post processing and cleaning, the novel dataset consists of 15,457 PE samples comprising 8775 malicious and 6681 benign ones. The proposed PROUD-MAL framework achieved an accuracy of more than 98.09% with better quantitative performance in standard evaluation parameters on collected dataset and outperformed other conventional machine learning algorithms.

This research is aimed at developing a computer vision-based system to identify paddy varieties using multiple heterogeneous features, exploiting textural, external, and physical properties. We captured the paddy seed images without any fixed setup to make the system user friendly at both industry and farmer levels, which can lead to illumination problems in the images. To overcome this problem, we introduced a modified histogram oriented gradient (T20-HOG) feature that can describe the illumination, scale, and rotational variations of a paddy image. We also utilized the existing Haralick and traditional features and the dimensionality of the features is reduced by the Lasso feature selection technique. The selected features are used to train the feed-forward neural network (FNN) to predict the paddy variety. The experiments conducted on two different datasets: BDRICE, and VNRICE. Results of our method are shown in terms of four standard evaluation metrics, namely, accuracy, precision, recall, and F_1 score, and achieved 99.28%, 98.64%, 98.48%, and 98.56% score, respectively. We also compared our system efficiency with existing studies. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed features are effective to identify paddy variety and achieved a new state-of-the-art performance.

But DP has no limitation on the bound of noise, leading to a low-level utility. Recently, researchers investigate how to preserving rigorous privacy guarantee while limiting the relative error to a fixed bound. However, these schemes destroy the statistical properties, including the mean, variance and MSE, which are the foundational elements for data aggregating and analyzing. In this paper, we explore the optimal privacy preserving solution, including novel definitions and implementing mechanisms, to maintain the statistical properties while satisfying DP with a fixed relative error bound.

EHR system enables the data owner to control his/her data and share it with designated people. The vast volume of data in the healthcare system makes it difficult for data to ensure security and diagnostic processes. To resolve these issues, this paper develops a new hyperledger blockchain enabled secure medical data management with deep learning (DL)-based diagnosis (HBESDM-DLD) model. The presented model involves distinct stages of operations such as encryption, optimal key generation, hyperledger blockchain-based secure data management, and diagnosis. The presented model allows the user to control access to data, permit the hospital authorities to read/write data, and alert emergency contacts. For encryption, SIMON block cipher technique is applied. At the same time, to improve the efficiency of the SIMON technique, a group teaching optimization algorithm (GTOA) is applied for the optimal key generation of the SIMON technique. Moreover, the sharing of medical data takes place using multi-channel hyperledger blockchain that utilizes a blockchain for storing patient visit data and for the medical institutions to record links for the EHRs saved in external databases. Once the data are decrypted at the receiving end, finally, variational autoencoder (VAE)-based diagnostic model is applied to detect the existence of the diseases. The performance validation of the HBESDM-DLD model takes place on benchmark medical dataset and the results are inspected under various performance measures. The experimental results proves that the HBESDM-DLD methodology is superior to state-of-the-art methods.},

Then, different rotation strategies are used to obtain a rotation feature map in multiple directions for each subimage. Then, the multiscale volume product and dilated convolution are used to learn the local and global features of feature maps. Finally, the residual strategy and integration strategy are used to fuse the generated feature maps. Experimental results demonstrate that the DR-Net method can obtain higher segmentation accuracy on both the CHAOS and BraTS data sets compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms have been paid more and more attention to solve computationally expensive problems. However, model management still plays a significant importance in searching for the optimal solution. In this paper, a new method is proposed to measure the approximation uncertainty, in which the differences between the solution and its neighbour samples in the decision space, and the ruggedness of the objective space in its neighborhood are both considered. The proposed approximation uncertainty will be utilized in the surrogate-assisted global search to find a solution for exact objective evaluation to improve the exploration capability of the global search. On the other hand, the approximated fitness value is adopted as the infill criterion for the surrogate-assisted local search, which is utilized to improve the exploitation capability to find a solution close to the real optimal solution as much as possible. The surrogate-assisted global and local searches are conducted in sequence at each generation to balance the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the method. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on seven benchmark problems with 10, 20, 30 and 50 dimensions, and one real-world application with 30 and 50 dimensions. The experimental results show that the proposed method is efficient for solving the low- and medium-dimensional expensive optimization problems by compared to the other six state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In breast cancer image analysis, reliable segmentation of the nuclei is still an open-ended research problem. In this paper, a new clustering-based nuclei segmentation method is presented. First, the proposed method pre-processes the histopathology image through SLIC method. Then, a novel variant of multi-objective grey wolf optimizer is employed to group the obtained super-pixels into optimal clusters. Lastly, the optimal cluster with minimum value is segmented as the nuclei region. The experimental results demonstrates that the proposed variant of multi-objective grey wolf algorithm surpasses the existing multi-objective algorithms over ten standard multi-objective benchmark functions belonging to different categories. Particularly, the proposed variant has achieved best fitness value of more than 0.90 on 90% of the considered functions. Further, the nuclei segmentation accuracy of the proposed method is validated on H&amp;E-stained estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer images. Experimental results illustrates that the proposed method has attained dice-coefficient value of more than 0.52 on 80% of the images. This illustrates that the proposed method is efficient in producing efficacious segmenting over histology images of Breast cancer.},

Therefore, the text summary extracted by the existing model has the problems of grammatical structure errors and semantic deviation from the original text. This paper attempts to enhance the model’s attention to the inherent feature information of the source text so that the model can more accurately identify the grammatical structure and semantic information of the document. Therefore, this paper proposes a model based on the multi-head self-attention mechanism and the soft attention mechanism. By introducing an improved multi-head self-attention mechanism in the model coding stage, the training model enables the correct summary syntax and semantic information to obtain higher weight, thereby making the generated summary more coherent and accurate. At the same time, the pointer network model is adopted, and the coverage mechanism is improved to solve out-of-vocabulary and repetitive problems when generating abstracts. This article uses CNN/DailyMail dataset to verify the model proposed in this article and uses the ROUGE indicator to evaluate the model. The experimental results show that the model in this article improves the quality of the generated summary compared with other models.},

A radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) is developed to deal with the IDC effects among the independent joint subsystems. Based on adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) approach and policy iteration (PI) algorithm, the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation is approximately solved by establishing critic NN structure and then the approximated optimal control policy can be derived. The closed-loop manipulator system is proved to be asymptotic stable by using the Lyapunov theory.

  abstract     = {The agricultural production rate plays a pivotal role in the economic development of a country. However, plant diseases are the most significant impediment to the production and quality of food. The identification of plant diseases at an early stage is crucial for global health and wellbeing. The traditional diagnosis process involves visual assessment of an individual plant by a pathologist through on-site visits. However, manual examination for crop diseases is restricted because of less accuracy and the small accessibility of human resources. To tackle such issues, there is a demand to design automated approaches capable of efficiently detecting and categorizing numerous plant diseases. Precise identification and classification of plant diseases is a tedious job due because of the occurrence of low-intensity information in the image background and foreground, the huge color resemblance in the healthy and diseased plant areas, the occurrence of noise in the samples, and changes in the position, chrominance, structure, and size of plant leaves. To tackle the above-mentioned problems, we have introduced a robust plant disease classification system by introducing a Custom CenterNet framework with DenseNet-77 as a base network. The presented method follows three steps. In the first step, annotations are developed to get the region of interest. Secondly, an improved CenterNet is introduced in which DenseNet-77 is proposed for deep keypoints extraction. Finally, the one-stage detector CenterNet is used to detect and categorize several plant diseases. To conduct the performance analysis, we have used the PlantVillage Kaggle database, which is the standard dataset for plant diseases and challenges in terms of intensity variations, color changes, and differences found in the shapes and sizes of leaves. Both the qualitative and quantitative analysis confirms that the presented method is more proficient and reliable to identify and classify plant diseases than other latest approaches.},

Machine learning can help make a storage system automatic. This article proposes a classification engine framework for this purpose by utilizing a machine learning strategy. A feature selection approach wrapped with a classifier is proposed to automatically predict the proper storage space for the incoming big data. It helps build an automatic storage space recommendation system for an object-based cloud storage platform. To find out a suitable combination of feature selection algorithms and classifiers for the proposed classification engine, a comparative study of different supervised feature selection algorithms (i.e., Fisher score, F-score, Lll21) from three categories (similarity, statistical, sparse learning) associated with various classifiers (i.e., SVM, K-NN, Neural Network) is performed. We illustrate our study using RSoS system as it provides a cloud storage platform for the healthcare data as experimental big data by considering its variety property. The experiments confirm that Lll21 feature selection combined with K-NN classifier provides better performance than the others.},

However, despite the importance of piRNAs and the large application of deep learning in computational biology, there are few studies of deep learning for piRNAs prediction. Still, current methods focus on using advanced architectures like CNN and variations. This paper presents an investigation on deep feedforward network models for classification of human transposon-derived piRNAs. We developed a lightweight predictor (when compared to other deep learning methods) and we show by practical evidence that simple neural networks can perform as well as better than complex neural networks when using the appropriate hyperparameters. For that, we train, analyze and compare the results of a multilayer perceptron with different hyperparameter choices, such as numbers of hidden layers, activation functions and optimizers, clarifying the advantages and disadvantages of each choice. Our proposed predictor reached a F-score of 0.872, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods for human transposon-derived piRNAs classification. In addition, to better access the generalization of our proposal, we also showed it achieved competitive results when classifying piRNAs of other species.},

In addition, Pythagorean fuzzy preference relations (PFPRs), as a generalization of intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations (IFPRs), are more flexible and applicable. The objective of this paper is to propose a novel decision support model for solving group decision-making problems in a Pythagorean fuzzy environment. First, we define the concepts of ordered consistency and multiplicative consistency for PFPRs. Then, aiming at the group decision-making problem of multiple PFPRs, a consistency improving model is constructed to improve the consistency of group preference relations. Later, a consensus reaching model is developed to reach the degree of group consensus. Furthermore, a decision support model with PFPRs is established to derive the normalized weights and output the final result. Holding these features, this paper builds a decision support model with PFPRs based on multiplicative consistency and consensus. Finally, the described method is validated by an example of financial risk management, and it is concluded that the solvency of a company is an important indicator that affects the financial early warning system.},

The hotspot problem occurs when cluster head (CH) nearer to BS may die prematurely due to uneven energy depletion resulting in partitioning the network. To overcome the issue of hotspot or energy hole, unequal clustering is used where variable size clusters are formed. Motivated from the aforesaid discussion, we propose an enhanced fuzzy unequal clustering and routing protocol (E-FUCA) where vital parameters are considered during CH candidate selection, and intelligent decision using fuzzy logic (FL) is taken by non-CH nodes during the selection of their CH for the formation of clusters. To further extend the lifetime, we have used FL for the next-hop choice for efficient routing. We have conducted the simulation experiments for four scenarios and compared the propound protocol’s performance with recent similar protocols. The experimental results validate the improved performance of E-FUCA with its comparative in respect of better lifetime, protracted stability period, and enhanced average energy.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, fog computing as a complementary facility of cloud computing has attracted great attentions in research communities because it has extraordinary potential to provide resources and processing services requested for applications at the edge network near to users. Recent researchers focus on how efficiently engage edge networks capabilities for execution and supporting of IoT applications and associated requirement. However, inefficient deployment of applications’ components on fog computing infrastructure results bandwidth and resource wastage, maximum power consumption, and unpleasant quality of service (QoS) level. This paper considers reduction of bandwidth wastage in regards to application components dependency in their distributed deployment. On the other hand, the service reliability is declined if an application’s components are deployed on a single node for the sake of power consumption management viewpoint. Therefore, a mechanism for tackling single point of failure and application reliability enhancement against failure are presented. Then, the components deployment is formulated to a multi-objective optimization problem with minimization perspective of both power consumption and total latency between each pair of components associated to applications. To solve this combinatorial optimization problem, a multi-objective cuckoo search algorithm (MOCSA) is presented. To validate the work, this algorithm is assessed in different conditions against some state-of the arts. The simulation results prove the amount 42%, 29%, 46%, 13%, and 5% improvement of proposed MOCSA in terms of average overall latency respectively against MOGWO, MOGWO-I, MOPSO, MOBA, and NSGA-II algorithms. Also, in term of average total power consumption the improvement is about 43%, 28%, 41%, 30%, and 32% respectively.},

First, some related theories of 2DULVs and the basic procedure of the MABAC method are briefly reviewed. Then, the maximum comprehensive evaluation value method is extended to 2DULVs to obtain combination weights of attributes, in which the subjective weights are determined according to the best–worst method (BWM) and the objective weights are calculated by the maximum deviation method. Besides, the generalized weighted average operator for 2DULVs (2DULGWA) is utilized to aggregate the evaluation information given by all experts. Finally, an improved MABAC for 2DULVs (2DUL-MABAC) is proposed, and an example is carried out to explain the validity of the proposed approach.},

Thus, it is aimed to contribute to the development of virtual fuzzy parametrized fuzzy soft set theory. To construct a topological structure on virtual fuzzy parametrized fuzzy soft sets, the concepts of point, quasi-coincident and mapping are first defined for this set theory and some of its characteristic properties are investigated. Then, virtual fuzzy parametrized fuzzy soft topological spaces are defined and concepts such as open, closed, closure, Q-neighborhood, interior, base, continuous, cover and compact are given. In addition, some related properties of these concepts are analyzed. Finally, many examples are given to make the paper easier to understand.},

  abstract     = {Synchronization of two neural networks through mutual learning is used to exchange the key over a public channel. In the absence of a weight vector from another party, the key challenge with neural synchronization is how to assess the coordination of two communication parties. There is an issue of delay in the current techniques in the synchronization assessment that has an impact on the security and privacy of the neural synchronization. In this paper, to assess the complete coordination of a cluster of neural networks more efficiently and timely, an important strategy for assessing coordination is presented. To approximately determine the degree of synchronization, the frequency of the two networks having the same output in prior iterations is used. The hash is used to determine if both the networks are completely synchronized exactly when a certain threshold is crossed. The improved technique makes absolute coordination between two communication parties using the weight vectors’ has value. In contrast, with existing approaches, two communicating parties who follow the proposed approach will detect complete synchronization sooner. This reduces the effective geometric likelihood. The proposed method, therefore, increases the safety of the protocol for neural key exchange. This proposed technique has been passed through different parametric tests. Simulations of the process show effectiveness in terms of cited results in the paper.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection based on the fuzzy neighborhood rough set model (FNRS) is highly popular in data mining. However, the dependent function of FNRS only considers the information present in the lower approximation of the decision while ignoring the information present in the upper approximation of the decision. This construction method may lead to the loss of some information. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a fuzzy neighborhood joint entropy model based on fuzzy neighborhood self-information measure (FNSIJE) and applies it to feature selection. First, to construct four uncertain fuzzy neighborhood self-information measures of decision variables, the concept of self-information is introduced into the upper and lower approximations of FNRS from the algebra view. The relationships between these measures and their properties are discussed in detail. It is found that the fourth measure, named tolerance fuzzy neighborhood self-information, has better classification performance. Second, an uncertainty measure based on the fuzzy neighborhood joint entropy has been proposed from the information view. Inspired by both algebra and information views, the FNSIJE is proposed. Third, the K–S test is used to delete features with weak distinguishing performance, which reduces the dimensionality of high-dimensional gene datasets, thereby reducing the complexity of high-dimensional gene datasets, and then, a forward feature selection algorithm is provided. Experimental results show that compared with related methods, the presented model can select less important features and have a higher classification accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Various works have been proposed to solve expensive multiobjective optimization problems (EMOPs) using surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) in recent decades. However, most existing methods focus on EMOPs with less than 30 decision variables, since a large number of training samples are required to build an accurate surrogate model for high-dimensional EMOPs, which is unrealistic for expensive multiobjective optimization. To address this issue, we propose an SAEA with an adaptive dropout mechanism. Specifically, this mechanism takes advantage of the statistical differences between different solution sets in the decision space to guide the selection of some crucial decision variables. A new infill criterion is then proposed to optimize the selected decision variables with the assistance of surrogate models. Moreover, the optimized decision variables are extended to new full-length solutions, and then the new candidate solutions are evaluated using expensive functions to update the archive. The proposed algorithm is tested on different benchmark problems with up to 200 decision variables compared to some state-of-the-art SAEAs. The experimental results have demonstrated the promising performance and computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm in high-dimensional expensive multiobjective optimization.},

Moreover, an adaptive neural network observer is developed to approximate the entire uncertainties, which are utilized to construct an improved cost function. By establishing a critic neural network, the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation is solved, and the approximate optimal error control policy is derived. The closed-loop VS manipulator system is verified to be ultimately uniformly bounded with the developed ADP-based feature tracking control strategy according to the Lyapunov theory.

Data collected from smart wearable devices size dramatically increases with data collected from millions of patients who are suffering from diseases such as diabetes.

Using long-term in situ observed data for 30 years (1980–2009) from ten rain gauge stations and three discharge measurement stations, the rainfall and runoff trends in the Nzoia River basin are predicted through satellite-based meteorological data comprising of: precipitation, mean temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and solar radiation. The prediction modelling was carried out in three sub-basins corresponding to the three discharge stations. LSTM and WNN were implemented with the same deep learning topological structure consisting of 4 hidden layers, each with 30 neurons. In the prediction of the basin runoff with the five meteorological parameters using LSTM and WNN, both models performed well with respective R2 values of 0.8967 and 0.8820. The MAE and RMSE measures for LSTM and WNN predictions ranged between 11–13 m3/s for the mean monthly runoff prediction. With the satellite-based meteorological data, LSTM predicted the mean monthly rainfall within the basin with R2 = 0.8610 as compared to R2 = 0.7825 using WNN. The MAE for mean monthly rainfall trend prediction was between 9 and 11 mm, while the RMSE varied between 15 and 21 mm. The performance of the models improved with increase in the number of input parameters, which corresponded to the size of the sub-basin. In terms of the computational time, both models converged at the lowest RMSE at nearly the same number of epochs, with WNN taking slightly longer to attain the minimum RMSE. The study shows that in hydrologic basins with scarce meteorological and hydrological monitoring networks, the use satellite-based meteorological data in deep learning neural network models are suitable for spatial and temporal analysis of rainfall and runoff trends.},

  abstract     = {Wart is a disease caused by human papillomavirus with common and plantar warts as general forms. Commonly used methods to treat warts are immunotherapy and cryotherapy. The selection of proper treatment is vital to cure warts. This paper establishes a classification and regression tree (CART) model based on particle swarm optimisation to help patients choose between immunotherapy and cryotherapy. The proposed model can accurately predict the response of patients to the two methods. Using an improved particle swarm algorithm (PSO) to optimise the parameters of the model instead of the traditional pruning algorithm, a more concise and more accurate model is obtained. Two experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed model. On the hand, five benchmarks are used to verify the performance of the improved PSO algorithm. On the other hand, the experiment on two wart datasets is conducted. Results show that the proposed model is effective. The proposed method classifies better than k-nearest neighbour, C4.5 and logistic regression. It also performs better than the conventional optimisation method for the CART algorithm. Moreover, the decision tree model established in this study is interpretable and understandable. Therefore, the proposed model can help patients and doctors reduce the medical cost and improve the quality of healing operation.},

  abstract     = {The distributed manufacturing has become a prevail production mode under the economic globalization. In this article, a memetic discrete differential evolution (MDDE) algorithm is proposed to address the distributed permutation flow shop scheduling problem (DPFSP) with the minimization of the makespan. An enhanced NEH (Nawaz–Enscore–Ham) method is presented to produce potential candidate solutions and Taillard’s acceleration method is adopted to ameliorate the operational efficiency of the MDDE. A new discrete mutation strategy is introduced to promote the search efficiency of the MDDE. Four neighborhood structures, which are based on job sequence and factory assignment adjustment mechanisms, are introduced to prevent the candidates from falling the local optimum during the search process. A neighborhood search mechanism is selected adaptively through a knowledge-based strategy which focuses on the adaptive evaluation for the neighborhood selection. The optimal combinations of parameters in the MDDE algorithm are testified by the design of experiment. The computational results and comparisons demonstrated the effectiveness of the MDDE algorithm for solving the DPFSP.},

  abstract     = {With the prosperity of e-commerce, ordering food online has become increasingly prevalent nowadays. Derived from the dispatching problem in Meituan, a real online food delivery (OFD) platform in China, this paper addresses an OFD problem (OFDP). To solve the OFDP efficiently, an effective matching algorithm with adaptive tie-breaking strategy (MAATS) is proposed by collaboratively fusing the optimization methods with machine learning (ML) techniques. First, to efficiently generate a partial solution with a certain quality, a best-matching heuristic is proposed. Second, to break the ties occurring in the best-matching heuristic and obtain a complete solution with high quality, multiple tie-breaking operators are designed. Third, to adapt to different scenarios, the tie-breaking operators are utilized in a dynamic way which is achieved by using ML methods including decision trees and a specially-designed deep neural network. Fourth, problem-specific features are extracted as decision information to assist the ML models to predict the best tie-breaking operator for use in the current scenario. Preliminary offline simulations are carried out on real historical data sets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, rigorous online A/B tests are conducted to evaluate the performance of MAATS in practical applications. The results of offline and online tests demonstrate both the effectiveness of MAATS to solve the OFDP and the application value to improve customer satisfaction and delivery efficiency on Meituan platform.},

One of the most relevant success factors is an adequate balanced tenancy, i.e., a complementary ecosystem of retail stores in the surroundings, both in planned and unplanned areas. In this paper, we use network theory to analyze the commercial spatial interactions in all the cities of Castile and Leon (an autonomous community in north-western Spain), Madrid, and Barcelona. Our approach encompasses different proposals both for the definition of the interaction networks and for their subsequent analyses. These methodologies can be used as pre-processing tools to capture features that formalize the relational dimension for location recommendation systems. Our results unveil the retail structure of different urban areas and enable a meaningful comparison between cities and methodologies. In addition, by means of consensus techniques, we identify a robust core of commercial relationships, independent of the particularities of each city, and thus help to distinguish transferable knowledge between cities. The results also suggest greater specialization of commercial space with city size.},

  abstract     = {Chimp optimization algorithm (ChOA) is a recently proposed metaheuristic. Interestingly, it simulates the social status relationship and hunting behavior of chimps. Due to the more flexible and complex application fields, researchers have higher requirements for native algorithms. In this paper, an enhanced chimp optimization algorithm (EChOA) is proposed to improve the accuracy of solutions. First, the highly disruptive polynomial mutation is used to initialize the population, which provides the foundation for global search. Next, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient of the chimps with the lowest social status is calculated with respect to the leader chimp. To reduce the probability of falling into the local optimum, the beetle antennae operator is used to improve the less fit chimps while gaining visual capability. Three strategies enhance the exploration and exploitation of the native algorithm. To verify the function optimization performance, EChOA is comprehensively analyzed on 12 classical benchmark functions and 15 CEC2017 benchmark functions. Besides, the practicability of EChOA is also highlighted by three engineering design problems and training multilayer perceptron. Compared with ChOA and five state-of-the-art algorithms, the statistical results show that EChOA has strong competitive capabilities and promising prospects.},

A binary version of GSK named novel binary Gaining Sharing knowledge-based optimization algorithm (NBGSK) depends on mainly two binary stages: binary junior gaining sharing stage and binary senior gaining sharing stage with knowledge factor 1. These two stages enable NBGSK for exploring and exploitation of the search space efficiently and effectively to solve problems in binary space. Moreover, to enhance the performance of NBGSK and prevent the solutions from trapping into local optima, NBGSK with population size reduction (PR-NBGSK) is introduced. It decreases the population size gradually with a linear function. The proposed NBGSK and PR-NBGSK applied to set of knapsack instances with small and large dimensions, which shows that NBGSK and PR-NBGSK are more efficient and effective in terms of convergence, robustness, and accuracy.},

The frequency spectrum from the three-phase current signal preprocess are applied as the input for 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN to conduct feature extraction, respectively. Then, the feature layers information are combined in the fully connected layer of HCNN. Finally, the performance status of TFI could be identified by the softmax classifier with Adam optimizer.

  abstract     = {Graph convolutional network (GCN) has made remarkable progress in learning good representations from graph-structured data. The layer-wise propagation rule of conventional GCN is designed in such a way that the feature aggregation at each node depends on the features of the one-hop neighbouring nodes. Adding an attention layer over the GCN can allow the network to provide different importance within various one-hop neighbours. These methods can capture the properties of static network, but is not well suited to capture the temporal patterns in time-varying networks. In this work, we propose a temporal graph attention network (TempGAN), where the aim is to learn representations from continuous-time temporal network by preserving the temporal proximity between nodes of the network. First, we perform a temporal walk over the network to generate a positive pointwise mutual information matrix (PPMI) which denote the temporal correlation between the nodes. Furthermore, we design a TempGAN architecture which uses both adjacency and PPMI information to generate node embeddings from temporal network. Finally, we conduct link prediction experiments by designing a TempGAN autoencoder to evaluate the quality of the embedding generated, and the results are compared with other state-of-the-art methods.},

Specifically, two following points are first considered: (1) a TextRank network is constructed for each patent text, (2) a prior knowledge network is constructed based on public dictionary data, in which network edges represent the prior interpretation relationship among all dictionary words in dictionary entries. Then, an improved node rank value evaluation formula is designed for TextRank networks of patent texts, in which prior interpretation information in prior knowledge network are introduced. Finally, patent keywords can be extracted by finding top-k node words with higher node rank values. In our experiments, patent text clustering task is used to examine the performance of proposed method, wherein several comparison experiments are executed. Corresponding results demonstrate that, new method can markedly obtain better performance than existing methods for patent keywords extraction task in an unsupervised way.},
