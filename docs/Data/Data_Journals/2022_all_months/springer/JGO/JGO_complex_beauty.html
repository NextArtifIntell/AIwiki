  abstract     = {In this paper, by using weighted kernel density estimation (KDE) to approximate the continuous probability density function (PDF) of the portfolio loss, and to compute the corresponding approximated Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), a KDE-based distributionally robust mean-CVaR portfolio optimization model is investigated. Its distributional uncertainty set (DUS) is defined indirectly by imposing the constraint on the weights in weighted KDE in terms of $$\phi $$ -divergence function in order that the corresponding infinite-dimensional space of PDF is converted into the finite-dimensional space on the weights. This makes the corresponding distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problem computationally tractable. We also prove that the optimal value and solution set of the KDE-based DRO problem converge to those of the portfolio optimization problem under the true distribution. Primary empirical test results show that the proposed model is meaningful.},

It employs orthogonal projections onto the individual subsets in an algorithmic regime that uses “blocks” of operators and has great flexibility in constructing specific algorithms from it. We extend this algorithmic scheme to handle a family of continuous cutter operators and to find a common fixed point of them. Since the family of continuous cutters includes several important specific operators, our generalized scheme, which ensures global convergence and retains the flexibility of BIP, can handle, in particular, metric (orthogonal) projectors and continuous subgradient projections, which are very important in applications. We also allow a certain kind of adaptive perturbations to be included, and along the way we derive a perturbed Fejér monotonicity lemma which is of independent interest.},

The approach leverages an elegant piecewise linear approximation for univariate quadratic functions due to Yarotsky (Neural Netw 94:103–114, 2017), formulating this (simple) approximation using mixed-integer programming (MIP). Notably, the number of constraints, binary variables, and auxiliary continuous variables used in this formulation grows logarithmically in the approximation error. Combining this with a diagonal perturbation technique to convert a nonseparable quadratic function into a separable one, we present a mixed-integer convex quadratic relaxation for nonconvex quadratic optimization problems. We study the strength (or sharpness) of our formulation and the tightness of its approximation. Further, we show that our formulation represents feasible points via a Gray code. We close with computational results on problems with quadratic objectives and/or constraints, showing that our proposed method (i) across the board outperforms existing MIP relaxations from the literature, and (ii) on hard instances produces better bounds than exact solvers within a fixed time budget.},

The new approach, called Regularized Outer-Approximation (ROA), has been implemented as part of the open-source Mixed-integer nonlinear decomposition toolbox for Pyomo—MindtPy. We compare the OA method with seven regularization function alternatives for ROA.

Then, a power penalty method is applied to (NCS) for introducing an approximating mixed variational inequality without constraints (AMVI, for short). After that, a convergence result that the unique solution of (MVI) can be approached by the unique solution of (AMVI) when a penalty parameter tends to infinity, is established.

Given a nonnegative matrix, NMF aims to obtain two low-rank nonnegative factor matrices by solving a constrained optimization problem. The Hierarchical Alternating Least Squares (HALS) algorithm is a well-known and widely-used iterative method for solving such optimization problems. However, the original update rule used in the HALS algorithm is not well defined. In this paper, we propose a novel well-defined update rule of the HALS algorithm, and prove its global convergence in the sense of Zangwill. Unlike conventional globally-convergent update rules, the proposed one allows variables to take the value of zero and hence can obtain sparse factor matrices. We also present two stopping conditions that guarantee the finite termination of the HALS algorithm. The practical usefulness of the proposed update rule is shown through experiments using real-world datasets.},

This problem can be solved within $$O(m \log n)$$ time, where m and n are the numbers of edges and nodes, respectively.

We first provide some optimality conditions of the problem. Then we propose a strongly polynomial time algorithm in $$O(m^2\log n)$$ time based on a binary search and a greedy method.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we address the line-capacitated minimum Steiner tree problem (the Lc-MStT problem, for short), which is a variant of the (Euclidean) capacitated minimum Steiner tree problem and defined as follows. Given a set $$X={r_{1},r_{2},\ldots , r_{n}}$$ of n terminals in $${\mathbb {R}}^2$$ , a demand function $$d:X \rightarrow {\mathbb {N}}$$ and a positive integer C, we are asked to determine the location of a line l and a Steiner tree $$T_l$$ to interconnect these n terminals in X and at least one point located on this line l such that the total demand of terminals in each maximal subtree (of $$T_l$$ ) connected to the line l, where the terminals in such maximal subtree are all located at the same side of this line l, does not exceed the bound C. The objective is to minimize total weight $$\sum _{e\in T_l}w(e)$$ of such a Steiner tree $$T_l$$ among all line-capacitated Steiner trees mentioned-above, where weight $$w(e)=0$$ if two endpoints of that edge $$e\in T_l$$ are located on the line l and otherwise weight w(e) is the Euclidean distance between two endpoints of that edge $$e\in T_l$$ . In addition, when this line l is as an input in $${\mathbb {R}}^2$$ and $$\sum _{r\in X} d(r) \le C$$ holds, we refer to this version as the 1-line-fixed minimum Steiner tree problem (the 1Lf-MStT problem, for short). We obtain three main results. (1) Given a $$\rho _{st}$$ -approximation algorithm to solve the Euclidean minimum Steiner tree problem and a $$\rho _{1Lf}$$ -approximation algorithm to solve the 1Lf-MStT problem, respectively, we design a $$(\rho _{st}\rho _{1Lf}+2)$$ -approximation algorithm to solve the Lc-MStT problem. (2) Whenever demand of each terminal $$r\in X$$ is less than $$\frac{C}{2}$$ , we provide a $$(\rho _{1Lf}+2)$$ -approximation algorithm to resolve the Lc-MStT problem. (3) Whenever demand of each terminal $$r\in X$$ is at least $$\frac{C}{2}$$ , using the Edmonds’ algorithm to solve the minimum weight perfect matching as a subroutine, we present an exact algorithm in polynomial time to resolve the Lc-MStT problem.},

  abstract     = {Bilevel optimization is an increasingly important tool to model hierarchical decision making. However, the ability of modeling such settings makes bilevel problems hard to solve in theory and practice. In this paper, we add on the general difficulty of this class of problems by further incorporating convex black-box constraints in the lower level. For this setup, we develop a cutting-plane algorithm that computes approximate bilevel-feasible points. We apply this method to a bilevel model of the European gas market in which we use a joint chance constraint to model uncertain loads. Since the chance constraint is not available in closed form, this fits into the black-box setting studied before. For the applied model, we use further problem-specific insights to derive bounds on the objective value of the bilevel problem. By doing so, we are able to show that we solve the application problem to approximate global optimality. In our numerical case study we are thus able to evaluate the welfare sensitivity in dependence of the achieved safety level of uncertain load coverage.},

Problems of this type are extremely challenging as a single-level reformulation suitable for off-the-shelf solvers is not available in general. In order to solve these problems to global optimality, we enhance an approximative projection-based algorithm for mixed-integer linear bilevel programming problems from the literature to become exact under one additional assumption. This assumption still allows for discrete and continuous leader and follower variables on both levels, but forbids continuous upper-level variables to appear in lower-level constraints and thus ensures that a bilevel optimum is attained. In addition, we extend our exact algorithm to make it applicable to a wider problem class. This setting allows nonlinear constraints and objective functions on both levels under certain assumptions, but still requires that the lower-level problem is convex in its continuous variables. We also discuss computational experiments on modified library instances.},

We obtain a compact extended relaxation of all A-odd cycle inequalities, which allows to optimize over the Chvátal–Gomory closure without repeated calls to separation algorithms and has less inequalities than the formulation provided by Boros et al. (SIAM J Discrete Math 5(2):163–177, 1992) for sparse matrices. In a computational study, we confirm the strength of this relaxation and show that we can provide very strong bounds for the BoxQP, even with a plain linear program. The resulting bounds are significantly stronger than these from Bonami et al. (Math Program Comput 10(3):333–382, 2018), which arise from separating A-odd cycle inequalities heuristically.},

  abstract     = {Multipartite entity resolution aims at integrating records from multiple datasets into one entity. We derive a mathematical formulation for a general class of record linkage problems in multipartite entity resolution across many datasets as a combinatorial optimization problem known as the multidimensional assignment problem. As a motivation for our approach, we illustrate the advantage of multipartite entity resolution over sequential bipartite matching. Because the optimization problem is NP-hard, we apply two heuristic procedures, a Greedy algorithm and very large scale neighborhood search, to solve the assignment problem and find the most likely matching of records from multiple datasets into a single entity. We evaluate and compare the performance of these algorithms and their modifications on synthetically generated data. We perform computational experiments to compare performance of recent heuristic, the very large-scale neighborhood search, with a Greedy algorithm, another heuristic for the MAP, as well as with two versions of genetic algorithm, a general metaheuristic. Importantly, we perform experiments to compare two alternative methods of re-starting the search for the former heuristic, specifically a random-sampling multi-start and a deterministic design-based multi-start. We find evidence that design-based multi-start can be more efficient as the size of databases grow large. In addition, we show that very large scale search, especially its multi-start version, outperforms simple Greedy heuristic. Hybridization of Greedy search with very large scale neighborhood search improves the performance. Using multi-start with as few as three additional runs of very large scale search offers some improvement in the performance of the very large scale search procedure. Last, we propose an approach to evaluating complexity of the very large-scale neighborhood search.},

  abstract     = {The optimization problems with a sparsity constraint is a class of important global optimization problems. A typical type of thresholding algorithms for solving such a problem adopts the traditional full steepest descent direction or Newton-like direction as a search direction to generate an iterate on which a certain thresholding is performed. Traditional hard thresholding discards a large part of a vector, and thus some important information contained in a dense vector has been lost in such a thresholding process. Recent study (Zhao in SIAM J Optim 30(1): 31–55, 2020) shows that the hard thresholding should be applied to a compressible vector instead of a dense vector to avoid a big loss of information. On the other hand, the optimal k-thresholding as a novel thresholding technique may overcome the intrinsic drawback of hard thresholding, and performs thresholding and objective function minimization simultaneously. This motivates us to propose the so-called partial gradient optimal thresholding (PGOT) method and its relaxed versions in this paper. The PGOT is an integration of the partial gradient and the optimal k-thresholding technique. The solution error bound and convergence for the proposed algorithms have been established in this paper under suitable conditions. Application of our results to the sparse optimization problems arising from signal recovery is also discussed. Experiment results from synthetic data indicate that the proposed algorithm is efficient and comparable to several existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Hammerstein–Wiener models constitute a significant class of block-structured dynamic models, as they approximate process nonlinearities on the basis of input–output data without requiring identification of a full nonlinear process model. Optimization problems with Hammerstein–Wiener models embedded are nonconvex, and thus local optimization methods may obtain suboptimal solutions. In this work, we develop a deterministic global optimization strategy that exploits the specific structure of Hammerstein–Wiener models to extend existing theory on global optimization of systems with linear dynamics. At first, we discuss alternative formulations of the dynamic optimization problem with Hammerstein–Wiener models embedded, demonstrating that careful selection of the optimization variables of the problem can offer significant numerical advantages to the solution approach. Then, we develop convex relaxations for the proposed optimization problem and discuss implementation aspects to obtain the global solution focusing on a control parametrization technique. Finally, we apply our optimization strategy to case studies comprising both offline and online dynamic optimization problems. The results confirm an improved computational performance of the proposed solution approach over alternative options not exploiting the linear dynamics for all considered examples. They also underline the tractability of deterministic global dynamic optimization when using few control intervals in online applications like nonlinear model predictive control.},

Because we assume the existence of data, we can consider confidence regions for the different estimators of the parameters of the distributions. Based on the definition of an appropriate estimator in the interior of the resulting confidence region, we propose a new data-driven stochastic optimization problem. This new approach applies the idea of a-posteriori Bayesian methods to the confidence region. We are able to prove that the expected value, over all observations and all possible distributions, of the optimal objective function of the proposed stochastic optimization problem is bounded by a constant. This constant is small for a sufficiently large i.i.d. sample size and depends on the chosen confidence level and the size of the confidence region.

By exploiting the multilinearity as well as the sparsity structure of the problem, four polynomial-time approximation algorithms are proposed, which are easily implemented, of low computational complexity, and can serve as initial procedures for iterative algorithms. In addition, theoretically guaranteed approximation lower bounds are derived for all the algorithms.

We analyse a generalization (GP4A) which replaces the closed perspective transform with a more general closed gauge. We decompose GP4A into the iterative application of two separate operators, and analyse it as a splitting method. By showing that GP4A and its under-relaxations exhibit global convergence whenever a fixed point exists, we obtain convergence guarantees for P4A by letting the gauge specify to the closed perspective transform for a convex function. We then provide easy-to-verify sufficient conditions for the existence of fixed points for the GP4A, using the Minkowski function representation of the gauge. Conveniently, the approach reveals that global minimizers of the objective function for P4A form an exposed face of the dilated fundamental set of the closed perspective transform.},

For a proper lower semicontinuous function, we prove that a global minimizer can be guaranteed if it is bounded below, has the primal-lower-nice property and satisfies the generalized Palais-Smale condition. This result can cover the classic differentiable case whose proof depends heavily on the global existence of the ordinary differential equation. Several examples are constructed to show that the global minimizer may be violated if any of three conditions above is dropped.},

Whenever an integer solution is found through the branching process, a node is created in the search tree for each criterion. That is, by adding a cutting plane that locally approximates the criterion, as to exclude a subset of dominated points. The nodes are traversed according to the depth-first strategy and the same process is repeated for the obtained programs as (P).

In general, the nonconvex nature of these models still poses a challenge to the available solvers, which do not consistently perform well for larger-scale instances. Therefore, we propose an appealing alternative algorithm that allows for overcoming computational performance issues. Our novel technique, named the p-Lagrangian decomposition, is a decomposition method that combines Lagrangian decomposition with mixed-integer programming-based relaxations. These relaxations are obtained using the reformulated normalised multiparametric disaggregation technique and can be made arbitrarily precise by means of a precision parameter p. We provide a technical analysis showing the convergent behaviour of the approach as the approximation is made increasingly precise. We observe that the proposed method presents significant reductions in computational time when compared with a previously proposed techniques in the literature and the direct employment of a commercial solver. Moreover, our computational experiments show that the employment of a simple heuristic can recover solutions with small duality gaps.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an open-source solver for mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems is presented. The Supporting Hyperplane Optimization Toolkit (SHOT) combines a dual strategy based on polyhedral outer approximations (POA) with primal heuristics. The POA is achieved by expressing the nonlinear feasible set of the MINLP problem with linearizations obtained with the extended supporting hyperplane (ESH) and extended cutting plane (ECP) algorithms. The dual strategy can be tightly integrated with the mixed-integer programming (MIP) subsolver in a so-called single-tree manner, i.e., only a single MIP optimization problem is solved, where the polyhedral linearizations are added as lazy constraints through callbacks in the MIP solver. This enables the MIP solver to reuse the branching tree in each iteration, in contrast to most other POA-based methods. SHOT is available as a COIN-OR open-source project, and it utilizes a flexible task-based structure making it easy to extend and modify. It is currently available in GAMS, and can be utilized in AMPL, Pyomo and JuMP as well through its ASL interface. The main functionality and solution strategies implemented in SHOT are described in this paper, and their impact on the performance are illustrated through numerical benchmarks on 406 convex MINLP problems from the MINLPLib problem library. Many of the features introduced in SHOT can be utilized in other POA-based solvers as well. To show the overall effectiveness of SHOT, it is also compared to other state-of-the-art solvers on the same benchmark set.},

  abstract     = {The solution to a biobjective optimization problem is composed of a collection of trade-off solution called the Pareto set. Based on a computer assisted proof methodology, the present work studies the question of certifying numerically that a conjectured set is close to the Pareto set. Two situations are considered. First, we analyze the case where the conjectured set is directly provided: one objective is explicitly given as a function of the other. Second, we analyze the situation where the conjectured set is parameterized: both objectives are explicitly given as functions of a parameter. In both cases, we formulate the question of verifying that the conjectured set is close to the Pareto set as a global optimization problem. These situations are illustrated on a new class of extremal problems over convex polygons in the plane. The objectives are to maximize the area and perimeter of a polygon with a fixed diameter, for a given number of sides.},

It combines ideas of trade-off free search and navigation (where a decision maker sees changes in objective function values in real time) and extends the NAUTILUS Navigator method to surrogate-assisted optimization. Importantly, it utilizes uncertainty quantification from surrogate models like Kriging or properties like Lipschitz continuity to approximate a so-called optimistic Pareto optimal set. This enables the decision maker to search in unexplored parts of the Pareto optimal set and requires a small amount of expensive function evaluations. We share the implementation of O-NAUTILUS as open source code. Thanks to its graphical user interface, a decision maker can see in real time how the preferences provided affect the direction of the search. We demonstrate the potential and benefits of O-NAUTILUS with a problem related to the design of vehicles.},

It extends the interactive NIMBUS method. The main idea underlying the designed algorithm, called LR-NIMBUS, is to ask the decision maker for a most acceptable (typical) scenario, find an efficient solution for this scenario satisfying the decision maker, and then apply the derived efficient solution to generate a lightly robust efficient solution. The preferences of the decision maker are incorporated through classifying the objective functions. A lightly robust efficient solution is generated by solving an augmented weighted achievement scalarizing function. We establish the tractability of the algorithm for important classes of objective functions and uncertainty sets.

  abstract     = {We consider a bilevel continuous knapsack problem where the leader controls the capacity of the knapsack and the follower chooses an optimal packing according to his own profits, which may differ from those of the leader. To this bilevel problem, we add uncertainty in a natural way, assuming that the leader does not have full knowledge about the follower’s problem. More precisely, adopting the robust optimization approach and assuming that the follower’s profits belong to a given uncertainty set, our aim is to compute a solution that optimizes the worst-case follower’s reaction from the leader’s perspective. By investigating the complexity of this problem with respect to different types of uncertainty sets, we make first steps towards better understanding the combination of bilevel optimization and robust combinatorial optimization. We show that the problem can be solved in polynomial time for both discrete and interval uncertainty, but that the same problem becomes NP-hard when each coefficient can independently assume only a finite number of values. In particular, this demonstrates that replacing uncertainty sets by their convex hulls may change the problem significantly, in contrast to the situation in classical single-level robust optimization. For general polytopal uncertainty, the problem again turns out to be NP-hard, and the same is true for ellipsoidal uncertainty even in the uncorrelated case. All presented hardness results already apply to the evaluation of the leader’s objective function.},

Secondly, based on DC algorithm and iterative soft thresholding algorithm, a successful algorithm for the regularization minimization $$(\mathrm{E}^{\lambda }_\alpha )$$ , called the DCS algorithm, is given.

  abstract     = {Lipschitz continuity of the gradient mapping of a continuously differentiable function plays a crucial role in designing various optimization algorithms. However, many functions arising in practical applications such as low rank matrix factorization or deep neural network problems do not have a Lipschitz continuous gradient. This led to the development of a generalized notion known as the L-smad property, which is based on generalized proximity measures called Bregman distances. However, the L-smad property cannot handle nonsmooth functions, for example, simple nonsmooth functions like $$\vert x^4-1 \vert $$ and also many practical composite problems are out of scope. We fix this issue by proposing the MAP property, which generalizes the L-smad property and is also valid for a large class of structured nonconvex nonsmooth composite problems. Based on the proposed MAP property, we propose a globally convergent algorithm called Model BPG, that unifies several existing algorithms. The convergence analysis is based on a new Lyapunov function. We also numerically illustrate the superior performance of Model BPG on standard phase retrieval problems and Poisson linear inverse problems, when compared to a state of the art optimization method that is valid for generic nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problems.},

In this study, we present a novel quadratic programming (QP)-based approach to classify bags. Solution of our QP formulation links the instance-level contributions to the bag label estimates, and provides a linear bag classifier along with a decision threshold. Our approach imposes no additional constraints on relating instance labels to bag labels and can be adapted to learning applications with different MIL assumptions. Unlike existing specialized heuristic approaches to solve previous MIL formulations, our QP models can be directly solved to optimality using any commercial QP solver. Also, kindly confirm Our computational experiments show that proposed QP formulation is efficient in terms of solution time, overcoming a main drawback of previous optimization algorithms for MIL.

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically demonstrated the importance of labor to supply chain network activities from production to distribution with shortfalls in labor availability, for numerous reasons, resulting in product shortages and the reduction of profits of firms. Even as progress has been made through vaccinations, issues associated with labor are still arising. Increasing wages is a strategy to enhance labor productivity and, also to ameliorate, in part, labor shortages, but has not, until this work, been explored in a full supply chain network context. Specifically, in this paper, a game theory supply chain network model is constructed of firms competing in producing a substitutable, but differentiated, product, and seeking to determine their equilibrium product path flows, as well as hourly wages to pay their workers, under fixed labor amounts associated with links, and wage-responsive productivity factors. The theoretical and computational approach utilizes the theory of variational inequalities. We first introduce a model without wage bounds on links and then extend it to include wage bounds. Lagrange analysis is conducted for the latter model, which yields interesting insights, as well as an alternative variational inequality formulation. A series of numerical examples reveals that firms can gain in terms of profits by being willing to pay higher wages, resulting in benefits also for their workers, as well as consumers, who enjoy lower demand market prices for the products. However, sensitivity analysis should be conducted to determine the range of such wage bounds. Ultimately, we observed, that the profits may decrease and then stabilize. This work adds to the literature on the integration of concepts from economics and operations research for supply chain networks and also has policy implications.},

  abstract     = {We are given a set of parallel jobs that have to be executed on a set of speed-scalable processors varying their speeds dynamically. Running a job at a slower speed is more energy-efficient, however, it takes a longer time and affects the performance. Every job is characterized by the processing volume and the number or the set of the required processors. Our objective is to minimize the maximum completion time so that the energy consumption is not greater than a given energy budget. For various particular cases, we propose polynomial-time approximation algorithms, consisting of two stages. At the first stage, we give an auxiliary convex program. By solving this problem, we get processing times of jobs and a lower bound on the makespan. Then, at the second stage, we transform our problem into the corresponding scheduling problem with the constant speed of processors and construct a feasible schedule. We also obtain an “almost exact” solution for the preemptive settings based on a configuration linear program.},

Several variants of the variational problem are known, such as point-to-point, point-to-plane, generalized ICP, and normal ICP (NICP). This paper proposes a closed-form exact solution for orthogonal registration of point clouds based on the generalized point-to-point ICP algorithm. We use points and normal vectors to align 3D point clouds, while the common point-to-point approach uses only the coordinates of points. The paper also presents a closed-form approximate solution to the variational problem of the NICP. In addition, the paper introduces a regularization approach and proposes reliable algorithms for solving variational problems using closed-form solutions. The performance of the algorithms is compared with that of common algorithms for solving variational problems of the ICP algorithm.

The main difference with the previously obtained results consists in the fact that now the extended dual problem uses neither the immobile indices themselves nor the explicit information about the convex hull of these indices. The strong duality formulations presented in the paper for linear copositive problems have similar structure and properties as that proposed in the works by M. Ramana, L. Tuncel, and H.

The objective is profit maximization by choosing the best hub and spoke topology, with the corresponding price structure, in a leader–follower setting. Because this bi–level optimization problem is NP–hard, the use of metaheuristics is a natural choice for solving real–size instances. A variable neighborhood search algorithm is designed as a solution approach for the leader. The characterization of optimal routes under the price equilibrium is given in order to simplify and improve the algorithm. When it comes to the follower, we have shown how to reformulate in a linear fashion the initial non–linear model. The computational experiments are conducted on the CAB instances. The results of these experiments are thoroughly discussed, highlighting the effects of different parameters and providing some interesting managerial insights.},

The Hadamard differentiability of the efficient value mapping and a formula to compute its derivative are also obtained. Then, we apply these derivatives to establish an implicit set-valued map theorem and employ it to higher-order sensitivity analysis of the solution mapping for a parametric vector equilibrium problem. Sensitivity for solutions to a parametric generalized equation is also investigated. Many examples are provided for analyzing and illustrating the obtained results.},

However, often these approximations are used for further evaluations. For those applications a polyhedron is a structure that is not easy to handle. In this paper, we introduce an approximation with a simpler structure respecting the natural ordering. In particular, we compute a box-coverage of the nondominated set. To do so, we use an approach that, in general, allows us to update not only one but several boxes whenever a new nondominated point is found.

  abstract     = {In this paper we consider a problem, called convex projection, of projecting a convex set onto a subspace. We will show that to a convex projection one can assign a particular multi-objective convex optimization problem, such that the solution to that problem also solves the convex projection (and vice versa), which is analogous to the result in the polyhedral convex case considered in Löhne and Weißing (Math Methods Oper Res 84(2):411–426, 2016). In practice, however, one can only compute approximate solutions in the (bounded or self-bounded) convex case, which solve the problem up to a given error tolerance. We will show that for approximate solutions a similar connection can be proven, but the tolerance level needs to be adjusted. That is, an approximate solution of the convex projection solves the multi-objective problem only with an increased error. Similarly, an approximate solution of the multi-objective problem solves the convex projection with an increased error. In both cases the tolerance is increased proportionally to a multiplier. These multipliers are deduced and shown to be sharp. These results allow to compute approximate solutions to a convex projection problem by computing approximate solutions to the corresponding multi-objective convex optimization problem, for which algorithms exist in the bounded case. For completeness, we will also investigate the potential generalization of the following result to the convex case. In Löhne and Weißing (Math Methods Oper Res 84(2):411–426, 2016), it has been shown for the polyhedral case, how to construct a polyhedral projection associated to any given vector linear program and how to relate their solutions. This in turn yields an equivalence between polyhedral projection, multi-objective linear programming and vector linear programming. We will show that only some parts of this result can be generalized to the convex case, and discuss the limitations.},

Unlike L-smooth convex functions, where the Lipschitz continuity of the objective gradient holds globally, the class of self-concordant functions only has local bounds, making it difficult to estimate the number of linear minimization oracle (LMO) calls for the underlying optimization algorithm. Fortunately, we can still prove that the number of LMO calls of our method is nearly the same as that of the standard Frank-Wolfe method in the L-smooth case. Specifically, our method requires at most $${\mathcal {O}}\big (\varepsilon ^{-(1 + \nu )}\big )$$ LMO’s, where $$\varepsilon $$ is the desired accuracy, and $$\nu \in (0, 0.139)$$ is a given constant depending on the chosen initial point of the proposed algorithm. Our intensive numerical experiments on three applications: portfolio design with the competitive ratio, D-optimal experimental design, and logistic regression with elastic-net regularizer, show that the proposed Newton Frank–Wolfe method outperforms different state-of-the-art competitors.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the problem of maximizing a monotone non-decreasing submodular function $$f :2^\Omega \rightarrow {\mathbb {R}}_{+}$$ subject to a cardinality constraint, i.e., $$\max { f(A) : |A| \le k, A \subseteq \Omega } $$ . We propose a deterministic algorithm based on a new greedy strategy for solving this problem. We prove that when the objective function f satisfies certain assumptions, the algorithm we propose can return a $$1 - \kappa _f (1 - \frac{1}{k})^k$$ approximate solution with O(kn) value oracle queries, where $$\kappa _f$$ is the curvature of the monotone submodular function f. We also show that our algorithm outperforms the traditional greedy algorithm in some cases. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to implement our algorithm in practice.},

At the first level we are able to derive the closed-form formula of the convex envelope.

Generating a pattern has been shown to be equivalent to solving a 0–1 multilinear program (MP). Thus, the success of LAD is tightly related to how efficiently practical instances of pattern generation MP’s can be solved. For a polyhedral relaxation of LAD pattern generation MP, this paper introduces a new notion of similarity among data that allows for simultaneously relaxing multiple terms of the objective function of MP into a single valid inequality for the Boolean MP polytope. Specifically, we present a framework for constructing three types of strong valid inequalities from cliques in multiple graph representations of data that collectively yield a tight polyhedral relaxation of MP. Furthermore, we specify conditions under which each type of the new inequalities defines a facet of the MP polytope. In comparison with methods from the literature, benefits of the new inequalities are validated through classification experiments with 8 public machine learning datasets.},

  abstract     = {We address the Electricity Contract Selection Problem (ECSP), of finding best parameters of an electricity contract for a client based on his/her past records of electricity consumption over a fixed time period. The objective is to optimize the electricity bill composed by some fixed cost, the cost of the subscription of the electricity contract and penalties due to overpowering when consumption exceeds subscribed power. The ECSP can be formulated as a convex separable optimization problem subject to total order constraints. Due to this special structure, ECSP is a special case of two well known classes of convex separable optimization problems, namely the minimum network flow under convex separable cost and minimizing convex separable functions under chain constraints. Both classes are well treated in the litterature and can be solved in polynomial time (Ahuja and Orlin in Oper Res 49(5):784–789, 2001; Ahuja et al. in Manag Sci 49(7):950–964, 2003; Best et al. in SIAM J Optim 10:658–672, 2000; Karzanov and McCormick in SIAM J Comput 26(4):1245–1275, 1997; Minoux in Eur J Oper Res 18(3):377–387, 1984; Minoux, in Gallo and Sandi (eds) Netflow at pisa, mathematical programming studies, Springer, Berlin, 1986). In particular, the algorithm in Ahuja and Orlin (2001) achieves the best theoretical time complexity assuming that computing the objective function value at one specific point can be done in constant time. However, when we work on a big amount of historic data as in ECSP, the time required for evaluating the objective function cannot be assumed to be O(1) anymore. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for ECSP which is specially designed to reduce the computational effort over large scale historical data. We present numerical results showing that our algorithm outperforms the algorithm in Ahuja and Orlin (2001) when applied to consumption data of various types of clients. A robust version of ECSP based on a Seasonal and Trend decomposition approach for modelling consumption uncertainty is also investigated. The resulting worst-case cost minimization problem is shown to be efficiently solvable using the same algorithm as for deterministic ECSP.},

  abstract     = {Multi-objective optimization of computationally expensive, multimodal problems is very challenging, and is even more difficult for problems with many objectives (more than three). Optimization methods that incorporate surrogates within iterative frameworks, can be effective for solving such problems by reducing the number of expensive objective function evaluations that need to be done to find a good solution. However, only a few surrogate algorithms have been developed that are suitable for solving expensive many-objective problems. We propose a novel and effective optimization algorithm, $$\varepsilon $$ -MaSO, that integrates $$\varepsilon $$ -dominance with iterative Radial Basis Function surrogate-assisted framework to solve problems with many expensive objectives. $$\varepsilon $$ -MaSO also incorporates a new strategy for selecting points for expensive evaluations, that is specially designed for many-objective problems. Moreover, a bi-level restart mechanism is introduced to prevent the algorithm from remaining in a local optimum and hence, increase the probability of finding the global optimum. Effectiveness of $$\varepsilon $$ -MaSO is illustrated via application to DTLZ test suite with 2 to 8 objectives and to a simulation model of an environmental application. Results on both test problems and the environmental application indicate that $$\varepsilon $$ -MaSO outperforms the other two surrogate-assisted many-objective methods, CSEA and K-RVEA, and an evolutionary many-objective method Borg within limited budget.},

These tools have a rich and successful history of thirty five years of development, and the research in recent years is being increasingly explored to new trends in the development of DCA: design novel DCA variants to improve standard DCA, to deal with the scalability and with broader classes than DC programs. Following these trends, we address in this paper the two wide classes of nonconvex problems, called partial DC programs and generalized partial DC programs, and investigate an alternating approach based on DCA for them. A partial DC program in two variables $$(x,y)\in \mathbb {R}^{n}\times {\mathbb {R}}^{m}$$ takes the form of a standard DC program in each variable while fixing other variable. A so-named alternating DCA and its inexact/generalized versions are developed. The convergence properties of these algorithms are established: both exact and inexact alternating DCA converge to a weak critical point of the considered problem, in particular, when the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz inequality property is satisfied, the algorithms furnish a Fréchet/Clarke critical point. The proposed algorithms are implemented on the problem of finding an intersection point of two nonconvex sets. Numerical experiments are performed on an important application that is robust principal component analysis. Numerical results show the efficiency and the superiority of the alternating DCA comparing with the standard DCA as well as a well known alternating projection algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Different versions of polyhedral outer approximation are used by many algorithms for mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). While it has been demonstrated that such methods work well for convex MINLP, extending them to solve nonconvex problems has traditionally been challenging. The Supporting Hyperplane Optimization Toolkit (SHOT) is a solver based on polyhedral approximations of the nonlinear feasible set of MINLP problems. SHOT is an open source COIN-OR project, and is currently one of the most efficient global solvers for convex MINLP. In this paper, we discuss some extensions to SHOT that significantly extend its applicability to nonconvex problems. The functionality include utilizing convexity detection for selecting the nonlinearities to linearize, lifting reformulations for special classes of functions, feasibility relaxations for infeasible subproblems and adding objective cuts to force the search for better feasible solutions. This functionality is not unique to SHOT, but can be implemented in other similar methods as well. In addition to discussing the new nonconvex functionality of SHOT, an extensive benchmark of deterministic solvers for nonconvex MINLP is performed that provides a snapshot of the current state of nonconvex MINLP.},

We compare this to various weaker relaxations, studying when they may be considered as viable alternatives.

  abstract     = {The solution to the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) is vital for optimizing logistics. However, the transformation of real-world logistics problems into the CVRP involves diverse constraints, interactions between various routes, and a balance between optimization performance and computation load. In this study, we propose a systematic model originating from the part logistic routing problem (PLRP), which is a two-dimensional loading capacitated pickup-and-delivery problem that considers time windows, multiple uses of vehicles, queuing, transit, and heterogeneous vehicles. The newly introduced queuing and transit complicate the problem, and to the best of our knowledge, it cannot be solved using existing methods or the standard commercial optimizer. Hence, this problem has caused the existing research to develop, generalize, and extend into the two-dimensional CVRP (2L-CVRP). To solve this problem, we provide a framework that decouples the combination of 2L-CVRP and global optimization engineering and derives an efficient and realistic solver that integrates diverse types of intelligent algorithms. These algorithms include: (1) a heuristic algorithm for initializing feasible solutions by imitating manual planning, (2) asynchronous simulated annealing (SA) and Tabu search (TS) algorithms to accelerate the optimization of global routes based on novel bundling mechanics, (3) dynamic programming for routing, (4) heuristic algorithms for packing, (5) simulators to review associated time-related constraints, and (6) truck-saving processes to promote the optimal solution and reduce the number of trucks. Moreover, the performances of the SA and TS solver algorithms are compared in terms of various size scales of data to obtain an empirical recommendation for selection. The proposed model successfully established an intelligent management system that can provide systematic solutions for logistics planning, resulting in higher performance and lower costs compared to that of manual planning.},

Numerical results show that the proposed models achieve high recoverability rates as compared to the truncated nuclear norm method and the alternating bilinear optimization approach. The results also demonstrate that the proposed DCA with the PPA framework is efficient in handling larger instances.},

The term “least changes” is defined in the sense of a global sum of strictly convex functions of changes. The main difficulty in this calculation is that the extrema of the interpolant have to be found automatically, but the number of all possible combinations of extrema can be $${\mathcal {O}}(n^{k-1})$$ , which makes not practicable to test each one separately. It is known that the case $$k=1$$ is straightforward, and that the case $$k&gt;1$$ reduces to partitioning the data into at most k disjoint sets of adjacent data and solving a $$k=1$$ problem for each set. Some ordering relations of the extrema are studied that establish three quite efficient algorithms by using a binary search method for partitioning the data. In the least squares case the total work is only $${\mathcal {O}}(n \sigma +k\sigma \log _2\sigma )$$ computer operations when $$k \ge 3$$ and is only $${\mathcal {O}}(n)$$ when $$k=1$$ or 2, where $$\sigma -2$$ is the number of sign changes in the sequence of the first differences of the data. Fortran software has been written for this case and the numerical results indicate superior performance to existing algorithms. Some examples with real data illustrate the method. Many applications of the method arise from bioinformatics, energy, geophysics, medical imaging, and peak finding in spectroscopy, for instance.},

  abstract     = {The European gas market is implemented as an entry-exit system, which aims to decouple transport and trading of gas. It has been modeled in the literature as a multilevel problem, which contains a nonlinear flow model of gas physics. Besides the multilevel structure and the nonlinear flow model, the computation of so-called technical capacities is another major challenge. These lead to nonlinear adjustable robust constraints that are computationally intractable in general. We provide techniques to equivalently reformulate these nonlinear adjustable constraints as finitely many convex constraints including integer variables in the case that the underlying network is tree-shaped. We further derive additional combinatorial constraints that significantly speed up the solution process. Using our results, we can recast the multilevel model as a single-level nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear problem, which we then solve on a real-world network, namely the Greek gas network, to global optimality. Overall, this is the first time that the considered multilevel entry-exit system can be solved for a real-world sized network and a nonlinear flow model.},

  abstract     = {In a single-objective setting, nonconvex quadratic problems can equivalently be reformulated as convex problems over the cone of completely positive matrices. In small dimensions this cone equals the cone of matrices which are entrywise nonnegative and positive semidefinite, so the convex reformulation can be solved via SDP solvers. Considering multiobjective nonconvex quadratic problems, naturally the question arises, whether the advantage of convex reformulations extends to the multicriteria framework. In this note, we show that this approach only finds the supported nondominated points, which can already be found by using the weighted sum scalarization of the multiobjective quadratic problem, i.e. it is not suitable for multiobjective nonconvex problems.},

We evaluate the solvers according to their ability to find a near-optimal solution, find the best solution among currently available solvers, and improve a given starting point. Computational results show that the ability of all these solvers to obtain good solutions diminishes with increasing problem size, but the solvers evaluated collectively found optimal solutions for 93\% of the problems in our test set. The open-source solvers MISO and NOMAD were the best performers among all solvers tested. MISO outperformed all other solvers on large and binary problems, while NOMAD was the best performer on mixed-integer, non-binary discrete, small, and medium-sized problems.},

It has a special importance in data science, since it serves as a mathematical model for the fusion of different data sources in data clustering. We develop four methods to solve the SNMTF. They are based on four theoretical approaches known from the literature: the fixed point method (FPM), the block-coordinate descent with projected gradient (BCD), the gradient method with exact line search (GM-ELS) and the adaptive moment estimation method (ADAM). For each of these methods we offer a software implementation: for the former two methods we use Matlab and for the latter Python with the TensorFlow library. We test these methods on three data-sets: the synthetic data-set we generated, while the others represent real-life similarities between different objects. Extensive numerical results show that with sufficient computing time all four methods perform satisfactorily and ADAM most often yields the best mean square error (MSE). However, if the computation time is limited, FPM gives the best MSE because it shows the fastest convergence at the beginning. All data-sets and codes are publicly available on our GitLab profile.},

  abstract     = {Non-convex discrete-time optimal control problems in, e.g., water or power systems, typically involve a large number of variables related through nonlinear equality constraints. The ideal goal is to find a globally optimal solution, and numerical experience indicates that algorithms aiming for Karush–Kuhn–Tucker points often find solutions that are indistinguishable from global optima. In our paper, we provide a theoretical underpinning for this phenomenon, showing that on a broad class of problems the objective can be shown to be an invariant convex function (invex function) of the control decision variables when state variables are eliminated using implicit function theory. In this way, optimality guarantees can be obtained, the exact nature of which depends on the position of the solution within the feasible set. In a numerical example, we show how high-quality solutions are obtained with local search for a river control problem where invexity holds.},

With the aggregate sparsity matrix from the data matrices of a QCQP with n variables, the rank and positive semidefiniteness of the matrix are examined. We prove that if the rank of the aggregate sparsity matrix is not less than $$n-1$$ and the matrix remains positive semidefinite after replacing some off-diagonal nonzero elements with zeros, then the standard SDP relaxation provides an exact optimal solution for the QCQP under feasibility assumptions. In particular, we demonstrate that QCQPs with forest-structured aggregate sparsity matrix, such as the tridiagonal or arrow-type matrix, satisfy the exactness condition on the rank. The exactness is attained by considering the feasibility of the dual SDP relaxation, the strong duality of SDPs, and a sequence of QCQPs with perturbed objective functions, under the assumption that the feasible region is compact. We generalize our result for a wider class of QCQPs by applying simultaneous tridiagonalization on the data matrices. Moreover, simultaneous tridiagonalization is applied to a matrix pencil so that QCQPs with two constraints can be solved exactly by the SDP relaxation.},

(SIAM J Optim 26:397–425, 2016), also introduced as $$N^C$$ -stationary points in Pan et al. (J Oper Res Soc China 3:421–439, 2015). We introduce nondegenerate M-stationary points and define their M-index. We show that all M-stationary points are generically nondegenerate. In particular, the sparsity constraint is active at all local minimizers of a generic SCNO. Some relations to other stationarity concepts, such as S-stationarity, basic feasibility, and CW-minimality, are discussed in detail. By doing so, the issues of instability and degeneracy of points due to different stationarity concepts are highlighted. The concept of M-stationarity allows to adequately describe the global structure of SCNO along the lines of Morse theory. For that, we study topological changes of lower level sets while passing an M-stationary point. As novelty for SCNO, multiple cells of dimension equal to the M-index are needed to be attached. This intriguing fact is in strong contrast with other optimization problems considered before, where just one cell suffices. As a consequence, we derive a Morse relation for SCNO, which relates the numbers of local minimizers and M-stationary points of M-index equal to one. The appearance of such saddle points cannot be thus neglected from the perspective of global optimization. Due to the multiplicity phenomenon in cell-attachment, a saddle point may lead to more than two different local minimizers. We conclude that the relatively involved structure of saddle points is the source of well-known difficulty if solving SCNO to global optimality.},

The fitting of the model is formulated as a constrained non-linear, non-convex least-squares minimization problem. The model parameters are directly related to the underlying physiology of arteries, and correctly identified they can be of great clinical value. The non-convexity of the minimization problem implies that incorrect parameter values, corresponding to local minima or stationary points may be found, however. Therefore, we investigate the feasibility of using a branch-and-bound algorithm to identify the parameters to global optimality. The algorithm is tested on three clinical data sets, in each case using four increasingly larger regions around a candidate global solution in the parameter space. In all cases, the candidate global solution is found already in the initialization phase when solving the original non-convex minimization problem from multiple starting points, and the remaining time is spent on increasing the lower bound on the optimal value. Although the branch-and-bound algorithm is parallelized, the overall procedure is in general very time-consuming.},

In this paper, we consider three maximization problems to balance these two factors. The objective function in each problem is the sum of a monotone submodular function f and a supermodular function g, where f and g capture the relevance and diversity of any feasible solution, respectively. In the first problem, we consider a special supermodular diversity function g of a sum-sum format satisfying the relaxed triangle inequality, for which we propose a greedy-type approximation algorithm with an $$\left( 1-1/e,1/(2\alpha )\right) $$ -bifactor approximation ratio, improving the previous $$\left( 1/(2\alpha ),1/(2\alpha )\right) $$ -bifactor approximation ratio. In the second problem, we consider an arbitrary supermodular diversity function g, for which we propose a distorted greedy method to give a $$\min \left{ 1-k_{f}e^{-1},1-k^{g}e^{-(1-k^{g})}\right} $$ -approximation algorithm, improving the previous $$k_f^{-1}\left( 1-e^{-k_f(1-k^{g})}\right) $$ -approximation ratio, where $$k_f$$ and $$k^g$$ are the curvatures of the submodular function f and the supermodular funciton g, respectively.

Upper and lower exhausters of positively homogeneous functions are employed to describe optimality conditions in geometric terms and also to find directions of steepest descent or ascent. Since an upper/lower exhauster may contain finitely or infinitely many compact convex sets, the problem of minimality and reduction of exhausters naturally arise. There are several approaches to reduce exhausters (Abbasov in J Glob Optim 74(4):737–751, 2019; Grzybowski et al. in J Glob Optim 46(4):589–601, 2010; Küçük et al. in J Optim Theory Appl 165:693–707, 2015; Roshchina in J Optim Theory Appl 136:261–273, 2008; J Convex Anal 15(4):859–868, 2008). In this study, in the sense of inclusion-minimality, some reduction techniques for upper exhausters of positively homogeneous functions defined from $$\mathbb {R}^2$$ to $$\mathbb {R}$$ is proposed by means of a representation of support functions. These techniques have concrete geometric meanings and they form a basis for a necessary and sufficient condition for inclusion-minimality of exhausters.

Then, we introduce an augmented Bi-QOP (which can also be regarded as a regularized Bi-QOP) for the purpose to guarantee the concavity of the underlying objective function. Theoretically, both the augmented Bi-QOP and the original problem share the same optimal solutions when the compact sets are specified as unit spheres. By exploiting the multi-block structure of the resulting MOP, we accordingly propose a proximal alternating minimization algorithm to get an approximate optimal value of the problem under consideration. Convergence of the proposed algorithm is established under mild conditions.

We observe that each convex relaxation in this family implicitly induces a convex underestimator of the objective function on the feasible region of the quadratic program. This alternative perspective on convex relaxations enables us to establish several useful properties of the corresponding convex underestimators. In particular, if the recession cone of the feasible region of the quadratic program does not contain any directions of negative curvature, we show that the convex underestimator arising from the copositive relaxation is precisely the convex envelope of the objective function of the quadratic program, strengthening Burer’s well-known result on the exactness of the copositive relaxation in the case of nonconvex quadratic programs. We also present an algorithmic recipe for constructing instances of quadratic programs with a finite optimal value but an unbounded relaxation for a rather large family of convex relaxations including the doubly nonnegative relaxation.},
