This poses big challenges for quality monitoring due to the vast amount of data and the interactive effects of many factors on the final product quality. This research introduces a smart real-time quality monitoring and inspection framework capable of predicting and determining the quality deviations for complex and multistage manufacturing systems as early as possible; introduces a hybrid quality inspection approach based on both predictive models and physical inspection in order to enhance the quality monitoring process, save resources, reduce inspection time and costs. Several supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques such as support vector machine, random forest, artificial neural network, principal component analysis were used to build the quality monitoring model with considering the cumulative effects of different manufacturing stages and the unbalance and dynamic nature of the manufacturing processes. A complex semiconductor manufacturing dataset was used to verify and assess the performance of the proposed framework. The results prove the ability of the suggested framework to enhance the quality monitoring process in multistage manufacturing systems and the ability of the hybrid quality inspection approach to reduce the inspection volume and cost.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous multi-robot optical inspection systems are increasingly applied for obtaining inline measurements in process monitoring and quality control. Numerous methods for path planning and robotic coordination have been developed for static and dynamic environments and applied to different fields. However, these approaches may not work for the autonomous multi-robot optical inspection system due to fast computation requirements of inline optimization, unique characteristics on robotic end-effector orientations, and complex large-scale free-form product surfaces. This paper proposes a novel task allocation methodology for coordinated motion planning of multi-robot inspection. Specifically, (1) a local robust inspection task allocation is proposed to achieve efficient and well-balanced measurement assignment among robots; (2) collision-free path planning and coordinated motion planning are developed via dynamic searching in robotic coordinate space and perturbation of probe poses or local paths in the conflicting robots. A case study shows that the proposed approach can mitigate the risk of collisions between robots and environments, resolve conflicts among robots, and reduce the inspection cycle time significantly and consistently.},

  abstract     = {Tool breakage in manufacturing procedures can damage machined surfaces and machine tools. It is crucial to detect tool breakage in time and promptly respond to it. Due to the safety restrictions imposed in production, failure samples are significantly scarcer than normal samples, and this disequilibrium results in difficulty of failure detection. Therefore, we propose a new imbalanced data learning method for tool breakage detection. The key strategy is to balance the data distribution by producing valuable artificial samples for the minority class using an adversarial generative oversampling model based on a generative adversarial network (GAN). Unlike previous studies using GAN, we use the discriminator to screen samples generated by the generator and achieve effective oversampling. Multiple classifiers are adopted as the decision-making models to perform tool breakage detection. The proposed method is applied to a set of imbalanced experimental tool breakage data collected in a workshop. Compared with the best results of other oversampling solutions, the proposed method improves the breakage detection rate from 93.6% to 100%, which shows its practicability and validity. Additionally, evaluations are performed based on 12 imbalanced benchmark datasets. The results further substantiate the superiority of the proposed method to existing sampling methods.},

  abstract     = {Self-configuration is the preparation required to facilitate smart-manufacturing (SM) with the inputs derived without user intervention for engineering applications. Thus, it is vital for achieving the highest maturity level of SM technologies. In context, digital twin (DT) is an advanced virtual factory with simulation as its core technical functionality. However, the requirement of several inputs limits the implementation of DT on a physical asset without user intervention. Moreover, surpassing this limitation requires extraction methods for deriving the necessary inputs for DT application. Therefore, this study proposes information fusion and systematic logic library (SLL)-generation methods to facilitate the self-configuration of an autonomous DT. The information fusion aggregates and extracts the information elements required for DT application from heterogeneous information sources. In addition, the SLL generation method created the SLL required for reflecting the functional units of agents within the physical asset. Both methods were proposed from available SM standards such as ISA-95, automation markup language, and OPC unified architecture. Furthermore, an autonomous DT-supporting framework was designed by analyzing the relationship between asset description and SM standards, which facilitated the artificial intelligence-based extraction of the asset description object and SLL. Additionally, the core functional engines within this framework were designed using machine learning and process-mining techniques. Consequently, the proposed methods reduced the input pre-processing time required for constructing and synchronizing an autonomous DT to aid the application of autonomous DT on the physical asset without user intervention.},

  abstract     = {The number of published manufacturing science digital articles available from scientific journals and the broader web have exponentially increased every year since the 1990s. To assimilate all of this knowledge by a novice engineer or an experienced researcher, requires significant synthesis of the existing knowledge space contained within published material, to find answers to basic and complex queries. Algorithmic approaches through machine learning and specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP) on a domain specific area such as manufacturing, is lacking. One of the significant challenges to analyzing manufacturing vocabulary is the lack of a named entity recognition model that enables algorithms to classify the manufacturing corpus of words under various manufacturing semantic categories. This work presents a supervised machine learning approach to categorize unstructured text from 500K+ manufacturing science related scientific abstracts and labelling them under various manufacturing topic categories. A neural network model using a bidirectional long-short term memory, plus a conditional random field (BiLSTM + CRF) is trained to extract information from manufacturing science abstracts. Our classifier achieves an overall accuracy (f1-score) of 88%, which is quite near to the state-of-the-art performance. Two use case examples are presented that demonstrate the value of the developed NER model as a Technical Language Processing (TLP) workflow on manufacturing science documents. The long term goal is to extract valuable knowledge regarding the connections and relationships between key manufacturing concepts/entities available within millions of manufacturing documents into a structured labeled-property graph data structure that allow for programmatic query and retrieval.},

Reconfigurability is used to measure quantitatively the capability of supply chain to change easily their structure and functions. The aim of this work is to evaluate the level of reconfigurability of a supply chain. Quantitative measures of six indicators that characterize reconfigurability are presented in this paper. Then, an index of reconfigurability in supply chain is developed based on The Multi-Attribute Utility Theory in order to choose the most reconfigurable configuration. An illustrative example is also given. From the discussion, it is deduced that the characteristics of the reconfigurable supply chain impacts positively on the degree of reconfigurability.},

Unlike before, the multi-light source inspection environment allows us to extract more different defects in a piece of work, depending on what we are working on with varying sources of light. We proposed the formulation of the multi-lights source lighting strategy to improve the inspection capability of Automated Optical Inspection (AOI). The process of developing this study not only utilizes the ubiquitous image processing to extract defects but also imports the design of generalized defect sample and reinforcement learning, dealing with diverse defects under in-depth inspection by cascading both light and camera parameters. As a result, the AOI system emphasized that the inspection parameters can be intelligently adjusted to appropriate values based on various defects, maximizing the detection of diverse defects. From the perspective of intelligent AOI results, there are two outstanding outcomes for a multi-light source lighting strategy. One is an efficient learning process, which facilitates us to obtain the strategy needed in 40 to 50 min, depending on the reward function designed. The other is an advanced inspection function that can extract 37% more defects than conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {In rapid hot-embossing of microarray products, sensors accuracy drifts, mechanical wears and environmental changes produce the nonlinear relationship between micro-forming accuracy and process parameters. Generally, the process parameters need to be adjusted according to ex-situ detection and on-spot experiences, leading to inefficiency. Therefore, an in-process optic detection of micro-forming heights is proposed to closed-loop control the micro-forming accuracy on macro hot-embossed surface. On the base of ex-situ detection data, the in-process detected data are related to micro-forming heights to adjust hot-embossing parameters by intelligent algorithms. The objective is to resolve the uncertainty during precision micro-forming. First, an optic detection was developed to recognize the micro-forming heights on macroscopic workpiece surface in real-time; then artificial neural networks and Naïve Bayes method were adopted to select the initial process parameters; next, the correction algorithm was modeled to perform fine adjustment instead of on-spot experiences, based on the recognized forming heights; finally, this system was applied to the hot-embossing of microprism arrays on light-guide plates. It is shown that the illuminance ratio is related to the hot-embossed microstructure heights. This may be used to in-process detect the micro-forming heights on macro workpiece surface. For the neural networks trained with process parameters, the RBF eliminates nonlinearity-caused local minimization better than the BP. For ambiguous process data, the Naïve Bayes method updates incomplete process parameter database more precisely and timely than neural networks. As a result, the micro-forming height may be controlled within the allowable error band under unstable hot-embossing situations.},

First, an adaptive machining quality evaluative function is designed to preprocess the raw precision detection data. Then, the key precision indices are extracted using a correlation and significance estimation (CSES) based on the modified density peak clustering (DPC) algorithm. A grading function is also designed, which can describe the precision grading of machined gear workpieces. Then, the significance estimation and attribution reduction of gear manufacturing parameters are performed using rough set theory. Finally, an adaptive variational inference Gaussian mixture regression (AVIGMR) model for gear machining error prediction is developed. The experimental results show that the proposed method has decent predictive capability with most gear precision detection indices and achieves superior comprehensive performance compared to eleven other regression algorithms.},

The main contributions include: (1) a generic hypergraph model to represent the interrelationships of complex equipment; and (2) a temporal-based prediction approach to learn the complex data correlation and high-order representation based on the hypergraph. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a case study is conducted by comparing with other cutting-edge models, of which it outperforms in several metrics.

This paper presents the results of an empirical study on failure prediction in the production line based on FL. This paper (1) designs Federated Support Vector Machine and federated random forest algorithms for the horizontal FL and vertical FL scenarios, respectively; (2) proposes an experiment process for evaluating the effectiveness between the FL and CL algorithms; (3) finds that the performance of FL and CL are not significantly different on the global testing data, on the random partial testing data, and on the estimated unknown Bosch data, respectively. The fact that the testing data is heterogeneous enhances our findings. Our study reveals that FL can replace CL for failure prediction.},

  abstract     = {Detection of fiber composite material boundaries and defects is critical to the automation of the manufacturing process in the aviation industry. This paper describes a process to evaluate four well-performing deep convolutional neural network models (Mask R-CNN, U-Net, DeepLab V3+, and IC-Net) for use in such a process. A custom-captured dataset of images showing fiber cut-pieces with geometrical defects was annotated and augmented for training deep convolutional neural network models; results show acceptable detection accuracy for gripper and fabric based on the Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of up to 0.92 and 0.86, respectively. However, wrinkle detection initially achieves a significantly lower IoU score of 0.40 in the best case. This discrepancy is mainly due to geometrical ambiguities, as wrinkles do not have a clearly defined boundary and are hard to distinguish even for human eye. The model is then evaluated as a binary predictor based on per-component detection success; the model achieves a recall rate (i.e., the ratio of the wrinkles detected to all existing wrinkles) of 0.71 and a precision score (i.e., the ratio of those detected being actually wrinkles) of 0.76. From a practical point of view, this model can outperform a human operator based on the results presented. Two complementary approaches are also introduced for the detection of wrinkles at the early stages of formation as well as the completely formed wrinkles. The developed method can be readily used in a variety of composite manufacturing processes or adapted to other similar tasks.},

  abstract     = {Studies have shown that melt-pool characteristics such as melt-pool size and shape are highly correlated with the formation of porosity and defects in parts built with the laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) additive manufacturing (AM) processes. Hence, optimizing process parameters to maintain a constant melt-pool size during the build process could potentially improve the build quality of the final part. This paper considers the optimal control of laser power, while keeping other process parameters fixed, to achieve a constant melt-pool size during the laser scanning of a multi-track build under L-PBF. First, Gaussian process regression (GPR) is applied to model the dynamic evolution of the melt-pool size as a function of laser power and thermal history, which are defined as the input features of the GPR model. Then a constrained finite-horizon optimal control problem is formulated, with a quadratic cost function defined to minimize the difference between the controlled melt-pool size and its reference value. A projected gradient descent algorithm is applied to compute the optimal sequence of laser power in the proposed control problem. The GPR modeling is demonstrated using simulated data sets, a mix of simulated and experimental data sets, or pure experimental data sets. Numerical verification of the control design of laser power is performed on a commercial AM software, Autodesk’s Netfabb Simulation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GPR modeling and model-based optimal control in regulating the melt-pool size during the scanning of multi-tracks using L-PBF.},

Specifically, the CAD/CAM approach was employed to generate the ideal tool paths based on the CAD model, and the coarse registration ensured the global optimal solution of the subsequent fine registration. Considering the complex structure and the uneven shrinkage deformation of ceramic cores, the hybrid and local fine registration method was proposed to optimize the ideal tool paths in order to generate deburring tool paths. Moreover, the fine registration also eliminated the influence of inconsistent clamping errors of ceramic cores on the final accuracy of deburring tool paths. In order to select the optimal local fine registration methods, focusing on the accuracy of deburring tool paths, four rigid and non-rigid point cloud registration methods based on the iterative closest point algorithm were compared. Furthermore, a method for evaluating the accuracy of deburring tool paths was proposed. Finally, a repeatability experiment was performed to verify the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method. The generated deburring tool paths were verified and its effectiveness was proven on a five-axis laser processing equipment.},

Consequently, advanced domain adaptation algorithms have been introduced to the field of fault diagnosis to address this problem. However, in performing domain adaptation, most existing diagnosis methods only focus on the minimization of marginal distribution divergences and do not consider conditional distribution differences at the same time. In this paper, we present a mixed adversarial adaptation network (MAAN) based intelligent framework for cross-domain fault diagnosis of machinery. In this approach, differences in marginal distribution and conditional distribution are reduced together by the adversarial learning strategy, moreover, a simple adaptive factor is also endowed to dynamically weigh the relative importance of two distributions. Extensive experiments on two kinds of mechanical equipment, i.e. planetary gearbox and rolling bearing, are built to validate the proposed method. Empirical evidence demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms popular deep learning and deep domain adaptation diagnosis methods.},

  abstract     = {In the last decade, wire + arc additive manufacturing (WAAM), which is one of the most promising metal additive manufacturing technologies, has been attracting high interest from both academia and industry. WAAM systems are increasingly employed in the industry and academia, but there are still several challenges and barriers to process stability control. The process stability is highly dependent on how the molten feed wire is added into the melt pool, which is known as the droplet transfer mode. To ensure a stable WAAM deposition process, it is essential to maintain the transfer mode in a suitable stable status. Without an effective transfer mode control method, the operators need to determine and control the transfer mode based on their experience using manual adjustment, which is difficult to achieve in a long period of production process. In this paper, a deep learning-based technology was proposed for the control of the droplet transfer mode based on the data collected from the WAAM process. A long short term memory neural network was applied as the core transfer mode classification model. A time-series data, arc voltage, was collected and statistical and frequency features were extracted, which included 11 relevant features, as the inputs of the classification model. Then, the distance between the melted wire and the melt pool was adjusted based on the determined transfer mode to keep a suitable stability of the process. A case study was used to evaluate the proposed approach and to show its merit. The proposed approach was compared to three commonly used machine learning algorithms, k-nearest neighbours, support vector machine, and decision tree. The proposed method obtained the highest accuracy in determining the transfer mode, which was over 91%. The performance of the proposed approach was also evaluated by the single-pass and oscillated wall building. The proposed deep learning based approach improved the process stability in real-time, which resulted in better deposition qualities, in terms of geometry size and processing cleanliness compared to without control. Furthermore, this data-driven method could be applied to other WAAM processes and materials.},

This work presents a novel method to transform digital definitions in any given STEP file into a tensor-like structure that is unique for each part and can be used to regenerate the original STEP file completely. Resulting STEP tensors are amenable to part comparison based on various part specifications in a general and straightforward manner. Here, part similarity is evaluated among sets of parts according to specific geometry, material composition, and design intent. Importantly, specification similarity can be quantified using only the tensors’ structure. As such, this approach is not limited to families of geometric shapes, part types, or fabrication methods; nor does it require any prior knowledge about the parts being compared.},

While it is known that changes in force data are related to physical parameters of the process material, lubricant used, and geometry, the changes in data over large stroke series and their relationship to wear are the subject of this paper. Previously, force data from different wear conditions (artificially introduced into the system and not occurring in an industry-like environment) were used as input for clustering and classifying high and low wear force data. This paper contributes to fill the current research gap by isolating structural properties of data as indicators of wear growth to quantify the wear evolution during ongoing production in industry-like scenarios. The selected methods represent either established methods in sheet metal forming force data analysis, dimensionality reduction for local structure separation or generic feature extraction.

A main application of ML is the construction of quality prediction models, which can be used, among other things, for documentation purposes, as assistance systems for process operators, or for adaptive process control. The quality of such ML models typically strongly depends on the amount and the quality of data used for training. In manufacturing, the size of available datasets before start of production (SOP) is often limited. In contrast to data, expert knowledge commonly is available in manufacturing. Therefore, this study introduces a general methodology for building quality prediction models with ML methods on small datasets by integrating shape expert knowledge, that is, prior knowledge about the shape of the input–output relationship to be learned. The proposed methodology is applied to a brushing process with 125 data points for predicting the surface roughness as a function of five process variables. As opposed to conventional ML methods for small datasets, the proposed methodology produces prediction models that strictly comply with all the expert knowledge specified by the involved process specialists. In particular, the direct involvement of process experts in the training of the models leads to a very clear interpretation and, by extension, to a high acceptance of the models. While working out the shape knowledge requires some iterations in general, another clear merit of the proposed methodology is that, in contrast to most conventional ML, it involves no time-consuming and often heuristic hyperparameter tuning or model selection step.},

These droplet characteristics, in turn, determine the functional quality of the printed parts. Hence, to ensure repeatable and reliable part quality it is necessary to monitor and control the droplet characteristics. Existing approaches for in-situ monitoring of droplet behavior in DoD-LMJ rely on high-speed imaging sensors. The resulting high volume of droplet images acquired is computationally demanding to analyze and hinders real-time control of the process. To overcome this challenge, the objective of this work is to use time series data acquired from an in-process millimeter-wave sensor for predicting the size, velocity, and shape characteristics of droplets in DoD-LMJ process. As opposed to high-speed imaging, this sensor produces data-efficient time series signatures that allows rapid, real-time process monitoring. We devise machine learning models that use the millimeter-wave sensor data to predict the droplet characteristics. Specifically, we developed multilayer perceptron-based non-linear autoregressive models to predict the size and velocity of droplets. Likewise, a supervised machine learning model was trained to classify the droplet shape using the frequency spectrum information contained in the millimeter-wave sensor signatures. High-speed imaging data served as ground truth for model training and validation. These models captured the droplet characteristics with a statistical fidelity exceeding 90%, and vastly outperformed conventional statistical modeling approaches. Thus, this work achieves a practically viable sensing approach for real-time quality monitoring of the DoD-LMJ process, in lieu of the existing data-intensive image-based techniques.},

  abstract     = {Inspection of dry carbon textiles is a key step to ensure quality in aerospace manufacturing. Due to the rarity and variety of defects, collecting a comprehensive defect dataset is difficult, while collecting ‘normal’ data is comparatively easy. In this paper, we present an unsupervised defect detection method for carbon fiber textiles that meets four key criteria for industrial applicability: using only ‘normal’ data, achieving high accuracy even on small and subtle defects, allowing visual interpretation, and achieving real-time performance. We combine a Visual Transformer Encoder and a Normalizing Flow to gather global context from input images and directly produce an image likelihood which is then used as an anomaly score. We demonstrate that when trained on only 150 normal samples, our method correctly detects 100% of anomalies with a 0% false positive rate on a industrial carbon fabric dataset with 34 real defect samples, including subtle stray fiber defects covering only 1% image area where previous methods are shown to fail. We validate the performance on the large public defect dataset MVTec-AD Textures, where we outperform previous work by 4–10%, proving the applicability of our method to other domains. Additionally, we propose a method to extract interpretable anomaly maps from Visual Transformer Attention Rollout and Image Likelihood Gradients that produces convincing explanations for detected anomalies. Finally, we show that the inference time for the model is acceptable at 32 ms, achieving real-time performance.},

Such large instances become increasingly challenging to provide high-quality solutions within limited amount of computational time, but so far, have not been adequately addressed in recent literature. A hybrid genetic algorithm is developed, which is lean in the sense that is equipped with a minimal number of parameters and operators, and which is enhanced with an effective local search operator, specifically targeted to solve large instances. For evaluation purposes a new set of larger problems is generated, consisting of up to 800 jobs and 60 machines. An extensive comparative study shows that the proposed method performs significantly better compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms, especially for the new larger instances. Also, it is demonstrated that calibration is crucial and in practice it should be targeted at a narrower set of representative instances.},

Typically, experimental data are used to fit empirical models (for example, regression models) to derive one set of optimal conditions that maximize (or minimize) the response. Unfortunately, the optimization rarely provides a Confidence Interval for the location of the optimal solution, even though the optimal solution itself is subjected to variability. From a practitioner&#39;s point of view, identifying a region of possible optimal values provides high operational flexibility to adjust process parameters online during production. This paper provides a procedure for computing a confidence region for the optimal point based on experimental data, bootstrapping, and data depth. The procedure is validated using a case study from micro-injection molding, where the part weight is maximized under a constraint of the probability of flash formation. The proposed method considers that the objective function (part weight) and the constraint (probability of flash formation) are estimated from experimental data and subjected to sampling variability.},

Learning causal structures from real-world settings remains challenging due to high-dimensional data, a mix of discrete and continuous variables, and requirements for preprocessing log data under the causal perspective. In our work, we address these challenges proposing a process for causal reasoning based on raw machine log data from production monitoring. Within this process, we define a set of transformation rules to extract independent and identically distributed observations. Further, we incorporate a variable selection step to handle high-dimensionality and a discretization step to include continuous variables. We enrich a commonly used causal structure learning algorithm with domain-related orientation rules, which provides a basis for causal reasoning. We demonstrate the process on a real-world dataset from a globally operating precision mechanical engineering company. The dataset contains over 40 million log data entries from production monitoring of a single machine. In this context, we determine the causal structures embedded in operational processes. Further, we examine causal effects to support machine operators in avoiding unforeseen production stops, i.e., by detaining machine operators from drawing false conclusions on impacting factors of unforeseen production stops based on experience.},

New techniques such as image segmentation with neural networks provide a new approach to this problem and have the potential to solve complex processes faster and more robustly. In this study, a system is presented that performs monitoring, inspection and measurement tasks simultaneously in automated fiber placement processes. The system is based on the SiamMask network which is used for the automatic image processing. The artificial neural network is trained to recognize individual carbon fiber tapes and segment them for additional analysis. For the creation of the testing- and training data, an analytical approach is presented. The post-processing of the object segmentation, which is the primary output of the SiamMask network and the identification of individual tapes, provides accurate measurements which are demonstrated by an example. We show that image segmentation with modern approaches like SiamMask offers great potential to handle highly complex engineering tasks in a faster and more intelligent manner in comparison to conventional methods.},

Our research is aimed at investigating possibility of application of Fuzzy Reasoning methods for shortening of a design process, being a part of this process. We present a study on application of simplified models for solving technological tasks, allowing obtaining expected properties of designed products. The core of our concept is replacing numerical models and classical metamodels with a rule-based reasoning. A quotation preparation process can be supported by solving a technological problem without numerical experiments. Our goal was to validate the thesis basing not only on the presentation of some potential solutions but also on the results of simulation studies. The problem is illustrated with an example of thermal treatment of aluminum alloys, aimed at evaluation of a summary fraction of precipitations as a function of time and technological parameters. We assumed that it is possible to use both unstructured and point numerical experiments for knowledge acquisition. Implementation of this concept required the use of hybrid knowledge acquisition methods that combine the results of point experiments with expert knowledge. A comparison of obtained results to the ones obtained with metamodels shows a similar efficiency of both approaches, while our method is less time and laborious.},

  abstract     = {It is well known that the processing parameters of selective laser melting (SLM) highly influence mechanical and physical properties of the manufactured parts. Also, the energy density is insufficient to detect the process window for producing full dense components. In fact, parts produced with the same energy density but different combinations of parameters may present different properties even under the microstructural viewpoint. In this context, the need to assess the influence of the process parameters and to select the best parameters set able to optimize the final properties of SLM parts has been capturing the attention of both academics and practitioners. In this paper different hybrid prediction-optimization approaches for maximizing the relative density of Ti6Al4V SLM manufactured parts are proposed. An extended design of experiments involving six process parameters has been configured for constructing two surrogate models based on response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN), respectively. The optimization phase has been performed by means of evolutionary computations. To this end, three nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms have been integrated with the prediction modelling structures. A series of experimental tests has been carried out to validate the results from the proposed hybrid optimization procedures. Also, a sensitivity analysis based on the results from the analysis of variance was executed to evaluate the influence of the processing parameter and their reciprocal interactions on the part porosity.},

  abstract     = {Since production efficiency and costs are directly affected by the ways in which jobs are scheduled, scholars have advanced a number of meta-heuristic algorithms to solve the job shop scheduling problem (JSSP). Although this JSSP is widely accepted as a computationally intractable NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, its solution is essential in manufacturing. This study proposes performance-driven meta-heuristic switching approaches that utilize the capabilities of multi-operator differential evolution (MODE) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) in a single algorithmic framework. The performance-driven switching mechanism is introduced to switch the population from an under-performing algorithm to other possibilities. A mixed selection strategy is employed to ensure the diversity and quality of the initial population, whereas a diversity check mechanism maintains population diversity over the generations. Moreover, a Tabu search (TS) inspired local search technique is implemented to enhance the proposed algorithm’s exploitation capability, avoiding being trapped in the local optima. Finally, this study presents two mixed population structure-based hybrid evolutionary algorithms (HEAs), such as a predictive sequence HEA (sHEA) and a random sequence HEA (rHEA), and one bi-population inspired HEA, called bHEA. The comparative impacts of these varied population structure-based approaches are assessed by solving 5 categories of the standard JSSP instances (i.e., FT, LA, ORB, ABZ and TA). The performance of these hybridized approaches (i.e., sHEA, rHEA and bHEA) is compared and contrasted with its constituent algorithms (MODE, PSO and TS) to validate the hybridization’s effectiveness. The statistical analysis shows that sHEA ranked first with mean value 1.84 compared to rHEA (1.96) and bHEA (2.21). Moreover, the proposed sHEA is compared with 26 existing algorithms and ranked first with a mean value 5.09 compared to the near-best algorithms. Thus, the simulation results and statistical analysis prove the supremacy of the sHEA.},

However, a direct measure of the backlash is hard to obtain, and dedicated auxiliary sensors are required for the measurement. This paper presents a method for estimating backlash in robotic joints that does not require the installation of extra devices. It only relies on data gathered from the motor encoder, which is always present in a robotic joint. The approach is based on the observation of a characteristic vibration pattern arising on the motor speed signal when backlash affects the joint transmission. By looking at the amplitude of this vibration some information about the entity of the backlash in the joint is gathered. Experimental results on simulated data are reported in the study to show the robustness of the method, also with respect of noise. Furthermore, tests on real-world data, gathered from robots installed in a production plant, demonstrate the efficacy of the technique. The approach is cost-effective, fast, and easily automatable, therefore convenient for the industrial world.},

  abstract     = {Process force determines productivity, quality, and safety in milling. Current approaches of process design often focus on a priori optimization. In order to enable online optimization, the establishment of active force controllers is required. Due to fast-changing engagement conditions of the tool in conjunction with the slower machine dynamics, classic control is not suited. A promising approach is the application of model predictive control (MPC) for force control, which is proposed in this contribution. The model predictive force controller (MPFC) explicitly takes into account a model to predict the immediate future. It consists of a model of the machine tool and a separate model of the process. The process model describes the relation between feed velocity of the tool, force, and geometric properties of the tool, such as the radial deviation, and of the tool/workpiece engagement. The feedback loop of the controller is closed by an online identification of the process model to account changes in the material properties or of the tool wear state. For this identification an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is applied. The MPFC solves an optimization problem on the future behavior in each sampling step to determine the optimal controller output enabling high dynamic control. The proposed control system is validated experimentally and compared with a conventionally designed process with constant feed. It can be shown that the manufacturing time is reduced by 50%. The system enables a paradigm shift in the design of milling processes operating the manufacturing process at its technological limit.},

However, there is currently a lack of an overall view of where predictive quality research stands as a whole, what approaches are currently being investigated, and what challenges currently exist. This paper addresses these issues by conducting a comprehensive and systematic review of scientific publications between 2012 and 2021 dealing with predictive quality in manufacturing. The publications are categorized according to the manufacturing processes they address as well as the data bases and machine learning models they use. In this process, key insights into the scope of this field are collected along with gaps and similarities in the solution approaches.

  abstract     = {Optimizing maintenance practices is a continuous process that must take into account the evolving state of the equipment, resources, workers, and more. To help streamline this process, facilities need a concise procedure for identifying critical tasks and assets that have major impact on the performance of maintenance activities. This work provides a process for making data investigations more effective by discovering influential equipment, actions, and other environmental factors from tacit knowledge within maintenance documents and reports. Traditional application of text analysis focuses on prediction and modeling of system state directly. Variation in domain data, quality, and managerial expectations prevent the creation of a generic method to do this with real industrial data. Instead, text analysis techniques can be applied to discover key factors within a system, which function as indicators for further, in-depth analysis. These factors can point investigators where to find good or bad behaviors, but do not explicitly perform any anomaly detection. This paper details an adaptable procedure tailored to maintenance and industrial settings for determining important named entities within natural language documents. The procedure in this paper utilizes natural language processing techniques to extract these terms or concepts from maintenance work orders and measure their influence on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) as defined by managers and decision makers. We present a case study to demonstrate the developed workflow (algorithmic procedure) to identify terms associated with concepts or systems which have strong relationships with a selected KPI, such as time or cost. This proof of concept uses the length of time a Maintenance Work Order (MWO) remains open from creation to completion as the relevant performance indicator. By identifying tasks, assets, and environments that have significant relevance to KPIs, planners and decision makers can more easily direct investigations to identify problem areas within a facility, better allocate resources, and guide more effective analysis for both monitoring and improving a facility. The output of the analysis workflow presented in this paper is not intended as a direct indicator of good or bad practices and assets, but instead is intended to be used to help direct and improve the effectiveness of investigations determining those. This workflow provides a preparatory investigation that both conditions the data, helps guide investigators into more productive and effective investigations of the latent information contained in human generated work logs, specifically the natural language recorded in MWOs. When this information preparing and gathering procedure is used in conjunction with other tacit knowledge or analysis tools it gives a more full picture of the efficiency and effectiveness of maintenance strategies. When properly applied, this methodology can identify pain points, highlight anomalous patterns, or verify expected outcomes of a facility’s maintenance strategy.},

  abstract     = {Titanium-based alloy products manufactured by Selective Laser Melting (SLM) have been widely used in biomedical applications, owing to their high biocompatibility, significantly good mechanical properties. In order to improve the Ti–6Al–4V SLM-fabricated part quality and help the manufacturing engineers choose optimal process parameters, an optimization methodology based on an artificial neural network was developed to relate four key process parameters (laser power, laser scanning speed, layer thickness, and hatch distance) and two target properties of a part fabricated by the SLM technique (density ratio and surface roughness). A supervised learning deep neural network based on the backpropagation algorithm was applied to optimize input parameters for a given set of quality part outputs. Several methods were utilized to solve undesired problems occurring during neural network training to increase the model accuracy. The model’s performance was proven with a value of R2 of 99% for both density ratio and surface roughness. A selection system was then built, allowing users to choose the optimal process parameters for fabricated products whose properties meet a specific user requirement. Experiments performed with the optimal process parameters recommended by the optimization system strongly confirmed its reliability by providing the ultimate part qualities nearly identical to those defined by the user with only about 0.9–4.4% of errors at the maximum. Finally, a graphical user interface was developed to facilitate the choice of the optimum process parameters for the desired density ratio and surface roughness.},

  abstract     = {The surface quality inspection of industrial printed circuit board (PCB) is a vitally important link in its manufacturing process. To inspect surface defects of PCBs effectively, the automatic optical inspection (AOI) technology, in which the PCB image acquisition depends on the path planning method, is widely adopted by industry. It is regarded as a characteristic travelling salesman problem (TSP), which includes component clustering, location adjustment and algorithm adaptation optimization. In this paper, by improving the ant colony algorithm (ACA) algorithm, we devise a PCB image acquisition path planning model and the corresponding solving algorithms. Because the ACA encounters difficulty escaping from the local optimal solution, an improved ACA with a negative feedback mechanism is proposed that is able to obtain a better tour path with a higher probability. Aiming at the uncertainty of the local location of image acquisition windows, location adjustment methods are introduced to further shorten the path length and improve the image acquisition efficiency. Finally, via simulation experiments, the proposed global negative feedback ACA (GNF-ACA) can shorten the average length of the tour path by 1.7% without changing the time complexity. The three methods of location adjustment can further shorten the length of the tour path by 5.6%, 13.1% and 13.7%.},

  abstract     = {This research proposes a method for machining quality monitoring (MQM) in laser-assisted micro-milling (LAMM) of glass. In tool-based mechanical processing including LAMM, the machining quality is generally affected by machining parameters and tool condition; therefore, previous studies have intensively focused on finding optimal machining parameters and monitoring tool condition to secure machining quality. However, prior work has not considered the degradation of machining quality over time. Furthermore, previous studies have manually designed features from sensory signals; these approaches are difficult to be applied without prior domain knowledge in LAMM of glass. In LAMM, MQM is more important than it is in metal cutting because glass materials are likely to have cracks from the mechanical contact between the workpiece and the tool. In this research, we employ a novel image-based deep transfer learning method for MQM in LAMM of glass. Our approach is based on a pre-trained model trained on a large-scale image dataset; this model is equipped to extract meaningful features from the images. To visually reflect the machining quality, we propose a multi-layer recurrence plot (MRP) that enables the cutting force signals to be transformed into two-dimensional images. From the experimental validation in this research, the proposed MQM method is found to have the best classification accuracy of machining quality, as compared to other existing methods. The proposed method is expected to predict the machining quality of the micro-milling of glass in advance with improved accuracy before the machining quality is degraded.},

  abstract     = {Recently, Industry 4.0 facilitates implementing several modular smart factories particularly the Cyber-Physical System. Due to enhanced growth in the Cyber-Physical System, privacy and security issues turned out to be the most significant factor all over the world. This paper demonstrates a complete co-design approach meant for integrating the cyberspace and physical space of a cyber-physical system. Various strategies and models regarding cyber and physical space are established in CPS. Apart from numerous co-design strategies, there are several parameters yet to be resolved and established. It becomes complicated and tricky to examine and explore the extremely best value since these parameters make up a very huge space. Therefore, a metaheuristic algorithm such as improved Fuzzy Harmonic Search Algorithm is proposed to optimize the control parameters so as to obtain a feasible solution. Also, this approach minimizes the cost function using Maximum Allowable Delay Bound (MADB) when subjected to several constraints such as the Sampling period, Horizon length, Routing graph, and scheduling table. Moreover the comparative analyses of various approaches such as Fuzzy Harmony Search (FHS) algorithm, Harmony Search (HS) algorithm, Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm as well as Fuzzy Genetic Algorithm (Fuzzy GA) are evaluated to examine the performances of the proposed approach. A testbed is organized for evaluation and exploration in a manufacturing atmosphere. The result reveals that this proposed approach provides enhanced control performance and communication reliability even under very harsh environmental habitat.},

Our algorithm is compared against superpixel-based and saliency-based already reported works. To validate the performance, infrared-image streams (LMD process) and standard datasets are using. The proposed algorithm has a molten pool segmentation uncertainty of $$0.1\; mm$$ . Reported results show that the performance of our proposal is applicable for tasks that require good precision when segmenting and fast runtime.

However, as the transition to eco-friendly material handling by electric material handling vehicles (EMV) is progressing, the use of electric forklifts (EFs) remains a challenge, as these EMVs are recognized only as energy consumers. In this paper, we develop an integrated dynamic algorithm for solving the EF routing problem with battery charging constraints in which EFs’ picking or put-away routes, EFs’ battery charging schedules, and the number of EFs operated are simultaneously determined while considering electricity consumption in a warehouse. Time series of electricity-usage penalty estimated by predicted energy consumption in a warehouse facility and equipment level play key roles in establishing EF battery charging schedules. Dynamic models for the arrival processes in material handling and EF battery charging jobs in multiple EF queues are developed and implemented as core engines in the proposed dynamic control algorithm. Operational performance and energy performance of the proposed dynamic algorithm are examined using real energy and operational parameters of the Toyota 9BRU23/16.5 reach truck and compared to those of the metaheuristic approach, called adaptive large neighborhood search. Experimental results of large-size instances with uniformly distributed job locations show that an average 5.6% better performance is achieved by the proposed dynamic algorithm. An additional experiment with the proposed approach and clustered job locations results in 8.9% lower energy-related costs and 1.2% shorter EF travel distances, demonstrating the competitiveness of the proposed energy-aware EF operations strategy for warehouse administration.},

Subsequently, a hybrid discrete multi-objective imperial competition algorithm (HDMICA) is developed to solve the model. The global search mechanism based on the HDMICA improves two aspects: a new initialization method to improve the quality of the initial population, and the empire selection method based on Pareto non-dominated solution to balance the empire forces. Then, the improved simulated annealing algorithm is embedded in imperial competition algorithm (ICA), which overcomes the premature convergence problem of ICA. Therefore, four neighborhood structures are designed to help the algorithm jump out of the local optimal solution. Finally, an example is used to verify the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.

The rapid advancement of the integrated circuit technology has recently led to more frequent occurrences of mixed-type defect patterns, wherein two or more defect patterns simultaneously occur in a wafer bin map. The detection of these mixed patterns is more difficult than that of single patterns. To detect these mixed patterns, binary relevance approaches based on convolutional neural networks have been proposed. However, as the manufacturing process has been advanced and integrated, various failure types are newly detected, thus the number of single models can be continuously increased following the diversification of defect types. Therefore, we propose an effective framework for detecting mixed-type patterns in which a simple single model, called the single shot detector, is employed. By applying the proposed model to the WM-811K dataset, we show that our framework outperforms existing CNN-based methods and also provides defect location information.},

Firstly, based on copula theory and kernel density estimation method, the nonparametric-copula-entropy is introduced to improve the accuracy of association measurement between parameters, and its superiority is verified by comparing with the results of different association measurement methods. Then, the global association matrix is constructed by the nonparametric-copula-entropy, and network deconvolution method is employed to extract the direct information from the global association matrix. The proposed method is tested by using an open gene expression dataset. Finally, as an experimental application, the causal analysis for a diesel engine production line is carried out by the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can reveal causal relationship between process parameters and quality parameters in the diesel engine production line well, which provide theoretical guidance and implementation approach for the optimal control of complex manufacturing system.},

Technically, a trained bidirectional LSTM neural network, called Manhattan LSTM is integrated into our approach named SAM-IDM to predict the similarity between sentences.

  abstract     = {Prognostic health management minimizes system downtime and improves overall equipment effectiveness. Accurate prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) is key to prognostics. Prominent machine learning algorithms implement handcrafted feature extraction to improve RUL prediction. Deep learning automates feature extraction from raw data but requires large datasets and computationally expensive fine-tuning. Data-specific handcrafting and fine-tuning limit the generalization capability of existing models. Proposed framework addresses these challenges using Temporal Multivariate 3D Convolutional Network (TM3C) and Kernel-based Transformation (KT) of features. KT generates 3D features that incorporate trendable degradation patterns from multivariate temporal relationship among sensor data. TM3C implements 3D convolutional layers with temporal filters for RUL prediction. KT is generalizable and improves feature relevance. Full-width filters in TM3C reduce number of tunable parameters and convolution operations. Proposed TM3C-KT capitalizes on the strength of deep learning while lowering the cost for feature discovery, parameter learning, and model fine-tuning. TM3C-KT is evaluated on three prognostics applications, (1) RUL prediction for turbofan engines, (2) Failure state estimation for hydraulic pumps, and (3) Component wear prediction for milling machines. Performance of the framework is comparable and better than benchmark methods in literature. Characteristics of the framework are reviewed on generalizability, prognosability and versatility metrics. Results and corresponding analysis demonstrate suitability of TM3C-KT for industrial applications of machine health prognostics.},

  abstract     = {The processing quality of the grooves of a nuclear-fuel rod will directly affect the quality of the finished nuclear-fuel rod. Due to the highly reflective, microscopic, and annular characteristics of nuclear-fuel rod grooves, it has been quite challenging to realize imaging and microscopic defect detection for these grooves. In this work, a machine vision-based defect detection system was developed for nuclear-fuel rod grooves. Through the performance improvement and application of the self-reference template defect detection method, efficient online inspection of nuclear-fuel rod grooves was realized. In the developed system, a combined-light-source imaging system was first designed by combining a coaxial light and a ring light, which realized the clear imaging of a groove. After that, an image expansion strategy was employed to expand the annular groove into a strip-shaped region of interest (ROI). Then, according to the turning processing characteristic of the nuclear-fuel rod groove, the large-size defect detection effect of the self-reference template method was improved by eliminating the anomalous columns prior to generating the self-reference template. The experimental results indicated that the average inspection efficiency of the developed system was 8.026 s/rod, the average false detection rate was 0.183%. The accuracy of the self-reference template method was 87.6%, higher than that of YOLOv2 and Faster R-CNN. The developed system exhibits high inspection efficiency and accuracy, so it can meet the actual detection functions and requirements of production lines, and now it has been successfully applied to actual production.},

In the past few years, cold spray (CS) had been widely adopted in restoration and repair applications due to its unique advantages, such as no thermal influence, high efficiency, flexibility, etc. Nowadays, speeding up the product lifecycle as well as improving the accuracy and reliability of CS based repairing require an advance strategy with higher efficiency and more agility. To respond to this need, in this article, a concept on the development of a knowledge based intelligent CS repairing framework is presented. The framework includes a 3D scanning system for providing the information needed on the partially damaged part to repair, a dynamic defect repairing knowledge base for providing related standard defect geometry repairing strategy, including matching the standardized defect geometry, machining pre-treatment, CS toolpath, CS parameter setting, etc., and a CS additive repair system involving robotic repair trajectory programming, simulation and material deposition. Based on the proposed framework, the design of intelligent CS additive repair system and its flow are explained. The novel repair strategy and method proposed in this article can become a model for the metal repair industry in the future.},

Formal and semi-formal languages, techniques, tools and frameworks can assist by providing repeatable and rigorous structures for eliciting, specifying, analysing, verifying and maintaining requirements. Various approaches have been proposed, but a contemporary and comprehensive study providing a landscape of the state-of-the-art is currently missing. This article reports a systematic mapping study covering 93 primary studies published between 2009 and October 2020. We categorise surveyed studies by current research directions in the use of semi-formal and formal methods for Requirements Engineering phases for Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems. We also identify gaps in current research and develop a novel conceptual model capturing the relationship between available formalisms and Requirements Engineering activities. We find that extensive work has been carried out on the formal analysis and verification of safety and timings requirements. However, the use of semi-formal notations, works on key phases like requirements elicitation and management, and the adoption of industrial standards are largely missing. Moreover, we find no literature providing methods to handle privacy and trust requirements, which have become critical concerns in this area.},

  abstract     = {Engineering and manufacturing processes and systems designs involve many challenges, such as dynamism, chaotic behaviours, and complexity. Of late, the arrival of big data, high computational speed, cloud computing and artificial intelligence techniques (like machine learning and deep learning) has reformed how many engineering and manufacturing professionals approach their work. These technologies offer thrilling innovative ways for engineers and manufacturers to tackle real-life challenges. On the other hand, the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is extensive. Several diverse theories, algorithms, and methods are available, which presents a challenge and a barrier in choosing the right AI technique for the appropriate engineering process or manufacturing process and environments. Besides, the pertinent literature is disseminated over various journals, conference proceedings, and research communities. Hence, conducting a systematic survey to scrutinise and classify the existing literature is worthwhile. However, it is challenging, but previous review studies have not adequately addressed AI’s use and advancement in engineering and manufacturing (EM). Besides, some concentrated on single AI models, and others focused on a specific area in EM. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review of studies on AI and its application in EM. To limit the scope of the current study, we conducted a keyword search in official publisher websites and academic databases, such as Springer, Elsevier, Scopus, Science Publication, Taylor &amp; Francis, Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), Wiley online library, Inderscience and Google scholar. The search results (173 articles) were filtered according to a proposed framework, which resulted in ninety-one (91) relevant research articles. We reviewed the articles based on a proposed taxonomy (the year of publication, the AI algorithm and machine learning task adopted, the application area in EM, the train and test split of data, the error, and accuracy metrics used, the potential benefits). Our assessment using the proposed taxonomy gave a helpful insight into the literature’s anatomy on various AI applications in engineering and manufacturing. Also, we identified opportunities for future research in AI application in the field of EM.},

Due to the physical, mechanical, and chemical components involved in the production, continuous casting is a very complex process, pushing conventional methods of monitoring and control to their limits. In recent years, this complexity and the increasing global competition created a demand for new methods to monitor and control the continuous casting process. Due to the success and associated rise of machine learning techniques in recent years, machine learning nowadays plays an essential role in monitoring and controlling complex processes. This publication presents a scientific survey of machine learning techniques for the analysis of the continuous casting process. We provide an introduction to both the involved fields: an overview of machine learning, and an overview of the continuous casting process. Therefore, we first analyze the existing work concerning machine learning in continuous casting of steel and then synthesize the common concepts into categories, supporting the identification of common use cases and approaches.

Nevertheless, almost all the study methods are of qualitative methods because they only qualitatively divided the health state of machines into several levels, which are not fit to comprehensively explore the degradation principle of machines and the relationship between degradation and maintenance. To discover the degradation principle of machines influenced by maintenance, a quantitative study method is proposed by calculating the Health Index (HI) based on fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and convolutional neural network (CNN). Finally, a case study is used to demonstrate the implementation and potential applications of the proposed method, in which two major maintenance methods in prognostic and health management (PHM), i.e. time-based maintenance (TBM) and condition-based maintenance (CBM) are studied. The results show that the application of the proposed method leads to a significant increase in the life of machines.

Using TP-LfD, human’s demonstrated paths can be learnt by a cobot for reproducing new paths for the cobot to move along in dynamic situations intelligently. One of the challenges to applying TP-LfD in industrial scenarios is how to identify and optimize critical task parameters of TP-LfD, i.e., frames in demonstrations. To overcome the challenge and enhance the performance of TP-LfD in complex manufacturing applications, in this paper, an improved TP-LfD approach is presented. In the approach, frames in demonstrations are autonomously chosen from a pool of generic visual features. To strengthen computational convergence, a statistical algorithm and a reinforcement learning algorithm are designed to eliminate redundant frames and irrelevant frames respectively. Meanwhile, a B-Spline cut-in algorithm is integrated in the improved TP-LfD approach to enhance the path reproducing process in dynamic manufacturing situations. Case studies were conducted to validate the improved TP-LfD approach and to showcase the advantage of the approach. Owing to the robust and generic capabilities, the improved TP-LfD approach enables teaching a cobot to behavior in a more intuitive and intelligent means to support dynamic manufacturing applications.},

  abstract     = {Industrial robots play an important role in the milling of large complex parts. However, the robot is less rigid and prone to vibration-related problems; chatter, which affects machining quality and efficiency, is more complex and difficult to monitor. In this paper, a variational mode decomposition-support vector machine (VMD-SVM) model based on information entropy (IE) is built to detect chatter in robotic milling. Significantly, the vibration signals are classified into four states for the first time: stable, transition, regular chatter, and irregular chatter. To improve the accuracy of the identification model based on VMD-SVM, a novel hyper-parameter optimization strategy—the kMap method—is proposed in this paper for optimizing three-dimensional hyper-parameters in the VMD-SVM model. The hyper-parameters of VMD-SVM are jointly optimized by the kMap method, with constant step sizes. As an improved grid search (GS), kMap reduces the operation time to the same order of magnitude as the heuristic algorithm (HA) [comprising particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA)]. The VMD-SVM model with the hyper-parameters optimized by kMap exhibits higher accuracy and better stability than the hyper-parameters optimized by PSO and GA. The results of the validation experiments show that the kMap-optimized identification model is effective in industrial robotic milling.},

Furthermore, the ANFIS model was optimized by GA and PSO algorithms. Full factorial experiments were conducted to obtain the training data, and the K-fold Cross-validation strategy was applied to train and validate machine learning models.

  abstract     = {Cloud manufacturing (CM) is a new networked manufacturing model that delivers various on-demand manufacturing capabilities to the consumers from the providers. In this model, the provider and consumer never meet each other, thus “trust” is the major enabler for starting a collaboration. In another word, a user must be sure that the requested capability will not be provided with malicious results, and the provider should ensure that the payment will be made on time. In this paper, a novel Blockchain Technology (BCT)-based trust system called “Blocktrust” is proposed to address the trust problem of the CM. First, the CM framework that contains the digital firm, capability pool, and digital certificate issuing units is developed, and then, the private blocktrust peer-to-peer network is proposed and implemented based on Hyperledger fabric. Finlay, the feasibility of the blocktrust is examined under different testing scenarios. The reason for using a private network instead of the public is placing restrictions on who is allowed to participate in the network and also enjoying a network with fast transaction speed. Experiments show that the proposed blocktrust embedded CM is credible and practical.},

First, the robot motion equation and the motion range constraint equation are proposed to ensure that the collected images of calibration grid and laser line meet the calibration requirements. Based on these two equations, the automatic collection procedure can be realized. Second, the simplified visual servoing method and the Extended Kalman filter were used to adjust the images and rectify system parameters, respectively, which will improve the stability of the calibration motion. Third, to reduce the impact of the complex welding environments, a robustness feature extraction algorithm based on local threshold is studied. And then, the laser plane and hand-eye matrix are fitted with optimization algorithms to ensure calibration accuracy. Finally, the simulation experiments prove the feasibility and stability of the proposed algorithm. And the actual calibration tests suggest that the algorithm can significantly improve calibration efficiency. Moreover, the experimental results of welding guidance and seam tracking confirm that the calibration precision has met the welding requirement.},

Some experiments were carried out to determine the hot water ( $$hw$$ ) and cold water ( $$cw$$ ) outlet temperatures of CHE. As a result of the CFD analysis, the average outlet temperatures of the $$hw$$ and $$cw$$ flow loops on the CHE were calculated as 48.24 and 35.38 °C, respectively. On the other hand, the experimental outlet temperatures were measured as being 48.50 and 35.72 °C, respectively. The studies showed that the numerical and experimental results of the CHE are compliant at the given boundary conditions. Furthermore, it was observed that the heat transfer rate of the CHE with lower volume is approximately 47.7% higher than that of standard brazed plate heat exchangers (BPHEs) produced by traditional methods. More experiments conducted on the CHE will inevitably have a negative effect on its manufacture time and cost. Thus, various models were developed to predict the results of unperformed experiments using the machine learning methods, ANN, MLR and SVM. In the models developed for each experiment, the source and inlet temperatures of $$hw$$ and $$cw$$ , respectively, and the volumetric flow rate of $$cw$$ were selected as input parameters for the machine learning methods. Thus, the $$hw$$ and $$cw$$ outlet temperatures of the CHE were estimated on the basis of these input parameters. The best performance was achieved by ANN.

  abstract     = {The ceramic membrane plays an important role in the wastewater disposal industry. The serial number engraved on each ceramic membrane is an essential feature for identification. Here, an automatic inspection system for serial numbers of ceramic membranes is proposed to replace the manual inspection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to automatically inspect serial numbers of ceramic membranes. To suppress error accumulation inherently existed in the previous stepwise approaches, an end-to-end photometric-induced convolutional neural network framework is proposed for this automatic inspection system. The framework consists of three sequential stages, which are photometric stage for performing photometric stereo, localization stage for localizing the text region, and recognition stage for producing recognition results. The photometric stage can integrate three-dimensional shape information of serial numbers of ceramic membranes into the framework to improve the inspection performance. Since three stages are jointly trained, a theoretical analysis on the contributions of the local losses is provided to ensure the convergence of the framework, which can guide the design of the total loss function of the framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves better inspection performance with a reasonable inspection time compared with the state-of-the-art deep learning methods, whose localization performance and recognition performance are the F-score of 95.61% and the accuracy of 96.49%, respectively. Furthermore, these demonstrate the potential that our proposed automatic inspection system will be beneficial for the intelligentialize of the ceramic membrane manufacturing and wastewater treatment if it is equipped with a perception system and a control system in ceramic membrane production lines and wastewater treatment processes.},

  abstract     = {Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is one of the most promising directions of Industry 4.0 smart manufacturing. Abundant manufacturing data and information are available for decision-makers in real-time thanks to the application of various frontier technologies in CPS. However, the inherent complexity and uncertainty of manufacturing optimization still plague scholars and practitioners and impede further progress of smart manufacturing. The production planning and scheduling is such a complex and stochastic problem that has received considerable research attention. Whereas how to leverage the strengths of CPS for breaking the bottleneck of complexity and uncertainty, is still a question that needs further exploration. This paper proposes a novel “divide and conquer” approach, Spatial–Temporal Out-Of-Order execution (ST-OOO), for achieving real-time planning and scheduling in cyber-physical factories. ST-OOO divides the space and time scopes of a factory into finite areas and intervals to reduce complexity and localize uncertainties so that the original complex optimization problem is decomposed into a set of subproblems with different spatial and temporal characteristics. These small-size subproblems can be assembled using data and information visibility and traceability, and then solved in a rolling spatiotemporal manner to generate a global solution. A case study shows that ST-OOO has a well-balanced and more stable performance compared to traditional strategies. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to study the impacts of spatial and temporal scales on the results.},

  abstract     = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) and differential evolution (DE) are two efficient meta-heuristic algorithms, achieving excellent performance in a wide variety of optimization problems. Unfortunately, when both algorithms are used to solve complex problems then they inevitably suffer from stagnation, premature convergence and unbalanced exploration–exploitation. Hybridization of PSO and DE may provide a platform to resolve these issues. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative hybrid algorithm (ihPSODE) which would be more effective than PSO and DE. It integrated with suggested novel PSO (nPSO) and DE (nDE). Where in nPSO a new, inertia weight and acceleration coefficient as well as position update equation are familiarized, to escape stagnation. And in nDE a new, mutation strategy and crossover rate is introduced, to avoid premature convergence. In order to balance between global and local search capability, after calculation of ihPSODE population best half member has been identified and discard rest members. Further, in current population nPSO is employed to maintain exploration and exploitation, then nDE is used to enhance convergence accuracy. The proposed ihPSODE and its integrating component nPSO and nDE have been tested over 23 basic, 30 IEEE CEC2014 and 30 IEEE CEC2017 unconstrained benchmark functions plus 3 real life optimization problems. The performance of proposed algorithms compared with traditional PSO and DE, their existed variants/hybrids as well as some of the other state-of-the-art algorithms. The results indicate the superiority of proposed algorithms. Finally, based on overall performance ihPSODE is recommended for bound-unconstrained optimization problems in this present study.},

A recursive computing procedure of the corresponding sparse loading matrixes is derived based on a modified rank-one matrix approximation algorithm, so that the computational complexity of the process monitoring model is greatly decreased and the real-time monitoring capability can be guaranteed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the benchmark Tennessee-Eastman process. Compared with traditional fault monitoring methods, the proposed method can effectively improve the fault detection accuracies with lower false alarm rates, which is suitable for the fault monitoring of time-varying, long-term and continuous complex industrial processes.},

  abstract     = {Jaya algorithm (JAYA) is a recently developed metaheuristic algorithm for global optimization problems. JAYA has a very simple structure and only needs the essential population size and terminal condition for solving optimization problems. However, JAYA is easy to get trapped in the local optimum for solving complex global optimization problems due to its single learning strategy. Motivated by this disadvantage of JAYA, this paper presents an improved JAYA, named comprehensive learning JAYA algorithm (CLJAYA), for solving engineering design optimization problems. The core idea of CLJAYA is the designed comprehensive learning mechanism by making full use of population information. The designed comprehensive learning mechanism consists of three different learning strategies to improve the global search ability of JAYA. To investigate the performance of CLJAYA, CLJAYA is first evaluated by the well-known CEC 2013 and CEC 2014 test suites, which include 50 multimodal test functions and eight unimodal test functions. Then CLJAYA is employed to solve five real-world engineering optimization problems. Experimental results demonstrate that CLJAYA can achieve better solutions for most test problems than JAYA and the other compared algorithms, which indicates the designed comprehensive learning mechanism is very effective. In addition, the source code of the proposed CLJAYA can be loaded from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/82134-the-source-code-for-cljaya .},

  abstract     = {The use of expert knowledge by manufacturing companies to support everyday activities has become an emerging practice thanks to the new knowledge management tools. A big set of knowledge is available in the organizations but its profitable use to solve problems and assist decision making is still a challenge. This is the case of CAM operations or preprocessing steps for which various works have been led to involve experts’ knowledge in the decision-making based on qualitative principles. However, so far, there is no methodology to the quantitative representation of that knowledge for more assistance. This paper introduces an approach for the conversion of knowledge into quantitative mathematical models. The main idea is to go from elicitation data in the form of action rules to simple unitary mathematical images; here desirability functions. The whole process carried out to extract the useful information that help building the desirability functions is exposed and different useful mathematical considerations are proposed. The resulting methodology identifies the categories of concepts in action rules and translate them into codified action rules. Then, through a mathematization process, the desirability functions are built. In short, this new approach allows evaluating the satisfaction level of the rules prescribed by the experts. As an illustration, the model is applied to action rules for CAM operations in additive manufacturing and more precisely to the definition of part orientation. This has shown the robustness of the methodology used and that it is possible to translate elicitation data into mathematical functions operable in computation algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Improving the geometric accuracy of the deposited component is essential for the wider adoption of wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) in industries. This paper introduces an online layer-by-layer controller that operates robustly under various welding conditions to improve the deposition accuracy of the WAAM process. Two control strategies are proposed and evaluated in this work: A PID algorithm and a multi-input multi-output model-predictive control (MPC) algorithm. After each layer of deposition, the deposited geometry is measured using a laser scanner. These measurements are compared against the CAD model, and geometric errors are then compensated by the controller, which generates a new set of welding parameters for the next layer. The MPC algorithm, combined with a linear autoregressive (ARX) modelling process, updates welding parameters between successive layers by minimizing a cost function based on sequences of input variables and predicted responses. Weighting coefficients of the ARX model are trained iteratively throughout the manufacturing process. The performance of the designed control architecture is investigated through both simulation and experiments. Results show that the real-time control performance is improved by increasing the complexity of implemented control algorithm: controlled geometric fluctuations in the test component were reduced by 200% whilst maintaining fluctuations within a 3 mm limit under various welding conditions. In addition, the adaptiveness of designed control strategy is verified by accurately controlling the fabrication of a part with complex geometry.},

  abstract     = {Digitalisation trends of Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things led to an unprecedented growth of manufacturing data. This opens new horizons for data-driven methods, such as Machine Learning (ML), in monitoring of manufacturing processes. In this work, we propose ML pipelines for quality monitoring in Resistance Spot Welding. Previous approaches mostly focused on estimating quality of welding based on data collected from laboratory or experimental settings. Then, they mostly treated welding operations as independent events while welding is a continuous process with a systematic dynamics and production cycles caused by maintenance. Besides, model interpretation based on engineering know-how, which is an important and common practice in manufacturing industry, has mostly been ignored. In this work, we address these three issues by developing a novel feature-engineering based ML approach. Our method was developed on top of real production data. It allows to analyse sequences of welding instances collected from running manufacturing lines. By capturing dependencies across sequences of welding instances, our method allows to predict quality of upcoming welding operations before they happen. Furthermore, in our work we strive to combine the view of engineering and data science by discussing characteristics of welding data that have been little discussed in the literature, by designing sophisticated feature engineering strategies with support of domain knowledge, and by interpreting the results of ML analysis intensively to provide insights for engineering. We developed 12 ML pipelines in two dimensions: settings of feature engineering and ML methods, where we considered 4 feature settings and 3 ML methods (linear regression, multi-layer perception and support vector regression). We extensively evaluated our ML pipelines on data from two running industrial production lines of 27 welding machines with promising results.},

  abstract     = {The use of composite materials is increasing in industry sectors such as renewable energy generation and storage, transport (including automotive, aerospace and agri-machinery) and construction. This is a result of the various advantages of composite materials over their monolithic counterparts, such as high strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and superior fatigue performance. However, there is a lack of detailed knowledge in relation to fusion joining techniques for composite materials. In this work, ultrasonic welding is carried out on a carbon fibre/PEKK composite material bonded to carbon fibre/epoxy composite to investigate the influence of weld process parameters on the joint’s lap shear strength (LSS), the process repeatability, and the process induced defects. A 33 parametric study is carried out and a robust machine learning model is developed using a hybrid genetic algorithm–artificial neural network (GA–ANN) trained on the experimental data. Bayesian optimisation is employed to determine the most suitable GA–ANN hyperparameters and the resulting GA–ANN surrogate model is exploited to optimise the welding process, where the process performance metrics are LSS, repeatability and joint visual quality. The prediction for the optimal LSS was subsequently validated through a further set of experiments, which resulted in a prediction error of just 3%.},

  abstract     = {In the semiconductor industry, automated visual inspection aims to improve the detection and recognition of manufacturing defects by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and computer vision systems, enabling manufacturers to profit from an increased yield and reduced manufacturing costs. Previous domain-specific contributions often utilized classical computer vision approaches, whereas more novel systems deploy deep learning based ones. However, a persistent problem in the domain stems from the recognition of very small defect patterns which are often in the size of only a few $$\mu $$ m and pixels within vast amounts of high-resolution imagery. While these defect patterns occur on the significantly larger wafer surface, classical machine and deep learning solutions have problems in dealing with the complexity of this challenge. This contribution introduces a novel hybrid multistage system of stacked deep neural networks (SH-DNN) which allows the localization of the finest structures within pixel size via a classical computer vision pipeline, while the classification process is realized by deep neural networks. The proposed system draws the focus over the level of detail from its structures to more task-relevant areas of interest. As the created test environment shows, our SH-DNN-based multistage system surpasses current approaches of learning-based automated visual inspection. The system reaches a performance (F1-score) of up to 99.5%, corresponding to a relative improvement of the system’s fault detection capabilities by 8.6-fold. Moreover, by specifically selecting models for the given manufacturing chain, runtime constraints are satisfied while improving the detection capabilities of currently deployed approaches.},

This article investigates and formalizes the production planning for a highly automated but customized pallet production and provides a solution approach. For completing a specific pallet, the required boards must be cut and stacked in advance to meet the demand at the assembly line. The arising planning problem for producing the required boards consists of both a cutting stock and a constraining open stack problem. Further, both the changeover of raw material at the cutting process and the number of fully automated internal storages, for stacked boards, are restricted. The proposed solution heuristic aims at minimizing the cutting waste. Additionally, feasibility with regard to the buffers is tested using discrete event simulation. Different approaches to generate, select and sequence the cutting patterns are investigated.},

In this paper, a ML integrated design for AM framework is proposed, which takes advantage of ML that can learn the complex relationships between the design and performance spaces. Furthermore, the primary advantage of ML over other surrogate modelling methods is the capability to model input–output relationships in both directions. That is, a deep neural network can model property–structure relationships, given structure–property input–output data. A case study was carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of using ML to design a customized ankle brace that has a tunable mechanical performance with tailored stiffness.},

However, the imbalanced fault data bring great challenges to extract the high nonlinearity and inherently time-varying dynamics of the batch process. Motivated by these, we propose a sequential oversampling discrimination approach for imbalanced batch process fault detection. Especially, different from the traditional oversampling methods, which extract temporal features from the whole process, we transform a whole batch sequence into multiple fixed-length sequences each batch by a sliding window, to extract the robust time-varying dynamics features. Then, an oversampling neural network is performed to balance both sequences of minority and majority classes. The needed sequences of the minority class are generated by an improved combination model of variational auto-encoder and generative adversarial network. Finally, a simplified sequential neural network is learned by the balanced-class sequences to perform the discrimination. We conduct extensive experiments based on two datasets of semiconductor manufacturing. One is a benchmark dataset and the other is a dataset from a real production line. The results achieved significant improvement, compared with other state-of-art fault detection methods and oversampling techniques.},

The extracted features are used for classifying 10 types of fault conditions in a gearbox and 7 types of fault conditions a roller bearings. Both vibration signal datasets were acquired at different loads and speeds. The feature extraction using Algorithm 1 performs the feature calculation from the Poincaré plot constructed with the raw vibration signals. In contrast, the Algorithm 2 requires an additional stage where the vibration signal is pre-processed for identifying the peaks of the signal. This peak sequence is equivalent to a non-uniform sub-sampling of the vibration signal that retains relevant information useful for fault classification. The fault classification is attained by using a multi-class Support Vector Machine. The proposed method is tested using the tenfold cross-validation. Results show that both algorithms could attain classification accuracies as high as 99.3% for the gearbox dataset and 100% for the roller bearings. The results are compared to other classification approaches performed on the same datasets by using other different features. The comparison shows that the approach in this paper has a performance as good as obtained by using well-known statistical features.},

These characteristics generally creates difficulties in the S-DBR, thereby worsening performance indicators, such as mean flow time, setup time, and stock replenishment frequency. Given this research gap, the present study aims to develop a dispatching method for production orders in MTA, based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) metaheuristic. The dispatching method aims to minimize the mean flow time, setup time, and stock levels in environments with a dependent setup time. To evaluate the performance of the new dispatching method, we used computational simulation to compare this method and the MTA dispatching logic.

These state-of-the-art results are typically obtained through supervised learning, for which large annotated datasets are required. However, acquiring such datasets for manufacturing applications remains a challenging proposition due to the time and costs involved in their collection. To overcome this disadvantage, a novel framework is proposed for data augmentation by creating synthetic images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The generator synthesizes new surface defect images from random noise which is trained over time to get realistic fakes. These synthetic images can be used further for training of classification algorithms. Three GAN architectures are trained, and the entire data augmentation pipeline is implemented for the Northeastern University (China) Classification (NEU-CLS) dataset for hot-rolled steel strips from NEU Surface Defect Database. The classification accuracy of a simple CNN architecture is measured on synthetic augmented data and further it is compared with similar state-of-the-arts. It is observed that the proposed GANs-based augmentation scheme significantly improves the performance of CNN for classification of surface defects. The classically augmented CNN yields sensitivity and specificity of 90.28% and 98.06% respectively. In contrast, the synthetically augmented CNN yields better results, with sensitivity and specificity of 95.33% and 99.16% respectively. Also, the use of GANs is demonstrated to disentangle the representation space and to add additional domain knowledge through synthetic augmentation that can be difficult to replicate through classic augmentation. The proposed framework demonstrates high generalization capability. It may be applied to other supervised surface inspection tasks, and thus facilitate the development of advanced vision-based inspection instruments for manufacturing applications.},

Physics-based models are not able to predict cell viability with high accuracy because of the complexity of cell biological structures and cell recovery. To overcome this challenge, we developed a predictive model using machine learning to predict cell viability. We designed a set of experiments considering the effects of four critical process parameters, including UV intensity, UV exposure time, gelatin methacrylate concentration, and layer thickness. These experiments were conducted under varying bioprinting conditions to collect experimental data. An ensemble learning algorithm combining neural networks, ridge regression, K-nearest neighbors, and random forest (RF) was developed aiming at predicting cell viability under various bioprinting conditions. The performance of the predictive model was evaluated based on three error metrics. Finally, the importance of each process parameter on cell viability was determined using RF. The predictive model has been demonstrated to be able to predict cell viability with high accuracy as well as determine the significance of each process parameter on cell viability in SLA-based 3D bioprinting.},

This paper presents an image acquisition system and a detailed analysis of deep learningbased object detectors for LCD pixel defect detection problem. Experimental results show that the proposed methods can be a powerful alternative to operator control by providing more efficient use of time, human, financial resources and betterquality standards in TV production industry.},

  abstract     = {Due to the existence of domain shifts, the distributions of data acquired from different machines show significant discrepancies in industrial applications, which leads to performance degradation of traditional machine learning methods. In this paper, we propose a novel method that combines supervised domain adaptation with prototype learning for fault diagnosis. The proposed method consists of two modules, i.e., feature learning and condition recognition. The module of feature learning applies the Siamese architecture based on one-dimensional convolutional neural networks to learn a domain invariant subspace, which reduces the inter-domain discrepancy of distributions. The module of condition recognition applies a prototypical layer to learn the prototypes of each class. Then the classification task is simplified to find the nearest class prototype. Compared with existing intelligent fault diagnosis methods, this proposed method can be extended to address the problem when the classes from the source and target domains are partially overlapped. The model must generalize to unknown classes in the source domain, given only a few samples of each new target class. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using two bearing datasets. The model quickly converges with high classification accuracy using a few labeled target samples in training, even one per class can be effective.},

Considering that the existing search technology is complicated and time-consuming in dealing with such constrained CAP (cCAP), and immune clone selection algorithm with variable neighborhood operation (ICSAVNS) is provided for solving this problem. Two approaches to initial solution generation are designed to improve the quality of the initial population. A variable neighborhood search operator is embedded to improve the accuracy of the local search. A threshold is set in the mutation operation of the ICSAVNS to achieve population expansion better. A double index of sequences consisting of affinity values and constrained facility index values is used to select and reselect, achieving population compression in the clonal selection part. Finally, by exactly solving the model, the rationality of the model is verified. The hybrid clone selection algorithm is used to solve the cCAP and cbCAP benchmark instances of different sizes, and compared with the state-of-the-art optimization algorithms.

  abstract     = {Surface roughness, which has a significant influence on fatigue strength and wear resistance, is an important technical parameter. In practical machining, it is unstable and may be larger than the acceptable surface roughness due to unstable machining process. This will seriously deteriorate the surface performance of the workpieces. Therefore, an effective surface roughness stabilization method is of great significance to improve machining efficiency and reduce machining cost. In this paper, a surface roughness stabilization method is proposed and illustrated by taking five-axis machining as an example. A self-learning surface roughness prediction model based on Pigeon-Inspired Optimization and Support Vector Machine is firstly constructed and its prediction error is only 8.69% in the initial stage. This model has the self-learning ability that the prediction accuracy can be improved with the increase of training data. Furthermore, a machining parameters self-adaption adjustment method based on digital twin is proposed to make the machined surface quality stable. In this method, considering the feasibility of practical machining operation, the cutter posture (i.e. lead angle and tilt angle in five-axis machining) and spindle speed are selected as the adjustable parameters. When the predicted surface roughness doesn’t meet the requirements, the Gradient Descent algorithm is applied to recalculate the new parameters for adjustment. According to the experimental results, the proposed method can stabilize surface roughness and improve the surface quality, which is vital for the precision manufacturing of complex workpiece. Meanwhile, it also greatly improves the intelligence level of manufacturing and production.},

This is because real-world application fields typically show specific requirement profiles that are often not considered by state-of-the-art DRL research. This survey addresses questions raised in the domain of industrial engineering regarding the reliability of production schedules obtained through DRL-based scheduling approaches. We review definitions and evaluation measures of reliability both, in the classical numerical optimization domain with focus on PS problems and more broadly in the DRL domain. Furthermore, we define common ground and terminology and present a collection of quantifiable reliability definitions for use in this interdisciplinary domain. Concludingly, we identify promising directions of current DRL research as a basis for tackling different aspects of reliability in PS applications in the future.},

Latest research has demonstrated that for most liquid engineering alloys, the critical meniscus velocity of the melt at the ingate is in the range of 0.4–0.6 m s−1. The work described in this research paper is to use neural network (NN) technology to propose digital twin approach for gating system design that allow to understand and model its performances faster and more reliable than traditional methods. This approach was applied in the case of sand casting of liquid aluminum alloy (EN AC-44200). The approach is based first on a digital representation of filling process to perform the melt flow simulations using a combination of the gating system design parameters, selected as a training cases from Taguchi orthogonal array (OA). The second step of the approach is the data capture of functional gating design system to train up the feed-forward back-propagation NN model. The validation of the well-trained NN model is assessed by interrogating predicted ingate velocity to it and making reliable predictions with high accuracy. The claim is that such digital twin approach is an effective solution to recognize the functional design parameters from the entire filling systems used during casting process.},

  abstract     = {Weld evaluation processes are usually conducted in the post-weld stage. In this way, defects are found after the weld is completed, often resulting in disposal of expensive material or lengthy repair processes. Simultaneously, weld quality inspections tend to be performed manually by a human, even for an automated weld. Therefore, a proper real-time weld quality monitoring method associated with a decision-making strategy is needed to increase the productivity and automaticity in weld. In this study, acoustic emission (AE) as a real-time monitoring method is introduced for gas metal arc weld. The AE system is designed to cover a wide range of frequencies from 5 to 400 kHz. Additionally, the welding parameters (weld current, voltage, gas flow rate, and heat input) are recorded concurrently with AE. Different types of weld defects are artificially created to generate different signals. For the automated decision-making system, machine learning algorithms are used. Several features extracted from the AE and welding parameters feed into a machine learning algorithm. A new AE feature as the rate of AE energy accumulation extracted from time driven AE feature is defined. For decision-making, supervised learning models are trained and evaluated using testing data. General classification methods—such as Logistic Regression—predict each data-point separately. In this study, Adversarial Sequence Tagging method is applied to predict the presence of four weld states as good, excessive penetration, burn-through, porosity and porosity-excessive penetration. We explore the prediction task as a sequence tagging problem where the label of a data-point depends on its corresponding features as well as neighboring labels. When all the AE features as well as heat input are used in the feature set, the sequence tagging and logistic regression algorithms achieve a prediction accuracy of 91.18% and 82.35%, respectively, as compared to metallographic analysis.},

However, because of the open-loop between the learner and task constraints, the precision of the reproduction at the desired task constraints cannot always be guaranteed and the model is not robust to changes of the training data. This paper proposes a closed-loop framework of LfD based on the bagging method of Gaussian Mixture Model and Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMM/GMR) to obtain a robust learner of LfD with high precision reproduction. The original demonstration data are divided into several sub-training data, from which multiple Gaussian mixture models are developed and combined through weighted average to provide predictions. A closed-loop is built between the reproduction of the combined learner and task constraints, and the weights that satisfy task constraints are estimated in the closed-loop. The prediction uncertainty of the models is automatically eliminated by the closed-loop, therefore, the low robustness of the LfD model to the training date is overcome. In experiments, tasks of the position and velocity are both constrained in dual closed-loop. It is shown that the proposed method can significantly meet the task constraints without increasing the complexity of the algorithm.},

To further improve the control performance, a prescribed performance function characterizing the error convergence rate, maximum overshoot and steady-state error is utilized for the output error transformation.

This study proposes an ensemble convolutional neural network (ECNN) framework for WBM pattern classification, in which a weighted majority function is adopted to select higher weights for the base classifiers that have higher predictive performance. An industrial WBM dataset (namely, WM-811K) from a wafer fabrication process was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ECNN framework. The proposed ECNN has superior performance in terms of precision, recall, F1 and other conventional machine learning classifiers such as linear regression, random forest, gradient boosting machine, and artificial neural network.

  abstract     = {The fault diagnostics of rotating components are crucial for most mechanical systems since the rotating components faults are the main form of failures of many mechanical systems. In traditional diagnostics approaches, extracting features from raw input is an important prerequisite and normally requires manual extraction based on signal processing techniques. This suffers of some drawbacks such as the strong dependence on domain expertise, the high sensitivity to different mechanical systems, the poor flexibility and generalization ability, and the limitations of mining new features, etc. In this paper, we proposed an end-to-end fault diagnostics model based on a convolutional neural network for rotating machinery using vibration signals. The model learns features directly from the one-dimensional raw vibration signals without any manual feature extraction. To fully validate its effectiveness and robustness, the proposed model is tested on four datasets, including two public ones and two datasets of our own, covering the applications of ball screw, bearing and gearbox. The method of manual, signal processing based feature extraction combined with a classifier is also explored for comparison. The results show that the manually extracted features are sensitive to the various applications, thus needing fine-tuning, while the proposed framework has a good robustness for rotating machinery fault diagnostics with high accuracies for all the four applications, without any application-specific manual fine-tuning.},

  abstract     = {Decision rules for machining method chains mined from historical machining documents can help technologists quickly design new machining method chains. However, the main factor that limits the practical application of existing rough set models is that the boundary regions are too large. Therefore, a decomposition-reorganization method (DRM) is proposed to mine rules for machining method chains. First, binary coding is used to decompose the existing machining method chains, and the decision rules for a single machining method are mined based on rough set reduction. Then, machining method chains are obtained by reorganizing the machining methods in accordance with the decision rules. DRM can eliminate the boundary regions without human intervention and recommend machining method chains for all features whose parameters have appeared in historical machining documents. Finally, three types of shell parts are used to verify the effectiveness of DRM.},

  abstract     = {Probe card that serves as the carrier of die and the transmitter of information is an indispensable test interface for integrated circuit testing. The probe card extracts the electrical signal of chip and sends it to the prober to screen defectives. In the process of interface transmission, signal disturbance or attenuation will lead to functional errors, and the output result will be different from the expected one to the screen of selected known good dies for integrated circuit packaging and final test. If abnormal situations happen with probe cards, the engineers will eliminate potential fault causes by trial and error method according to domain knowledge and personal experience for troubleshooting. As semiconductor industry is continuously migrating with shrinking feature size, the diagnosing and troubleshooting procedure for probe card is exponentially complicated and time-consuming. To enhance data integrity of circuit probe testing, this study aims to develop a Bayesian network for probe card fault diagnosis and troubleshooting via the integrated data-driven solutions considering potential rules derived from domain knowledge and manufacturing big data to empower Industry 3.5 smart production. An empirical study is conducted in a leading semiconductor testing company for validation. The experiment results show that the proposed approach can improve one-shot probability from 0.13 to 0.36 to improve one-shot success chance in troubleshooting process. The expected shooting times for probe faults have been reduced from 11 times to 3.96 times on average to save 63.97% of fault troubleshooting efforts in testing process. The proposed approach can provide effective suggestions to shorten troubleshooting time for yield improvement and subsequent packaging cost reduction to empower flexible decision-making for smart production. The results have shown practical viability of proposed approach for Industry 3.5. Indeed, the developed solutions have been implemented in real settings.},

In this method, Class imbalance problem was solved by using SMOTE, and parameters optimization problem was solved by using GA. Finally, the assembly-related data from the batch assembly of x-axis of a three-axis vertical machining center were collected to validate the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed NMI-RSWR approach has capacity for selecting the highly related assembly parameters with assembly quality of linear axis, and the proposed data-driven modeling approach is effective for assembly quality evaluation of linear axis.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing market features of globalization, service and customization, the way manufacturers conduct manufacturing business is changing. Under this background, Cloud Manufacturing (CMfg) emerges as a new networked manufacturing model. However, CMfg is immature in many aspects, especially in exception handling of service composition execution. Due to the complexity of the enterprise manufacturing process, there are a large number of unpredictable abnormal events in the dynamic open cloud manufacturing environment (such as user demand change, machine failure, etc.), so in order to ensure the smooth implementation of the service combination, it is indispensable to establish an effective service exception handling mechanism in CMfg. Moreover, when an exception occurs, in order to ensure the smooth execution of the downstream services after the exception point, the exception handling must satisfy the strict time constraints. To realize the exception-handing of service-composition with the strict deadline or strict time constraints, this paper proposes a service-composition exception adaptive adjustment model, considering the influences of the logistics transferring time and cost. And the occupied time of the cloud services and the valid replacement time range of the exception service are considered as the constraints in this model. In addition, the processing quality, the cost, and the quality of service are set as the optimal objectives. On the above basis, a service-composition exception handling adaptive adjustment (SCEHAA) algorithm based on the improved ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) is proposed and applied to address the above model. Finally, to validate the performance of SCEHAA, a case study and the comparison experiment between SCEHAA and other algorithms (Particle Swarm Optimization and Artificial Bee Colony) are performed. The results show that the SCEHAA algorithm can perform the adaptive adjustment of the service-composition with strict time limit effectively, through the adaptive service execution path reconfiguration and has fast convergence effects.},

  abstract     = {Industrial environments such as manufacturing and transportation industries usually involve fleets of identical systems that must carry out several missions interspersed with scheduled finite breaks. Given the limited amount of maintenance resources and time available, only a restricted number of maintenance actions can be performed on selected components to ensure a pre-specified performance level of the fleet for the next mission. Such a maintenance strategy is known as fleet-level selective maintenance (FSM). The FSM is more complex than the selective maintenance problem as it adds the total number of systems in the fleet as another level of combinations to be explored during the optimization process. Most FSM models consider the replacement or perfect repair of system components as the only maintenance option. Furthermore, they consider a single repair channel and disregard the assignment of repairpersons and the impact of their variable skillsets on the maintenance costs and duration. In this paper, an approach is proposed to help in more realistic decision making for FSM where several imperfect maintenance levels and multiple repair channels are available. A novel integrated non-linear programming formulation of the FSM problem where maintenance and repairpersons assignment decisions are made jointly is proposed. All relevant parameters and terms of this non-linear optimization problem are developed and discussed. A two-phase modeling approach is then used to transform the original nonlinear problem into a binary integer optimization model. To demonstrate the validity and the added value of the proposed approach, multiple sets of numerical experiments are investigated and managerial implications are provided.},

  abstract     = {As a rapid developing additive manufacturing (AM) technology, selective laser melting (SLM) provides a promising way for intelligent manufacturing. The SLM part quality depends largely on the process parameters in the manufacturing process. Therefore, understanding the relationships between the input process parameters and the output part performances is critical to improve the part quality. In this work, the ensemble of metamodels (EM) is adopted and an adaptive hybrid leave-one-out error-based EM (EM-AHL) is developed to predict the powder utilization rate, the energy consumption, and the tensile strength of the as-built parts. First, the Taguchi experiment design is applied to obtain the sample points and the corresponding SLM experiments are conducted to get the experimental results. Second, the correlations between the process parameters (i.e., laser power, layer thickness, scanning speed) and the three responses are fitted using the proposed EM-AHL, which is constructed by aggregating three metamodels, Kriging, Radial basis fuction (RBF), and Support vector regression (SVR), according to the local measures. Finally, K-fold cross-validation and additional experiments validation methods are adopted to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the proposed EM-AHL. Results illustrate that the proposed EM-AHL not only outperforms the stand-alone metamodels but also provides more accurate results than the EM constructed by global measures (EM-G). Among the three prediction objectives, the prediction accuracy of the proposed EM-AHL has improved by up to 20% compared to the stand-alone metamodels. Besides, the main effects and contribution rates of process parameters on the responses are analyzed. Overall, the proposed EM-AHL method exhibits the excellent capability of guiding the actual SLM manufacturing.},

The literature that compares PCSs in the MTO context reported contradictory results. In fact, there is a gap in the literature concerning which factors or parameters explain a PCS performance. This paper presents an analysis of comparative studies on PCS in the MTO context, using a systematic literature review, to reveal which control factors and manufacturing conditions influence a PCS performance. The analysis concentrates on studies that use simulation to assess the performance of PCSs. Our results indicate that the main difference in PCSs performance is the design of the control loops. Other important factors that must be considered in the choice of a PCS are the order release mechanism, the workload aggregation approach, and the workload estimation method used on control loops. A framework for choosing a suitable PCS for MTO companies is presented, considering these factors.},

Furthermore, the path parameters that simultaneously realize multiple target values of the workpiece dimensions were calculated instantly by the iterative solution based on the constructed model. A systematic design of the path parameters for a constant thickness distribution was established as follows. First, the roller path was expressed using 12 parameters. Second, the workpieces were spun under various experimental conditions, which were determined by partial randomization of the orthogonal array based on the Taguchi method. Third, an ANN model was trained by considering seven path parameters as inputs and five forming result values as outputs (cup height, wall thickness at 25%, 50%, and 75% of the cup height, and residual path length). Finally, the path parameters required for realizing a constant thickness were determined using an ANN model with an iterative solution. Although several samples of the training dataset exhibited non-uniform thickness distributions, the workpieces that were spun under the parameters obtained via iteration exhibited a constant thickness distribution. The parameters responsible for stretching the material in the radial direction significantly affected the thickness distribution. The most influential parameter was the increment in the axial start position for each curved pass.},

  abstract     = {Robotic vision plays a key role for perceiving the environment in grasping applications. However, the conventional framed-based robotic vision, suffering from motion blur and low sampling rate, may not meet the automation needs of evolving industrial requirements. This paper, for the first time, proposes an event-based robotic grasping framework for multiple known and unknown objects in a cluttered scene. With advantages of microsecond-level sampling rate and no motion blur of event camera, the model-based and model-free approaches are developed for known and unknown objects’ grasping respectively. The event-based multi-view approach is used to localize the objects in the scene in the model-based approach, and then point cloud processing is utilized to cluster and register the objects. The proposed model-free approach, on the other hand, utilizes the developed event-based object segmentation, visual servoing and grasp planning to localize, align to, and grasp the targeting object. Using a UR10 robot with an eye-in-hand neuromorphic camera and a Barrett hand gripper, the proposed approaches are experimentally validated with objects of different sizes. Furthermore, it demonstrates robustness and a significant advantage over grasping with a traditional frame-based camera in low-light conditions.},

  abstract     = {Remanufacturing includes disassembly and reassembly of used products to save natural resources and reduce emissions. While assembly is widely understood in the field of operations management, disassembly is a rather new problem in production planning and control. The latter faces the challenge of high uncertainty of type, quantity and quality conditions of returned products, leading to high volatility in remanufacturing production systems. Traditionally, disassembly is a manual labor-intensive production step that, thanks to advances in robotics and artificial intelligence, starts to be automated with autonomous workstations. Due to the diverging material flow, the application of production systems with loosely linked stations is particularly suitable and, owing to the risk of condition induced operational failures, the rise of hybrid disassembly systems that combine manual and autonomous workstations can be expected. In contrast to traditional workstations, autonomous workstations can expand their capabilities but suffer from unknown failure rates. For such adverse conditions a condition-based control for hybrid disassembly systems, based on reinforcement learning, alongside a comprehensive modeling approach is presented in this work. The method is applied to a real-world production system. By comparison with a heuristic control approach, the potential of the RL approach can be proven simulatively using two different test cases.},

  abstract     = {In order to manufacture products at low cost, machine learning (ML) is increasingly used in production, especially in high wage countries. Therefore, we introduce our PREFERML AutoML system, which is adapted to the production environment. The system is designed to predict production errors and to help identifying the root cause. It is particularly important to produce results for further investigations that can also be used by quality engineers. Quality engineers are not data science experts and are usually overwhelmed with the settings of an algorithm. Because of this, our system takes over this task and delivers a fully optimized ML model as a result. In this paper, we give a brief overview of what results can be achieved with a state-of-the-art classifier. Moreover, we present the results with optimized tree-based algorithms based on RandomSearchCV and HyperOpt hyperparameter tuning. The algorithms are optimized based on multiple metrics, which we will introduce in the following sections. Based on a cost-oriented metric we can show an improvement for companies to predict the outcome of later product tests. Further, we compare the results from the mentioned optimization approaches and evaluate the needed time for them.},

Different resource types can be included in the planning system. A genetic algorithm generates and optimizes possible layouts for a line. The optimization aims to minimize the line’s area and the costs for assembling the line while simultaneously optimizing the resources’ positioning to perform their tasks. The line’s cycle time is considered as a boundary condition. For the evaluation of different layout alternatives, a multi-body simulation is performed. A parameter study is used to set the algorithm’s parameters. Afterward, the algorithm is applied to three increasingly complex examples to validate and evaluate its functionality. The approach is promising for industrial applications as it allows the integration of various resource types and individualization of the optimization function.},

  abstract     = {In metal additive manufacturing, geometries with high aspect ratio (AR) features are often associated with defects caused by thermal stresses and other related build failures. Ideally, excessively high AR features would be detected and removed in the design phase to avoid unwanted failure during manufacture. However, AR is scale and orientation independent and identifying features across all scales and orientations is exceptionally challenging. Furthermore, not all high AR features are as easy to recognise as thin walls and fine needles. There is therefore a pressing need for further development in the field of problematic features detection for additive manufacturing processes. In this work, a dimensionless ratio (D1/D2) based on two distance metrics that are extracted from triangulated mesh geometries is proposed. Based on this method, geometries with different features (e.g. thin wall, helices and polyhedra) were generated and evaluated to produce metrics that are similar to AR. The prediction results are compared with known theoretical AR values of typical geometries.By combining this metric with mesh segmentation, this method was further extended to analyse the geometry with complex features. The proposed method provides a powerful, general and promising way to automatically detect high AR features and tackle the relevant defect issues prior to manufacture.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes the transformation of a rolling mill aggregate from a stand-alone solution to a fully integrated cyber physical production system. Within this process, already existing load cells were substituted and additional inductive and magnetic displacement sensors were applied. After calibration, those were fully integrated into a six-layer digitalization architecture at the Smart Forming Lab at the Chair of Metal Forming (Montanuniversitaet Leoben). Within this framework, two front end human machine interfaces were designed, where the first one serves as a condition monitoring system during the rolling process. The second user interface visualizes the result of a resilient machine learning algorithm, which was designed using Python and is not just able to predict and adapt the resulting rolling schedule of a defined metal sheet, but also to learn from additional rolling mill schedules carried out. This algorithm was created on the basis of a black box approach, using data from more than 1900 milling steps with varying roll gap height, sheet width and friction conditions. As a result, the developed program is able to interpolate and extrapolate between these parameters as well as different initial sheet thicknesses, serving as a digital twin for data-based recommendations on schedule changes between different rolling process steps. Furthermore, via the second user interface, it is possible to visualize the influence of this parameters on the result of the milling process. As the whole layer system runs on an internal server at the university, students and other interested parties are able to access the visualization and can therefore use the environment to deepen their knowledge within the characteristics and influence of the sheet metal rolling process as well as data science and especially fundamentals of machine learning. This algorithm also serves as a basis for further integration of materials science based data for the prediction of the influence of different materials on the rolling result. To do so, the rolled specimens were also analyzed regarding the influence of the plastic strain path on their mechanical properties, including anisotropy and materials’ strength.},

A novel method is presented, which firstly allows to extract the statistical influence of these conditions on the process curves and its representation via generative models, and secondly represents their influence on the ensemble of curves by transformations of the representation space. A latent variable space is derived from sampled process data, which represents the curves with only few features. Generative models are formed based on conditional propability functions estimated in this space. Furthermore, the influence of conditions on the ensemble of process curves is represented by estimated transformations of the feature space, which map the process curve densities with different conditions on each other. The latent space is formed via Multi-Task-Learning of an auto-encoder and condition-detectors. The latter classifies the latent space representations of the process curves into the considered conditions. The Bayes framework and the Multi-task Learning models are used to obtain the process curve probabilty densities from the latent space densities. The methods are shown to reveal and represent the influence of combinations of workpiece and tool properties on resistance spot welding process curves.},

  abstract     = {Highly complex data streams from in-situ additive manufacturing (AM) monitoring systems are becoming increasingly prevalent, yet finding physically actionable patterns remains a key challenge. Recent AM literature utilising machine learning methods tend to make predictions about flaws or porosity without considering the dynamical nature of the process. This leads to increases in false detections as useful information about the signal is lost. This study takes a different approach and investigates learning a physical model of the laser powder bed fusion process dynamics. In addition, deep representation learning enables this to be achieved directly from high speed videos. This representation is combined with a predictive state space model which is learned in a semi-supervised manner, requiring only the optimal laser parameter to be characterised. The model, referred to as FlawNet, was exploited to measure offsets between predicted and observed states resulting in a highly robust metric, known as the dynamic signature. This feature also correlated strongly with a global material quality metric, namely porosity. The model achieved state-of-the-art results with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under curve (AUC) of 0.999 when differentiating between optimal and unstable laser parameters. Furthermore, there was a demonstrated potential to detect changes in ultra-dense, 0.1% porosity, materials with an ROC AUC of 0.944, suggesting an ability to detect anomalous events prior to the onset of significant material degradation. The method has merit for the purposes of detecting out of process distributions, while maintaining data efficiency. Subsequently, the generality of the methodology would suggest the solution is applicable to different laser processing systems and can potentially be adapted to a number of different sensing modalities.},

The implementation of smart factories represents a leap forward compared to traditional automation. It is underpinned by the deployment of cyberphysical systems that, through the application of Artificial Intelligence, integrate predictive capabilities and foster rapid decision-making. Deep Learning (DL) is a key enabler for the development of smart factories. However, the implementation of DL in smart factories is hindered by its reliance on large amounts of data and extreme computational demand. To address this challenge, Transfer Learning (TL) has been proposed to promote the efficient training of models by enabling the reuse of previously trained models. In this paper, by means of a specific example in aluminium can manufacturing, an empirical study is presented, which demonstrates the potential of TL to achieve fast deployment of scalable and reusable predictive models for Cyber Manufacturing Systems. Through extensive experiments, the value of TL is demonstrated to achieve better generalisation and model performance, especially with limited datasets.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a critical review of laser pyrolysis. Although this technology is almost 60 years old, in literature many researchers, both from academia and industry, are still developing and improving it. On the contrary industrial applications are struggling to take off, if not in very restricted areas, although the technology has undoubted advantages that justify future development. The aim of this work consists in analysing a representative pool of scientific papers (230) and patents (121), from the last 20 years, to have an overview about the evolution of the method and try to understand the efforts spent to improve this technology effectively in academia and in industry. This study is important to provide a complete review about the argument, still missing in the literature. The objective is to provide an overview sufficiently broad and representative in the sources and to capture all the main ways in which laser pyrolysis has been used and with what distribution. The main focuses of the study are the analyses of the functions carried out by laser technologies, the application fields, and the types of used laser (i.e. models, power and fluence). Among the main results, the study showed that the main use of laser pyrolysis is to produce nanoparticles and coatings, the main materials worked by laser pyrolysis are silicon and carbon dioxide and the main searched properties in the products of laser pyrolysis are catalysts activity and electrical conductivity. CO2 lasers are the most used and the have high versatility compared to others. In conclusion, the study showed that laser pyrolysis is a consolidated technology within its main application fields (nanoparticles and coatings) for several years. Within this context, the technology has been developed on very different sizes and processes, obtaining a very wide range of results. Finally, these results may also have stimulated new areas of experimentation that emerged mainly in recent years and which concern biomedical applications, additive manufacturing, and waste disposal.},

Our proposed methods can find an optimal path from a start structure to a single target structure, or optimize the processing paths to one of the equivalent target-structures in the set. In the latter case, the algorithm learns during processing to simultaneously identify the best reachable target structure and the optimal path to it. The proposed methods belong to the family of model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms. They are guided by structure representations as features of the process state and by a reward signal, which is formulated based on a distance function in the structure space. Model-free reinforcement learning algorithms learn through trial and error while interacting with the process. Thereby, they are not restricted to information from a priori sampled processing data and are able to adapt to the specific process. The optimization itself is model-free and does not require any prior knowledge about the process itself. We instantiate and evaluate the proposed methods by optimizing paths of a generic metal forming process. We show the ability of both methods to find processing paths leading close to target structures and the ability of the extended method to identify target-structures that can be reached effectively and efficiently and to focus on these targets for sample efficient processing path optimization.},

  abstract     = {In furtherance of emerging research within smart production planning and control (PPC), this paper prescribes a methodology for the design and development of a smart PPC system. A smart PPC system uses emerging technologies such as the internet of things, big-data analytics tools and machine learning running on the cloud or on edge devices to enhance performance of PPC processes. It achieves this by using a wider range of data sources from the production system, capturing and utilizing the experience of production planners, using analytics and machine learning to harness insights from the data and allowing dynamic and near real-time action to the continuously changing production system. The proposed methodology is illustrated with a case study in a sweets and snacks manufacturing company, to highlight the key considerations and challenges production managers might face during its application. The case further demonstrates considerations for scalability and flexibility via a loosely coupled, service-oriented architecture and the selection of fitting algorithms respectively to address a business requirement for a short-term, multi-criteria and event-driven production planning and control solution. Finally, the paper further discusses the challenges of PPC in smart manufacturing and the importance of fitting smart technologies to planning environment characteristics.},

Monitoring is a key tool for this purpose but the typical AM fast process dynamics and the high data flow required to accurately describe the process are pushing the limits of standard statistical process monitoring (SPM) techniques. The adoption of novel smart data extraction and analysis methods are fundamental to monitor the process with the required accuracy while keeping the computational effort to a reasonable level for real-time application. In this work, a new framework for the detection of defects in metal additive manufacturing processes via in-situ high-speed cameras is presented: a new data extraction method is developed to efficiently extract only the relevant information from the regions of interest identified in the high-speed imaging data stream and to reduce the dimensionality of the anomaly detection task performed by three competitor machine learning classification methods. The defect detection performance and computational speed of this approach is carefully evaluated through computer simulations and experimental studies, and directly compared with the performance and computational speed of other existing methods applied on the same reference dataset. The results show that the proposed method is capable of quickly detecting the occurrence of defects while keeping the high computational speed that would be required to implement this new process monitoring approach for real-time defect detection.},

A central challenge is that production processes are subject to continuous changes such as the manufacturing of new products, with the result that previously trained models may no longer perform well in the process. In this paper, we address this problem and propose a method for continual learning in such predictive quality scenarios. We therefore adapt and extend the memory-aware synapses approach to train an artificial neural network across different product variations. Our evaluation in a real-world regression problem in injection molding shows that the approach successfully prevents the neural network from forgetting of previous tasks and improves the training efficiency for new tasks. Moreover, by extending the approach with the transfer of network weights from similar previous tasks, we significantly improve its data efficiency and performance on sparse data.

Therefore, this study investigates the influence of data acquisition, preprocessing and transformation on the performance of a multiclass support vector machine to classify abrasive wear states during blanking based on force signals. The performance of the model was quantitatively evaluated based on the model accuracy and the separability of the classes. As a result, it was shown, that the deviation of time series represents the key parameter for the resulting performance of the classification model and strongly depends on the sensor type and position, the preprocessing procedure as well as the feature extraction and selection. Furthermore, it is shown that the consideration of domain knowledge in the phases of data acquisition, preprocessing and transformation improves the performance of the classification model and is essential to successfully implement AI projects.

However, acoustic sensor data suffer from strong noise, which can severely limit the accuracy of predictions regarding tool condition. The present work addresses this issue by proposing a novel TCM method that employs only a few appropriate feature parameters of acoustic sensor signals in conjunction with a two-layer angle kernel extreme learning machine. The two-layer network structure is applied to enhance the learning of features associated with complex nonlinear data, and two angle kernel functions without hyperparameters are employed to avoid the complications associated with the use of preset hyperparameters in conventional kernel functions. The proposed TCM method is experimentally demonstrated to achieve superior TCM performance relative to other state-of-the-art methods based on sound sensor data.},

To solve IPPS problems, a hierarchical multistrategy genetic algorithm was developed. To address the multidimensional flexibility of IPPS problems, a chromosome coding method was designed to include a scheduling layer, a process layer, a machine layer, and a logic layer. Multiple crossover operators and mutation operators with polytypic global or local optimization strategies were used during the genetic operation stage to expand the algorithm’s search dimension and maintain the population’s diversity, thereby addressing the problems of population evolution stagnation and premature convergence. The effectiveness of the algorithm was verified by benchmark testing in the example simulation process. The test data show that if the makespan is taken as the optimization target, the proposed genetic algorithm performs better in solving IPPS problems with high complexity. The use of multistrategy genetic operators and logic layer coding makes a significant contribution to the improved performance of the algorithm reported in this paper.},

  abstract     = {The modelling of machining processes by means of machine-learning algorithms is still based on principles that are especially adapted to mechanical approaches, in which very few inputs are varied with little repetition of experimental conditions. These principles might not be ideal to achieve accurate machine-learning models and they are certainly not aligned with the practicalities of industrial machining in factories. In this research the effect of a new strategy to improve machine-learning model accuracy is studied: experimental repetition. Tool-life prediction in the face-turning operations of AISI 1045 steel discs, depending on different cooling systems and tool geometries, is selected as a case study. Both the side rake and the relief angles of HSS tools are optimized using the Brandsma facing test under dry, MQL, and flooding conditions. Different machine-learning algorithms, such as regression trees, kNNs, artificial neural networks, and ensembles (bagging and Random Forest) are tested. On the one hand, the results of the study showed that artificial neural networks of Radial Basis Functions presented the highest model accuracy (11.4 mm RMSE), but required a very sensitive and complex tuning process. On the other hand, they demonstrated that ensembles, especially Random Forest, provided models with accuracy in the same range, but with no tuning procedure (12.8 mm RMSE). Secondly, the effect of an increased dataset size, by means of experimental repetition, is evaluated and compared with traditional experimental modelling that used average values. The results showed that some machine-learning techniques, including both ensemble types, significantly improved their accuracy with this strategy, by up to 23%. The results therefore suggested that the use of raw experimental data, rather than their averaged values, can achieve machine-learning models of higher accuracy for tool-wear processes.},

  abstract     = {The incipient bearing fault diagnosis is crucial to the industrial machinery maintenance. Developed based on the blind source separation, blind source extraction (BSE) has recently become the focus of intensive research work. However, owing to certain industrial restrictions, the number of sensors is usually less than that of the source signals, which is defined as an underdetermined BSE problem to identify the fault signals. The kernelized methods are found to be robust to the noise, especially in the presence of outliers, which makes it a suitable tool to extract fault signatures submerged in the strong environment noise. Thus, this paper proposes a new underdetermined BSE method based on the empirical mean decomposition and kernelized correlation. The experimental results indicate that the extracted fault signature presents more obvious periodicity. Two important parameters of this method, including the multi-shift number and the kernel size are investigated to improve the algorithm performance. Furthermore, performance comparisons with underdetermined BSE based on the second order correlation are made to emphasize the advantage of the presented method. The application of the proposed method is validated using the simulated signal and the rolling element bearing signal of the train vehicle axle.},

  abstract     = {A multistage manufacturing process (MMP) consists of several consecutive process stages, each of which has multiple machines performing the same functions in parallel. A manufacturing path (simply referred to as path) is defined as an ordered set indicating a record of machines assigned to a product at each process stage of an MMP. An MMP usually produces products through various paths. In practice, multiple machines in a process stage have different operational performances, which accumulate during production and affect the quality of products. This study proposes a heuristic approach to derive the golden paths that produce products whose quality exceeds the desired level. The proposed approach consists of the searching phase and the merging phase. The searching phase extracts two types of machine sequence patterns (MSPs) from a path dataset in an MMP. An MSP is a subset of the path that is defined as an ordered set of assigned machines from several process stages. The two extracted types of MSPs are: (1) superior MSP, which affects the production of superior-quality products, and (2) inferior MSP, which affects the production of inferior-quality products, called inferior MSP. The merging phase derives the golden paths by combining superior MSPs and excluding inferior MSPs. The proposed approach is verified by applying it to a hypothetical path dataset and the semiconductor tool fault isolation (SETFI) dataset. This verification shows that the proposed approach derives the golden paths that exceed the predefined product quality level. This outcome demonstrates the practical viability of the proposed approach in an MMP.},

Firstly, frequency spectrum datasets are utilized to remove the redundant information of raw vibration signals. Secondly, the BiGRU network is constructed to generate auxiliary samples that are utilized as source domain. Finally, MEDA, as the most powerful non-deep transfer learning method, is applied to align the distribution of these auxiliary samples generated by BiGRU and the unlabeled samples from target domain.

In the order batching problem, the aim is to find groups of orders and picking routes of these groups to minimize distance travelled by the order picker. This problem is encountered especially in manual order picking systems where the capacity of picking vehicle is limited. Solving the order batching problem becomes more important when the size of the problem (e.g. number of storage locations, number of aisles, number of customer orders, etc.) is large. The content of the batch and picking route affect the retrieval-time of the orders. Therefore, an effective batching and routing approach is essential in reducing the time needed to collect ordered items. The main objective of this study is to develop fast and effective metaheuristic approaches to solve the order batching problem. For this purpose, two genetic algorithm based metaheuristic approaches are proposed. The numerical test of the proposed algorithms is performed with generated data sets. The proposed methods are thought to be useful to solve real-life problems in different warehouse configurations. Accordingly, a real case study is conducted in the distribution center of a well-known retailer in Turkey. The case study includes the storage assignment process of incoming products.

This paper applies a novel p-leader multifractal formalism for chatter detection in milling processes. This novel formalism can discover internal singularities rising on unstable signals due to chatter without prior knowledge of the natural frequencies of the machining system. The p-leader multifractal features are selected by using a multivariate filter method for feature selection, and verified by both numerical simulations and experimental studies with detailed parameter selection discussions when applying this formalism. The proposed method is assessed in terms of their dynamic monitoring abilities and classification accuracies under wide cutting conditions. The results show that the multifractal features can successfully detect chatter with high accuracies and short computation time. For further verification, the proposed method is compared with two commonly-used methods, which indicates that the proposed method gives better classification accuracies, especially when identifying unstable tests.},

  abstract     = {The machining processes on the advanced machining workshop floor are becoming more sophisticated with the interdependent intrinsic processes, generation of ever-increasing in-process data and machining domain knowledge. To manage and utilize those above effectively, an industrial dataspace for machining workshop (IDMW) is presented with a three-layer framework. The IDMW architecture is Schema Centralized–Data Distributed, which relies on Process-Workpiece-Centric knowledge schema description and data storage in decentralized data silos. Subsequently, the pre-processing method for the data silos driven by RFID event graphical deduction model is elaborated to associate decentralized data with knowledge schema. Furthermore, through two industrial case studies, it is found that IDMW is effective in managing heterogeneous data, interconnecting the resource entities, handling domain knowledge, and thereby enabling machining operations control on the machining workshop floor particularly.},

  abstract     = {The electrode state is an important factor affecting the welding quality in the process of resistance spot welding, but there is still lack of an effective method to monitor the electrode wear state. In this paper, a novel online monitoring method of electrode wear state is proposed by exploring the variation pattern of dynamic resistance. The evaluation method of time series similarity is important for dynamic resistance data processing, and two types of evaluation methods including static evaluation method and dynamic evaluation method are proposed in this paper. The static evaluation methods include shape change factor, dynamic resistance decrease ratio and peak time delay, and the dynamic evaluation method refers to the trend change factor. The welding process parameters and the welding material are kept unchanged during the experiment, the newly polished electrode is used to weld 1300 times continuously, and dynamic resistance is collected. According to the results of data processing, the change of the electrode state can be divided into three stages: The electrode state is stable when the welding number is less than 360. When the welding number is in the range of 360–800, the electrode state is in the transition stage, and the electrode state rapidly deteriorates with the increase of the welding number. When the welding number is more than 800, the electrode state is completely deteriorated, and the electrode needs to be dressed. This study may pave the way for online monitoring of electrode wear state.},

  abstract     = {Process parameters of injection molding are the key factors affecting the final quality and the molding efficiency of products. In the traditional automatic setting of process parameters based on case-based reasoning, only the geometric features of molds are considered, which may not be the representative feature of products and cause the reasoning process to fail. This problem of failure manifests itself in that the molding process parameters inferred by the reasoning system may be very different between molds with similar geometric features or very similar between molds with different geometric features. Therefore, this paper proposes a case-based-reasoning method based on molding features in order to overcome this problem by a method of dimensionality reduction, composed of three stages which (1) obtain the injection pressure profile data through actual injection molding or filling simulation analysis, (2) calculate the similarity of the pressure profiles between target case and each of source cases in case database using the nearest neighbor method, and sort according to the value of similarity, (3) find the case with a maximum of similarity out as the one closest to the target case, and take the process parameters of the most similar case as the solution of the target case according to case modification strategies. This method simplifies the high-dimensional molding features to the pressure profile at the injection location with two-dimensional data features. Experiments show that the new method has a high retrieval accuracy and sensitivity. Moreover, even slight differences in molding can be captured easily.},

  abstract     = {The transition to industry 4.0 has impacted factories, but it also affects the entire value chain. In this sense, human-centred factors play a core role in transitioning to sustainable manufacturing processes and consumption. The awareness of human roles in Industry 4.0 is increasing, as evidenced by active work in developing methods, exploring influencing factors, and proving the effectiveness of design oriented to humans. However, numerous studies have been brought into existence but then disconnected from other studies. As a consequence, these studies in industry and research alike are not regularly adopted, and the network of studies is seemingly broad and expands without forming a coherent structure. This study is a unique attempt to bridge the gap through the literature characteristics and lessons learnt derived from a collection of case studies regarding human-centred design (HCD) in the context of Industry 4.0. This objective is achieved by a well-rounded systematic literature review whose special unit of analysis is given to the case studies, delivering contributions in three ways: (1) providing an insight into how the literature has evolved through the cross-disciplinary lens; (2) identifying what research themes associated with design methods are emerging in the field; (3) and setting the research agenda in the context of HCD in Industry 4.0, taking into account the lessons learnt, as uncovered by the in-depth review of case studies.},

This problem is under the umbrella of the assembly line balancing problem in which robots and automated equipment are employed to take on human workers’ roles to form a flexible assembly line. In this review paper, the development and generalisation throughout the time of the RALBP are addressed. To make the review easy to comprehend and effective, the RALBP is first classified based on the types of layouts and then further dividing up according to the 4 M (Man, Machine, Material and Method) concept. The main contributions of different articles are chronologically summarised in the form of a table. Besides, the research contribution precedence diagram is used to illustrate the sequential order and linkage relationship among researches. Finally, from the findings of the review, future research directions are pinpointed and discussed.},
