  abstract     = {Common knowledge, that is, a common understanding of environmental conditions, task objectives, coordination rules, etc., can greatly improve the collaborative efficiency of swarm robots. In many complex task scenarios, it is impossible to assume there is a central facility (e.g., a powerful robot or a back-end server that can communicate effectively with everyone) responsible for maintaining the collective’s common knowledge. Instead, we must maintain it in a decentralized way. Blockchain has been proved to be an effective means of meeting this demand. It can even tolerate malicious or malfunctioning individuals to a certain extent, which is an important capability for swarm robots to operate in an open or hostile environment. However, current widely-accepted Blockchain techniques, such as Ethereum, use the proof-of-work mechanism as the basis of reaching consensus, which has to consume huge computing resources and is not suitable for swarm robots. In this paper, we present a fast and robust solution for maintaining common knowledge in swarm robots based on Hashgraph, a lightweight consensus technology being originally proposed for fully-connected, well-conditioned networks. We successfully improve its kernel mechanisms to adapt it to swarm robots with limited communication capabilities. And we novelly introduce the concept of Ranger Robot, a special kind of robot that can significantly accelerate the formation of consensus in sparsely-distributed or physically-partitioned robot swarms. Furthermore, we design a knowledge validation algorithm to enable the robot swarm to recognize attacks from a special kind of malicious robot called Byzantine robots. The results of a set of experiments based on both simulated and real robots show that our solution can greatly reduce computing overhead and accelerate the formation of consensus in comparison with solutions based on the original Hashgraph.},

  abstract     = {Service robots that operate in human-populated environments are exposed to changes in the environment. Most mobile robot are concerned with portable objects only if there is a risk of colliding with them. However, humans need to keep track of especially personal items - like a cup, glasses, the mobile phone, etc - that can be left at various locations in the living environment. Thus, we think it will be useful if a robot assistant can support a human in keeping track of such item. In this paper, we therefore study the problem of object search (OS) in unknown indoor environments. We present an OS system that relies on semantic information inferred from the changes in the objects’ position over time in the environment, which allows the robot to reduce search costs by giving preference to more promising regions for the target object. Our two-mode OS system gathers data from the objects’ placement by executing its recording mode, which is later used when the robot executes the request mode to search for the target object. We compared the performance of our semantic, temporal OS system with two other search methods in simulation, considering six different scenarios with objects being moved from time to time. Moreover, we also demonstrate our OS system’s efficiency in the HH106 dataset collected over two months containing person occurrences in a residential environment. The experiments in simulation indicate that our semantic, temporal OS system always finds the target object and, in some cases, with the robot travelling a distance two times smaller. The tests with the HH106 enhance our method’s robustness and efficiency in properly estimating the person’s position at different times of the day.},

  abstract     = {Simulation has proven to be a highly effective tool for validating autonomous systems while lowering cost and increasing safety. Currently, several dedicated simulation environments exist, but they are limited in terms of environment size, visual quality, and feature sets. As a result, many researchers have begun to consider repurposing game engines as simulators to take advantage of their greater flexibility, scalability, and graphical fidelity. This study investigates a robotics simulation environment based on the Unity3D game engine and Robot Operating System (ROS) middleware, collectively referred to as ROS-Unity3D, and compares it to the popular ROS-Gazebo robotics simulation environment. They are compared in terms of their architecture, environment creation process, resource usage, and accuracy while simulating an autonomous ground robot in real-time. Overall, with its variety of supported file types and powerful scripting interface for creating custom functionality, ROS-Unity3D is found to be a viable alternative to ROS-Gazebo. Test results indicate that ROS-Unity3D scales better to larger environments, has higher shadow quality, achieves the same or better visual-based SLAM performance, and is more capable of real-time LiDAR simulation than ROS-Gazebo. As for its advantages over ROS-Unity3D, ROS-Gazebo has a more streamlined interface between ROS and Gazebo, has more existing sensor plugins, and is more computer resource efficient for simulating small environments.},

In the proposed approach, each robot maintains the latest estimate of itself and targets, and information exchange only takes place between two robots when they obtain relative measurements of each other. Moreover, we have proved that when CU is used to fuse the target state estimate with the target state estimated by teammate robots, the positive definiteness of the robot and target joint covariance matrix is guaranteed without any calculation of the robot-to-target correlation terms. Finally, simulation and experimental results have shown that the EDMR-SLTT approach is superior to alternative state-of-the-art approaches with comparable processing and communication costs.},

  abstract     = {In reinforcement learning navigation, agent exploration based on intrinsic rewards has uncertainties, including observation, action, and neural network prediction uncertainties, owing to partially observable environments. This causes stagnant exploration, randomizes strategies, and leads to unreasonable intrinsic rewards. This study proposes a spatial consciousness model of intrinsic rewards (SC-modelX) for agent navigation in partially observable environments. In this method, the spatial consciousness state generator not only remembers the historical observation information of the agent but also regresses the current spatial position. In similar scenes that are difficult to identify, the two characteristics suppress the uncertainty of observation and action, respectively. The suppress-uncentainty model was proposed to enhance the input–output relationship of intrinsic rewards to suppress the influence of neural network prediction uncertainties. The experimental results demonstrate that the spatial consciousness model of intrinsic rewards can effectively evaluate the novelty of observations and improve the efficiency of exploration, strategy performance, and convergence speed. The three uncertainties proposed in this paper are complementary to agent exploration in partially observable environment and SC-modelX can effectively improve the agent exploration ability.},

  abstract     = {In real-world environments, ranging from urban disastrous scenes to underground mining tunnels, autonomous mobile robots are being deployed in harsh and cluttered environments, having to deal with perception and communication issues that limit their facilitation for data sharing and coordination with other robots. In these scenarios, mobile robot inference can be used to increase spatial awareness and aid decision-making in order to complete tasks such as navigation, exploration, and mapping. This is advantageous as inference enables robots to plan with predicted information that is otherwise unobservable, thus, reducing the replanning efforts of robots by anticipating future states of both the environment and teammates during execution. While detailed reviews have explored the use of inference during human–robot interactions, to-date none have explored mobile robot inference in unknown environments and with cooperative teams. In this survey paper, we present the first extensive investigation of mobile robot inference problems in unknown environments with limited sensor and communication range and propose a new taxonomy to classify the different environment and task inference methods for single- and multi-robot systems. Furthermore, we identify the open research challenges within this emerging field and discuss future research directions to address them.},

We assume that the agents total sensing resources are a line sensor of predetermined length, which is divided between the swarm’s agents. We propose procedures for designing cooperative sweeping processes that guarantee the detection of all evaders that were inside the original evader region. The task is accomplished by deriving conditions on the sweeping velocity of the agents and their paths, thus ensuring that evaders with a given limit on their velocity are caught. A simpler task for the swarm is the confinement of evaders to their initial domain. The feasibility of completing these tasks depends on geometric and dynamic constraints that impose a lower bound on the pursuers’ velocities. This lower bound ensures the satisfaction of the confinement task. Increasing the velocity above the lower bound enables the sweeper swarm of agents to complete the search task as well. We present results on the total search time as a function of the velocity of the swarm’s agents given the initial conditions on the size of the search region and the evaders’ maximal velocity under limited sensing capabilities of the swarm. The established results provide insights on the practical tradeoffs in designing a multi-agent system, where the alternatives are to deploy a smaller number of sophisticated and expensive agents, or to deploy a larger number of simple, cost-effective agents.},

  abstract     = {Slender robots have received a lot of attention in ruin rescue missions as they are flexible to detect narrow spaces. However, the ability to perform rescue operations is not satisfactory, which is greatly subject to the control performance of the end manipulators. Unfortunately, to adapt to the small ruined environment, the end manipulators of these robots usually lack enough sensors, moreover, the complex and unstable ruined environment further makes them hard to control. To dress this, we use tendon-sheath mechanisms to develop a slender robot with an elastic end gripper. In this paper, we propose a precise control method for the end gripper without output sensory feedback. Firstly, the gripper drive mechanism is simplified as a single tendon-sheath system with a spring load. After that, a tendon-sheath force transmission model is built. On this basis, we propose a force control method for the end gripper, it is composed of model-based friction compensation and adaptive sliding mode control. The transmission model and the force control method are then validated by experiments. The experimental results illustrate that the force transmission model can predict the distal force with high accuracy, the R2 (Coefficient of Determination) is over 0.993 and the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) is below 0.60 N. The force control method can track the desired force precisely, the R2 is over 0.989 and the RMSE is below 0.74 N.},

The HUG is a lightweight, small, modular, and low-cost underwater vehicle. The HUG uses a piston buoyancy system to control buoyancy and pitch angle and two thrusters to control yaw angle. A hybrid control method utilizing both a piston buoyancy system and a pair of horizontal thrusters is proposed. The novelty of this study is: 1) a two-hull design to facilitate modularity and ease of assembly, 2) an effective piston buoyancy and thrusters’ mechanism to reduce the weight and size of the vehicle, and 3) a pitch control method based on equilibrium identification to enables a fixable and convenient parameters selection and reduces model dependence. Experimental results show that the HUG design reduces the thrusters’ disturbance to pitch angle control, and pitch angle control with the hybrid control method has less overshoot compared to the PID controller.},

Against this context, the paper presents an overview on wheeled mobile robot (WMR), which have a central role in nowadays scenario. In particular, the paper describes the most commonly adopted locomotion strategies, perception systems, control architectures and navigation approaches. After having analyzed the state of the art, this paper focuses on the kinematics of three omnidirectional platforms: a four mecanum wheels robot (4WD), a three omni wheel platform (3WD) and a two swerve-drive system (2SWD). Through a dimensionless approach, these three platforms are compared to understand how their mobility is affected by the wheel speed limitations that are present in every practical application. This original comparison has not been already presented by the literature and it can be used to improve our understanding of the kinematics of these mobile robots and to guide the selection of the most appropriate locomotion system according to the specific application.},

The joint torque feedback (JTF) technique is introduced to model the MRM subsystems. The cost function of each subsystem consists of a tracking error fusion function and a term summarizing the RNN identifier errors. The event-triggered Hamiltonian-Jacobi-Bellman (ETHJB) equation is solved by constructing a critic neural network using NDP, and a decentralized optimal tracking control policy under the event-triggered framework can be obtained. The closed-loop MRM system is shown to be uniformly ultimately bounded under the Lyapunov stability theorem. Finally, the experimental results verify that the proposed control method is superior to the time-triggered optimal control policy and the observer-critic-based event-triggered optimal control policy proposed in the previous work of the author.},

A custom multi-rotor equipped with onboard downward facing stereo cameras flies over an unknown environment capturing imagery and reconstructing a height map of the ground surface online. Together with a simple terrain classifier, this height map is used to detect obstacles and estimate navigation costs for a Clearpath Robotics Jackal. Given a user defined goal, an online exploration algorithm automatically directs the aerial vehicle to expand the frontiers of the map until a path for the ground vehicle from the current position to the goal is discovered. Simultaneously, this algorithm directs the ground vehicle to execute partial paths to make progress towards the goal before a complete path has been discovered. Aside from the trajectory execution and the state estimation for the unmanned ground vehicle and the graphical interface for the operator, the online exploration algorithm and reconstruction all run onboard the UAV by taking advantage of the graphics processing unit (GPU) computing capabilities of the Nvidia TX2 for both stereo calculations and map construction. This paper presents the improvements made to an existing multi-robot system, the mapping and exploration algorithms.

Our benchmark is built upon the CARLA simulator, whose back-end is the Unreal Engine rendering a high dynamic scenery simulating the real world. Moreover, we offer 43 datasets for Autonomous Ground Vehicles (AGVs) reliability assessment, including scenarios for scene understanding evaluation like accidents, along with a wide range of frame quality based on a dynamic weather simulation class integrated with our APIs. We also introduce the first calibration targets to CARLA maps to solve the unknown distortion parameters problem of CARLA simulated DVS and RGB cameras. Furthermore, we propose a novel pre-processing layer that eases the integration of DVS sensor events in any frame-based Visual-SLAM system.

This problem of self-adjustment can be addressed by soft robotic grippers. In the past few decades, new methods, and techniques to develop and control soft actuators have been explored by researchers worldwide. Soft robotic grippers can be categorized into three technologies which are controlled actuation, controlled adhesion, and controlled stiffness. Using these three technologies soft robots can mimic the morphology of the gripping and locomotion mechanisms of various animals. This study is aimed to present an introductory review for researchers who want to explore the field of soft robotics. While previous reports focussed on granular jamming structures to control stiffness, the present study emphasized laminar jamming structures and discussed the recent soft actuators developed using these structures. It was observed that soft actuators with a longitudinal strain like mckibben and peano HASEL exert high forces compared to bending actuators. Also, sandwiched laminar jammers can generate greater stiffness compared to homogeneous laminar jammers.},

  abstract     = {Delivery drones have always faced challenges when it comes to reliably deliver packages. This paper introduces a novel concept of a hybrid drone called “MICOPTER” to alleviate this issue. Being able to fly in three modes of aircraft, helicopter, and gyrocopter, the proposed model of the multi-identity helicopter comprises a 2DOF tilting mechanism of rotors and a folding wing system leading to better performance and controllability. To scrutinize the idea, MICOPTER is compared to other types of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in terms of different performance parameters. The performance goal of the MICOPTER is the realization of a predetermined standard delivery drone mission based on Amazon Prime Air. According to the relevant literature, the corresponding conceptual design equations are formulated and the traditional matching diagram method is utilized to attain the initial design point. Afterward, a multidisciplinary-feasible design matrix is provided as well as multi-objective optimization to strive for optimal feasible configurations while maximizing cruise velocity and range. Furthermore, the configuration and performance of some of the feasible design points on the final Pareto frontier are compared with the traditional design. Finally, by simulating a typical flight profile and using robust non-linear backstepping control, the controllability of the proposed configuration is investigated. The controller performance is assessed considering its stability and tracking 8-shape trajectory. Results indicate the MICOPTER capabilities as a novel configuration in both terms of design performance and controllability.},

Therefore, multi-intelligent agents’ organic coordination and cross-domain collaboration will lead to a new paradigm of future robotics and applications.

  abstract     = {The vibration isolation control for wheel-legged robot has been widely investigated when adapting to the undulating slope terrain. How to solve the lag problem of low accuracy of foot-end force convergence to fixed target force in traditional impedance control under continuously changing slope terrain is the main challenge. In this paper, a vibration isolation control strategy based on variable target force impedance control (VTFIC) is proposed to effectively realize the foot-end contact force to track the target force under uneven road while maintaining the stability of the body. The strategy includes foot-end disturbance force estimator (FDFE) and force convergence accelerating controller (FCAC). Firstly, FDFE includes slope angle model, slope terrain model, autoregressive comprehensive moving average (ARIMA) model and event-triggering mechanism. It is mainly used to predict and calculate the disturbance force of slope terrain, and solve the problem of high deviation between foot-end actual force and target force caused by the impulse when foot contact with slope. Secondly, FCAC is designed based on power functional feed-forward control, to accelerate the convergence speed of the foot-end contact force to the target force. Finally, the simulation and experiment results show that the foot-end contact force of the robot can effectively track the target force with high accuracy and the robot remains stable under various terrains.},

  abstract     = {In this contribution, order reduction of self-balanced-bicycle-robot (SBBR) controller is proposed by incorporating rank-order-centroid (ROC) based method utilizing grey-wolf-optimizer. The higher-order (HO) SBBR controller system is approximated by minimizing the errors between time-moments (TMs) and Markov-parameters (MPs) of HO SBBR system and desired approximated-model. The minimization of errors are accomplished by framing the weighted objective function utilizing TMs and MPs. The weights are associated with the weighted objective function. These weights are determined by systematic procedure of ROC based method. The main orientation of this proposal is to ascertain the associated weights in a systematic manner exploiting ROC method by providing the appropriate importance to effect-on-steady-state response and effect-on-transient response for SBBR controller based robotic application. The minimization of weighted objective function is done for the determination of unknown coefficients of approximant with the help of grey-wolf-optimizer. The optimization is done by employing matching of first TMs of the HO system and approximated-model ensuring the steady-state-matching. In this approximation, the stability of desired approximant is also ensured with the help of Hurwitz stability criterion. The obtained approximant is compared with already available controller models for SBBR in the literature. The step and impulse along with error and Bode responses are plotted to show the efficacy and productiveness of proposed method. The time-domain-analysis and performance-error-criterion-analysis are also provided in the support of proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {The success of the physical therapy and rehabilitation depends on mostly the continuity of the exercises. The best way to ensure this continuity is to perform the exercises at home instead of therapy centers. At present, many of the rehabilitation devices including robots are not available to use at homes due to their high costs. Considering this fact, a low-cost and portable wrist rehabilitation robot (POWROBOT) that can be used both at home and physical therapy centers is manufactured in this study. Thus, more patients will be able to access rehabilitation robots and continue their treatment in the comfort of their home. It is expected that there will be an acceleration in the recovery of physically disabled patients with the increase in the use of the proposed rehabilitation robot at home. Force measurements are obtained from force sensors which constitutes a significant part of the robot price in general. Therefore, a low cost three-degree-of-freedom practical force sensor unit is also manufactured for human–robot interaction during rehabilitation. Pronation/supination, radial/ulnar deviation and flexion/extension movement experiments are performed in order to illustrate performance of the proposed portable wrist rehabilitation robot. Passive, active-assistive and active exercise methods are used for all of these movements. Experiments are guided with a human–machine interface software and managed by a microcontroller with an embedded program. Finally, the results of the experiments are evaluated separately for each exercise type and, presented in figures and tables. These results reveal clearly the feasibility of the proposed robot according to manufacturing based design approaches.},

  abstract     = {The application of lower limb exoskeletons for gait assistance has attracted extensive attention in recent decades. Reference trajectory and assistive control are the important aspects determining the performance of the exoskeleton. During overground walking, there are certain variations in touchdown position, step length and time as subjects have the requirement of adjusting gait pattern to maintain balance. In order to adapt to the different starting and ending foot location on the swing phase of gait, in this study, a dynamic movement primitives (DMPs)-based gait trajectory generation method is proposed to provide a flexible manner to online adjust the reference trajectory. Meanwhile, a time-independent path-based trajectory controller is developed to exert the assistance and guidance for the swing leg motion, where a lookahead distance is employed to search for the desired angular position in 4D hip-knee joint space. The combination of DMP-based reference generation and path-based trajectory control enables lower limb exoskeletons to reduce gait trajectory deviation while still allowing subjects’ own effort to change the gait pattern. Simulations and experiments involving five healthy subjects walking on level ground with a commercial lower limb exoskeleton, were conducted to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results showed that the exoskeleton assistance improved subjects’ leg movement performance, and did not limit subjects’ active effort to adjust step length and time.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are aircraft that can be manually operated or autonomously guided through an autopilot. In the last case, the system is responsible for stabilising the aircraft and executing guidance tasks such as path-following. In literature, several path-following algorithms were proposed for straight lines and loiter paths. Previous comparisons generally consider straight line algorithms in a 2D space using the kinematic model of an aircraft. In order to complement existing research, this paper compares four 3D path-following algorithms for loiter paths under different wind intensities. Tests are made through Software-in-the-Loop (SiL) simulations using the dynamic model of a fixed-wing UAV. Furthermore, a genetic algorithm is employed to tune the parameters and the analysis is carried out under varying wind conditions. The algorithms compared are four well-known geometric methods: Carrot-Chasing (CC), Non-Linear Guidance Law (NLGL), Pure Pursuit and Line-of-Sight (PLOS) and Vector Field (VF). Results show that Vector Field has the smallest errors, while PLOS is the most resistant to wind disturbance.},

  abstract     = {Urban locomotion is a challenge for individuals with lower limb impairment or any other conditions that inhibit ambulation. While wheelchairs are the absolute choice, they do not address the entire problem of accessibility in urban locomotion despite the use of actuators. One of the viable prospects has been demonstrated by Stair Climbing Wheelchairs (SCW), which rely on different modes of mechanism to traverse the staircase. Since staircases are the most common and one of the challenging elements of the urban setting, these wheelchairs are supposed to sufficiently address the problems of the terrain. However, several technical and psychological shortcomings hinder a wider practical use. This paper discusses semi-autonomous tracked SCW and introduces a novel kinematic mechanism design that facilitates successful switching of the mode of locomotion and autonomous pose adjustment with the changing terrain. To execute the intended task of pose estimation/adjustment and variable locomotion, an algorithm that combines multiple sensor data with the kinematic model has been developed. The developed prototype was tested in a loaded condition in staircases of different gradients. The experimental results suggest that the system addresses a plethora of issues mentioned in the literature, considering the factors of accessibility and safety. Also, this paper has highlighted the requirement of vibration suppression for user comfort, promoting technological acceptance and adaptation.},

In this paper, we propose a sensing network based on the fusion of multi-information to obtain scene semantic information and employ it to realize risk assessment. However, due to the influence of light on the image information sensed by RGB cameras, it is not easy to obtain accurate scene semantic information. We apply a depth camera and a thermal imager to obtain depth and infrared information to enhance the RGB images. We build a risk information database and use it to quantify the obtained scene semantic information into risk factors. The dynamic change of risk factors judges whether the distance between humans and robots is safe. The experimental results verify that the algorithm of intelligent human-robot monitoring can realize the analysis of dangerous situations and control the robot system, thereby reducing the number of false shutdowns and improving safety.},

In the details, the proposed solution relies on a Task and Motion Planning approach based on a two-level architecture: the high-level is a Task Planner aimed at finding the optimal objects sequence to relocate, according to a metric based on the objects weight; the low-level is a Motion Planner in charge of planning the end-effector path for reaching the specific objects taking into account the robot physical constraints. The high-level task planner is a Reinforcement Learning agent, trained using the information coming from the low-level Motion Planner. In this work we consider the Q-Tree algorithm, which is based on a dynamic tree structure inspired by the Q-learning technique. Three different RL-policies with two kinds of tree exploration techniques (Breadth and Depth) are compared in simulation scenarios with different complexity. Moreover, the proposed learning methods are experimentally validated in a real scenario by adopting a KINOVA Jaco $$^{2}$$ 7-DoFs robot manipulator.},

Due to the complex and cluttered environment, i.e., many obstacles under the forest canopy, it is quite challenging to achieve full coverage search using fully autonomous MAVs, e.g., quadrotors. In this work, we propose a two-stage multi-MAV forest search strategy. The first batch of MAVs provides a coarse search and mapping result using pre-defined or auto-generated paths. Based on that, the second batch of MAVs continues to search the multiple isolated regions missed by the first batch. The main difficulties fall in the autonomous task allocation and optimal cooperative coverage path planning for the second batch of MAVs, to achieve the full coverage goal. To address this problem, a task allocation algorithm based on the branch and bound principle is introduced to find the optimal search order of the missed regions. Furthermore, an optimal coverage path planning algorithm considering obstacle avoidance is proposed to cover each region. Simulation results show that our proposed method improves the efficiency of coverage path planning for cooperative search and guarantees full area coverage.},

  abstract     = {Robot global localization is a significant and challenging problem. The popular filter-based methods such as Monte Carlo Localization (MCL), which cover the entire state space with particles, have the problem of high computational cost especially in large-scale environments. In this paper, we propose a deep hierarchical framework for robot 2D global localization, which mainly includes coarse localization and fine localization. The coarse localization takes the RGB image as the input, and it provides an initial probability distribution by using CNN and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based deep network. CNN learns suitable feature representations while LSTM is used for structural dimension reduction and feature association. For fine localization, we present a method combining fast branch-and-bound scan matching (FBBS) and MCL, which takes the pointcloud of LiDAR sensor as the input. FBBS quickly narrows the possible range of actual pose through finding the best match between the laser scan and map. Finally, the precise localization is realized by means of MCL. Finally, we used the Microsoft 7Scenes dataset and the Cambridge Landmarks dataset to evaluate our coarse localization method. It achieves an average accuracy of 0.191 m and 7.96∘ on 7Scenes dataset, and it achieves an average accuracy of 1.17 m and 4.10∘ on Cambridge Landmarks dataset. And the global localization experiments on a real robot shows that our success rate reaches up to 98%. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, our framework can achieve faster convergence and more accurate estimation.},

  abstract     = {The role of transportation in the economic process is central. Transportation’s benefits, however, can be dampened because of its environmental and social cost. A central question then arises as to the degre of sustainability of a national transportation system. In the present paper we develop a mathematical model to define and assess national transportation sustainability. The model relies on a number of indicators encompassing environmental impact, efficiency, safety, and economic contributions. Statistical data manipulations and fuzzy multistage reasoning result in an overall sustainability index over [0, 1]. A sensitivity analysis uncovers those indicators with the highest potential for improving transportation sustainability. Thirty European countries are ranked and the most important indicators for each country are pinpointed. It is demonstrated that greatest improvement will be achieved with the reduction of passenger car use, road freight transportation, and fatal accidents. Counterintuitively, Norway, Austria, Denmark, and Luxembourg rank at the bottom of the list together with Bulgaria, Greece, and Malta. This is due to their poor environmental performance and their small sustainability progress over 2010–2020.},

  abstract     = {This research is inspired by the challenge of providing situational awareness to a ship looking for leads in the ice to navigate the Canadian Arctic. To address this challenge, this paper proposes piecewise-deterministic quasi-static simultaneous localization and mapping (PDQS-SLAM). PDQS-SLAM relaxes the static assumption that is inherent to traditional SLAM algorithms by incorporating landmark kinematic motion models in the graph construction. It then generalizes to more complex dynamic environments by detecting inevitable disruptions to the landmark’s motion model. This is achieved by augmenting the definition of a loop closure factor to include a state, governed by a finite state machine, that captures the edge’s behaviour over time. Simulations and laboratory experiments demonstrate that the localization and mapping errors of PDQS-SLAM in a dynamic environment with mobile landmarks that experience changes in their motion model were similar to the baseline static SLAM in a static environment. This represents a capability that is needed for persistent autonomous operations in complex environments populated with slowly-evolving landmarks, such as the Canadian marine Arctic.},

  abstract     = {In recent research works, morphing wings were studied as an interesting field for a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The previous studies either focused on selecting suitable material for the morphing wings or performing experimental tests on UAVs with morphing wings. Though, the dynamic modeling of active flexible morphing wings and their involved interactions with the aerodynamics of the UAV body are challenging subjects. Using such a model to control a small UAV to perform specific maneuvering is not investigated yet. The dynamic model of UAV with active morphing wings generates a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system which rises the difficulty of the control system design. In this paper, the aeroelastic dynamic model of morphing wing activated by piezocomposite actuators is established using the finite element method and modal decomposition technique. Then, the dynamic model of the UAV is developed taking into consideration the coupling between the wing and piezocomposite actuators, as well as the dynamic properties of the morphing actuators with the aerodynamic wind disturbances. A model predictive control (MPC) is designed for the MIMO control system to perform specific flight maneuvering by tracking desired trajectories of UAV altitude and yaw angle. Additionally, the MPC achieves constrained behavior of pitch and roll angles to get satisfactory UAV motion. Also, the behaviors of the UAV control system using MPC are evaluated after adding Dryden wind turbulence to the UAV outputs. Finally, a UAV flight simulation is conducted which shows that the control system successfully rejects the applied disturbances and tracks the reference trajectories with acceptable behavior of pitch and roll angles.},

This paper provides a novel study focused on the human aspects involved in industrial HRC by exploring the effects of various HRC setting factors. In particular, this paper aims at investigating the impact of industrial HRC on user experience, affective state, and stress, assessed through both subjective measures (i.e., questionnaires) and objective ones (i.e., physiological signals). A collaborative assembly task was implemented with different configurations, in which the robot movement speed, the distance between the operator and the robot workspace, and the control of the task execution time were varied. Forty-two participants were involved in the study and provided feedbacks on interaction quality and their affective state. Participants’ physiological responses (i.e., electrodermal activity and heart rate) were also collected non-invasively to monitor the amount of stress generated by the interaction. Analysis of both subjective and objective responses revealed how the configuration factors considered influence them. Robot movement speed and control of the task execution time resulted to be the most influential factors. The results also showed the need for customization of HRC to improve ergonomics, both psychological and physical, and the well-being of the operator.},

Yet humans rarely require long periods of training to perform well on novel tasks, such as computer games, once they are provided with an accurate program of instructions. We used perceptual control theory (PCT) to construct a simple closed-loop model which requires no training samples and training time within a video game study using the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE). The model was programmed to parse inputs from the environment into hierarchically organised perceptual signals, and it computed a dynamic error signal by subtracting the incoming signal for each perceptual variable from a reference signal to drive output signals to reduce this error. We tested the same model across three different Atari games Breakout, Pong and Video Pinball to achieve performance at least as high as DRL paradigms, and close to good human performance. Our study shows that perceptual control models, based on simple assumptions, can perform well without learning. We conclude by specifying a parsimonious role of learning that may be more similar to psychological functioning.},

Although passive robot localization is a mature field, it still could fail in challenging environments containing symmetries or open spaces. Active localization can fix this issue by allowing the robot to improve pose estimation by choosing specific actions. We propose an active localization strategy for the indoor position tracking problem in challenging environments. The proposed active localization is performed in three steps: (i) cluster the particle cloud with Spectral Clustering (or Kmeans $$++$$ ) algorithm, (ii) search and select the most informative point in a reduced search space, and (iii) execute rotational actions in order to sense the selected point. Hence, a significant number of wrong hypotheses are pruned. We also introduce a novel study that considers evaluates points in spatial neighborhoods all at once, instead of evaluating each cell independently. Simulated experiments show an improvement in robot pose estimation using the proposed strategy. Real-world validation in symmetric and open office-like environment is also presented.},

  abstract     = {Long-distance, high latency teleoperation tasks are difficult, highly stressful for teleoperators, and prone to over-corrections, which can lead to loss of control. At higher latencies, or when teleoperating at higher vehicle speed, the situation becomes progressively worse. To explore potential solutions, this research work investigates two 2D visual feedback-based assistive interfaces (sliding-only and sliding-and-zooming windows) that apply simple but effective video transformations to enhance teleoperation. A teleoperation simulator that can replicate teleoperation scenarios affected by high and adjustable latency has been developed to explore the effectiveness of the proposed assistive interfaces. Three image comparison metrics have been used to fine-tune and optimise the proposed interfaces. An operator survey was conducted to evaluate and compare performance with and without the assistance. The survey has shown that a 900ms latency increases task completion time by up to 205% for an on-road and 147% for an off-road driving track. Further, the overcorrection-induced oscillations increase by up to 718% with this level of latency. The survey has shown the sliding-only video transformation reduces the task completion time by up to 25.53%, and the sliding-and-zooming transformation reduces the task completion time by up to 21.82%. The sliding-only interface reduces the oscillation count by up to 66.28%, and the sliding-and-zooming interface reduces it by up to 75.58%. The qualitative feedback from the participants also shows that both types of assistive interfaces offer better visual situational awareness, comfort, and controllability, and significantly reduce the impact of latency and intermittency on the teleoperation task.},

This paper firstly proposes a unified framework for scale force control (SFC) of human-bearing augmentation exoskeleton (HBAE) and robot-bearing augmentation exoskeleton (RBAE). Furthermore, a mid-level SFC method was proposed, in the light of both cognitive and physical HRIs (cHRI and pHRI). On this basis, a hybrid low-level controller was designed for load-carrying exoskeletons (LCEs). Finally, the proposed method was simulated on an LCE. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our SFC approach: the pilot is always provided with an arbitrary scaled-down interaction force, regardless of the load state.},

But precision-restricted sensors carried by micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) lead to measurement error and sensor noise, the localization accuracy under this condition needs to be further improved. The random movement of the non-cooperative target further increases the difficulty of accurate localization. In this paper, considering observation noise and error, a multi-view vision-based cooperative target geo-localization method is proposed. This method estimates the target’s position end-to-end using Interactive Multi-Model Unscented Kalman Filter (IMM-UKF) through the multi-view observation of the target from UAVs. The initial state of the filter is calculated by intersection localization algorithm. Compared with other state-of-the-art cooperative localization methods, simulation and flight experiments show that the proposed cooperative localization method can effectively improve the accuracy of vision-based target geo-localization.},

  abstract     = {In railway transportation, the information is provided in literature and graphic styles. Generally, quite a lot information can not be obtained directly from the images. As a result, an artificial intelligence system, which can obtain information and perceive the environment, has to be established. In the driving equipment monitoring system, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis and utilization of the multiple monitoring data. This paper briefly introduces the research ideas and optimization directions of image-based data acquiring, such as template matching, support vector machine (SVM), and convolutional neural network (CNN) from the perspective of image detection. Then the characteristics, application scenarios, and possible future research directions of these three types of algorithms are compared and analyzed.},

Even well-developed cities contains obstacles that make the navigation of these agents without a human assistance infeasible. Therefore, it is primordial that they be able to restore dynamically their own balance when subject to certain types of external disturbances. Thereby, this article contributes with a implementation of a Push Recovery controller that improves the walking engine’s performance used by a simulated humanoid agent from RoboCup 3D Soccer Simulation League environment. This work applies Proximal Policy Optimization in order to learn a movement policy in this simulator. Our learned policy was able to surpass the baselines with statistical significance.

  abstract     = {This paper considers persistent monitoring of environmental phenomena using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The objective is to generate periodic dynamically feasible UAV trajectories that minimize the estimation uncertainty at a set of points of interest in the environment. We develop an optimization algorithm that iterates between determining the observation periods for a set of ordered points of interest and optimizing a continuous UAV trajectory to meet the required observation periods and UAV dynamics constraints. The interest-point visitation order is determined using a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), followed by a greedy optimization algorithm to determine the number of observations that minimizes the maximum steady-state eigenvalue of a Kalman filter estimator. Given the interest-point observation periods and visitation order, a minimum-jerk trajectory is generated from a bi-level optimization, formulated as a convex quadratically constrained quadratic program. The resulting B-spline trajectory is guaranteed to be feasible, meeting the observation duration, maximum velocity and acceleration, region enter and exit constraints. The feasible trajectories outperform existing methods by achieving comparable observability at up to 47% higher travel speeds, resulting in lower maximum estimation uncertainty.},

Current methods do not consider the objective priority and its change during the task, making a robot have a hard time or even fail to learn a good policy. In this work, we develop a novel Adaptive Hierarchical Curriculum to guide the robot to learn manipulation tasks with multiple prioritized objectives. Our method determines the objective priorities during the learning process and updates the learning sequence of the objectives to adapt to the changing priorities at different phases. A smooth transition function is developed to mitigate the effects on the learning stability when updating the learning sequence. The proposed method is validated in a multi-objective manipulation task with a JACO robot arm in which the robot needs to manipulate a target with obstacles surrounded. The simulation and physical experiment results show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods with a 92.5% success rate in 40 tests and on average takes 36.4% less time to finish the task.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs) commonly called drones are relatively new entrants to the airspace. The regulatory agencies, numerous States and entities are involved in creation of the safe integration with manned aviation. The so-called U-space concept announced by the European Commission is one of the approaches to achieve that goal. There is also known concept of Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) – a tool which would enable the services needed for safe conduct of UAV flights in generally accessible airspace. There are quite a few European projects which focuses on testing UTM capabilities in order to find a solution which could enable the market and ensure safe UAV operations. One of those systems is PansaUTM – which was developed in order to coordinate drone flights in different types of airspace in Poland. The first part of the paper will present an example of the implementation of this system as a foundation for new possible applications of drones and increasing number of operations. The conclusion of the first part of the article is that, in line rapid growth of UAS flights and different applications of drone services, the European drone ecosystem should evolve even further to deploy very complex drone operations in scalable manner. In order to accommodate unmanned air taxi operations, cargo flights, medical cargo flights, automatic surveillance flights, etc. Europe is preparing towards deployment of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM). The second part of the text indicate the possibility of extensive use of drones in medical logistics as well as minimizing the epidemiological risk as a result of the use of this mean of transport. At the same time, it should be stressed out that the medical transport using drones can be used in urgent situations, where the main variable that has an impact on the success of life and health saving is the breaking of barriers to reaching difficult-to-reach places. In addition, the development of transport using drones can have a lasting impact on improving the quality of life of chronically ill patients who experience severe disease recurrence and thus on the need to implement emergency prevention or treatment measures. The second part of the article focuses as well on the U-space concept as an opportunity for UAVs to be widely used in the field of day-to-day supplies as well as health-related supplies. In the context of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus, drones may be used to provide diagnostic screening tests, medicinal products and septic materials, transport of samples of biological material, as well as an information campaign on how to deal with an epidemic, quarantine or isolation at home. The use of UAV for medical supplies is economically and legally justified. The U-space environment from the operational and regulatory side is a multidisciplinary approach that requires the interaction of aviation, law, medicine, robotics, mechatronics and engineering experts. The legal framework for the development of U-space should be taken into account, as well as sector-specific regulations taking into account the principles of the use of drones in strictly defined areas, including in the process of medical supply, and liability for damage caused by UAV medical supply or AI-controlled intelligent machines.},

  abstract     = {Services that exploit Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) are poised to revolutionise the service industry with a projected value of 71 BUSD by the end of the decade. A key enabler of this technology is the unlocking of autonomous Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) operations. BVLOS operations will depend on a robust Detect and Avoid (D&amp;A) capability. Yet, currently in the UK and EU, BVLOS operations are only allowed in specific cases and scenarios. As a result, the technological landscape for the development of robust D&amp;A faces limitations, and there is little market incentive for development. Furthermore, while automated BVLOS is a future technology, a strong D&amp;A capability is of importance now for all types of UAS operations. As the remote pilot has to deal with information overload from the controller device and the environment. These high-risk UAS operations are becoming more common. In this paper, we discuss the current legal framework in the UK making comparisons to EU countries. We make the case that even when an operation abides by the current framework the remote pilot is exposed to several legal liabilities. We review the roadmaps for UAS adoption (including certification processes for UAS-based products) and highlight that for software-intensive systems, key steps are missing to assure the quality of the product. Finally, we build on these findings to set forwards a path to complement future certification processes to enable autonomous based UAS operations to share the airspace with remotely piloted operations.},

To overcome this deficiency, a novel adaptive NDI control approach based on the L1 adaptive structure, called L1 Adaptive Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (L1-ANDI), is presented, which can guarantee the desired dynamic performance while overcoming the influence of disturbances and uncertainties. In particular, the introduction of a low-pass filter makes the L1-ANDI control realize the decoupling of fast adaptation and robustness. Furthermore, the effect of CG variations on the aircraft is analyzed from the aerodynamic perspective, and the L1-ANDI-based flight controller is designed to eliminate the influence of the CG variations. A series of simulation results demonstrate that the designed flight controller can achieve satisfactory performance and is robust to the disturbance of CG sudden variations.},

  abstract     = {Integrity monitoring (IM) in autonomous navigation has been extensively researched, but currently available solutions are mainly applicable to specific algorithms and sensors, or limited by linearity or &#39;Gaussianity&#39; assumptions. This study investigates a Solution Separation (SS) based framework for universal IM, scalable to multi-sensor fusion as each hypothesis assumes a whole sensor measurement set as faulty. Architecturally we consider that: 1) multi sensor systems must account for various sensor noise models which lead to inconsistent estimates of uncertainties, 2) a module must be able to detect sensor failure or sensor noise mismodeling and suggest better bounds for the error, without being constantly conservative, 3) some algorithms are computationally heavy to monitor in the SS setting or the provided covariances cannot be interpreted in IM. A hybrid SS architecture can be practical, where some solutions are evaluated with a navigation algorithm with known characteristics, although the all-sensor-in solution is evaluated with the monitored algorithm. Experiments are run on filter and smoothing-based navigation algorithms. In addition, we experiment with hybrid SS monitoring and time-correlated noise to evaluate the appropriability of our framework in the context of the above-mentioned requirements. This is a novel framework in the IM domain, directly integrable in existing navigation solutions and, in our opinion, it will facilitate the quantification of the effect of different sensors in navigation safety.},

Due to this a user may have limited to the usage of such devices within set rehabilitation sessions as opposed to a continual usage. The purpose of this review is therefore to find which actuator implementations would be most suitable for a simplistic, low-cost powered orthoses capable of assisting those with pathologic gait disorders by collating literature from Web of Science, Scopus, and Grey Literature. In this systematic review paper 127 papers were selected from these databases via the PRISMA guidelines, with the financial costs of 25 actuators discovered with 11 distinct actuator groups identified. The review paper will consider a variety of actuator implementations used in existing lower-limb exoskeletons that are specifically designed for the purpose of rehabilitating or aiding those with conditions inhibiting natural movement abilities, such as electric motors, hydraulics, pneumatics, cable-driven actuators, and compliant actuators. Key attributes such as technical simplicity, financial cost, power efficiency, size limitations, accuracy, and reliability are compared for all actuator groups. Statistical findings show that rotary electric motors (which are the most common actuator type within collated literature) and compliant actuators (such as elastic and springs) would be the most suitable actuators for a low-cost implementation. From these results, a possible actuator design will be proposed making use of both rotary electric motors and compliant actuators.},

In spaces with limited environmental cues, random-like search is an effective approach as it allows the robot to perform online coverage of environments using simple algorithm designs. One way to generate random-like scanning search is to use nonlinear dynamical systems to impart chaos into the searching robot’s controller. This will result in the generation of unpredictable yet deterministic trajectories, allowing designers to control the system and achieve a high scanning coverage of an area. However, the unpredictability comes at the cost of increased coverage time and a lack of scalability, both of which have been ignored by the state-of-the-art chaotic path planners. This work introduces a new, scalable technique that helps a robot to steer away from the obstacles and cover the entire search space in a short period of time. The technique involves coupling and manipulating two chaotic systems to reduce the coverage time and enable scanning of unknown environments with different online properties. Using this new technique resulted in an average 49% boost in the robot’s performance compared to the state-of-the-art planners. The overall search performance of the chaotic planner remained comparable to optimal systems while still ensuring unpredictable paths.},

To solve the issues of inputs constraint and partial communication blocked between the leader and the followers, a novel consensus-based model predictive control scheme with optimized line-of-sight guidance is proposed. A desired optimal heading is generated by the line-of-sight guidance with reference governor, which is instrumented to compensate for the lack of actuator in sway direction. The reference governor is employed to prescribe the increment of desired optimal heading by balancing the line-of-sight guidance law and current heading. The information from the leader and neighbors is integrated using graph theory based on consensus scheme, which reduces the dependency of the leader compared to traditional leader-follower formation methods. The relative distances between followers are used to design state constraints for collision avoidance. Meanwhile, when the communication between the leader and the followers is partially blocked, the proposed controller can still generate the optimal control inputs and guarantee the formation tracking performance relying on the neighbors’ state.

  abstract     = {We propose semi-autonomous control strategies to assist in the teleoperation of mobile robots under unstable communication conditions. A short-term autonomous control system is the assistance in the semi-autonomous control strategies, when the teleoperation is compromised. The short-term autonomous control comprises of lateral and longitudinal functions. The lateral control is based on an artificial potential field method where obstacles are repulsive, and a route is attractive. LiDAR-based artificial potential field methods are well studied. We present a novel artificial potential field method based on color and depth images. Benefit of a camera system compared to a LiDAR is that a camera detects color, is cheaper, and does not have moving parts. Moreover, utilization of active sensors is not desired in the particle accelerator environment. A set of experiments with a robot prototype are carried out to validate this system. The experiments are carried out in an environment which mimics the accelerator tunnel environment. The difficulty of the teleoperation is altered with obstacles. Fully manual and autonomous control are compared with the proposed semi-autonomous control strategies. The results show that the teleoperation is improved with autonomous, delay-dependent, and control-dependent assist compared to the fully manual control. Based on the operation time, control-dependent assist performed the best, reducing the time by 12% on the tunnel section with most obstacles. The presented system can be easily applied to common industrial robots operating e.g. in warehouses or factories due to hardware simplicity and light computational demand.},

  abstract     = {Deep reinforcement learning has been widely studied in many fields of robotics. However, the application of the algorithm is seriously restricted by its low convergence efficiency. Although demonstration information can effectively improve the convergence speed, relying too much on demonstration information will reduce the training effect in the real environment and make the convergence effect worse. In addition, historical information should also be considered, as it will affect the utilization efficiency of information and convergence effect of the algorithm. However, there are few studies on this part at present. This paper proposes an improved reinforcement learning algorithm, which introduces the demonstration information utilization mechanism and LSTM network based on the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm(PPO). Demonstration information is introduced to provide a priori knowledge base for robots, and a utilization mechanism for demonstration information is established to balance the utilization of teaching information and interactive information. So that the data efficiency can be improved. In addition, we reconstruct the network structure in deep reinforcement learning to introduce historical information. Experimental results show that the method is feasible. Compared with the existing solutions, our method significantly improves the convergence effect of robot autonomous learning.},

Specifically, a network manager (NM) is utilized that considers UAV requests (including start/target locations) and addresses inherent mobility uncertainties using a linear-Gaussian system, to compute efficient and safe trajectories. Through the proposed framework, a family of mathematical programming problems is derived to compute control profiles for both distributed and centralized implementations.

This robot is featured with accurate and fast force regeneration. Force feedback is derived from small scale dampers in this robot, and these dampers are designed with two advantages, high torque accuracy and fast torque response. Different from other work, magnetic reluctance, magnetic field intensity, and low inertia were specially considered during the design of the magnetorheological fluid based damper. A magnetic field simulation verified the correctness of our magnetic field design and model. In addition, an accurate torque model and compensation model for the damper incorporating factors from magnetic field and mechanical property of magnetorheological fluid were proposed. Then, the dampers were manufactured and a prototype of master device was assembled . A series of experiments demonstrated that the damper had superior torque accuracy and fast response time.

A theoretical model is established to predict the relationship between the bending angle and pressure of the actuator. The single finger bending experiment is carried out to verify the theoretical model. The capability of variable gripping size of the soft gripper has been proofed, which has increased the gripping size range from 84 to 141 mm.

Firstly, in sight of the influence of the shape of the farmland, the minimum turning radius of the harvesting robot, the distribution of the unloading position, and the manual operation experience on working path, a full coverage path planning model for the irregular quadrilateral farmland is established, which significantly improve the adaptability of path planning algorithm to working environment and performance of the harvesting robot. Secondly, according to the farmland boundary, selected operating direction, and estimated output of the operating row, an operating environment model is established. Then the corner turning method of the irregular quadrilateral farmland is researched, and the turning path by taking turning area as optimization target is designed. Finally, the shuttle method and the improved ant colony algorithm are used to design the full coverage path respectively, by considering the constrains of the harvesting robot’s granary capacity, total travel distance, full-load travel distance and unloading position distribution as constrains. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm can perform intelligent planning under the multi-objective constraint according to the principle of maximum load rate. When solving the traversal sequence of job rows, the algorithm is not affected by the traversal sequence, the full load rate is greater than 90%, and full coverage path planning is realized.},

Among the various methods to solve robot localization, polar scan matching (PSM) technique has the advantage of much less computational load but has the potential to mismatch scans. Chaos optimization algorithms (COAs), a family of stochastic global optimization algorithms based on chaos theory, has many good features such as easy implementation, short execution time and robust mechanism for escaping from local optima. This paper presents a mobile robot localization method based on polar scan matching and adaptive niching chaos optimization algorithm (ANCOA). First, we define a new error function that fits the characteristics of the polar scan matching problem, and then propose an adaptive version of niching chaos optimization algorithm to increase the search speed and improve solution accuracy. The task of robot localization is performed by optimizing the new error function using the adaptive version of NCOA. The proposed approach is tested and evaluated comprehensively through computer simulations which shows that the proposed approach can significantly improve the performance of polar scan matching.},

Knowing where the fire has started allows emergency services to react faster and more efficiently. That is why unmanned aerial vehicles are being used more and more often. A drone with a thermal imaging camera locates fire outbreaks from the air. The drone will not only reach places that are difficult to reach, but also record an image from a wide area and—importantly—allow you to assess the extent of damage and fire extinguishing activities in real time. The unmanned aerial vehicle with a thermal imaging camera installed, despite the clouds of smoke and poor visibility, registers where the fire is located and in which direction the fire is spreading. The obtained data, along with the exact coordinates of the places that are on fire, are forwarded to the fire brigade. On this basis, firefighters can react quickly and move to a specific area to extinguish a fire. The analysis of the temperature of the indicated area also translated into the safety of the services participating in the fire extinguishing operation. This refers to issues in the area of public safety and privacy. UAV, under the international, regional and national regime of aviation law, are considered as aircraft. Since there is no framework existing in connection with the unauthorized flight in operations area of fire services in the context of the possibility of the U-space using, this paper will focus on this analysis. The paper’s conclusion will address the proposed recommendations for the UAV and aviation industries to consider as potential solution- implementation of the U-space concept.

In detail, a pre-trained object detector predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities from selected keyframes. Then, a proposed random-sampling clustering algorithm, R-DBSCAN, filters the outliers lying within the prefiltered bounding boxes. After calculating the centroid of the remaining feature points, the semantic object’s attributes are judged by a proposed strategy: if the dynamic probability of the semantic object is larger than the static probability, the semantic object is dynamic; otherwise, it is static. Additionally, the drift errors of the VI-SLAM is constrained by the pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) velocity. A series of experiments are conducted using the self-collected dataset to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method in distinguishing the attributes of semantic objects for application scenes. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the highest precision, recall, and F1 score as compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the centroid of the dynamic semantic object changes in continuous keyframes reflecting its motion trajectory relative to the pose graph.},

  abstract     = {Accurate real-time information about an ongoing wildfire event is important for realizing effective and safe wildfire fighting. This paper is intended to solve the problem of guiding Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with onboard cameras to monitor dynamic wildfire boundaries. According to whether the prior knowledge of the wildfire boundary is available or not, we propose a model-based vector field and a model-free vector field for UAV guidance. By describing the wildfire boundary with a zero level set function, the propagation of the wildfire boundary is modeled with the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. If the prior knowledge of the boundary is available, the typical radial basis function thin-plate spline is adopted to approximate the wildfire boundary and predicts its propagation. Then a 3D analytical vector field is constructed for an implicit function representing the wildfire boundary. If only partial observation of the wildfire boundary within the UAV’s field of view is available, the horizontal error between the UAV and its sensed segment of wildfire boundary and the vertical error between the UAV and the desired altitude are utilized to construct a 3D distance error based vector field, directly. To guide the UAV to converge to and patrol along the advancing wildfire boundary, the complex nonlinear dynamics of the UAV is exploited with differential flatness and incorporated with the above mentioned vector fields to design a nonlinear geometric controller. Computer simulations have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed 3D vector field based controllers with both synthetic and real data, and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can be effective methods to monitor the advancing wildfire boundaries.},

  abstract     = {In order for an effective and efficient collaboration among multiple vehicles to be possible, task allocation is essential. In general, task allocation algorithms assume constant costs and attempt to minimize or maximize an expected objective value. However, the optimality and reliability of the results may be greatly affected by uncertainties, such as those of the position of the tasks and the agents. This study addresses such challenges in multi-agent task allocation and proposes a robust task allocation algorithm under the uncertainty in the position of the nodes. To quantify the robustness of the solution, the uncertainty of the cost matrix, and the sensitivity of the solution are considered and evaluated. In order to model the uncertainty, Gaussian approximations are used and the Interval algorithm is employed to investigate the sensitivity of the solution to the uncertainty. For performance evaluation with respect to the travel distance and the value at risk of the proposed methodology, numerical simulations of multi-objective task allocation were carried out.},

The VSLAM system performs data association between image frames through feature matching. There are a large number of incorrect correspondences in the unfiltered matching results, and the accuracy of data association will directly determine the localization performance. This paper proposes a convolutional neural network with dense connectivity to eliminate the outliers in the matching results. It repeatedly concatenates low-level and high-level features into a dense feature map, which allows both local and global information to be used for mismatch removal. Furthermore, we introduce an outlier rejection module based on our network into the classic monocular visual odometry (VO) pipeline, in order to enhance the reliability of data association. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that our method achieves favorable performance against other algorithms, especially under challenging scenes, such as low texture. Also, we verify the performance of our system on a mobile robot in real-world localization task.},

  abstract     = {Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) such as quadcopters are ideal for aerial surveillance because of their runway independence, terrain-agnostic maneuverability, low cost, and simple hardware. However, battery capacity constraints limit the effective range and endurance of sUASs, requiring human intervention to replace batteries or perform manual recharging for longer operations. To increase their range, an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) may provide recharging depot as needed. The problem is then to find optimal paths for the UGV and sUASs to visit mission points and sUAS-UGV rendezvous points for recharging. We present a three-tiered heuristics to solve this computationally hard combinatorial optimization problem: (1) K-means clustering is used to find UGV waypoints, (2) a traveling salesman formulation (TSP) is used to solve the optimal UGV route, and (3) vehicle routing problem formulation (VRP) with capacity constraints, time windows, and dropped visits is used to solve for sUAS routes. We use constraint programming for optimization of the TSP and VRP, achieving a solution for 25 mission points and up to 4 sUASs in about a minute on a standard desktop computer. We also found that constraint programming solvers are 7 − 30 times faster, but 4 − 15% sub-optimal compared to mixed-integer solvers, which provide exact solutions. Further, we used constraint programming solvers in a Monte-Carlo approach to evaluate the role of mission spread, number of clusters, and number of sUASs on the optimal solution. Our contribution is the development of heuristics for route selection of sUAS-UGVs that produces high quality solutions as more mission points and sUASs are added without substantially increasing the computational time.},

  abstract     = {Automatic venipuncture robots are expected to replace manual venipuncture methods owing to their high control precision, steady operation, and measurable perception. However, the lack of perception of the venipuncture status in the human body leads to an increased risk and failure rate, which further restricts the development of such robots. To address this, we propose a humanoid venipuncture method guided by a biomechanical model to imitate human sensations and feedback. This method intends to perceive the venipuncture status and improve the performance of the venipuncture robot. First, this study establishes a biomechanical venipuncture model, which thoroughly considers the elastic deformation, cutting, and friction of tissues and can be applied to different venipuncture conditions. Then, venipuncture simulations and in vitro phantom experiments are performed under various settings to analyze and validate the model. Finally, to evaluate the robotic humanoid venipuncture method, we apply the method to a self-developed six-degree-of-freedom venipuncture robot via rabbit ear veins with a success rate of approximately 90%. This work demonstrates that the humanoid venipuncture method based on the biomechanical model is practical and rapid in processing simple information in venipuncture robots.},

For this purpose, the paper aims to develop a practical model of hybrid robotic hands for grasping applications based on bioinspired form. The design principle of the hybrid robotic fingers with soft materials and rigid structures, which can reproduce the digit grasping movement of the human hands, is proposed by the analysis of the coupled motion of human fingers in daily living. In order to capture the distal deflection and comprehensive shape, the kinematic transmission of the hybrid robotic fingers is modeled and effects of different parameters on the kinematic model is analyzed, which contributes to the desired configuration design of the hybrid robotic fingers. Then the hybrid robotic fingers are built by proposing a laminated multi-material manufacturing approach. Experimental results show that the kinematic model is accurate and the hybrid fingers have high performance with compact structure. The robotic hand composed of five hybrid fingers can replicate 91% of the natural movements of the human hand. It also has inherent capability of exploiting environmental constraints that simplifies the perception and planning for grasping.},

In this paper, we present a visual servo controlled robotic system for MRI-guided breast intervention. This robot system is developed based on the manual control version of previous publication. Zhang et al. (2019). The robot system exploits a cable-driven series-parallel mechanism and pneumatic controlled acupuncture mechanism, robot motion is guided by a machine vision system. The kinematic model of the robot is established, a control method of combining forward kinematics and visual servo control of a series-parallel robot is proposed to fulfil accurate control of the needle. A robot motion compensation method based on vision is developed, and the accuracy of the lesion targeting of the robot system is improved by establishing a feedback control mechanism. Repetitive accuracy results shows that the average error of targeting different lesions is between 1.29 mm to 2.42 mm, compared to previous manual control method, the visual control can provide significant improved accuracy. Comprehensive image quality test including signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) test, distortion test and uniformity test are carried out. The SNR variation is less than 10%, distortion is less than 1%, and uniformity is larger than 96%. Comparative experiments are conducted to verify the system’s visual servo control accuracy, MR image quality is evaluated to verify MRI compatibility under working condition. The experimental results show the robot satisfies the operational requirements and can provide effective assistance in clinical breast biopsy.},

  abstract     = {Aerial manipulators (AM) exhibit particularly challenging, non-linear dynamics; the UAV and its manipulator form a tightly coupled dynamic system, mutually impacting each other. The mathematical model describing these dynamics forms the core of many solutions in non-linear control and deep reinforcement learning. Traditionally, the formulation of the dynamics involves Euler angle parametrization in the Lagrangian framework or quaternion parametrization in the Newton-Euler framework. The former has the disadvantage of giving birth to singularities and the latter being algorithmically complex. This work presents a hybrid solution, combining the benefits of both, namely a quaternion approach leveraging the Lagrangian framework, connecting the singularity-free parameterization with the algorithmic simplicity of the Lagrangian approach. We do so by offering detailed insights into the kinematic modeling process and the formulation of the dynamics of a general aerial manipulator. The obtained dynamics model is validated experimentally against a real-time physics engine. A practical application of the obtained dynamics model is shown in the context of a computed torque feedback controller (feedback linearization), where we analyze its real-time capability with increasingly complex AM models.},

In 2016, the Belgian legislator has issued its first regulation specifically dedicated to Unmanned Aircraft Systems. As a result of establishing regulation on a national level, the European Union became a regulatory patchwork, in contrast with the otherwise unified regulatory framework for civil manned aviation. The Royal Decree that was issued in 2016 has in the meantime been repealed. As a member of the European Union, Belgium now applies the relatively recently developed European regulation. However, member states have at the same time maintained the competency to still regulate certain aspects of operations with UAS.

The novel flight controller is proposed based on the chattering reduced terminal sliding mode control method and a universal nonlinear disturbance estimator (NDE), which is applied to improve the robustness of the flight system. By skillfully using Lyapunov theory, the stability condition of the closed-loop systems is derived and it is shown that the control gains can be reduced by estimating the model uncertainties and external disturbances. Finally, compared with traditional methods, the theoretical results are validated experimentally through tests using a quadrotor assembled with PX4 and Pixracer. Two different kinds of model uncertainties and external disturbances cases, including partial failure of a rotor and the sudden change of the load, are validated through experiments. Since the nonlinear disturbance estimator is designed in a universal way, the proposed method shows great robustness in the above two different experiment cases without changing the structure of the flight controller and the nonlinear disturbance estimator.},

  abstract     = {A master-slave (M-S) based free environment (in-air) on-line trajectory control of a redundant surgical robot is presented in this work which can provide solution to precise positioning of the surgical robot tip that can be deployed for the internal organ inspection, radiosurgery of the gastrointestinal tumor, improvement in the precise placement of radiation source during brachytherapy, etc. This work deals with the online in-air 3D trajectory tracking control of a cable-driven 5-degrees of freedom (DOF) redundant slave robot deployed in the M-S based robotic surgical system presented towards robotic natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) purpose. A novel intelligent control technique involving an uncomplicated supervised radial basis function network (RBFN) based mapping is proposed to learn the inverse kinematics (IK) relationship of the redundant slave robot for tracking the desired 3D trajectory, which is given by the master robot under in-air environmental conditions. The proposed method eliminates the reckoning of Jacobian pseudo-inverse of the slave robot in real-time. To resolve the redundancy of the 5-DOF slave robot, a generalised approach in the weight update law during the learning phase of the inverse kinematic control is proposed. The proposed control algorithm’s trajectory tracking performance is compared with the back propagation network (BPN) based approach and the gold standard closed-loop inverse kinematic (CLIK) redundant control algorithm involving instantaneous maximization of manipulability measure through both simulation and experimental studies. Root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.572 mm (simulation) and 0.600 mm (experiment) are obtained for the RBFN based approach as compared to that of the BPN (simulation: 0.910 mm and experiment: 1.500 mm) and CLIK (simulation: 0.607 mm and experiment: 0.900 mm) algorithms are reflecting its best performance towards trajectory tracking tasks. Thus, the novelty of the current study lies on the development of a simple, uncomplicated intelligent neural network controller overperforming in 3D trajectory tracking tasks by the standard kinematic control techniques such as CLIK and other model based techniques. The experimental setup for M-S based surgical system for robotic-NOTES is developed to validate the intelligent control technique.},

In recent years, with the development of deep learning technique, the combination of visual odometry with deep learning has attracted more and more researchers’ attentions. Existing deep learning-based monocular visual odometry methods include a large number of calculations of redundant pixels, and they only consider the pose transformation between two adjacent frames, resulting in error accumulations. To solve the above problems, an end-to-end self-supervised monocular visual odometry method based on keypoint heatmap guidance is proposed in this paper. In the process of network training, the keypoint heatmap is used to guide network learning to reduce the influence of redundant pixels. The photometric error based on the pose consistency constraint of image sequence is calculated to reduce the accumulated error in the pose estimation of video sequence. Extensive experimental results on the KITTI visual odometry dataset have fully validated the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In the deterministic formulation, two problems are considered related to the generation of admissible reference actions for the automatic control of an autonomous mobile robot in the problem of path following stabilization. The first problem is the restoration of the derivatives of the reference vector signal without its analytical description. This signal sets the realizable trajectory for the robot. An easy-to-tune dynamic differentiator with piecewise linear corrective actions is proposed to solve that problem. The differentiator is constructed as a copy of the virtual canonical model with unknown input and provides an estimation of derivatives of any required order with any given accuracy. The second problem is the smoothing of composite spatial trajectories. For solution, a dynamic generator is presented. It is constructed as a copy of the motion equations of a specific robot. A decomposition procedure for the synthesis of S-shaped smooth and bounded corrective actions of the generator is developed. In the generator, a reference non-smooth vector signal is used to describe the path of the robot in the first approximation. For tuning the generator, the constraints on the state variables and controls of a specific robot are taken into account. It produces smooth output signals, as well as their derivatives, realizable by a particular robot. These algorithms can be implemented both at the planning stage and in real time since they do not require large computational costs. Their effectiveness is verified by numerical simulation for the movement of the center of mass of an unmanned aerial vehicle.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of robot perception and planning technology, robots are gradually getting rid of fixed fences and working closely with humans in a shared workspace. The safety of human-robot coexistence becomes critical. Although various safety-related motion planning methods have been proposed to prevent robots from colliding with obstacles, collision avoidance planning in highly dynamic environments is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a robust and efficient collision avoidance planning method that generates a collision-free trajectory in real-time by leveraging the complementary strengths of the potential field and optimization. Our approach starts with a new repulsive force generation method that quickly generates collision avoidance actions even if obstacles are moving faster than the robot. To ensure that the robot avoids collisions while converging toward the goal, an optimization method based on quadratic programming is designed to minimize the deviation of the post-optimized trajectory from the reference trajectory by fusing the whole body collision avoidance constraints and constraints dimensionality reduction. Finally, a closed-loop safety protection framework is presented, including obstacle perception, collision avoidance planning, and multi-task optimization. Compared with the existing state-of-the-art collision avoidance planners as well as advanced trajectory optimization methods, our method can generate a shorter collision-free trajectory in less time with a higher success rate. Detailed simulation comparison experiments, as well as real-world comparison experiments, are reported to verify the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract     = {The robot grinding process requires a high level of real-time constant force control. However, the low stiffness of the robot makes it difficult to keep the grinding force stable due to the deformation at the end of the robot during grinding. Therefore, an online optimization method of controller parameters for constant force grinding based on the deep reinforcement learning Rainbow is proposed in this paper. The method can stabilize the convergence while optimizing the control parameters online and can solve the constant force control during the grinding process. Firstly, based on the force analysis of the grinding model, we established the relationship between the grinding force and the trajectory compensation, and the robot constant force grinding controller was established by obtaining the grinding force to adjust the grinding trajectory. Secondly, aiming at adjusting the controller parameters of robot constant force grinding, we selected Rainbow to optimize the controller parameters and designed the training environment for the reinforcement learning agent. The environment includes the state space composed of different controller parameters, the action space of state transformation, the Noisy Categorical Dueling (NCD) network mapping agent state and action reward, and the reward function with two-stage sample evaluation. The online optimization of constant force controller parameters is realized to reduce the training time cost. To improve the safety of grinding force overload during sampling and the utilization rate of sample data, an online sampling method of grinding force was proposed. Through the experiment of the robotic constant force grinding system, Rainbow can quickly converge to the stable strategy. The results show that the grinding force is more consistently close to the expected value and the roughness of the machined surface decreases. Compared with the parameters empirically adjusted and the parameters with a poor grinding performance by sampling, the roughness was reduced by 26.54% and 78.39% respectively, verifying the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The ducted fan unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is capable of both hovering and high-speed cruising, while the transitional flight between hovering and cruising is one of the most challenging flight maneuverings. In this paper, we address the flight mode transition control of a ducted fan UAV with constrained control inputs. During our early flight tests, we have engaged a saturation problem on the control vanes that led to severe crashes. In order to maintain a sufficient control on the attitude suffering from input saturation, we propose a control effectiveness enhancement (CEE) algorithm, which compensates the deficiency on vane control effectiveness by utilizing the thrust-vectored property of the ducted fan UAV. In the meanwhile, to handle the variation of the complex aerodynamic effects acting on the vehicle, we adopt an adaptive full envelope flight control scheme to compensate all of the unmodeled nonlinear dynamics. A sufficient condition is also derived to ensure the stability of the closed-loop system, by which the aircraft is capable of tracking a given velocity trajectory with bounded tracking error. Finally, flight tests are conducted with comparative experiments. The result is satisfactory in accomplishing the desired transition course and resisting the risk of flight failure in the presence of input saturation, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Highly optimized missions and robust systems mitigate uncertainty effects and improve notoriously success rates. This paper brings a niching hybrid human–machine system that combines UAVs fast responsiveness with two robust, decentralized, and scalable bio-inspired techniques. Cloud-Sharing Network (CSN) and Pseudo-Central Network (PCN), based on Bacterial and Honeybee behaviors, are presented, and applied to Safe and Rescue (SAR) operations. A post-earthquake scenario is proposed, where a heterogeneous fleet of UAVs cooperates with human rescue teams to detect and locate victims distributed along the map. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to test both approaches through state-of-the-art metrics. This paper introduces two hybrid and bio-inspired schemes to deal with critical scouting stages, poor communications environments and high uncertainly levels in disaster release operations. Role heterogeneity, path optimization and hive data-sharing structure give PCN an efficient performance as far as task allocation and communications are concerned. Cloud-sharing network gains strength when the allocated agents per victim and square meter is high, allowing fast data transmission. Potential applications of these algorithms are not only comprehended in SAR field, but also in surveillance, geophysical mapping, security and planetary exploration.},

  abstract     = {As the world’s population increases, new ways of improving transportation systems in, around and between urban areas are being suggested. Early discussions on this have been technology-focused, pointing at the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) for cargo delivery and electrical Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft for passenger transportation. Recently, the term ‘Urban Air Mobility’ has become widely used to encompass these vehicles within a new mobility ecosystem. However, due to deficiencies in this term, other proposals – namely ‘Advanced Air Mobility’, ‘New Air Mobility and ‘Innovative Air Mobility’ – have emerged. The rise in different terms can lead to confusion as their scope is not always fully known or appreciated, and they are often used interchangeably. This paper, therefore, shifts focus from the recent debate about the definition of ‘UAS’ to the aforementioned ecosystem terms so to address and evaluate them as potentially different aspects of the same concept. An interpretive approach of the terms, an assessment of their major characteristics, as well as an analysis of their relationship with the aircraft types will take place. This will show the scope of these terms so that the context can be properly understood and then appropriately applied.},

Hence we design a SLAM system to simultaneously estimate trajectory and construct object-level dense 3D semantic maps in dynamic environments. Synergizing deep learning-based object detection, we leverage geometric constraints by using optical flow and the relationship between objects to identify those moving but predefined static objects. To construct more precise 3D semantic maps, our method employs an unsupervised algorithm to segment 3D point cloud generated by depth data into meaningful clusters. The 3D point clusters are then synergized with semantic cues generated by deep learning to produce a more accurate 3D semantic map. We evaluate the proposed system on TUM RGB-D dataset and ICL-NUIM dataset as well as in real-world indoor environments. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in various dynamic scenes in terms of both accuracy and robustness.},

  abstract     = {This work presents swing-up and stabilizing control of an underactuated two-segment soft-bodied arm by exploiting its morphology (e.g., body shape changing and stiffness variation) inspired by the classical control case of an underactuated rigid-double pendulum (a.k.a “Acrobot”) which uses partial feedback linearization and a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller. The concept of morphological computation is used to set up a dynamical system that includes a network of nonlinear mass-spring-damper, as a physical reservoir computing, and a linear (regression) readout to determine the actual outputs of the system. The soft arm is modeled as two soft-bodied segments, each as a set of mass-spring-damper systems with a rigid central backbone, connected through pseudo rotational joints. The soft-bodied arm’s configurations (i.e., pseudo joint angles and angular velocities) are determined based on the summation of the weighted squared length of springs in each segment. A partial feedback linearization and an LQR controller were derived based on the morphological reduced-order model. Stability analysis is carried out and the required conditions are determined. During the learning phase, the linear readout weights were trained based on the error between the closed-loop rigid body dynamics of the backbones and the morphologically computed joint angles. In the exploitation phase, the morphologically computed pseudo joint angles were directly feedback to the closed-loop dynamical system carrying the successful swing-up motion and achieving the upright configuration stabilization in most simulation runs. Additionally, the proposed controller’s performance was examined in presence of a small perturbation, as an added white Gaussian noise to the joint angles during the training phase, where the success rate was lower compared to the case without noise. Moreover, a comparison with a 2-link rigid robotic arm’s performance revealed a significant reduction in the required time (40 seconds vs 5 seconds) and energy consumption (2337.7 J vs 44.1 J) for the soft-bodied arm to achieve the desired final configuration. These outcomes also pointed to the feasibility of using the proposed partial feedback linearization enabled morphological control to manipulate underactuated soft robots.},

  abstract     = {The advancement of collaborative robotics increases process efficiency. However, humans are still part of the loop in many deployment scenarios. They are unpredictable factors that may potentially become at risk. This work proposes a safety system for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), called HOSA, and discusses the decisions made from its modular architectural design phase to a real scenario implementation. HOSA is an end-to-end system that considers the information provided by sensors available in the environment, the communication network to transport the information, the reasoning in the information, and the interface to present the risks. It applies deep learning algorithms to detect HRI collision risk and the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) based on surveillance camera images. Also, it considers knowledge representation based on Ontology, Software-Defined Wireless Networking (SDWN), and a user interface based on augmented reality. The benefits of the proposed design are evaluated through a use case of a HRI scenario for radio base station maintenance. The architecture scales with the number of devices due to semantic descriptions and an adequately provisioned communication network. It demonstrates the system’s efficiency in detecting risk during HRI tasks and alerting people in the scenario. The conducted experiment shows that the system takes 1.052 seconds to react to a risky situation.},

  abstract     = {Grasping unfamiliar-adjacent objects based on limited previous information is a daunting task in robotic manipulation. It is substantially more difficult to grasp an object in such a scenario than grasping secluded objects. For this reason, recent solutions typically require non-prehensile actions prior to grasping (e.g., pushing, toppling, squeezing or rolling). However, these solutions play a loose role and causing delays. The non-prehensile action should have intended utility and effect on the consecutive grasping action, because it is a sequential decision-making problem. This paper takes a step towards solving the issue by introducing a self-learning strategy to manipulate unknown objects in challenging scenarios based on minimal prior knowledge. The developed system learns jointly pre-grasping (non-prehensile shifting) and grasping (prehensile) actions using model-free deep reinforcement learning. The agent comprehends sequences of pregrasp manipulations that purposely lead to successful potential grasps. The system is object-agnostic, which does not require task-specific training data or predefined object information (e.g., pose estimation or 3D CAD models). The proposed model trains end-to-end policies (from only visual observations to decisions-making) to seek optimal manipulating strategies. Perception network maps visual inputs to actions, as dense pixel-wise Q-values, and learns quickly through trial-and-error manner. Experimentation findings have demonstrated the effectiveness of the joint learning between pregrasp manipulation and grasp policies, in which the success rate of grasping has greatly increased. The proposed system has been experimentally tested and validated in simulations and real-world settings using 6DOF robot with two-finger gripper.},

However, state-of-the art methods for Safe Corridor generation either generate “unsafe” Safe Corridors, or are not generic enough. In this paper we propose a new algorithm for decomposing free 3D space into overlapping convex polyhedra based on a voxel-grid representation of the 3D space. It introduces the concept of “convex grid/inscribed polyhedron” duality that allows for an efficient and safe convex polyhedron generation. We showed that our method generates Safer Corridors than the state-of-the-art with guarantees that no intersection exists between the Safe Corridor and the real world obstacles, while staying within real-time constraints. We also showed that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of number of constraints per polyhedron and number of polyhedra per Safe Corridor, which translates into faster computation time in the planning/optimization phase.},

The performance achieved by using a fixed senor network and an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is compared and analyzed. We construct a continuous path-based reward function, based on which BO will design an optimal, three-dimensional path for the UAV.

  abstract     = {Since learning models from data allows direct and accurate model approximation, it has lately become a tool of increasing interest in robotics. However, most learning methods require significant amounts of samples in the anticipated region to achieve adequate performance. In this paper, a novel modeling framework via sparsity and feature learning (SFL) is proposed for approximating multi-DOF manipulator inverse dynamics. A large number of features and their weights are recognized and selected from the analytical form of the dynamical equation. A matrix-free procedure based on the Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM) and reweighted L1-minimization technique are presented for time and space efficiency. Finally, we conducted the torque prediction and control experiments on a 7-DOF industrial robot to show the effectiveness of the proposed learning framework and compared the performance with different model classes and procedures. Superior to existing modeling methods, the merits of our method are that it needs no prior knowledge of the mechanical parameters of the robot thus avoiding modeling and assembly errors introduced by the geometric parameter identification procedure. Moreover, as the restriction of the features with specific forms is viewed as a strong priority of learning, the SFL method outperforms the universal approximation method on real data while generalizing for finite training samples.},

The path is extracted using learning by demonstration methods and it is customized on each fold by integrating features extracted by a depth sensor, such as the fold’s curve height. Moreover, the unfolding path can be re-adjusted through the classification of visual data by Support Vector Machines. In the second introduced method, the garment is lifted in the air by two points so that it unfolds due to gravity while the criterion proposed for the selection of these grasp points is the maximization of the free of deformations hanging’s garment area.

  abstract     = {Autonomous scene exposure and exploration, especially in localization or communication-denied areas, useful for finding targets in unknown scenes, remains a challenging problem in computer navigation. In this work, we present a novel method for real-time environment exploration, whose only requirements are a visually similar dataset for pre-training, enough lighting in the scene, and an on-board forward-looking RGB camera for environmental sensing. As opposed to existing methods, our method requires only one look (image) to make a good tactical decision, and therefore works at a non-growing, constant time. Two direction predictions, characterized by pixels dubbed the Goto and Lookat pixels, comprise the core of our method. These pixels encode the recommended flight instructions in the following way: the Goto pixel defines the direction in which the agent should move by one distance unit, and the Lookat pixel defines the direction in which the camera should be pointing at in the next step. These flying-instruction pixels are optimized to expose the largest amount of currently unexplored areas. Our method presents a novel deep learning-based navigation approach that is able to solve this problem and demonstrate its ability in an even more complicated setup, i.e., when computational power is limited. In addition, we propose a way to generate a navigation-oriented dataset, enabling efficient training of our method using RGB and depth images. Tests conducted in a simulator evaluating both the sparse pixels’ coordinations inferring process, and 2D and 3D test flights aimed to unveil areas and decrease distances to targets achieve promising results. Comparison against a state-of-the-art algorithm shows our method is able to overperform it, that while measuring the new voxels per camera pose, minimum distance to target, percentage of surface voxels seen, and compute time metrics.},

These versatile platforms are capable of steady flight and thrust-borne hover, but owing to their design are challenging to control for a remote operator with limited visual feedback. The proposed pilot-assist solution uses a unified controller architecture that remains valid for all flight regimes, while accounting for different operating modes required by the pilot. The cascaded control structure consists of an attitude controller, developed directly on the Special Orthonormal Group SO(3), a nonlinear position control system capable of operating in position, velocity, or path following modes, and a reference generation system that enables smooth transitions between modes. The stability of the system dynamics together with the proposed control solution is analyzed through Lyapunov stability theory. In addition, to verify the viability of the developed system when operated by a human pilot, outdoor flight experiments are conducted with an experimental platform. Results show the control system enables the lightweight platform to fly stably outdoors while following pilot inputs, both in conventional steady flight, and in a thrust-borne flight regime.},

  abstract     = {The reliability of autonomous landing of the UAVs in an unknown or unprepared environment can be improved by the application of image-based sensors. This paper investigates the landing control of a multirotor UAV by controlling the optical flow and estimation of vertical distance supported by a low-cost monocular camera. Landing control and vertical distance estimation using just a camera as the sensor, makes the proposed approach well-suited for emergency scenarios in GPS denied environment. To develop the optical flow-based controller strategy, an appropriate nonlinear model is proposed by combining the optical flow equations and the kinematics of vertical landing. In the control loop of the multirotor landing, an estimation of the vertical distance is required, which is provided by the application of the developed model and the optical flow derived from camera images. RLS algorithm and the EKF have been applied to estimate the vertical distance. The controller output is determined by using the NDI algorithm, the augmented state-space form of the equations, and the estimated states based on optical flow. An experimental setup is developed for the tasks of optical flow extraction, vertical distance estimation, and control. Additionally, the developed estimation and controller strategy are applied to the nonlinear dynamics of a quadrotor to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed models and algorithms for landing control. According to the results, the proposed optical flow-based control strategy can support a smooth landing for the multirotor UAV while its performance is dependent on the quality of estimation. There is a steady-state error in tracking the optical flow due to the estimation error of the vertical distance. The EKF-based algorithm has better performance in terms of estimation accuracy respecting the RLS, and therefore supports a better landing performance.},

In this work, a Design of Experiments strategy is adopted to study the effect of choices for five factors in a fractional factorial experiment, followed by a full factorial experiment. A fractional factorial experiment with resolution V was implemented to study the effect of type/number of membership functions for forward and angular velocities, in addition to LiDAR range on the robot’s navigation time. The robot’s navigation time is formulated mathematically as a function of the significant factors, using the regression equation extracted from the analysis. The optimization of this regression equation revealed that the robot’s navigation time is minimized using five triangular membership functions for forward velocity with a 6 m LiDAR range. Finally, a confirmation experiment is implemented to validate the adopted regression equation’s prediction under untested combinations of factors and the results of this experiment confirm those obtained from the fractional and full factorial experiments. When the algorithm was re-evaluated using the results of this study, a significant improvement in performance was realized.},

The stability of LN guidance algorithms is investigated using global Lyapunov stability theorems and its stability is proved. Validation and verification flight tests of LN lateral-directional guidance logic demonstrate superior tracking performance adaptability of this novel method compared to other methods such as L1 or $${{{L}_{2}}^{+}}$$ . The LN longitudinal guidance is newly developed in this paper and shows excellent altitude tracking capabilities and similarly scalable.

  abstract     = {Trajectory planning for quadrotor has been extensively studied in terms of safety, smoothness, and dynamical feasibility. However, few methods have been proposed for the optimization of efficiency in long-distance navigation. Quadrotor often has high computational complexity when performing tasks that involve at least multiple computing modules such as location, mapping, planning, etc. Therefore, improving planning efficiency and flight efficiency can save computing resources and improve transport efficiency to complete more tasks. This paper presents a real-time trajectory planning method that can achieve long-distance navigation with less planning number and calculation time while greatly reducing flight time to reach the target point quickly. Our method is built on hard constraints such as safety distance, free-space flight corridors, and smoothness constraints that can ensure trajectory quality. For each scenario, our improved Theta* algorithm can obtain a shortest initial trajectory with several key waypoints. Low-quality segments of the initial trajectory are then screened and optimized by local replanning detection and flight corridor-based optimization, respectively. Flight efficiency, continuity, and dynamical feasibility are greatly boosted by the distributed time allocation method. Experimental results show that the flight time of our method is 22%–56% less than that of the state-of-the-art hard-constrained methods in about 50 m flight, and total calculation time is 19%–84% less, which is attributable to the reduction of planning number. The proposed trajectory planning method is also integrated into a quadrotor platform and its competence is validated by presenting autonomous flight in unknown indoor environments.},

A COMPRA-enabled MAV is able to autonomously explore previously unknown areas while specific mission criteria are considered e.g. an object of interest is identified and localized, the remaining useful battery life, the overall desired exploration mission duration. The proposed architecture follows a low-complexity algorithmic design to facilitate fully on-board computations, including nonlinear control, state-estimation, navigation, exploration behavior and object localization capabilities. The framework is mainly structured around a reactive local avoidance planner, based on enhanced Potential Field concepts and using instantaneous 3D pointclouds, as well as a computationally efficient heading regulation technique, based on depth images from an instantaneous camera stream. Those techniques decouple the collision-free path generation from the dependency of a global map and are capable of handling imprecise localization occasions. Field experimental verification of the overall architecture is performed in relevant unknown Global Positioning System (GPS)-denied environments.},

  abstract     = {The development of intelligent prostheses has provided convenience and confidence to amputees’ lives. For the majority of patients that only use a passive ankle prosthesis structure without its corresponding function, the development of intelligent ankle prostheses is very important. In this paper, a controllable active and passive hybrid hydraulic ankle prosthesis (APHHAP) with active drive, precise damping regulation, and energy recovery functions is presented. Also, an embedded control board capable of communicating with motors, a computer, and a mobile phone terminal as well as connecting various types of sensors for real-time monitoring of an ankle prosthesis motion state is designed. This board is based on STM32F429ZI. For a better control performance, generalized opposition-based learning, variable parameters based on the sigmoid function, and adaptive elite mutation are introduced to improve the traditional particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The new algorithm is called improved particle swarm optimization (IGOPSO) algorithm. The IGOPSO algorithm achieves better optimization and faster convergence than traditional PSO algorithms. Using simulation, which adopts a mathematical model based on a piecewise function, the parameter range values are obtained, and the number of invalid running times is reduced. Experiments on a physical prototype are conducted to validate the control algorithm performance. The obtained experimental results demonstrate that by combining IGOPSO with the proportion integration differentiation (PID) algorithm (IGOPSO-PID control algorithm), efficient track tracking control of the APHHAP dorsiflexion and plantarflexion as well as significant improvement in its control accuracy can be achieved.},

  abstract     = {The inverse kinematics (IK) of continuum robot is a challenging work due to the hyper-redundant DOFs and the narrow and complex operating environment. However, many of the currently available algorithms are with the disadvantage of complex solving processes, low computational efficiency, and even singular problems or low convergence rates. Referred to the Forward and Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics (FABRIK) algorithm, a novel heuristic algorithm is proposed in this paper, which is called Continuum Robot Reaching Inverse Kinematics (CRRIK). The CRRIK algorithm is with the advantages of high convergence rate and low computational cost, which are suitable for real-time applications. The forward iteration of CRRIK is inspired by the physical process of pulling a rope with a fixed end, which is straightforward and obvious, avoiding complicated nonlinear operations. Furthermore, the joint angle boundary condition and obstacle avoidance can also be implemented in the backward iteration, broadening the application scenarios of the CRRIK algorithm. The effectiveness of the CRRIK algorithm is demonstrated through a five-segment continuum robot’s trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance simulation. And a comparison between the CRRIK algorithm and some of the most popular IK methods is also presented to validate the performance of CRRIK.},

  abstract     = {Robotic sensing is used in many sectors to improve the inspection of large and/or complex parts, enhancing data acquisition speed, part coverage and inspection reliability. Several automated or semi-automated solutions have been proposed to enable the automated deployment of specific types of sensors. The trajectory to be followed by a robotic manipulator is typically obtained through the offline programmed tool paths for the inspection of a part. This method is acceptable for a part with known geometry in a well-structured and controlled environment. The part undergoing assessment needs to be precisely registered with respect to the robot reference system. It implies the need for a setup preparation phase for each new part, which can be very laborious and reliant on the human experience. This work combines real-time robot control and live sensor data to confer full autonomy to robotic sensing applications. It presents a novel framework that enables fully autonomous single-pass geometric and volumetric inspection of complex parts using one single robotised sensor. A practical and robust robot control sequence allows the autonomous correction of the sensor orientation and position to maximise the sensor signal amplitude. It is accompanied by an autonomous in-process path planning method, capable of keeping the inspection resolution uniform throughout the full extension of the free-form parts. Last but not least, a by-product of the framework is the progressive construction of the digital model of the part surface throughout the inspection process. The introduced framework is scalable and applicable to widely different fields.},

  abstract     = {Recently, research concerning autonomous self-driving vehicles has become very popular. In autonomous vehicles (AVs), different decision-making and learning architectures have been proposed to predict multiple tasks (MTs) or MTs from various datasets or to improve performance among different MTs. In this paper, a novel and unified multitask learning framework, called Multi-Modal DenseNet (M2-DenseNet), is proposed to predict MTs in a single network in which three long short-term memory units act as the output (MTs). Accordingly, the proposed M2-DenseNet can predict three different motion decision-making tasks, i.e., the steering angle, speed, and throttle, to control AV driving. Moreover, M2-DenseNet can greatly reduce the time complexity (e.g., to less than 5 ms) because the different prediction tasks can be predicted simultaneously. We conduct comprehensive experiments with the lane-keeping task based on two control mechanisms using the proposed M2-DenseNet and other existing methods to evaluate the performance. The experiments demonstrate that M2-DenseNet significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with the accuracies of the three control tasks being approximately 98%, 99%, and 98%, respectively. The mean squared error between the predicted value and the ground truth is reported in the experiments, with values for the steering angle, speed, and throttle of 0.0250, 0.0210, and 0.0242, respectively.},

Managing aerial vehicles fleets, dependent on rising technologies such as artificial intelligence and automated ground control stations, will require a solid and uninterrupted connection to complete their trajectories. A path planner based on evolutionary algorithms to find the most suitable route has been previously proposed by the authors. Herein, we propose using particle swarm and hybrid optimisation algorithms instead of evolutionary algorithms in this work. The goal of speeding the route planning process and reducing computational costs is achieved using particle swarm and direct search algorithms. This improved path planner efficiently explores the search space and proposes a trajectory according to its predetermined goals: maximum air-to-ground quality, availability, and flight time. The proposal is tested in different situations, including diverse terrain conditions for various channel behaviours and no-fly zones.},

User evaluation included 20 children and assessed their perceived robot embodiment preferences (e.g., shape, robot motion, displays, and emotional expressivity) and perceived usability aspects. The evaluation used an experimental remote protocol supporting collecting online feedback with users during the COVID-19 pandemic. Empirical results supported performing quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the HRI application and highlighting the perceived differences of robot embodiment features. The discussions center on improving a future version of the HRI application, plus children’s considerations about their preferred robot embodiment features during the observation sessions. Finally, we propose recommendations for robot embodiment design for children and learning based on this case study and discuss protocol limitations during the social distancing context, that we believe as a valid alternative to move forward with experimental designs, particularly in robotics, becoming a great contribution to other researchers facing similar hurdles.},

  abstract     = {This work proposes a Visual Predictive Control (VPC) scheme adapted to the autonomous navigation problem among static obstacles. To do so, it is necessary to cope with several issues which by now limit the use of VPC in this context. Among them, we focus on the following ones: the need for precise prediction models to improve the task realization; the need for a long prediction horizon which is required to perform long range displacements and guarantee stability, but also results in a high computational burden and a more difficult implementation ; the possible optimization problem evolution at every iteration due to unexpected events (e.g., detection of new obstacles), which leads to non convex problems and therefore makes difficult its resolution. The proposed VPC allows to tackle the above mentioned challenges. Based on a more accurate prediction model relying on an exact integration method, it integrates constraints to deal with actuator saturation, obstacle avoidance along the trajectory and stability. To deal with the two last mentioned challenges, the classical VPC scheme has been extended with two methods: the first one allowing to relax some constraints on the control inputs to reduce the computational burden; the second one for adequately refining the optimized trajectory to avoid local minima when the optimization problem evolves during the navigation. The proposed approach has been evaluated and compared to other VPC configurations. The obtained results show than it runs 60 times faster than classical configurations for similar performances.},

The AVI involves the identification of vehicles through the transmission of a unique identifier between an in-vehicle device and a tollbooth or roadside reader. To strengthen the reliability of this process, we propose a computer vision solution applied to AVI with subscription/membership. A camera system is set up to perform vehicle verification by extracting attributes of the vehicle to compare with those found in the membership. We focus on solving vehicle make and model classification by developing a fine-grained vehicle classification system that exploits the multi-camera composition of the system by powering a convolutional neural network with multiple views of the vehicle. We propose a multi-view network that extracts features from multiple views and combines them with late fusion to classify the make and model of the vehicle. We also propose a strategy to give each independent view a contribution to network learning. The presented evaluations show that using information from different views of a vehicle improves the classification performance of the make and model, especially in challenging tolling scenarios.},

SRM-PSO combines the mutation mechanism, self-regulation and self-perception strategy. The mutation mechanism is introduced to generate trial particle moving in different directions to maintain population diversity. Self-regulation and self-perception enable particles to be updated in different ways for fast exploration and intelligent exploitation. To validate the effectiveness of the SRM-PSO, experiments are conducted in the CEC2017 test suite. The test results indicate that SRM-PSO outperforms two related variants, and five representative PSO variants. Further, SRM-PSO is applied to several real-world optimization problems, which demonstrates its potential and competitiveness.},

  abstract     = {Manipulators are widely used in various fields of industrial automation, and hydraulic manipulators have more extensive application in future by virtue of high power to weight ratio. However, compared with the traditional motor manipulators, the dynamic model of hydraulic manipulator is more complex such as higher model order characteristics, which makes the design of precision motion controller of hydraulic manipulators more challenging. In addition, the application demand of hydraulic manipulator is gradually increasing even under various harsh conditions or extreme environments, which puts forward higher requirements for the autonomous environmental perception ability of hydraulic manipulators. Therefore, the visual servoing control for hydraulic manipulator is of great research value. In this paper, a position-based visual servoing control method for multi-joint hydraulic manipulator is proposed. To be specific, based on the obtained target position, the discrete desired path points can be got by velocity-limited path interpolation, which will be transformed into a discrete sequence of desired joint angles according to well-constrained inverse kinematics. Then the continuous desired angle trajectory of manipulator joint is generated by B-spline trajectory planner. Finally, the ideal angle trajectory is input into backstepping controller to contrive the angle tracking of each joint, so as to realize the visual target following control of multi-joint hydraulic manipulator.},

Our method, the OptiOdom calibration algorithm, generalizes the odometry calibration problem. It is developed an optimization-based approach that uses the improved Resilient Propagation without weight-backtracking (iRprop-) for estimating the kinematic parameters using only the position data of the robot. Even though a calibration path is suggested to be used in the calibration procedure, the OptiOdom method is not path-specific. In the experiments performed, the OptiOdom was tested using four different robots on a square, arbitrary, and suggested calibration paths. The OptiTrack motion capture system was used as a ground-truth. Overall, the use of OptiOdom led to improvements in the odometry accuracy (in terms of maximum distance and absolute orientation errors over the path) over the existent literature while being a generalized approach to the odometry calibration problem.

  abstract     = {A critical component in the public health response to pandemics is the ability to determine the spread of diseases via diagnostic testing kits. Currently, diagnostic testing kits, treatments, and vaccines for the COVID-19 pandemic have been developed and are being distributed to communities worldwide, but the spread of the disease persists. In conjunction, a strong level of social distancing has been established as one of the most basic and reliable ways to mitigate disease spread. If home testing kits are safely and quickly delivered to a patient, this has the potential to significantly reduce human contact and reduce disease spread before, during, and after diagnosis. This paper proposes a diagnostic testing kit delivery scheduling approach using the Mothership and Drone Routing Problem (MDRP) with one truck and multiple drones. Due to the complexity of solving the MDRP, the problem is decomposed into 1) truck scheduling to carry the drones and 2) drone scheduling for actual delivery. The truck schedule (TS) is optimized first to minimize the total travel distance to cover patients. Then, the drone flight schedule is optimized to minimize the total delivery time. These two steps are repeated until it reaches a solution minimizing the total delivery time for all patients. Heuristic algorithms are developed to further improve the computational time of the proposed model. Experiments are made to show the benefits of the proposed approach compared to the commonly performed face-to-face diagnosis via the drive-through testing sites. The proposed solution method significantly reduced the computation time for solving the optimization model (less than 50 minutes) compared to the exact solution method that took more than 10 hours to reach a 20% optimality gap. A modified basic reproduction rate (i.e., mR0) is used to compare the performance of the drone-based testing kit delivery method to the face-to-face diagnostic method in reducing disease spread. The results show that our proposed method (mR0= 0.002) outperformed the face-to-face diagnostic method (mR0= 0.0153) by reducing mR0 by 7.5 times.},

  abstract     = {The popularity of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAV) to be used in civilian applications has increased in the last years. However, in most of these applications, a MAV is used to acquire aerial images and video of areas and structures of interest. However, MAVs could become more useful if they can interact with the environment. For instance, in a parcel delivery task, the goal is for the MAV to deliver a package somewhere, but what about having to pick up a package autonomously? This task raises some challenges: i) the MAV has to recognize where the package or object of interest is; ii) the MAV has to plan its maneuver to achieve the picking. In this paper, we address both challenges, considering the scenario where the MAV has a suspended cable that moves freely with a hook attached at the end of the cable. A suspended cable saves weight, although it has to be indirectly controllable with the MAV’s flight. Thus, we present a solution based on a Convolutional Neural Network that is trained to recognize the object of interest, in this case, a bucket; and that simultaneously recognizes the hook. Both objects are expected to be observed with a camera on board the MAV. Our method uses the distance between these two objects in a state machine controller to position the MAV and trigger the lifting maneuver in a single upward motion action that reduces the effects of air current on the hook. We use synthetic datasets to train the bucket and hook detector, but the model is capable of performing the detection in real environments. We achieved an average lifting success rate of 70% for indoor and 60% for outdoor scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The expected value (EV) based optimization principle often used in engineering ignores risk-related human characteristics which are however important to human-robot interaction (HRI). The characteristics include risk-perception and risk-attitudes which can be called risk-awareness collectively. In this work, we study the effects of risk-awareness in a human-multi-robot collaborative search task. In such a task, the correctness of robotic visual detection is uncertain, but the robots can request human assistance. Assume there is only one human in the team, the requesting robots must be ordered into a sequence. To optimize the ordering, we propose to construct a risk-aware cost function with an extended version of regret theory (RTx). RTx is a decision theory modeling risk-awareness and is backed by neuroscientific and psychological evidences. We cast the optimal ordering into multi-option choice problems and use RTx to make human-like risk-aware decisions. This optimal ordering is combinatorial optimization with a nonlinear cost function which is generally difficult to solve. However, we prove the properties of RTx enable simplification of the optimal ordering to a sorting problem which has fast off-the-shelf solvers. The simplification has two parts. One part concerns with ordering a fixed number of robots optimally. The other concerns with selecting a not-yet-ordered sequence of robots with the optimal length. We examine the RTx-based ordering in simulation and show risk-aware decision-making is more advantageous than EV-based decision-making. The results indicate that risk-awareness renders improved performance of robotic decision-making for HRI and RTx is a tractable embodiment of risk-awareness.},

  abstract     = {Bionic fish have received widespread attention due to their high mobility, high concealment and high propulsion efficiency. Trajectory tracking and tracking accuracy are the main challenges in controlling the motion of bionic fish. To realize the trajectory tracking control of bionic fish, in this paper, nonlinear dynamics model of bionic fish is established by the Newton-Euler equation and Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) coordinate transformation, and it is reasonably simplified. Then, a model predictive controller is established based on the dynamic model, and combined with a central pattern generator (CPG) network, a CPG-based model predictive controller (MPC-CPG controller) is proposed. Finally, simulations and experiments are carried out on the bionic fish, tracking the circular trajectory and straight trajectory. Experiments show that under the condition of initial error, the MPC-CPG controller can quickly eliminate the position error and heading angle error of the bionic fish, and track to the reference trajectory. For the tracking circular trajectory and straight trajectory, the position errors are kept at −6.9% ~ 14.9% and − 8.6% ~ 8.6% of the body length, respectively, and the heading angle errors are always kept at −4.76° ~ 4.73° and − 3.24° ~ 3.55°, respectively.

  abstract     = {Monocular Visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (VSLAM) systems are widely utilised for intelligent mobile robots to work in unknown environments. However, complex and varying illuminations challenge the accuracy and robustness of VSLAM systems significantly. Existing feature-based VSLAM methods often fail due to the insufficient feature points that can be extracted in those challenging illumination environments. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved ORB-SLAM algorithm based on adaptive FAST threshold and image enhancement (AFE-ORB-SLAM), which works in the environments with complex lighting conditions. An improved truncated Adaptive Gamma Correction (AGC) is combined with unsharp masking to reduce the effect caused by different illuminations. What is more, an improved ORB feature extraction method with the adaptive FAST threshold is proposed and adopted to obtain more reliable feature points. To verify the performance of the AFE-ORB-SLAM, three public datasets (the extended Imperial College London and National University of Ireland Maynooth (ICL-NUIM) dataset with different lighting conditions, Onboard Illumination Visual-Inertial Odometry (OIVIO) dataset and the European Robotics Challenge (EuRoC) dataset) are utilised. The results are compared with other state-of-the-art monocular VSLAM methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the AFE-ORB-SLAM could achieve the highest average localisation accuracy with robust performance in the environments with complex lighting conditions while keeping similar performance in the normal lighting scenarios.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel data-driven navigation system to navigate an Unmanned Vehicle (UV) in GPS-denied, feature-deficient environments such as tunnels, or mines. The method utilizes landmarks that vehicle can deploy and measure range from to enable localization as the vehicle traverses its pre-defined path through the tunnel. A key question that arises in such scenario is determine apriori, i.e., before the start of the mission, the number of landmarks the vehicle has to carry, given some information about the environment. The main objective is to determine this number so as to keep the maximum position uncertainty less than or close to a desired value. In this article, we develop a novel vehicle navigation system in GPS-denied, feature-deficient environment by combining techniques from estimation, machine learning, and mixed-integer convex optimization. This article develops a novel, systematic method to perform localization and navigate the UV through the environment with minimum number of landmarks while maintaining desired localization accuracy. We also present extensive simulation experiments on different scenarios that corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed navigation system.},

Firstly, the improved vegetation index combined with Otsu method is used to segment the road and background. Then, an edge detection algorithm is proposed to overcome the noise interference and get the road edge points. Lastly, the cascade anti-interference algorithm eliminates the interference points and extracts navigation lines. Experimental results show that the average processing time of the proposed algorithm is 36.25 ms, and the error is less than 0.8°, which is better than the traditional least square method and Hough transform method.},

By observing a human demonstration of the task and a real-world object, the learned task constraint model can be utilized to infer both the unknown grasping task and the probability density distributions of the task constraints on the object point cloud. In addition, we extend the superquadric-based grasp estimation method for reproducing the grasping task with 2-finger grippers. The task constraints restrict the searching scope of the grasp pose, so the geometrically best grasp pose within the task-constrained regions can be obtained. The effectiveness of our methodology is verified in experiments with a UR5 robot with a 2-finger gripper.},

However, from the teleoperator’s point of view, objective and subjective measurements are relevant to determine the influence that algorithms and data feedback project on the human immersed in the control of the vehicle.

All strategies are evaluated considering aspects such as success rate of executions, time required to complete the task, average velocity coordination error, kinetic energy of the haptic device, situation of awareness, and mental load.

  abstract     = {Designs of robotic fishes are becoming more and more diversified, from totally rigid to soft, or rigid-soft coupling. Currently, most of the dynamic modeling approaches for robotic fishes have an assumption that the midline body curve follows a specific flapping pattern. Nevertheless, the soft or rigid-soft coupling biomimetic robotic fish is an under-actuated system. Due to the complicated interactions with the surrounding aquatic environments, the midline body curve is not guaranteed to follow the given pattern. This paper presents the modeling method for a novel kind of rigid-soft coupling biomimetic robotic fish, and studies how the hydrodynamic force influences motions of the robotic fish, especially its flapping pattern. The biomimetic robotic fish is characterized with a rigid head, a wire-driven active body, and a soft tail. To begin with, dynamics of the robot’s rigid head is formulated by using Kirchhoff’s equation from conventional marine vessel technologies. Then, by using the Pseudo-Rigid-Body Model (PRBM) theory, the soft tail can be modeled as pseudo-rigid links connected serially via torsional springs. Together with the wire-driven active body, the whole propeller, is a serial-link mechanism, motion of which can be calculated by Lagrangian method. Finally, experiments are carried out to verify this modeling method in terms of midline body curves. Overall, this paper offers a feasible and pragmatic method for modeling the rigid-soft coupling biomimetic robotic fish.},

Improvements in the IAPF are made to deal with constraints on angular velocity. In each step of the SPC method, the IAPF is used for robust and efficient tracking in a short future. And the MPC is implemented to generate actual control commands for high-precision tracking. The IAPF and the MPC work in an alternative way to drive the USV to the prescribed target while avoiding the obstacles detected around.

The proposed method replicates the transmission process of neuron signals when higher organisms move. The spiking neural networks simulate the brain to receive feedback signals and generate motion control commands. Through the bridge of saturation function, spinal cord neurons receive commands and use CPG to generate motor control signals. Repeated and comparative results verify the effectiveness of the hybrid locomotion control method, providing theoretical guidance for the development and control of multimode aquatic robots.},

However, this kind of technology raises significant challenges. sEMG signals are difficult to acquire and isolate reliably. The creation of a gesture representative model is hard due to the non-explicit nature of sEMG signals. Several solutions have been proposed for the recognition of sEMG-based hand gestures, but none of them are entirely satisfactory. This study contributes to take a step forward in finding the solution to this problem. A sEMG capturing prototype device was used to collect human hand gestures and a two-step algorithm is proposed to recognize five valid gestures, invalid gestures and non-gestures. The former algorithm step (segmentation) is used for sEMG signal isolation to separate signals containing gestures from signals containing non-gestures. The latter step of the algorithm (recognition) is based on a deep learning method, a convolutional neural network (CNN) that identifies which gesture is in the sEMG signals. The performances of the prototype device and recognition architecture were compared successfully with the off-the-shelf sEMG device Myo. Results indicated that the segmentation process played an important role in the success of the gesture recognition system, excluding sEMG signals containing non-gestures. The proposed system was applied successfully in the control loop of a collaborative robotic application, in which the gesture recognition system achieved an online class recognition rate (CR) of 98%, outperforming similar studies in the literature.},

The DT concept has become quite popular among process and manufacturing industries for improving performance and estimating remaining useful life (RUL). However, environmental behavior, such as in gas dispersion, is ever changing and hard to model in real-time. The DT framework is applied to the point source environmental monitoring problem, through the use of hybrid modeling and optimization techniques. A controlled release case study is overviewed to illustrate our proposed DT framework and several spatial interpolation techniques are explored for source estimation.

  abstract     = {Autonomous grasping in dynamic and unstructured environments is challenging in robotics. We aim to solve the problem by proposing an grasping algorithm for unknown objects based on adaptive dynamic force balance. Firstly, Principal Component Analysis(PCA) is used to adjust the axis direction of the camera coordinate system, so that it is consistent with the object coordinate system. The multi-plane projection policy and contour detection algorithm are used to extract the 2D contour information of unknown object, which can reduce the computational complexity. Secondly, a graspable area generating algorithm is established by estimating the size of target object and the distance of the gripper. Several candidate areas are adaptively generated by detecting the concave and convex points on the edge. The optimal grasping area is dynamically selected by minimizing the angle obtained from force balance analysis. The grasping pose is generated by using the depth image to complete autonomous grasping operation. In order to verify the effectiveness of proposed algorithm, a 6-DoF robot grasping platform is built based on eye-in-hand calibration. The experimental results show that compared with the current grasping algorithms, the proposed algorithm can effectively obtain the optimal grasping area of unknown objects without GPUs, which can achieve higher execution efficiency and adaptability.},

  abstract     = {We present a multiplatform control architecture to enable stable hovering flight and trajectory tracking for insect-scale flapping-wing micro air vehicles (FWMAVs). In the proposed approach, flight controllers are synthesized by using modern design techniques and applying the quaternion representation to describe the attitude dynamics of the controlled FWMAVs. During controller synthesis, the nominal stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed and ensured employing nonlinear Lyapunov methods. Given stringent fabrication, payload, size, and actuation limits at the insect scale, all subgram FWMAVs developed to date have been underactuated and, therefore, operate under multiple constraints. This observation has motivated us to develop an approach in which attitude is directly controlled by generating roll, pitch, and yaw torques through asymmetrical flapping; however, positional control forces are generated by manipulating the attitude of the robot to align its body-fixed aerodynamic-thrust vector along a desired direction. By leveraging this concept, we endow the proposed control architecture with the desired multiplatform characteristic and flexibility required to achieve multiple different objectives. The functionality, performance, and suitability of the proposed control approach are demonstrated experimentally using two different FWMAVs: a new version of the RoboBee, a 75-mg two-wing robot originally developed at Harvard University; and the Bee++, a 95-mg four-wing robot that we developed in the Autonomous Microrobotic Systems Laboratory (AMSL) at the University of Southern California (USC). The use of a single control architecture to fly both robots allows an objective comparison of their flight capabilities. The performance achieved by the Bee++ highlights the significant potential of its new design.},

Thus, we present a unified lane and obstacle detection network, ULODNet, which can detect the lanes and obstacles in a joint manner and further frame the drivable areas for mobile robots or other autonomous vehicles. To better coordinate the training of ULODNet, we also create a new dataset, CULane-ULOD Dataset, based on the widely used CULane Dataset. The new dataset contains both the lane labels and obstacle labels which the original dataset do not have.

To this end, we create a large data set composed by energy-efficient trajectories obtained by running a competitive planner. To the best of our knowledge our proposed data set is the first one with a high number of pseudo-optimal paths for ornithopter trajectory optimization. We compare the performance of three methods to compute low-cost trajectories: two classification approaches to learn maneuvers and an alternative regression method that predicts new states. The algorithms are tested in several scenarios, including the landing case. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated through simulation, which show that the machine learning techniques can be used to compute the flight path of the ornithopter in real time, even under uncertainties such as wrong sensor readings or re-positioning of the target. Random Forest obtains the higher performance with more than 99% and 97% of accuracy in a landing and a mid-range scenario, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Simultaneous Localization and Mapping is one of the hotspots in the field of mobile intelligent robot research. Over the past decades, many excellent SLAM systems with good performance have been developed. However, many of the systems make the assumption that the environment is static. In this paper, we propose a key segmentation frame based semantic SLAM (KSF-SLAM) method to deal with autonomous navigation in dynamic environments, which can reduce computational complexity. First, a key segmentation frame selection strategy is designed, so that it is unnecessary to perform segmentation in all the image frames. When a key segmentation frame arrives, the semantic segmentation is performed by SegNet, and the dynamic key points in the frame can be stored at the same time. Moreover, an efficient semantic image generation method is proposed when dealing with non-key segmentation frames. Optical flow tracking of the dynamic key points is performed between key segmentation frame and current frame before the next key segmentation frame arrives to generate semantic images for dynamic key points removal in non-key segmentation frames. By this way, an efficient semantic tracking module is added to the SLAM system to remove dynamic objects in dynamic environments. Experiments on TUM RGB-D datasets, KITTI datasets and in real-world environments are conducted to verify the effect of the proposed method. When compared with ORB-SLAM2 and DS-SLAM, the method proposed in this paper can significantly improve the real-time performance of the SLAM system while the positioning accuracy are equivalent.},

We integrate the step duration, footstep location, and angular momentum into the objective function while the center of pressure(CoP) is located in the supporting polygon. The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, four anti-disturbance strategies are applied online simultaneously. The anti-disturbance ability is improved compared to the methods that only consider three or less strategies. Second, we use known initial values to avoid the nonlinear constraints caused by adjusting the step duration. The optimization problem is converted to standard quadratic programming(QP), thus reducing the computational complexity. Simulation results show that this approach has stronger anti-disturbance ability than the previous linear anti-disturbance methods while ensuring low time cost.},

Due to the recent success of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in continuous control tasks, many teams have been using this technique to develop motions in Soccer 3D. This article focuses on learning humanoid robot behaviors: completing a racing track as fast as possible and dribbling against a single opponent. Our approach uses a hierarchical controller where a model-free policy learns to interact model-based walking algorithm. Then, we use DRL algorithms for an agent to learn how to perform these behaviors. Finally, the learned dribble policy was evaluated in the Soccer 3D environment. Simulated experiments show that the DRL agent wins against the hand-coded behavior used by the ITAndroids robotics team in 68.2% of dribble attempts.},

  abstract     = {The application of Middle-sized Car-like Robots (MCRs) in indoor and outdoor road scenarios is becoming broader and broader. To achieve the goal of stable and efficient movement of the MCRs on the road, a motion planning algorithm based on the Hybrid Potential Field Model (HPFM) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the artificial potential field model improved with the eye model is used to generate a safe and smooth initial path that meets the road constraints. Then, the path constraints such as curvatures and obstacle avoidance are converted into an unconstrained weighted objective function. The efficient least-squares &amp; quasi-Newton fusion algorithm is used to optimize the initial path to obtain a smooth path curve suitable for the MCR. Finally, the speed constraints are converted into a weighted objective function based on the path curve to get the best speed profile. Numerical simulation and practical prototype experiments are carried out on different road scenes to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results show that re-planned trajectories can satisfy the path constraints and speed constraints. The real-time re-planning period is 184 ms, which demonstrates the proposed approach’s effectiveness and feasibility.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a control framework for cooperative robot manipulation based on distributed optimisation. Besides transporting a jointly grasped rigid object, whole-body avoidance of dynamic obstacles for the entire multi-robot system in uncertain environments is also part of the task. Since the physical connection through grasping can significantly reduce the operation capability of the system, internal performance of individual robots should be optimised during task execution. For this purpose, a framework for the characterisation of robot joint-space constraints and their inclusion into a highly multi-goal optimisation problem for the aforementioned reactive manipulation is designed. A computationally and communicationally efficient distributed optimal control algorithm based on primal decomposition is then developed for the multi-robot system to reach the optimum without generating internal conflicting forces in spite of different fields of view. Experiments on a multi-arm platform are conducted for validation. Results not only show effective coordinated avoidance of moving obstacles, but also demonstrate the benefit of optimising internal performance during cooperation.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory generation is a fundamental problem for every type of robot. In most applications, the robots should reach their goals in the minimum time possible. Time-optimal trajectory generation allows us to solve this problem. The generation of such trajectories for multirotors has gained traction with new applications in transport, delivery and search and rescue missions, as well as other applications in sports and entertainment such as drone racing. The current state-of-the-art is heavily based on polynomial methods and most methods choose a conservative approach when limiting the velocity or acceleration as a way to account for nonlinearities and guarantee feasibility, which limits time optimality and trajectory speed. We overcome this limitation by proposing a new formulation for multirotors trajectory generation that takes into account nonlinearities such as gravity and aerodynamic drag, It allows us to provide more time-optimal solutions then the state-of-the-art. We present an algorithm that uses our new formulation for near time-optimal trajectory generation for multirotors subject to obstacles/path constraints.

Falling analysis and postural stability algorithms based on it can abstain the subjects from inflicting those injuries. In this research, a subject using ASR-EXO, a newly developed lower-limb exoskeleton, has been modeled and co-simulated with MSC ADAMS and Matlab. To posit novel postural stability strategies, Centroidal Moment Pivot (CMP) is utilized for a person wearing ASR-EXO. Further, a new strategy of balance named Trunk’s Angular Jerk (TAJ) is introduced. The strategies are implemented in MSC ADAMS Matlab co-simulation using a PD controller. When the subject ascends stairs, four phenomena of leaning, abnormal heel contact, toe abrasion, and toe-stair contact happen that can be used as four signs indicating the direction of falling. They can imply falling forward or backward. The four phenomena would leave their impact on the amplitude of the peak of Trunk’s Translational Acceleration (TTA), Trunk’s Angular Acceleration (TAA), and time derivative of TTA. Based on a comparison between these peaks during balanced and unbalanced stair climbing, the Trunk’s Translational and Angular Acceleration (TTAA) algorithm is introduced. It defines safe boundaries on the magnitude of these peaks, based on simulation and experimental data and consequently, relates the four phenomena to the falling directions. Moreover, the TTAA calculates the right time for Postural Stability Torques (PSTs) to be exerted by ASR-EXO and keeps the mentioned parameters in their safe domains. The TTAA algorithm can guarantee the Postural Stability of the subject with only a torque of 6 N.m, instead of 30 N.m and 200 N.m of CMP and TAJ algorithms respectively.},

In this work, we create a bioinspired robot with a blended physical and virtual impedance control to configure the robot’s mechatronic setup. We consider human neural control and musculoskeletal system a blueprint for a hopping robot. The hybrid electric-pneumatic actuator (EPA) presents an artificial copy of this biological system to implement the blended control. By defining efficacy as a metric that encompasses both performance and efficiency, we demonstrate that incorporating a simple force-based control besides constant pressure pneumatic artificial muscles (PAM) alone can increase the efficiency up to 21% in simulations and 7% in experiments with the 2-segmented EPA-hopper robot. Also, we show that with proper adjustment of the force-based controller and the PAMs, efficacy can be further increased to 41%. Finally, experimental results with the 3-segmented EPA-hopper robot and comparisons with human hopping confirm the extendability of the proposed methods to more complex robots.},

In the previous studies, the parameters of this guidance law are tuned by trial and error and are constant, during the flight. In this research, it will be shown that the optimal value of these parameters depends on the initial conditions of the problem and the wind conditions. For this reason, a fuzzy system is proposed to generate the instantaneous optimal value of these parameters, in such a way that the flying vehicle converges to the desired path in less time and follows it more accurately, in the presence of wind. For this purpose, a cost function is defined to penalize the distance from the desired path and the control effort. Then, the parameters of the fuzzy system are optimized for different initial and wind conditions. During the flight, the optimized fuzzy systems determine the parameters of the guidance algorithm in an online manner, in such a way that the desired path is better followed. The obtained results show that online adjustment of the PLOS guidance law improves its performance in the presence of wind by about 20%.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a new path tracker is proposed for autonomous robots by re-designing a classical obstacle avoidance algorithm “Follow the Gap Method (FGM)”. Until now, FGM is not used to track a global plan of consecutive waypoints dynamically yet. On the other hand, this is a very fundamental requirement for autonomous robots. To use the FGM as a dynamic tracker, the proposed methodology is borrowing the “Look Ahead Distance” (LAD) from geometric path tracking methods and adapting it to the local planner. The LAD is defined as the distance from the robot to the desired waypoint on the path to be tracked. In the proposed solution, a dynamic and optimized LAD for the local planner is defined which is automatically adjusted by the robot velocity. The dynamic LAD function is optimized to increase tracking, avoidance, and comfort capabilities. This study is the first one that uses FGM together with a global planner as part of a whole autonomous system. Another novelty of the paper is the optimization of LAD. In this study, the LAD is optimized by taking into account not only the tracking error but also the distance to obstacle and comfort metrics simultaneously, for the first time in literature. The optimization is performed with various weight coefficients in the cost function. Three metrics are used to compare the effect of weight coefficients on the optimization. These metrics are the Root Mean Square (RMS) values of “Distance to Path”, “Distance to Obstacle” and “Magnitude of Total Acceleration”. For instance according to the experiments, when the tracking coefficient is doubled in optimization, the distance to path metric comes from 0,424m to 1,23m, indicating that the robot is tracking better. Similar effects on other metrics are observed when the related coefficients are changed. Besides the simulations, real-world experiments are performed on the real autonomous wheelchair platform to show the real-time performance of the proposed approach.},

Attributes to the optimal design, the number of Degrees of Actuations (DoA) reduces to two in each hindlimb, which realizes miniaturization in the current study. Kinematic analysis is conducted to analyze the locomotion of the spatial mechanism. The hydrodynamic model based on the blade element theory is established to estimate the swimming performance of the designed mechanism.

  abstract     = {Autonomous ground/aerial vehicles (UGVs/UAVs) boost many potential applications over past few years, but it usually takes a long time or a large price to fully recharge or refuel a vehicle, so it is extremely important to make efficient routing decisions for autonomous vehicles with limited fuel capacity. This paper elaborates the uninterrupted cruising requirements for autonomous vehicles and the influence of limited fuel capacity on the routing policies. We provide a proof that the basic cruising problem is NP-hard in the general case, though the previous work formulated it as a polynomial problem based on some oversimplified assumptions, which result in a degraded performance under the condition of limited fuel capacity. This is formulated as a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem, which is difficult to solve in general. Furthermore, we observed that the nature of the limited fuel capacity is a limitation on the solution space of the cruising problem, which motivated us to construct an efficient heuristic solution by applying the fuel constraints iteratively on the shortest path that can be obtained in polynomial time. Since targets are usually requested in an online way in real cruising applications, we design a sliding window-based algorithm, so that a tradeoff can be made between the routing efficiency and the computation complexity by adjusting the window size. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed scheme reduces the computation complexity by at least 13 times, simultaneously with performance improvements by about 7% in terms of fuel consumption than the alternative algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Place recognition and loop detection play an important role in the outdoor simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). In this paper, we present a place recognition and navigation method based on the random forest algorithm for outdoor mobile robot with three-dimensional (3D) laser point cloud data. The 3D point cloud-based place recognition employs a global feature extractor composed of well-designed geometric and statistical features without preprocessing for the effective training and construction of the random forest classifier. Then, the environment point cloud and node map are fed into the classifier for the place recognition task. The place recognition method is subsequently applied to the loop detection of the mobile robots. To begin with, the odometry pose nodes are sorted according to their location and distance, and are then fed into the random forest classifier for loop discrimination. Eventually, loop verification based on the overlap rate of two point clouds is performed to identify the true loop. The loop detection method is combined with S4-SLAM proposed earlier by us to form the new S4-SLAM2 algorithm. Node maps constructed via S4-SLAM2 perform global re-localization in the given map by combining the place recognition method and the point cloud registration. The proposed method was verified by extensive evaluations using the KITTI dataset, as well as real-world scenarios of outdoor environments. The loop detection recall was determined as 82%, with 100% precision. The S4-SLAM2 system also exhibited high localization and mapping accuracies, with a localization output rate of 10 Hz and an average localization drift lower than 1%.},

Each WRC is a standalone module composed of a wireless communication unit, a processing unit, and sensor(s)/actuator(s) to perform a specific function. The WRC architecture is described generically by UML diagrams to lead the development of WRC-based robotic systems. The proposed framework customizes the UML diagrams based on the analysis of the robot platform, its assigned task, and the operational environment. Then the WRC behavioral design specifications are translated to the formalism of CPNs. The developer complements the CPNs to generate a module per each WRC into a hierarchical CPN. The WRC architecture and the development framework are used to implement an Ackermann steering robot and differential drive robots to perform the tasks of wall-following and exploration while avoiding obstacles, respectively. The validation schema follows three phases: simulation, hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation, and physical implementation of mobile robots configured with the appropriate WRCs. The experimental results validate the development framework using standard and formal modeling tools to guide the implementation of robotic systems build with WRCs.},

In this paper, the use of neural network-based nonlinear controller structures which consist of recurrent and feedforward layers have been examined in the dynamically stable walking problem of two-legged robots. In detail, hybrid neural controllers, in which long short-term memory type of neuron models employed at recurrent layers, are utilized in the feedback and feedforward paths. To train these neural networks, supervised learning data sets are created by using a biped robot platform which is controlled by a central pattern generator. Then, the ability of the neural networks to perform stable gait by controlling the robot platform is examined under various ground conditions in the simulation environment. After that, the stable walking generation capacity of the neural networks and the central pattern generators are compared with each other. It is shown that the inclusion of recurrent layer provides smooth transition and control between stance and flight motion phases and $$L_2$$ regularization is beneficial for walking performance. Finally, the proposed hybrid neural network models are found to be more successful gait controllers than the central pattern generator, which is employed to generate data sets used in training.},

To achieve a better trade-off among positioning accuracy, running time and model size, two MobileNetv3 and GhostNet-based modified YOLOv3 (MGBM-YOLO) models are proposed in this paper: MGBM-YOLO-Large and MGBM-YOLO-Small, which are applied to the robotic grasping system of bolster spring based on image-based visual servoing (IBVS). The proposed MGBM-YOLO models are trained and evaluated on Pascal VOC2007 and Pascal VOC2012 datasets. The results show that compared with the original YOLOv3 model based on Darknet53, the sizes of the proposed Large and Small models are reduced by 59% and 66% respectively, and the model parameters are reduced by 63% and 66% respectively. The detection speed is 4× and 5.5× faster respectively when the difference of mAP is small. To improve the convergence speed of IBVS system, an online depth estimation method based on the area feature of detection bounding box of bolster spring is proposed. The comparative experiments of visual servoing grasping are conducted on the robotic grasping platform of bolster spring. The experimental results show that the two MGBM-YOLO detection models proposed in this paper can meet the requirements of fast detection and positioning of bolster spring robotic grasping system based on IBVS. The proposed method of feature depth online estimation is of great significance to accelerate the convergence speed of visual servoing system.},

  abstract     = {3D map exploration is one of key technologies in robotics. However, finding an optimal exploration path is a challenge due to unknown environments. This research proposed the Topological Fourier Sparse Set (TFSS) algorithm to enable an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to explore 3D environments with theoretical guarantees. The algorithm combines the Rips complex with Fourier sparse set representation to take the advantages of topological and submodular approaches. More specifically, the Rips complex is used for expanding the exploration subgoals, while the Fourier sparse set encodes a learned representation of the subgoal selection problem in the form of a submodular optimization problem. Since the objective function of spatial exploration is reformulated as a maximizing submodular function with path constraints, greedy algorithms can achieve $\frac {1}{2}(1-e^{-1})$ of the optimum. Experiments conducted with this algorithm demonstrates that the TFSS explores unknown environments $25\% \sim 127\%$ more than the NBV algorithm does. The TFSS exploration performance is close to the SFSS but it is 50 times faster than the SFSS.},

In this paper, we have combined the characteristics of USV and AUV to design a hybrid energy positive buoyancy autonomous vehicle that satisfies requirements for water surface and underwater operations. The vehicle maintains positive buoyancy and underwater motion is achieved through thruster propulsion, inverted V rudder adjustment attitude, and using the lift generated by its wing to counteract the buoyancy force. Therefore, the vehicle does not need to carry a complicated variable buoyancy device, and the space saved can carry more energy or payload. The hybrid energy technology of solar batteries and lithium batteries will also be used to improve the endurance of the positive buoyancy autonomous vehicle. The main contributions of this article are new solutions to the challenges of combined water surface and underwater motions, the optimization design of the vehicle, the development of the required control algorithms, and the demonstration of the vehicle successfully surface sailing, entering, diving, underwater sailing, and exiting the water. The results of the lake test demonstrate that the positive buoyancy autonomous vehicle has desired motion performance, high safety, and strong adaptability to the environment.},

Although this problem has been addressed by the community, the usual approach is to identify the moving objects and remove them from contributing to the localization and mapping algorithm. Conversely, the proposed strategy integrates the moving objects in the vehicle motions estimation, without compromising its accuracy. The proposed solution is based on the design of: i) an extended Kalman filter (EKF); ii) a modified version of the multiple hypothesis tracking method to perform data association and track moving objects; and iii) and the interacting multiple model algorithm to identify the motion models described by the environment’s objects. The performance of the devised SLAMMOT filter is studied in simulation and validated with a new public experimental dataset using an RGB-D camera on-board an instrumented quadrotor with ground-truth.},

A prototype of multi-sectional soft reinforced actuator with new joint is fabricated to move like a human finger and generate the distal interphalangeal (DIP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint angles. Finite element method is employed to demonstrate the behavior of the robot and also an analytical model is presented to predict its joints angle in terms of the internal pressure. The effect of a geometric parameter of the joint is investigated on the tip displacement of the robot, the DIP and the PIP joint angles. Due to the fact that the relation between pressure and joint angles is unclear, an equation is proposed for estimation of the DIP and PIP angles as a function of the pressure. Finally, comparing the angles of the robot joints with the angle of the human finger shows that the proposed design can move like a human finger.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel hybrid controller for promoting safe human-robot interaction. The hybrid controller modifies a model-based impedance controller such that it uses impedance control but switches to sliding mode control under non-nominal conditions. Each control law is formulated with an inner-loop controller for feedback linearization and an outer-loop feedback controller for trajectory tracking. The outer-loop feedback torque is theoretically proven to have a smaller magnitude in hybrid control than in impedance control under an assumed condition, suggesting it may be the safer approach. To validate the mathematical assumption and purpose of the controller, a walking experiment is conducted where a healthy able-bodied subject using a lower-limb exoskeleton is randomly subjected to either hybrid or impedance control. Perturbations are induced through sudden changes in treadmill speed, resulting in operation outside nominal conditions for 15.9% of the experiment. The assumption made in the theory holds true for the majority of the experiment, failing only 14.3% of the time. The main results show a statistically significant reduction in average feedback torque magnitudes by 7.9%. This is accomplished without drastically affecting gait, with joint angle root-mean-square differences being 0.36° for the hip and 0.64° for the knee. This demonstrates how the hybrid controller can achieve similar gait patterns with lower feedback torque magnitudes, suggesting it is a promising alternative to impedance control.},

  abstract     = {Evapotranspiration (ET) estimation is important in precision agriculture water management, such as evaluating soil moisture, drought monitoring, and assessing crop water stress. As a traditional method, evapotranspiration estimation using crop coefficient (Kc) has been commonly used. Since there are strong similarities between the Kc curve and the vegetation index curve, the crop coefficient Kc is usually estimated as a function of the vegetation index. Researchers have developed linear regression models for the Kc and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), usually derived from satellite imagery. However, the spatial resolution of the satellite image is often insufficient for crops with clumped canopy structures, such as vines and trees. Therefore, in this article, the authors used Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to collect high-resolution multispectral imagery in a pomegranate orchard located at the USDA-ARS, San Joaquin Valley Agricultural Sciences Center, Parlier, CA. The Kc values were measured from a weighing lysimeter and the NDVI values were derived from UAV imagery. Then, the authors established a relationship between the NDVI and Kc by using a linear regression model and a stochastic configuration networks (SCN) model, respectively. Based on the research results, the linear regression model has an R2 of 0.975 and RMSE of 0.05. The SCN regression model has an R2 and RMSE value of 0.995 and 0.046, respectively. Compared with the linear regression model, the SCN model improved performance in predicting Kc from NDVI. Then, actual evapotranspiration was estimated and compared with lysimeter data in an experimental pomegranate orchard. The UAV imagery provided a spatial and tree-by-tree view of ET distribution.},

By analysing the travelling time of robots on different paths using Petri Nets, the optimal configuration of paths is selected. The prime objective is to avoid congestion when routing many robots into a narrow area. The movements of robots are controlled at every intersection by organising a one-by-one passing of the robots. Controls are available for the robots which are able to communicate and share information with each other. To avoid collision with humans and other moving objects (i.e. robots), a dipole field integrated with a dynamic window approach is developed. By considering the velocity and direction of the dynamic obstacles as sources of a virtual magnetic dipole moment, the dipole-dipole interaction between different moving objects will generate repulsive forces proportional to the velocity to prevent collisions. The whole system is presented on the widely used platform Robot Operating System (ROS) so that its implementation is extendable to real robots. Analysis and experiments are demonstrated with extensive simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {The rapid and orderly evacuation of passengers at the railway hub station in case of emergencies is an important issue for railway safety and efficiency. In this paper, a robot-guided passenger evacuation method is proposed to help passengers search evacuation paths and avoid potential risks. The number and initial positions of robots are determined by using a k-means clustering approach. The exit assignment and evacuation paths of robots are calculated by using a hybrid bi-level optimization approach taking into account the cooperative mechanism between robots. Then, a robot-guided crowd evacuation dynamical model is built based on a modified social force model, in which a navigation force is introduced to influence the speed and direction of evacuees. A case study of a typical railway hub station is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The scenarios of the mall and platform are designed to verify the evacuation efficiency under different robot distribution schemes. The experimental results prove that setting up robots can effectively reduce evacuation time, and the utilization of exits is more balanced. The proposed optimal scheme shows the best performance in evacuation efficiency, including evacuation time and exit utilization rate, compared to the uniform distribution scheme and no robot scheme.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a graph-based, potential-guided method for path planning problems in unknown environments, where obstacles are unknown until the robots are in close proximity to the obstacle locations. Inspired by the Fokker-Planck equation and the intermittent diffusion process, the proposed method generates a tree connecting the initial and target configurations, and then finds a path on it using the available environmental information. The tree and path are updated iteratively when newly encountered obstacle information becomes available. The resulting method is a deterministic procedure proven to be complete, i.e., it is guaranteed to find a feasible path, when one exists, in a finite number of iterations. The method is scalable to high-dimensional problems. In addition, our method does not search the entire domain for the path, instead, the algorithm only explores a sub-region that can be described by the evolution of the Fokker-Planck equation on graph with a changing of diffusion coefficient intermittently. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm via several numerical examples with different environments and dimensions, including high-dimensional cases.},

The propulsion mechanism is an articulating torso followed by a flexible caudal fin to provide thrust. The trunk is an assemblage of five ABS-plastic vertebrae driven by an actuator through a pair of wires, whereas the caudal fin is a silicone-rubber lunate-shaped tail coupled to the last vertebra. MEMS 3-axis sensors measured the linear acceleration experienced by the rigid head, articulated trunk, and compliant caudal fin at different undulation frequencies with the robotic fish prototype suspended in still water. The transverse acceleration measured was approximated as the reaction force exerted by the water on a propulsive element that accelerates the surrounding water. Subsequently, the caudal fin midline motion was analyzed by video processing to compare with the subcarangiform swimming kinematics model and to depict the normal force vectors in an undulation excursion. This study provides a feasible alternative to quantify the normal force generated by propulsive elements in bio-inspired propulsion mechanisms by using low-cost MEMS sensors to complement other well-suited techniques.},

  abstract     = {The exploration of underwater narrow space is of great significance to study the phenomena, process and laws of life in the ocean. The existing underwater robots are not suitable for the underwater narrow area exploration. Beavers use the hind limbs with webfeet to provide power for flexible movement and possess certain underwater operation ability. In this study, based on the bionic prototype of beaver hind limb, the system structure of beaver-like hind limb is designed, and the paddling motion of beaver-like hind limb is realized by combining servos with rope drive. On this basis, the concept of swimming gait is proposed, and swimming process of beavers with one leg and two legs is analyzed, and the movement sequence of various joints and parts in the swimming is studied. Then, the joint angle data of beavers from the video are obtained and a nonlinear oscillation swimming controller based on Fourier technology is proposed to plan the bionic swimming trajectory of the beaver. Further, the swimming efficiency of the beaver-like hind limb is analyzed, and a model of the swimming efficiency is proposed, which can provide a basis for evaluating its swimming effect. Finally, an experimental platform for the swimming of the beaver-like hind limb is set up, and bionic and reconstruction of the swimming gaits are generated by the nonlinear oscillation swimming controller, and the swimming experiment is carried out. The results show that the propulsion efficiencies of the alternate and synchronous bionic gait are 0.5 × 10−3 and 0.6 × 10−3, higher than those of the generated gaits which are 0.2 × 10−3 and 0.3 × 10−3. This verifies the rationality of the beaver swimming, and lays a theoretical foundation for the swimming realization of the beaver-like hind limb, which provides theoretical support for us to further understand the swimming mechanism of the beaver.},

This work presents a compliant leg configuration that can meet the requirements of the SLIP model. The leg is characterized by the fact that most of the mass is concentrated in the hip, and the leg is spring-like and light in weight. Numerical models were introduced to analyze the stiffness of the leg, and its dynamic characteristics with the mass of the leg being taken into account. Using the proposed model, the analysis on the stiffness showed that the leg could be taken as a variable stiffness spring with respect to the length of the leg, the longer the leg, the greater the stiffness. In addition to this, it suggested that the mass of the leg should be maintained below one-tenth of the mass concentrated in the hip to perform spring-like walking. Experiments regarding the stiffness and dynamic characteristics showed a good agreement with the simulation results, thus verifying the presented leg configuration and the numerical models. Afterwards, experiments were conducted on vertical jumps of the leg, demonstrating the feasibility of the leg to perform the biped’s spring-like walking, regardless of being at a certain speed, or at varying speeds.},

  abstract     = {Despite its various outdoor applications, the operation of quadrotors is restricted under strong winds due to their small size. Since the battery energy overconsumptions induced by the winds may lead to a mission failure, it is desirable to identify the tendency of excess battery energy and operable wind conditions according to ground speed, wind speed, and weight class of industrial quadrotors. This study suggests a multidisciplinary simulation that estimates the overall performance required to resist the winds and the corresponding battery energy. Flight endurance of lightweight and middleweight quadrotors was examined under light, moderate, and strong breeze modeled by von Kármán wind turbulence with Beaufort wind force scale. As a result, it is found that the excess battery energy is increased with ground speed, even under the same wind conditions. As the ground speed increases, the airspeed is increased, led to higher frame drag, position error, pitch angle, and required mechanical power, consequently. Also, it is found that the lightweight quadrotor is more limited in the operation under the winds than the middleweight, regardless of remained battery energy and ground speed. Beyond a certain wind and ground speed, the required rotational speed of propellers exceeds the speed limit of motors, which is checked by the duty ratio of motors that goes over 100%. With smaller radius and faster rotation speed of propellers, the higher duty ratios of the lightweight class quadrotor under the winds than those of the middleweight is observed.},

  abstract     = {Path tracking has a significant impact on the success of long-term autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) missions in terms of safety, energy-saving, and efficiency. However, it is a challenging problem due to the model uncertainty, and ocean current disturbance. Moreover, the widely used line of sight (LOS) algorithm with fixed lookahead distance does not perform well because it requires an urgent need for the automatic adjustment of the parameter. Considering the above, this study proposes an adaptive line-of-sight (ALOS) guidance method with reinforcement learning (RL) based on the dynamic data-driven AUV model (DDDAM). Firstly, we introduced a detailed AUV dynamic model mainly including the models with and without current influence. Next, we conducted a detailed analysis of the path tracking error dynamics and the factors influencing the tracking performance based on the model proposed above. We then used the DDDAM (using long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network) to pre-train the RL framework to generate more samples for online learning in order to speed up the learning process. Finally, the deterministic policy gradient (DPG) based RL was designed to optimize the continuously varying lookahead distance considering the previously analyzed factors. Collectively, this paper presents simulation cases and an evaluation of the algorithm. Our results indicate that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of path tracking with effectiveness and robustness.},

This paper presents the use of multiple models as a strategy for a team of unmanned aerial vehicles to track a target of unknown behaviour. It combines the T Test criteria in a novel manner for model selection with a distributed extended Kalman filter. The algorithm is validated in both simulation and live indoor trials with a team unmanned aerial vehicles and an evasive target. Results show that using multiple models with the T Test outperforms the traditional single model methods as well as other commonly used approaches, such as the interacting multiple model and maximum likelihood methods. Furthermore, the distributed nature of the drone system provides for robust estimation, as demonstrated in live tests with occlusions present.},

By employing a natural user interface, this novel approach leverages the conventional fine-tuning control, turning it into a direct body pose capture process. The proposed approach is comprised of two main parts. The first is a nonlinear customizable pose mapping based on Thin-Plate Splines (TPS), to directly transfer human body motion to robotic arm motion in a nonlinear fashion, thus allowing matching dissimilar bodies with different workspace shapes and kinematic constraints. The second is a Deep Neural Network hand-state classifier based on Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) that exploits the temporal coherence of the acquired depth data. We validate, evaluate and compare our approach through both classical cross-validation experiments of the proposed hand state classifier; and user studies over a set of practical experiments involving variants of pick-and-place and manufacturing tasks. Results revealed that LRCNs outperform single image Convolutional Neural Networks; and that users’ learning curves were steep, thus allowing the successful completion of the proposed tasks. When compared to a previous approach, the TPS approach revealed no increase in task complexity and similar times of completion, while providing more precise operation in regions closer to workspace boundaries.},

  abstract     = {With the development of smart warehouses in Industry 4.0, scheduling a fleet of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) for transporting and sorting parcels has become a new development trend. In smart warehouses, AGVs receive paths from the multi-AGV scheduling system and independently sense the surrounding environment while sending poses as interactive information. This navigation method relies heavily on on-board sensors and significantly increases the information interactions within the system. Under this situation, a solution that locates multiple AGVs in global images of the warehouse by top cameras is expected to have a great effect. However, traditional tracking algorithms cannot output the heading angles required by the AGV navigation and their real-time performance and calculation accuracy cannot satisfy the tracking of large-scale AGVs. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-AGV tracking system that integrates a multi-AGV scheduling system, AprilTag system, improved YOLOv5 with the oriented bounding box (OBB), extended Kalman filtering (EKF), and global vision to calculate the coordinates and heading angles of AGVs. Extensive experiments prove that in addition to less time complexity, the multi-AGV tracking system can efficiently track a fleet of AGVs with higher positioning accuracy than traditional navigation methods and other tracking algorithms based on various location patterns.},

Search for specific target objects is usually a required activity. This work aimed to propose a visual semantic navigation with memory architecture model. Based on recent advances in convolutional neural networks and graph neural networks, a visual semantic navigation architecture model (GCN-MLP) was extended with recurrent neural networks for memory mechanisms (GCN-GRU and GCN-LSTM) while exposing a robot agent in navigation experiences to learn navigation policies. The models were evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively, where memory enhanced models demonstrated early convergence, better performance in evaluation metrics, increased successfully terminated episodes, more efficient path trajectories, and lower decrease in performance when exposed to challenger test scheme, presenting a more exploratory behavior. Finally, were analyzed differences between GRU and LSTM, where GRU performed similarly to LSTM in some cases, being a viable option.},

  abstract     = {In the last decade, a great effort has been employed in the study of Hybrid Unmanned Aerial Underwater Vehicles, robots that can easily fly and dive into the water with different levels of mechanical adaptation. However, most of this literature is concentrated on physical design, practical issues of construction, and, more recently, low-level control strategies. Little has been done in the context of high-level intelligence, such as motion planning and interactions with the real world. Therefore, we proposed in this paper a trajectory planning approach that allows collision avoidance against unknown obstacles and smooth transitions between aerial and aquatic media. Our method is based on a variant of the classic Rapidly-exploring Random Tree, whose main advantages are the capability to deal with obstacles, complex nonlinear dynamics, model uncertainties, and external disturbances. The approach uses the dynamic model of the HyDrone, a hybrid vehicle proposed with high underwater performance, but we believe it can be easily generalized to other types of aerial/aquatic platforms. In the experimental section, we present simulated results in environments filled with obstacles, where the robot is commanded to perform different media movements, demonstrating the applicability of our strategy.},

  abstract     = {To improve the detection accuracy and speed of palletizing robot positioning bolts in complex scenes, we proposed a positioning bolt (PB) detection method based on improved YOLO-V3. First, due to the actual detection requirement, we constructed the PB data set by using a series of data enhancement operations such as horizontal flip, ± 30degree rotation, and random luminance enhancement or decrease. Then, an improved anchor box mechanism based on the k-means++ algorithm was designed to obtain a more accurate anchor box for the PB data. According to the feature of the PB data in the palletizing robot, such as the existence of dust and dirt on the surface, the feature extraction network was further enhanced by adding a Densenet-4 module. In this way, the low-level semantics and high-level abstract features can be extracted effectively to improve detection performance. Finally, a new bounding box regression loss function was elaborated to accelerate the neural network training. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed improvement mechanisms. The comparable results also show that our method is superior to the original YOLO-V3, SSD, and Faster R-CNN for PB data, and has a detection AP of 86.7%, a recall rate of 97%, and a detection speed of 25.47 FPS, which can achieve high-efficiency and high-precision detection in complex industrial scenarios.},

It provides a means to rectify the drift error, which is typically accumulated along a robot’s trajectory. In this article we propose an LCD method based on tracked visual features, combined with a signal peak-trace filtering approach for loop-closure identification. In particular, local binary features are firstly extracted and tracked through consecutive frames. This way online visual words are generated, which in turn form an incremental bag of visual words (BoVW) vocabulary. Loop-closures (LCs) result from a classification method, which considers current and past state peaks on the similarity matrix. The system discerns the movement of the peaks to identify whether they come about to be true-positive detections or background noise. The suggested peak-trace filtering technique provides exceeding robustness to noisy signals, enabling the usage of only a handful of visual local features per image; thus resulting into a considerably downsized visual vocabulary.},

At present, the commonly used physical human-machine interface can only obtain motion after the movement occurs. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the non-rhythmic movement. The inherent intent detection hysteresis exist in the physical human-machine interface. The cognition based human-machine interface directly detect the neural electrical signals of the human body, and has the characteristics of advanced motion detection. However, the existing methods based on the Hill muscle mechanics model mostly set muscle parameters based on experience. It is difficult to accurately predict joint torque of different subjects because of the parameter difference of the muscle model. Therefore, in this paper, we proposes a three-step muscle parameters identification paradigm for Hill muscle model based on exoskeleton robots. Then, the Adam optimizer with variable learning rate is employed to identify the muscle parameters. Eight healthy subjects are participated in the experiment. The results show that the proposed Adam optimizer with variable learning rate can make the parameters stably convergence. The estimated torque of the identified Hill muscle model have lower error than that of the neural network-based method. The performance of the proposed method is competitive with that of the State-of-art method.},

Quantitative experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed shape completion network and demonstrate that our network outperforms existing methods. Besides, TransSC is integrated into a grasp evaluation network to generate a set of grasp candidates. The simulation experiment shows that TransSC improves the grasping generation result compared to the existing shape completion baselines.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose and validate a Joint-Initiative Supervised Autonomy (JISA) framework for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Through JISA, a robot maintains a measure of its self-confidence (SC) while performing a task, and only prompts the human supervisor for help when its SC drops. At the same time, a human supervisor can intervene in the tasks being performed, based on his/her Situation Awareness (SA). This paper outlines JISA, presents a guideline for defining the tasks to be supervised, and defines the robot SC and human SA attributes. The paper presents a generic block-diagram to apply JISA in various autonomous systems, and provides detailed proof-of-concept (POC) examples for applying JISA. The selected POCs aim to prove the applicability and utility of JISA through two different applications: grid-based collaborative simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and automated jigsaw puzzle reconstruction. In both POCs, the robot SC and human SA attributes are defined in accordance with JISA’s guidelines. In addition, augmented reality (AR) and two-dimensional graphical user interfaces (GUI) are custom-designed to enhance the human SA and allow intuitive interaction between the human and the agent. The superiority of the JISA framework over existing full-autonomy approaches is demonstrated in experiments. In SLAM, JISA eliminates the need for post processing of SLAM maps and reduces the required mapping time by ${\sim }50\%$ . In automated puzzle reconstruction, JISA outperforms two solutions: full autonomy and on-demand human intervention prompted by the agent, reaching a reconstruction accuracy of 97.2%.},

  abstract     = {Enabling robots to provide effective assistance yet still accommodating the operator’s commands for telemanipulation of an object is very challenging because robot’s assistance is not always intuitive for human operators and human behaviors and preferences are sometimes ambiguous for the robot to interpret. Due to the difference in hand structures, some motion assistance from the robot may surprise the operator with counter-intuitive movements, which could introduce more burden to the human to correct the actions and/or reduce the operator’s sense of system control. To address these problems, we developed a novel preference-aware assistance knowledge learning approach. An assistance preference model learns what assistance is preferred by a human, and a stage-wise model updating method ensures the learning stability while dealing with the ambiguity of human preference data. Such a preference-aware assistance knowledge enables a teleoperated robot hand to provide more active yet preferred assistance toward manipulation success. We also developed knowledge transfer methods to transfer the preference knowledge across different robot hand structures to avoid extensive robot-specific training. Experiments to telemanipulate a 3-finger hand and 2-finger hand, respectively, to use, move, and hand over a cup have been conducted. Results demonstrated that the methods enabled the robots to effectively learn the preference knowledge and allowed knowledge transfer between robots with less training effort.},

For this reason, a robot skill learning framework based on compliant movement primitives is proposed in this paper. The framework consists of four modules: kinesthetic teaching, task learning, compliant movement primitive library, and task generalization. Specifically, the trajectories are collected from the kinematics of the robot, and the stiffness profiles are collected from the designed variable stiffness interface based on stiffness optimization; then the collected data is optimized, segmented, and learned to create the robot’s compliant movement primitive library; the primitives in the library are adjusted and combined to generate the robot’s desired trajectory and desired stiffness, which are then input into the dynamics-based variable impedance controller; thereafter the controller drives the robot to perform the desired compliant motion and complete various tasks. The framework covers the entire process of robot skill learning and application, and the proposed compliant movement primitives can simultaneously achieve the robot’s trajectory learning and interactive compliance learning. The experiment of the robot learning to press buttons was carried out on a universal 6-DOF collaborative robot. The experimental results prove the effectiveness and safety of the framework and show its application value.},

The primary aim of this study is to unveil a clear categorization overview for more than a decade worth of substantial progress in UAVs. The paper will begin with a general overview of the advancements, followed by an up-to-date explanation of the different mechanical structures and technical elements that have been included. The paper will then explore and examine various vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) configurations, followed by expressing the dynamics, applicable simulation tools and control strategies for a Quadrotor. In conclusion to this review, the dynamic system presented will always face limitations such as internal and/or external disturbances. Hence, this can be minimised by the choice of introducing appropriate control techniques or mechanical enhancements.},

However, very few works deal with the firefighting process using UAVs and most of these consider only simulation and planning methods but not actual concept implementation and validation. This work describes the design, construction and test of a novel light-weight tethered UAV with mixed multi-rotor and water jet propulsion for forest fire fighting. The challenges in conceiving such system are presented and discussed. This analysis leads to a set of requirements and specifications for the system. A full-scale realization of the UAV is presented and tested in the field in a simulated fire drill. It is demonstrated that taking advantage of the water jet propulsion combined with a multi-rotor propulsion contributes to increase the flight endurance.},

Existing static environment-based AUV path planners do not work well in dynamic ocean environments. A novel onboard sensing system-based AUV path planning strategy is proposed, and it is suitable for a regional dynamic environment to improve the energy utilization efficiency of an AUV working in a small-scale and dynamic mission area. Firstly, unlike the existing methods, the onboard sensing system including horizontal acoustic doppler current profile and detecting sonar is used to obtain environmental information, and the probabilistic multiple hypothesis tracker and Kalman filter are employed to carry out multi-step prediction of the environment. After that, the differential evolution algorithm is introduced as the optimizer, and a novel prediction-based path evaluator is designed to evaluate the fitness of possible paths. Besides, a novel prediction-based online re-planning strategy is designed, which is beneficial to reduce the impact of forecast error and the planning is thus closed-loop. Finally, multiple simulation experiments are designed to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the path planner, and the results show that the proposed planning strategy can reduce the AUV energy consumption by at least 4.6% compared with static environment-based planners.},

  abstract     = {Passive global localisation is defined as locating a robot on a map, under global pose uncertainty, without prescribing motion controls. The majority of current solutions either assume structured environments or require tuning of parameters relevant to establishing correspondences between sensor measurements and segments of the map. This article advocates for a solution that dispenses with both in order to achieve greater portability and universality across disparate static environments. A single 2D panoramic LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) sensor is used as the measurement device, this way reducing computational and investment costs. The proposed method disperses pose hypotheses on the map of the robot’s environment and then captures virtual scans from each of them. Subsequently, each virtual scan is matched against the one derived from the physical sensor. Angular alignment is performed via 2D Fourier-Mellin Invariant (FMI) matching; positional alignment is performed via feedback of the position estimation error. In order to deduce the robot’s pose the method sifts through hypotheses by using measures extracted from FMI. Simulations and experiments illustrate the efficacy of the proposed global localisation solution in realistic surroundings and scenarios. In addition, the proposed method is pitted against the most effective Iterative Closest Point (ICP) variant under the same task, and three conclusions are drawn. The first is that the proposed method is effective in both structured and unstructured environments. The second is that it concludes to fewer false positives. The third is that the two methods are largely equivalent in terms of pose error.},

In our framework, the feature extraction backbone is based on Res2Net combined with improved FPN. The fusion network neck adds a mask branch to the latest YOLO detector and embeds a bottleneck attention module. We address possible inference conflict between semantic segmentation and instance segmentation with a panoptic fusion head that resolves conflict using Dezert-Smarandache theory. We also constructed the first maritime scene parsing dataset MarPS-1395, which is completely and fully annotated. MarPS-1395 is the first panoptic segmentation dataset in this field. We validated our model on MarPS-1395 as well as the publicly available dataset to investigate the real-time performance and the accuracy of multitask implementation in panoptic segmentation, which included object detection and classification, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. The experimental results also show that our method can robustly accomplish full scene parsing in a complex maritime environment, and achieved a good balance between accuracy of segmentation and speed of computing.},

UAVs offer high-quality aerial imaging and the ability to perform quick, flexible and in-depth data acquisition over an area of interest. While navigating in remote environments, UAVs need to be capable of autonomously landing on complex terrains for security, safety and delivery reasons. This is extremely challenging as the structure of these terrains is often unknown, and no prior knowledge can be leveraged. In this study, we present a vision-based autonomous landing system for rotor wing UAVs equipped with a stereo camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The landing site detection algorithm introduces and evaluates several factors including terrain’s flatness, inclination and steepness. Considering these features we compute map metrics that are used to obtain a landing-score map, based on which we detect candidate landing sites. The 3D reconstruction of the scene is acquired by stereo processing and the pose of the UAV at any given time is estimated by fusing raw data from the inertial sensors with the pose obtained from stereo ORB-SLAM2. Real-world trials demonstrate successful landing in unknown and complex terrains such as suburban and forest areas.},

Autonomous soaring allows these aircraft to detect and exploit rising air masses (thermals) without user input, which greatly simplifies their operation. While previous research has focused on the detection and exploitation of thermal updraft, the initial turn at the entry point into the thermal has been ignored. This paper explores the initial turn decision at the instant of thermal detection in order to improve soaring performance by flying directly into the thermal. A high-fidelity simulation of an off-the-shelf RC glider is constructed, along with the Weather Research and Forecasting model to capture realistic thermal convection. The effects of turn decisions on thermalling performance are examined through a large batch simulation on a Matlab/Simulink environment. Thermalling algorithms are subsequently integrated into the PX4 flight stack for Software-in-the-Loop simulations and flight tests using a Pixhawk flight controller. Simulated and experimental results demonstrate the importance of turn decisions for improved overall soaring performance.},

Hence, it has become important that modern UAVs can accomplish their missions while maximizing their chances of survival. In this work, we specifically study the problem of identifying a short path from a designated start to a goal, while collecting all rewards and avoiding adversaries that move randomly on the grid. We also provide a possible application of the framework in a military setting, that of autonomous casualty evacuation. We present a comparison of three methods to solve this problem: namely we implement a Deep Q-Learning model, an $$\varepsilon$$ -greedy tabular Q-Learning model, and an online optimization framework. Our computational experiments, designed using simple grid-world environments with random adversaries showcase how these approaches work and compare them in terms of performance, accuracy, and computational time.},

Traditional coal moisture content detection mechanisms rely heavily on detection equipment, which can be expensive or difficult to deploy under field conditions. To achieve fast prediction of coal moisture content, a novel neural network model based on attention mechanism and bidirectional ResNet-LSTM structure (ABRM) is proposed in this paper. The prediction of coal moisture content is achieved by training the model to learn the relationship between changes of coal moisture content and meteorological conditions. The experimental results show that the proposed method has superior performance in terms of moisture content prediction accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art methods, and that ABRM model approaches appear to have the greatest potential for predicting coal moisture content shifts in the face of meteorological elements.},

  abstract     = {The development of algorithms capable of automatically generating optimal grasp involves first of all the necessity to define the notion of optimal grasp in relation to the target task. To address this problem, the scientific community offers many quality criteria in the literature and continues to propose new ones for grasp synthesis purpose. This paper aims at proposing a synthesis and a fine analysis of the quality criteria useful to evaluate a grasp in a context of adaptive grasping, as well as in the perspective of in-hand manipulation. These criteria are divided in two categories, the first one has 11 criteria and focuses exclusively on the location of contact points while the second one has 5 criteria and takes into account the kinematics of the robotic hand as well. Evaluation of the criteria is proposed with a common evaluation framework based on reference objects and reference manipulation tasks. The evaluation and illustration of the resulting grasps with the different criteria allow to appreciate the physical meaning of each of these criteria with this common evaluation framework. In order to reduce the number of criteria to be used in the context of a grasping synthesis process, a correlation study is carried out. The results show that several criteria in the literature are strongly correlated. Four criteria are finally chosen. Thus, to demonstrate the relevance of the selected criteria, a grasp synthesis process is used for in-hand manipulation purpose. An evolutionary approach is used to solve this multi-criteria optimization problem. The approach is validated in the OpenRAVE simulation environment and then demonstrated with the new RoBioSS hand: a fully actuated dexterous robotic hand with four fingers and sixteen degrees of freedom. Experimental results illustrate the relevance of the choice of these criteria to produce robust grasps leading to stable in-hand manipulations with large amplitudes.},

  abstract     = {Simultaneously Localization and Mapping (SLAM) plays a key role in tasks such as mobile robots navigation and path planning. How to achieve high localization accuracy in various scenarios is particularly important. This paper proposes a visual Semantic SLAM algorithm based on object tracking and static points detection, in order to eliminate the influence of dynamic objects on localization and mapping. This algorithm is improved on the framework of ORB-SLAM2. For continuously acquired input images, tracking algorithm is combined with the object detection to achieve the inter-frame correlation of objects in the scene. Then, epipolar geometry is used to detect static points on each object, and depth constraint is introduced to improve robustness. After excluding dynamic objects, the static points are sent to the tracking thread to achieve more accurate localization result. Finally, we record the pose of the dynamic objects for robots autonomous navigation in the future. Experiments on the public datasets TUM and KITTI show that in dynamic scenes, the proposed algorithm has reduced the relative index of absolute trajectory error (ATE) by more than 90% compared with ORB-SLAM2. Our system is also superior than DynaSLAM and DS-SLAM in most cases, which proves that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the localization accuracy of visual SLAM in dynamic scenes.},

Instead of using an image-based sensing approach, we propose a simple learning system that uses only a few sparse range data from a distance sensor to train a learning agent. We based our approaches on two state-of-art double critics Deep-RL models: Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). We show that our two approaches manage to outperform an approach based on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) technique and the BUG2 algorithm. Also, our new Deep-RL structure based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) outperforms the current structure used to perform mapless navigation of mobile robots. Overall, we conclude that Deep-RL approaches based on double critic with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are better suited to perform mapless navigation and obstacle avoidance of UAVs.},

We design cooperative guidance laws for the evader and the defender team to safeguard the evader from an attacking pursuer. Unlike differential games, optimal control formulations, and other heuristic methods, we propose a novel perspective on designing effective nonlinear feedback control laws for the evader-defender team using a time-constrained guidance approach. The evader lures the pursuer on the collision course by offering itself as bait. At the same time, the defender protects the evader from the pursuer by exercising control over the engagement duration. Depending on the nature of the mission, the defender may choose to take an aggressive or defensive stance. Such consideration widens the applicability of the proposed methods in various three-agent motion planning scenarios such as aircraft defense, asset guarding, search and rescue, surveillance, and secure transportation. We use a fixed-time sliding mode control strategy to design the control laws for the evader-defender team and a nonlinear finite-time disturbance observer to estimate the pursuer’s maneuver. Finally, we present simulations to demonstrate favorable performance under various engagement geometries, thus vindicating the efficacy of the proposed designs.},

First, the model of an uncertain robotic manipulator is presented as the case study of the proposed strategy. Then, the time-varying form of the robotic manipulator model is obtained to provide finite-time boundedness using the first-order sliding mode method. Moreover, without any knowledge about the upper bounds of the uncertainties, a reduced-order observer is presented to estimate the uncertainties in a finite time. Subsequently, a disturbance observer-based finite-time position tracking control law is designed. The time-varying gains are provided to converge the position tracking error to a neighborhood of zero in a finite time.

However, it may fail when illumination variations and shifting dynamics present in the scenes. One way to improve the precision is to effectively combine multiple image features that supply complementary information. In this paper, a general method to quantitatively measure the efficacy of individual image features as well as feature combinations for LCD is proposed by calculating the statistical distance considering the distributions of feature vectors. Based on different statistical distances including Kullback-Leibler divergence, Bhattacharyya divergence and Wasserstein metric, various numerical indices capable of evaluating feature combinations are obtained and compared. An unsupervised algorithm is further proposed to optimize feature combinations by maximizing any of the indices. Experiments show that the proposed indices can measure the efficacies of image features and the resulting feature combinations maximizing the indices can improve the precision of LCD.},

Furthermore, the migration process is introduced into the GA to mitigate the issue of premature convergence. To determine best GA configurations, a tradeoff analysis is conducted, and it is found that the runtime is minimized and optimization accuracy is preserved when the number of populations and individuals are selected as 640 and 64. The number of generations is selected as 1,000 based on the convergence rate of GA optimization. An objective function enabling differential consideration of the path length, smoothness, safety, and feasibility through individual weights is also presented. Numerical experiments demonstrate that different optimal paths can be obtained from the same terrain by tuning the weights. Compared to its serial CPU counterpart, the average speedup achieved by GPU is 83×.},

The training scheme is completely autonomous, requiring no human to be present throughout the learning process. We show that the pseudo-episodic technique allows for additional learning updates with off-policy actor-critic and experience replay methods. We show that including these additional updates between periods of traditional training episodes can improve speed and consistency of learning. Furthermore, we validate the procedure in experimental hardware. In the physical environment, several algorithm variants learned rapidly, each surpassing baseline maximum reward.

There are holonomic robot path planning algorithms for generating guaranteed collision-free paths even in very complex but completely known environments. However, it is not feasible to apply these algorithms to non-holonomic cars. In this paper we propose a novel approach to solve this problem in real-time, by generating a series of incremental collision-free path segments from the start to end configuration using an incremental sampling-based planner, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The proposed approach employs only local sensor data (point cloud data) for path planning of nonholonomic self driving cars in quasi static unknown environments. The proposed planner generates real-time paths that guarantee safety. The algorithms are extensively testedand validated in popular benchmark simulation environments.},

  abstract     = {Robots will eventually make part of our daily lives, helping us at home, taking care of the elderly, and collaborating at work. In such Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) scenarios, achieving abnormal movement identification can effectively deal with unexpected anomalies such as human collisions, external perturbations, and unexpected changes in the environment. To this end, Long-short Term Memory (LSTMs) based prediction methods are widely proposed for abnormal identification, which typically has an implicit requirement of fixed-length input signals such that the identification thresholds are calculated from the prediction-error sequences with the same length. However, in robotics, this is rarely the case, generalization in HRC is a desirable characteristic that indicates the recorded executions would have different lengths for a specific movement. To address this problem, we first extend the concept of stacked LSTMs to predict anomalies by admitting the input multivariate time series of varying lengths. Subsequently, prediction errors with different lengths are modeled using a probabilistic model for tackling the temporal uncertainty. Consequently, dynamic threshold representation is learned from the trained probabilistic model for abnormal movement identification. A self-designed robot manipulation task consisting of six individual movements is used to evaluate the proposed approach and compared it to baselines. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method with an average anomaly identification accuracy of 94% outperforms the baselines.},

  abstract     = {Aiming at satisfying the increasing demand of family service robots for housework, this paper proposes a robot visual servoing scheme based on the randomized trees to complete the visual servoing task of unknown objects in natural scenes. Here, “unknown” means that there is no prior information on object models, such as template or database of the object. Firstly, an object to be manipulated is randomly selected by user prior to the visual servoing task execution. Then, the raw image information about the object can be obtained and used to train a randomized tree classifier online. Secondly, the current image features can be computed using the well-trained classifier. Finally, the visual controller can be designed according to the error of image feature, which is defined as the difference between the desired image features and current image features. Five visual positioning of unknown objects experiments, including 2D rigid object and 3D non-rigid object, are conducted on a MOTOMAN-SV3X six degree-of-freedom (DOF) manipulator robot. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can effectively position an unknown object in complex natural scenes, such as occlusion and illumination changes. Furthermore, the developed robot visual servoing scheme has an excellent positioning accuracy within 0.05 mm positioning error.},

  abstract     = {In the haptic human-robot interaction systems, stability and transparency factors are critical but conflicting with one another. Ensuring safety and accuracy of bilateral haptic teleoperation systems is always an important tradeoff to be carefully balanced. Attaining a reasonable operating point for less painful compensation between stability and transparency has been the main concern when designing haptic human-robot systems. Some important works discussed in the paper include model-based control approaches like wave-variable transformation and scattering, time domain passivity/wave prediction with energy regulation, model mediated teleoperation approaches, along with model-free control approaches like neural networks and fuzzy control approaches. The objective to obtain a better agreement between stability and transparency criteria, along with a comprehensive review of these methods and a newly proposed technique attracted most interests of the paper. Earlier solutions tried to achieve a decent tradeoff but were limited to varying time delay and data loss encountered during transmission in the communication channels. The comparison of these methods demonstrates their performance, by illustrating their respective outlines, viability, and limitations, which can aid in the identification of compensation among the state-of-the-art methods and inspire novel ideas. The hardware platforms developed in literature are also summarized here to show the physical implementation of such systems. The paper concludes by suggesting the need of a hybrid method inclusive of an Active Disturbance Rejection Controller (ADRC), towards an even better operating point for the tradeoff between the transparency and stability of haptic human-robot systems.},

Therefore, in order to improve the edge quality of the affordance detection results, semantic edge detection is introduced into our affordance detection framework. In order to take full advantage of the duality between affordance detection task and semantic edge detection task, our framework employs two key components to couple these two tasks: spatial gradient fusion module and shared gradient attention module. In the spatial gradient fusion module, the gradient features derived from the segmentation block are fused with the features output by the edge block to suppress non-semantic edges in semantic edge detection. In the shared gradient attention module, the edge consistency between affordance detection results and semantic edge detection results is enhanced by sharing gradient attention weights. Our experiments show that our framework can output affordance detection results with better edge quality. In particular, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the IIT-AFF benchmark, in terms of both affordance mask (F-score) and semantic edge (F-score) quality, improving by 0.52% and 3.22% over strong baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in real robotic applications.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a new collision avoidance algorithm based on velocity obstacles (VO) is proposed for distributed mobile robots to achieve oscillation-free autonomous navigation, which is called repulsion-oriented reciprocal collision avoidance (RORCA). Firstly, the problem of reciprocal collision avoidance for autonomous robots is defined. Each robot makes independent decisions by sensing the position and velocity of its surrounding objects without centralized coordination or communication with other robots. The final aims of the robots are to reach some pre-defined goals. Secondly, the VO algorithm and its variants are reviewed. Their potential problems in trajectory smoothness and navigation safety are used as test elements of the new algorithm. The RORCA algorithm considers the virtual repulsion direction of the paired robots and the reciprocity of collision avoidance between them to constructs a feasible velocity set for each robot. This set is proved to be a non-empty convex set containing at least zero vector. In this way, the local motion planning of the robot is transformed into a convex optimization problem for solving the optimal velocity on this set. For ease of explanation, we elaborate the algorithm in a two-dimensional (2D) workspace, which takes into account the kinematics constraints and measurement uncertainty from sensors. Then, the expansion of the RORCA in three-dimensional (3D) space is introduced. Finally, comparative simulations are performed in 2D and 3D scenarios to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. The results show that the RORCA algorithm is particularly suitable for solving the problems trajectory oscillation, reciprocal dance and potential collisions of robots in dense environments, and it has excellent performance in safety and computational efficiency.},

This paper aims to tackle the practically very challenging problem of the balance between efficiency and safety in the safety scheme aforementioned in the intelligent manufacturing industry. The human-robot dynamic fusion algorithm (HRDF) was proposed in this paper to ensure the safety of humans initiatively, in favor of reducing the stop times of the collaborative operations. In this algorithm, the digital dynamics model of human was built and employed to estimate the minimum distance between human and robot in real-time. And the virtual force can be calculated based on the minimum distance above. Subsequently, the value and the time duration of the virtual force were employed to evaluate the safety status of human-robot system. Then, robot can conduct safety planning initiatively according to the safety status. In practice, the average response time taken from the detection of the distance change of human-robot to the adjustment of robot is 0.05s with our algorithm. Above all, the effectiveness of our approach is verified empirically with contact maintenance experiments in a non-stop mode. And the HRDF can maximally increase efficiency by 26.4% compared with the traditional stop-maintenance-restart safety mode.},

  abstract     = {The chattering problem is caused by the switching function of sliding mode controller, which makes the accuracy of autonomous driving limited. To solve this problem, a steering sliding mode controller with improved nonlinear reaching law is proposed. The exponential function is used in the new reaching law to eliminate chattering problem, and the initial value of switching function is employed to avoid output saturation in the case of large initial errors. In the new reaching law, the large slope of sign function coefficient ensures the anti-disturbance ability of the controller after the system converges. A disturbance observer is constructed for real-time observation of the disturbance signals, which makes the controller get rid of the dependence on the prior knowledge of the disturbance. This paper introduces the tuning principle of controller parameters in detail and constructs the simulations and experiments of autonomous driving system. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed controller restrains the path-tracking mean error by 38% and restrains the standard error by 18%, the accuracy and efficiency of autonomous driving system are improved. Furthermore, the proposed reaching law can be used in other systems besides autonomous harvesting robots.},

  abstract     = {Normally, small batch parts, especially by manual assembly, are difficult to be manufactured automatically(e.g., welded, polished, sprayed) by robots because of deviation from a pre-taught path, which results from shape error and clamping error. To correct the pre-taught path, visual sensors can be used to detect it and guide the robots. However, some of the paths cannot be continuously detected due to work space limitation, and therefore, only part of them can be detected. As a result, it is difficult to directly match the incompleted detected path to pre-taught path with location errors and shape errors, which cause residual deviation after correction. This paper proposes an efficient and robust path correction method, that can be applied to robotic autonomous systems. The main contribution of this work is adopting global matching to maintain the original shape of the pre-taught path, which deals with location errors, and the local matching relaxes this constraint and addressed the shape errors. Structured light vision is used to detect the deviation of path to improve the detecting accuracy and reduce detection data size simultaneously. And a path-matching method taking account of both global and local features is developed based on iterative closest point algorithm (ICP). The proposed method consists of four steps: path scanning, global matching, local matching and data updating. Several robotic welding experiments are applied to verify the proposed method performance.},

  abstract     = {Robots equipped with the vision systems at the end-effector provide a powerful combination in industrial contexts, allowing to execute a wide range of manufacturing tasks, such as inspection applications. While many works are dedicated to machine vision algorithms, the optimization of the vision system pose is not properly addressed. Optimizing the sensor pose, in fact, can increase the object detection performance, avoiding occlusions and collisions in the real working scene. Therefore, the development of an approach capable of optimizing the pose of a vision system is the main objective of this paper. A complete pipeline for such optimization is proposed, composed of the following main components: working scene reconstruction, robot-environment collisions modeling, object detection, sensor pose optimization (exploiting Bayesian Optimization, a state of the art methodology), and collision-free robot motion planning. To validate the proposed approach, experimental tests have been executed considering two object detection-based tasks. A Franka EMIKA Panda robot equipped with an Intel© RealSense D400 at its end-effector has been employed as a robotic platform. Achieved results show the high-fidelity reconstruction of the real working environment for an offline optimization (i.e., performed simulations), as well as the capabilities of the employed Bayesian Optimization-based approach to define the sensor pose. The proposed optimization methodology has been compared with the grid point approach, showing an improved performance for camera pose optimization purposes. An additional experiment has been performed in order to show the possibility to exploit a digital twin (if available) of the working scene instead of the environment reconstruction (to reduce the computational resources and to avoid measurements noise in the 3D reconstruction). Obtained results show the feasibility of the proposed pipeline employing such a digital twin.},
