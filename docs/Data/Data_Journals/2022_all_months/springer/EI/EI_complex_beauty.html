  abstract     = {With the ever increasing demand and stressed operating conditions, resource expansion is the only way to have sustainable electric grid. Transmission system expansion is one of the important aspects in this regard. In the recent years, expansion problem has been addressed by several researchers. Meta-heuristic techniques have been applied to solve expansion problems. In this paper, a new variant of Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO) Algorithm is proposed by adding a sine function based diversity in the teaching phase. The proposed variant is named as Composite TLBO (C-TLBO). The efficacy of the proposed variant has been evaluated on standard benchmark functions and then it is evaluated on two standard electrical networks with cases of inclusion of uncertainty and demand burst. The results obtained from optimization processes have been evaluated with the help of several analytical and statistical tests. Results affirm that the proposed modification enhances the performance of the algorithm in a substantial manner.},

  abstract     = {The preventive protection of cultural relics is the important topic of cultural relics protection research. Aiming at the shortage of cultural relics data analysis and disease prediction, in this paper, a wavelet correlation analysis relevance vector machine regression method is proposed, which can accurately predict the disease of immovable cultural relics by using the monitored environmental data and the corresponding disease degree of cultural relics. Firstly, the correlation of multivariate time series of immovable cultural relics is quantitatively obtained by using wavelet correlation analysis, and the validity of characteristic variables of cultural relics disease is identified. Then, according to the effective characteristic variables, the relevance vector machine prediction model is constructed. Finally, the good performance of the method is verified by using the environmental monitoring data of the rock mass fracture in the North Qianfo cliff of Dafo Temple in Binzhou City of Shaanxi Province in China. The experimental results show that the proposed method is more effective than the traditional disease prediction methods based on back propagation neural network, support vector machine, principal component analysis relevance vector machine, and random forest for immovable cultural relics. This method is universal and easy to implement for multi-source data prediction of immovable cultural relics diseases. It not only provides ideas for data analysis of the Internet of Things for cultural relics protection, but also gives a scientific theoretical reference for the preventive protection of cultural relics.},

This paper deals with a Michigan cooperative approach for mining fuzzy rules. The proposed algorithm named EDE-FRMiner uses an enhanced differential evolution that evolves population of individuals; each one represents a single rule. The whole population collaborates to generate in one shot an accurate and reduced number of rules. EDE-FRMiner is an intelligent process of evolution that uses fast arithmetic operators and a new cooperative weights memory. This latter allows sharing information between individuals. In addition, it uses a new threshold based fitness function using a redefined support and confidence measures. The adaptive threshold mechanism used in the fitness function aims to adapt the miner system to problems with dynamic training data. Experiments are carried out using the NSL-kdd’99 intrusion detection data set and other data sets from the UCI repository. A comparative study with other competitive evolutionary rule based systems is performed and the results show the effectiveness of proposed algorithm.},

We used EPX with three the most reputed mutation operators: Makinen, Periaux and Toivanen mutation (MPTM), non uniform mutation (NUM) and power mutation (PM). The experimental results with eighteen well-known models depict that our proposed EPX operator performs better than the other competitive crossover operators. The comparison analysis is evaluated through mean, standard deviation and the performance index. Significance of EPX vs competitive is examined by performing the two-tailed t-test. Hence, the new crossover scheme appears to be significant as well as comparable to establish the crossing among parents for better offspring.},

In the past decades, the hypothetical schemes depending on the rock fragmentation process and the experimental models up to field surveillance as well as machine performance are the two main methods. Traditional and conventional approaches for rock mass rate (RMR) prediction usually consider excessive parameters and the accuracies are far from actual values. A new RMR prediction model based on the optimized neural network (NN) is designed. To improve the prediction accuracy, this paper proposed a new self-adaptive rider optimization algorithm (SA-ROA), which applied optimization logic to train the NN by updating the weight as wave velocity (Vp), transverse wave velocity (Vs), Vp/Vs, statistics (Stat), orientation, magnitude, polarity, wave type, and metre. Finally, the RMR prediction analysis of the adopted NN-SA-ROA model is compared to the conventional and traditional classifiers with varied learning percentages: 50%, 60%, 70%, and 80% for three data sets, respectively. Subsequently, the performance of the proposed work is verified using other approaches based on error analysis. The predicted mean absolute errors (MAEs) and the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) of SA-ROA are smaller than conventional and traditional schemes. The results show that the proposed method can successfully predict the actual RMR.},

  abstract     = {As an important form of multi-energy complementation, the integrated electricity and natural gas system (IEGS) is a new carrier for renewable energy accommodation. Firstly, based on the natural gas pipeline model, the buffer effect of natural gas pipeline storage characteristics in response to natural gas load fluctuations is analyzed. Then, considering the pipeline storage characteristics, a dad-ahead economic dispatch model for IEGSs with a high proportion of wind power is established. And the extreme scenario optimization method is used in this model to deal with the uncertainty of wind power. Furthermore, a distributed solutions method based on the Improved Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers is proposed to accelerate the convergence of distributed solutions. Cases studies are conducted on a modified IEEE 39-bus system and a Belgium 20-node natural gas system to verify the effectiveness of models and algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Collision detection is currently a hot issue in virtual reality and other fields. The efficiency and accuracy of collision detection directly affect the real-time update effect of the virtual reality environment, and it is also an important indicator that affects the user&#39;s interactive experience. In a complex virtual reality scene, if the traditional collision detection algorithm (Sphere-OBB) is adopted and the tree structure traversal is used to realize the bounding box traversal detection, the accuracy remains unchanged, but the detection complexity is reduced. If the RAPID collision detection algorithm is used, the separated axis test method and the two-layer hybrid hierarchical surrounding tree structure are used, although the amount of calculation is large, the detection efficiency is improved. Using the separation axis (SAT) algorithm and using the separation axis theorem to determine the vector axis can save a lot of calculation time. The purpose of this research is to propose an improved hybrid-level bounding box collision detection optimization algorithm (ASO) based on the traditional hybrid-level bounding box collision detection algorithm. Firstly, based on the spatio-temporal correlation theory, the hybrid hierarchical bounding box hierarchical tree structure is improved to AABB and OBB from top to bottom. The synchronous descent rule is used to realize the traversal of nodes, and then the triangle area weighting method is used to improve the calculation method of the bottom OBB bounding box node center, solve the bounding box vertex covariance matrix, and improve the efficiency and accuracy of collision detection. The experimental results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper is 35.6% faster than the RAPID detection speed and 29.9% faster than the separation axis (SAT) detection speed under the same accuracy. In the multi-object collision detection, compared with the latest research, the algorithm in this paper shortens the intersection detection time, improves the collision detection efficiency, and meets the real-time update requirements of complex virtual reality scenes.},

At the same time, separate training will increase network complexity and be very time-consuming. Therefore, a deep learning space-spectrum combined with hyperspectral remote sensing image classification algorithm is proposed. First, mathematical transformation is used to stabilize the growth rate of remote sensing image radiation value, and reduce the standard deviation of spatial distribution characteristics of GIS information DN value, so as to increase the growth rate of remote sensing spectral radiation value in suburban areas. Then, a band combination strategy LSTM algorithm that focuses on global features is selected to regroup the bands of the spectral vector of each pixel of the hyperspectral data, which can effectively extract the context features between adjacent spectra. Finally, principal component analysis is performed on the satellite remote sensing image, and retain the first few principal components to achieve dimensionality reduction; the multiscale convolutional neural network is applied to extract the spatial features of the satellite remote sensing image after dimensionality reduction. The end-to-end structure is used to extract spectral features and spatial features simultaneously to realize satellite remote sensing image analysis. The simulation experiment proves that the calculation accuracy of the urban pattern change trend of the algorithm in this paper is high, and the calculation results are more convergent, which can provide more accurate trends of the urban pattern change and play a guiding role in the future construction of the city.},

To improve the accuracy and real-time of speech emotion recognition, people have done a lot of work in speech emotion feature extraction and speech emotion recognition algorithms, but the recognition rate also needs improvement. In this paper, we propose a speech emotion recognition method based on Mel-frequency Cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and broad learning network. 39-dimensional MFCC features were extracted after preprocess of the speech signal. After labelling and standardizing the data, a data prediction model is built. Finally, the data set is split into training and test data onto a certain ratio (0.8). We experimented with broad learning network architecture. And then the data processing in the broad learning network is improved. The proposed algorithm is a neural network structure that does not rely on deep structure, which has a small amount of calculation, excellent calculation speed and simple structure. The experimental results show that the proposed network architecture achieves higher accuracy and it turned out to be the most accurate in recognizing emotions in CASIA Chinese emotion corpus. The recognition rate can reach 100%. Therefore, the proposed network architecture provides an effective method of speech emotion recognition.},

Among those, the penalty-based shrinkage approach has been most popular for the ability to carry out the variable selection and parameter estimation simultaneously. However, not much work is available on the variable selection for the generalized partially models (GPLMs) with longitudinal data. In this paper, we proposed a variable selection procedure for GPLMs with longitudinal data. The inference is based on the SCAD-penalized quadratic inference functions, which is obtained after the B-spline approximating to non-parametric function in the model. The proposed approach efficiently utilized the within-cluster correlation information, which can improve estimating efficiency. The proposed approach also has the virtue of low computational cost. With the tuning parameter chosen by BIC, the correct model is identified with probability tends to 1. The resulted estimator of the parametric component is asymptotic to a normal distribution, and that of the non-parametric function achieves the optimal convergence rate. The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated through extensive simulation studies. A real data analysis shows that the proposed approach succeeds in excluding the insignificant variable.},

Firstly, based on the analysis of influencing factors of gas outburst, 10 factors including coal thickness variations, geological structures and gas change are selected as the influencing factors. By using the attribute reduction algorithm to eliminate redundant information, the gas outburst influencing factors as input to the prediction model are reduced from 10 to 6 in decision table. Secondly, by applying the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize penalty parameter and kernel function of SVM and improve the generalization performance of model, the nonlinear relationship between main influencing factors and intensity of gas outburst is established. Finally, 60 sets of data of Jiulishan Coal Mine in Henan are used as training and testing samples to verify the proposed prediction model, and the discriminant results is compared with that of RBF model and SVM model. The results show that the prediction accuracy of the proposed model is 93%, which is improved compared with the other two models. The RS-PSOSVM model can reduce data redundancy, avoid the model to fall into the local extremum, and can predict the risk level of gas outburst effectively.},

Finally, according to different faults corresponding to different permutation entropy distributions, the various fault states were classified, and the permutation entropy distributions of non-denoised signals were compared. It could be seen that the morphological Haar wavelet had good de-noising effectiveness, and permutation entropy could express the feature of different gear conditions.

Before generating all simple circuits in a directed graph, the algorithm first detects whether there is a simple circuit in directed graph, and the detection can divide the directed graph into trivial graphs or strongly connected components. In the process of detecting the existence of simple circuit, the algorithm repeatedly reduces the number of vertices in vertex set along with edge pruning. Based on depth-first traversal, we can get all simple circuits of the directed graph. Especially, instead of proceeding depth-first traversals based on all vertices, the algorithm starts with a random vertex in a strongly connected component to reduce the number of depth-first traversals, and obtain all simple circuits of this strongly connected component. The difficulty of the algorithm is to detect and delete the repeated circuits in the process of generating all simple circuits, which can reduce both the storage space and time complexity. As a result, the output of the algorithm does not contain any repeated circuits. The algorithm simplifies the edge set of directed graphs and greatly reduces the number of depth-first traversals, thereby reducing the computational complexity and improving the computational efficiency.},

Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is a comprehensive evaluation method based on fuzzy mathematics, which converts qualitative evaluation into quantitative evaluation according to the membership theory of fuzzy mathematics. In this paper, Yaahp software is used for weight calculation and consistency test of ahp, and sensitivity analysis is also carried out. The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is used to determine the evaluation index set and the fuzzy comment set, and the evaluation model is constructed by fuzzy synthesis. On this basis, the empirical analysis is carried out.},

Collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms cannot be applied to sparse matrices or used in cold start problems. Although the users’ trust relationships provide some useful additional information for recommendation systems, the existing research has not incorporated the rating matrix and trust relationships well. The trust relationship itself also has the problem of data sparsity. With a focus on the problem of sparsity and low accuracy in collaborative filtering algorithms, this paper proposes a general framework, called neural multi-task collaborative filtering (NMCF), which can simultaneously predict the rating and trust relationships. That is, the rating of the same user in e-commerce platforms and the trust relationships in social networks promote and complement each other and help to improve the prediction accuracy of both. The study results for three datasets of real-world show that our algorithm performs better in recommendation, and the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is significantly improved compared with that of the comparison models.},

  abstract     = {In the automatic identification of lesions, aiming at the misdiagnosis of the lung nodule size, shape, blood vessels and other lung tissues on CT images of pneumonia, this paper proposes a method for identifying lung diseases based on capsule neural networks. Considering that the texture features of lung CT images contain important medical information, this article first combines gray average, entropy, fractal dimension and fractal intercept to form feature vectors as texture features, and introduces context models to obtain context information. The LBG algorithm was used to achieve context quantization, and the CT images of lungs were preprocessed. Then, for the problem of less CT image data of lungs and fewer features of lung diseases in this paper, the existing images are enhanced and the data set is expanded. Finally, in the recognition process of pneumonia, the characteristic pose information will affect the recognition. In order to solve this problem, this paper uses a capsule neural network to identify and detect lung CT images. The application results show that the accuracy rate of identifying lung diseases by capsule neural network is 98.7%. Compared with traditional convolutional networks, capsule neural networks can better identify lung diseases.},

A simplified model for calculating heat dissipation in conductors suits this purpose completely. The preliminary settlement of the heat dissipation parameter will allow engineers to evaluate the on-chip interconnect topology at the early stages of design so that these interconnects comply with the power dissipation and the power consumption variables. The novelty of this approach lies in the fact that it allows modeling thermal stresses that take place inside the chip. A solver applied here enables numerical solution to differential equations that is theoretically best, i.e., a direct numerical solution. In addition, it overcame the Gibbs phenomenon by incorporating more natural, not sharp boundary conditions into the model. Here, this approach was applied to the multiprocessor system design that implies the integration of processor cores in a single chip package.},

For this, a Kriging-based multi-point sequential sampling optimization (KMSSO) method is presented. The proposed method uses uncertainty estimate information of Kriging to construct the multiple-point generalized Expected Improvement (EI) criterion. In optimization cycle, this criterion is maximized to produce the Pareto front data, which will be further screened to obtain final expensive evaluation points. For numerical tests and an engineering case, KMSSO is compared to GEGO and HAM algorithm and is shown to deliver better results.

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks are known for their excellent performance in computer vision, achieving results in the state of the art. Moreover, recent research has shown that these networks can also provide promising results for natural language processing. In this case, the basic idea is to concatenate the vector representations of words into a single block and use it as an image. However, despite the good results, the problem of using convolution networks is the large numbers of design decisions that need to be made á priori. These models require the definition of many hyper-parameters, including the type of word embeddings, which consists of the data vectorized representation, the activation function that prints the non-linearity characteristics to the model, the size of the filter that applies data convolution, the number of feature maps, which are responsible for identifying the attributes and the pooling method used for data reduction. In addition, one must also predefine the regularization constant and the dropout rate, which are responsible for avoiding any network over-fitting. In existing research works, convolutional neural network architectures capable of overcoming the performance of traditional machine learning models are presented. Even though these can compete with more complex models, the problem of how the different setting of the hyper-parameters may affect the performance of this type of network has not yet been explored. In this paper, we propose an efficient sentiment analysis classifier using convolutional neural networks by analyzing the impact of the hyper-parameters on the model performance. The main interest in analyzing sentiment comes from the advent of social media and the technological advances that flood the Internet with opinions. Nonetheless, mining the Internet for opinion and sentiment analysis is not an easy task and thus needs outstanding models with the best hyper-parameters setting to be able to get pertinent answers. The results achieved are obtained with the use of GPU and show that the different configurations exceed the reference models in the most of the cases with gains of up to 18% and have similar performance to the models of the state of the art with gains of up to 2% in some cases.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a multiobjective memetic algorithm based on adaptive local search chains (MMA-ALSC) for vehicle routing problem with time window (VRPTW) which is an important research area in logistics. As shown in most previous studies, VRPTW is essentially a multiobjective optimization problem and can be solved effectively by the multiobjective algorithms with various local search operators. We have observed, however, that the promising solutions obtained during the process of evolution are not fully utilized to guide the search together with different local search operators. This will lead to the discontinuous and insufficient search in the regions showing promise. To alleviate this drawback, MMA-ALSC is proposed and characterized by combining a multi-directional local search strategy (MD-LS) with an enhanced local search chain technique (eLS-Chain). In MMA-ALSC, on the one hand, with MD-LS, different local search operators are designed to perform the search towards multiple directions with distinct problem-specific knowledge of multiobjective VRPTW (MOVRPTW). On the other hand, with eLS-Chain, the promising solutions obtained during the process of evolution are adaptively selected for the subsequent local search operators. In this way, MMA-ALSC can not only effectively explore the search space in multiple directions, but also fully exploit the promising solutions in a chain-based way. Experimental results on two suites of benchmark instances have demonstrated the competitive performance of MMA-ALSC when compared with other representative algorithms.},

Therefore the risk factors causing cost overrun in the construction industry should be assessed. In this study, 55 important risk factors causing cost overrun in Indian construction projects are identified through intensive literature review and expert opinion. A new fuzzy based model has been proposed to estimate the risk magnitude of these factors, as the theory has the potential to deal with the vagueness, uncertainty and subjective nature of any problems and It is capable of handling the almost same analogous which is found in the complex construction projects. In order to assess the risk factors causing cost overrun, probability index and severity index are considered. A new cost overrun factor index, namely fuzzy index for cost overrun is calculated which indicates the risk magnitude of a certain factor. The applicability of the model has been shown by an example. The risk magnitude for the factor “fluctuation in price material” is determined by collecting the data from the experts of Indian construction industry. On the basis of these risk magnitudes, the importance level the factors are assessed. Top ten factors for causing cost overrun in the Indian construction industry are recognised as fluctuation in price material, lowest bid procurement policy, inflation inappropriate govt. Policy, mistakes and discrepancies in the contract document, inaccurate time and cost estimate, additional work, frequent design change, unrealistic contract duration and financial difficulty faced by contractors.},

  abstract     = {The software fault classification is very crucial in the development of reliable and high-quality software products. The fault classification allows determining and concentrating on fault software modules for early prediction of fault in time. As a result, it saves the time and money of the industry. Generally, various metrics are generated to represent the fault. But, selecting the dominant metrics from the available set is a challenge. Therefore, in this paper, a sequential forward search (SFS) with extreme learning machine (ELM) approach has used for fault classification. The number of features available in the metrics are selected to represent the fault using SFS and operated on ELM to verify the performance of software fault classification. Also, various activation functions of ELM have tested for the proposed work to identify the best model. The experimental result demonstrates that ELM with radial basis function achieves the good results compared to other activation function. Also, the proposed method has shown good results in comparison to support vector machine.},

  abstract     = {In most Differential evolution (DE) algorithms, the inferior vectors in the selection operator are always ignored during the evolutionary process. However, from the existing studies, these inferior vectors can provide valuable information in guiding the search of DE. Thus, how to effectively utilize the information from the current population together with the inferior vectors is one of the most salient and important topics in DE. This study proposes an enhanced utilization mechanism of population information (EUM) for DE. In EUM, there are two novel operators to utilize the information of the inferior and superior vectors generated during the evolution, proximity-based replacement operator (PRO) and negative direction operator (NDO). For PRO, the trial vector that is worse than its parent vector will have a chance to replace other parent vectors with the conditions based on the proximity. For NDO, the winning vectors in the selection process or RPO are stored in the archive to guide the mutation process by introducing the negative direction information. By incorporating EUM into DE, the novel DE framework, EUM-DE, is proposed. To test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, EUM-DE is applied to several original and advanced DE algorithms. The experimental study on the CEC2013 benchmark functions has shown that the proposed EUM is an effective approach to enhance the performance of most DE algorithms studied.},

Classification of sleep stages help in understanding sleep related issues. Manual analysis of sleep scoring is costly, tedious and time-consuming process. It is essential to design an automatic sleep scoring technique which is convenient to patients and simplifies the diagnostic process using EEG signals. Implementation of such technique enable experts to identify sleep related issues. In this paper, EEG signals are recorded for 60 subjects and preprocessed using Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter. Sleep stages are classified into three major stages viz stage 1, 2 and 3 with 10 s epoch duration using statistical features of EEG and machine learning algorithms with five-fold cross validation. Proposed method is more feasible for physicians to diagnose sleep disorders and proves to be the better technique with improved accuracy compared to other existing studies.},

It has already been shown that $$\lfloor \frac{8n}{9}\rfloor $$ landmarks are sufficient for trilaterating a simple n-side. Later, as a better result, it has been proved that $$ \lfloor \frac{2n}{3}\rfloor $$ landmarks are sufficient for this purpose.

In most previous works addressing this issue, the proxemia concept has been considered static with regards to the activity’s nature. Furthermore, the F-Formation type is not considered. The different activities of people can not be considered similarly. For example, the way to navigate socially without disturbing a group drinking coffee or discussing a poster is different, just like the interaction location when serving coffee or explaining a poster. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a dynamic proxemia modeling approach “DPMA” for social navigation and interaction. It is based on proxemia and spatial modeling, which allow the robot to navigate socially by considering the comfort of people, and to interact in appropriate interaction conditions. It considers the F-Formation type and the nature of the activity, additionally to the different social spaces and the navigation and interaction constraints. Then, it uses a social map to encode them. The performance and the efficiency DPMA are evaluated both in three simulation environments using the ROS Stage simulator and on a real robot used as a service robot in a mediation event example.

  abstract     = {There has been a rapid growth in the domains of artificial intelligence, data mining and machine learning during the last few years. Machine learning techniques have been extensively used for outcome predication and classification in different spheres of research now a days. Machine learning shows excellent performance for outcome prediction and classification in the domains of medicine, cyber security, banking fraud, drug discovery etc. However, in the field of sports, particularly for the game of badminton, outcome result prediction with the aid of artificial intelligence and machine learning is still unexplored. The machine learning techniques for outcome prediction have been used for limited games only. This paper presents machine learning based technique for badminton match outcome prediction with less input attributes. Here, supervised learning approach with feature reduction techniques has been proposed for badminton match outcome prediction. The raw data related to Australian Open, Malaysian Open, German Open and Singapore Open Badminton tournaments from 2016 to 2019 are collected from internet sources (official websites and other websites). CSV file is formulated from the scarp data with total thirty features for singles tournament and thirty-four features for doubles tournaments. Correlation Feature Selection Method, Info Gain Attribute Selection Method, ReliefF Attribute Selection Method, Probabilistic Significance Attribute Evaluation Method and Symmetrical Uncertainty Attribute Evaluation feature reduction techniques are employed to evaluate feature significance. Fourteen significant features as input predictors for three machine learning classifiers are selected for badminton match result prediction. The classifiers performance for match outcome prediction is evaluated in terms of accuracy, root mean square error, receiver operating characteristics and other confusion matrices parameters. Results for each tournament with reduced features are analysed and compared with full feature dataset. It has been observed that Naïve Bayes with correlation based feature weighting shows remarkable performance in contrast to other proposed classifiers in match outcome prediction for reduced feature dataset.},

  abstract     = {Despite the good performance of Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) in dealing with global optimization problems, unfortunately it is not the case with respect to the convergence performance. Conventional CSA exploration and exploitation are strongly dependent on the proper setting of awareness probability (AP) and flight length (FL) parameters. In each optimization problem, AP and FL parameters are set in an ad hoc manner and their values do not change over the optimization process. To this date, there is no analytical approach to adjust their best values. This presents a major drawback to apply CSA in complex practical problems. Hence, the conventional CSA is used only for limited problems due to fact that CSA with fixed AP and FL is frequently trapped into local optimum. In this present paper, an enhanced version of CSA called dynamic crow search algorithm (DCSA) is proposed to overcome the drawbacks of the conventional CSA. In the proposed DCSA, two modifications of the basic algorithm are made. The first modification concerns the continuous adjustment of the CSA parameters leading to a DCSA, where AP will be adjusting linearly over optimization process and FL will be adjusting according to the generalized Pareto probability density function. This dynamic adjustment will provide more global search capability as well as more exploitation of the pre-final solutions. The second modification concerns the improvement of CSA’s swarm diversity in the search process. This will lead to a high convergence accuracy, and fast convergence rate. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated using a set of experimental series using 13 complex benchmark functions. Experimental results highly proved the modified algorithm effectiveness compared to the basic algorithm in terms of convergence rate, global search capability and final solutions. In addition, a comparison with conventional and recent similar algorithms revealed that DCSA gives superior results in terms of performance and efficiency.},

These sensors are deployed in a region of interest for monitoring targets or detecting events, and forwarding the processed data to the sink nodes or gateways. In any wireless network scenario, the targets are to be covered by at least one sensor in the network in order to detect certain events. Maximizing coverage along with improving energy efficiency of the network is a fundamental issue in WSN. Therefore, a Biogeography Based Optimization (BBO) meta-heuristic technique is employed to place sensors in the region of interest. The proposed scheme solves a multi-objective problem using classical weighted sum approach. A fitness function is derived from combination of conflicting objectives, minimum interference, maximum target coverage, and selection of minimum number of sensor nodes along with connectivity of the network as a constraint. The scheme selects minimum number of sensors to deploy in the field of interest which maximizes the target coverage by minimizing the interference of sensors. The proposed scheme is tested on random and grid deployment scenarios. Finally, the scheme is compared with Genetic Algorithm and Random Scheme. The average interference energy loss on BBO-based scheme is found to be 16% less than that of the GA-based scheme, and 60% less than that of a Random-based scheme.},

The constructed improved algorithm, named as improved atom search optimization algorithm, was proposed for optimizing a power system stabilizer adopted in a single-machine infinite-bus power system. The evaluations were initially performed using several benchmark functions by comparing the results with genetic algorithm, simulated annealing technique, particle swarm optimization, gravitational search algorithm and the original version of atom search optimization algorithm. The obtained results showed the great promise of the developed hybrid algorithm in terms of the balance between exploration and exploitation phases. The performance of the proposed hybrid algorithm was also assessed through designing an optimally performing power system stabilizer for further evaluation. To do so, a power system stabilizer damping controller was formulated as an optimization problem and the improved algorithm was used to search for optimal controller parameters in order to show the applicability and greater performance of the proposed algorithm for such a complex real-world engineering problem. The obtained results for the latter case were compared with the best performing reported approaches of sine cosine algorithm and symbiotic organisms search algorithm. The comparisons clearly demonstrated the superiority of the proposed algorithm over other recently reported best performing algorithms for power system stabilizer design.},

  abstract     = {The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a typical problem in combinatorial optimization. The unique objective of the traditional TSP is to minimize the tour distance. When more than one objective is taken into account to be optimized simultaneously, the problem is known as a multi-objective TSP. In the present paper, a bi-objective traveling salesman problem (BOTSP) is considered, where both the cost and the distance are taken as optimization objectives. We introduce a new algorithm that solves the BOTSP called Gw-ABC. This algorithm is based on an Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm (ABC) and uses a Gradual Weight Generation method. Firstly, we apply a gradual method to prepare the weight vectors. In fact, weight vectors values are gradually distributed in the objective space and change relatively to the optimization process from cycle to another. Secondly, we apply the ABC algorithm with the generated weights to our problem. The proposed algorithm is experimentally tested on well-known benchmark instances of different sizes and compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms. The obtained experimental results show that Gw-ABC is significantly better.},

In fact, most of these algorithms are integrated with some other intelligent technique to prove the effectiveness of each method. Out of these algorithms, the last decade has witnessed a good research contribution for Teaching–Learning Based optimization and its different variations as well as advances in many engineering domains. In this research, a variation of the TLBO technique has been integrated with the Functional Link Artificial Neural Network to classify the nonlinear data. With suitable parameter adjustments, the proposed model can classify the data efficiently. For learning, the Gradient Descent method has been adopted for obtaining the optimal weight units of the neural network.

The crucial part is how to specify the eminent problem-relevant features out of a collection of features contained in a dataset. Feature selection process goes with the pre processing steps in knowledge revelation (KDD process). It aids in eliminating the unnecessary (redundant) and unrelated (irrelevant) features in order to improve the fulfillment of classifying algorithms. It chooses the most optimal count of features that is best suited to classification model which in turn advance the learning process. As such, the correctness (accuracy) of classification increases. Thus, in this paper we have proposed a two-staged hybrid arrangement of model that contains filter-based approach in the first stage to filter out the unnecessary and unrelated features and then providing these acquired features as input to the next stage that is the wrapper method by availing the recent swarm based algorithm, namely, salp swarm algorithm or SSA. The proposed model is named as MRMR-SSA. The binary version of SSA is utilized to evaluate the features that can either take the feature as 1 or discard it as 0. Specific classifiers like XGBoost, AdaBoost, Random forests and Logistic Regression are made in use in this paper. Accuracy is considered to measure the performance of each classifier. An analogy is made for the proposed hybrid feature selection approach with a few familiar algorithms specifically MRMR-PSO, MRMR-GA, MRMR-ALO and MRMR-ACO.

The maximum return of the direct marketing campaigns is based on an appropriate prediction of the response rate and an elaborated description of the prospects. This paper plans to develop a new direct marketing campaign model in banking applications using a hybrid deep learning architecture. The proposed model consists of several steps like (a) Data acquisition, (b) Optimal feature selection, and (c) prediction. Initially, the direct marketing campaign data corresponding to banking applications are collected from other Google sites like Portuguese banking institutions. With the collected information, optimal feature selection is performed in order to reduce the dimension of the attribute or feature vector, thus can reduce the complexity of the prediction algorithm. Here, the optimal feature selection is performed by a new variant of a meta-heuristic algorithm termed as Self Adaptive-Sea Lion Optimization (SA-SLnO) Algorithm. Further, the optimally collected features are subjected to deep hybrid learning with the integration of Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). As an improvement to the deep learning model, the hidden neurons of both DBN and RNN are optimized by the same SA-SLnO. The outcome of the hybrid classifier is the decision of the customer on banking deposits. Finally, the performance of the proposed model is certified by comparing over the conventional methods through the evaluation of relevant performance measures.},

All three algorithms have been tested on the simulator with a Soft Real-time periodic task set on 500 timelines.

Textual sentiment classification harnesses the full computational potential of deep learning models. Typically, these research works are carried either with a popular open-source data corpus, or self-extracted short phrase texts from Twitter, Reddit, or web-scrapped text data from other resources. Rarely do we see a large amount of data on a current ongoing event is being collected and cultured further. Also, an even more complex task would be to model the data from a currently ongoing event, not only for scaling the sentiment accuracy but also for making a predictive analysis for the same. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for achieving sentiment evaluation accuracy by using a deep neural network on live-streamed tweets on Coronavirus and future case growth prediction. We develop a large tweet corpus exclusively based on the Coronavirus tweets. We split the data into train and test sets, alongside we perform polarity classification and trend analysis. The refined outcome from the trend analysis helps to train the data to provide an incremental learning curvature for our neural network, and we obtain an accuracy of 90.67%. Finally, we provide a statistical-based future prediction for Coronavirus cases growth. Not only our model outperforms several previous state-of-art experiments in overall sentiment accuracy comparison for similar tasks, but it also maintains a throughout performance stability among all the test cases when tested with several popular open-source text corpora.},

Consequently, exploring a method to solve this problem is of great significance to facilitating smart orchards. On this basis, this article takes the navel orange as a study object, dividing four observation periods (10:00–11:00, 12:00–13:00, 14:00–15:00, 16:00–17:00) and two viewing distances of one-meter and two-meter to collect image data.

However, dealing with the customer feedbacks in text format as an unstructured data is a challenging task, because it is hard to analyze and interpret the information. In this research work, matrix factorization and non-negative matrix factorization methods are applied in gated recurrent unit to predict the long and global time interested products of the users. The factorization methods generate the latent user and product features in gated recurrent unit for underlying the interaction between users and products. Additionally, the obtained latent user and product features are feed to Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno algorithm to recommend the final product to the customers. In this paper, gated recurrent unit gives differentiable dependencies on predicted state. To resolve the problems of non-linear constrains in gated recurrent unit, the Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno algorithm is applied in this work. Simulation results showed that the proposed algorithm achieved better performance in product recommendation compared to collaborative filtering, fuzzy c means, k-means clustering and quantum inspired possibilistic fuzzy C-means on amazon customer review database in terms of precision, recall, and accuracy.},

In this work, an improved version of a meta-heuristic algorithm, Chaotic Jaya (CJaya), is hybridized with Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM), called as CJaya-KELM, to select the most informative genes and classify the high-dimensional cancerous data. Initially, the Fisher score technique is used to pre-select the informative genes. Then, the CJaya algorithm is employed for both selecting key genes and optimizing the parameters of the KELM classifier. To evaluate the designed model, six cancerous datasets are considered. Here, the designed model CJaya-KELM, has been compared with particle swarm optimization hybridized KELM (PSO-KELM), genetic algorithm hybridized KELM (GA-KELM), and Jaya hybridized KELM (Jaya-KELM) models. Moreover, a comparison between the suggested model with other ten existing models is demonstrated here. Some performance metrices like accuracy in tenfold cross-validation method, the number of selected genes, sensitivity, F-measure, specificity, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) are applied to measure the efficiency of the suggested model. The CJaya-KELM approach resulted in the highest accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in Colon tumor (.9677, .9714, .963), Leukemia (.99, .9756, 1), Ovarian cancer (1, 1, .9892), Lymphoma-3 (.9971, 1, .9583), ALL-AML-3 (.9961, .9767, 1) and SRBCT (.998, 1, .9583) datasets respectively. The experimental results reveal that the suggested model CJaya-KELM is outperforming.},

  abstract     = {Bitcoin prediction is a recent area of research interest and growing fast. Since its inception, in a short period of time Bitcoin got wide popularity and considered as an investment asset. At present it is the most successful cryptocurrency compared to other altcoins dispersed in the world economy. The Bitcoin prices fluctuate like other stock markets due to inherent volatility. The investors’ confidence on Bitcoin rising fast and have been reflected on its prices. Though few computational intelligence methods are available, sophisticated methodologies for accurate prediction of Bitcoin are still lacking and need to be explored. Functional link neural network (FLN) is a flat network, offers lower computational complexity, and achieves enhanced input–output nonlinearity mapping through functional expansion of input signals. Basis functions such as Legendre, Trigonometric, Laguerre, and Chebyshev are commonly used polynomials in FLN for expansion of input signal dimension. In this article along with the weight and bias vector of FLNs, optimal number of polynomial functions for each category of basis function is selected by genetic algorithm during training process rather fixing them earlier. Therefore, an optimal FLN structure is crafted on fly from exploitation of training data. The optimal FLN models are used to predict the daily, weekly, and monthly closing prices of Bitcoin. A comparative study among optimal FLNs is carried out using evaluation metrics such as MAPE, NMSE, ARV, and U of Theil’s statistics. Finally, outcomes from experimental and comparative studies suggested the superiority of optimal FLN models for Bitcoin closing price prediction.},

  abstract     = {The Vortex Search Algorithm (VSA) is a meta-heuristic algorithm that has been inspired by the vortex phenomenon proposed by Dogan and Olmez in 2015. Like other meta-heuristic algorithms, the VSA has a major problem: it can easily get stuck in local optimum solutions and provide solutions with a slow convergence rate and low accuracy. Thus, chaos theory has been added to the search process of VSA in order to speed up global convergence and gain better performance. In the proposed method, various chaotic maps have been considered for improving the VSA operators and helping to control both exploitation and exploration. The performance of this method was evaluated with 24 UCI standard datasets. In addition, it was evaluated as a Feature Selection (FS) method. The results of simulation showed that chaotic maps (particularly the Tent map) are able to enhance the performance of the VSA. Furthermore, it was clearly shown the fitness of the proposed method in attaining the optimal feature subset with utmost accuracy and the least number of features. If the number of features is equal to 36, the percentage of accuracy in VSA and the proposed model is 77.49 and 92.07. If the number of features is 80, the percentage of accuracy in VSA and the proposed model is 36.37 and 71.76. If the number of features is 3343, the percentage of accuracy in VSA and the proposed model is 95.48 and 99.70. Finally, the results on Real Application showed that the proposed method has higher percentage of accuracy in comparison to other algorithms.},

Due to intra and inter personal variations, facial expressions and aging variations are major concerns in facial recognition system. In order to address this concern, a new discriminant algorithm is proposed in this research article. A gradient descent with momentum and style transfer function are included in linear collaborative discriminant regression classification algorithm to characterize the dissimilar contributions of the training facial images and to learn the optimal projection matrix by maximizing the ratio of the within class reconstruction error and collaborative between class reconstruction error. Hence, the proposed collaborative algorithm not only enhance the recognition accuracy and also overall computing efficiency. In the experimental phase, the performance of the proposed stochastic gradient descent linear collaborative discriminant regression classification algorithm is validated on ORL, YALE, and extended YALE B datasets, because these databases comprise of the extensive variety of face details, expressions, and degree of scales. The experimental outcome shows that the proposed algorithm achieved maximum of 93.34%, 90.07%, and 98.83% of recognition accuracy on ORL, YALE, and extended YALE B datasets, respectively. Compared to the other existing models, the proposed algorithm approximately showed 1.5% to 10.5% improvement in face recognition in terms of recognition accuracy on ORL, YALE, and extended YALE B datasets.},

However, the existing RSs either focus on the neighborhood or global replacement strategy, which may have difficulties in solving the complex multi-objective optimization problems. To solve this problem, a hybrid neighborhood and global replacement strategies for multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) is proposed. In this mechanism, a probability threshold pt is used to determine whether to implement neighborhood or global replacement strategy to balance convergence and diversity. Meanwhile, an offspring generation method is designed to generate high-quality offspring solutions for each sub-problem, which can improve the success of the replacement strategy. Based on MOEA/D, a new MOEA/D-HRS algorithm is designed, and it is compared with some state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) in a series of bi-objective and three-objective test instances with linear or nonlinear various linkages. The experimental results show that MOEA/D-HRS can achieve the best performance in most test instances.},

  abstract     = {Within neural networks, it is considered a difficult task to find optimal values for the number of hidden neurons and connection weights simultaneously. This is because altering the hidden neurons significantly affects a neural network’s structure and increases the difficulty of the training process which needs special considerations. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is one of the most important metaheuristic algorithms due to its convergence speed and its simplicity of implementation. Multi-verse optimization (MVO) based on Lévy flight is a recent and fast algorithm and can avoid premature convergence and can achieve a better balance between exploration and exploitation. This paper presents a new training method based on hybrid particle swarm optimization with Multi-verse optimization based on Lévy flight (PLMVO) to optimize the number of hidden neurons and connection weights simultaneously in feedforward neural networks (FFNN). The hybrid algorithm is utilized to search better in solution space which proves its efficiency in reducing the problems of trapping in local minima. To evaluate the proposed algorithm we used three experimental series. In the first one, the proposed PLMVO algorithm is compared with the MVO and PSO algorithms to solve a set of 15 benchmark functions to find the global solution. Meanwhile, in the second experiment, the performance of the proposed approach was compared with five evolutionary techniques and the standard momentum backpropagation and adaptive learning rate. The comparison was benchmarked and evaluated using nine bio-medical datasets. The results of the comparative study show that PLMVO outperformed other training methods in most datasets and can be an alternative to other training methods. In the third experiment, the proposed PLMVO-MLP is used to predict malicious executable Linux files. The implemented model achieved very promising results with very high accuracy of 1.0, and an average f-measure of 1.0.},

Modified US is tested on the seven following well-known benchmarks from the UCI machine learning directory: Iris, Wine, Glass, Cancer, Vowel, CMC, and Ecoli. The results are then compared against metaheuristics, such as genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO), black hole algorithm, hybrid of PSO k-means, and accelerated chaotic PSO.

Although high-performance computing techniques have been applied to reduce the computational time of meta-heuristic algorithms, it does not mean that they can assist meta-heuristic algorithms in finding a high-quality solution. Moreover, most of meta-heuristic algorithms may belong to the “depth-first” search method, thus achieving a tradeoff between the broad search and the deep search is a crucial objective in the EC. To alleviate the above problems, a parallel zoning search (PZS) strategy is proposed in the current study. In the PZS, the entire search space is divided into many small search spaces for improving the broad search capability of algorithms and reducing the problem complexity. Subsequently, selected meta-heuristic algorithms considered as deep search algorithms are employed to find a satisfactory solution in each search region. The effectiveness of the PZS integrated into six differential evolution (DE) variants is demonstrated on two commonly used test suites, i.e., IEEE CEC2014 and BBOB2012. Results suggest that the PZS is a highly competitive approach to solve different types of optimization problems, especially on complex optimization problems. Finally, the PZS incorporated into six DE variants is used to estimate parameters of a heavy oil thermal cracking model. Results indicate that the PZS is an effective and efficient tool to help selected algorithms solve actual industrial optimization problems.},

In the actual processing process, the combination’s effect depends not only on QoS but also on the geographical aspects, company, and other attributes. Based on this, we propose a tool combination model based on the task sequence (TCMbTS).

This vulnerability in nodes makes the wireless sensor network unstable and leads to many types of demerits like limited battery lifetime, less computing, and limited memory space. To avoid these attacks and to reduce the impact created by the malicious nodes, we suggest a simple and effective way of detecting and removing unhealthy nodes in the environment. We proposed a simple scheme by using the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm which is known as the cuddle death design. The theme of a scheme is to find the unhealthy or malicious cluster head nodes in the network and removing that particular node without creating any harm to the other nodes in the environment. It also helps to improve the energy efficiency, packet delivery ratio with maximum throughput in WSN.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to minimize the generation cost of a low voltage (LV) grid-connected microgrid system using a novel hybrid whale optimization algorithm (WOA)- Sine cosine algorithm (SCA) optimization technique. Three different methods of electricity market prices are formulated in turns and the generation cost is evaluated for each method to sort out the best among them which yields the least generation cost of the same microgrid system. Both active and passive participation of grid are studied to acknowledge its importance. Numerical results show that the time of usage (TOU) method of electricity market pricing proved to be the most convenient and economic method for cost analysis of the system. The generation cost was at its maximum when the electricity price was a constant value. Also during the TOU method of electricity pricing, a 15% surge in the price was realized when the grid was passively participating in supplying power to the system. Figures and statistical data aids the fact that proposed hybrid WOASCA outperformed WOA in consistently providing a robust and superior quality result.},

  abstract     = {Differential evolution (DE) algorithm is a very effective algorithm used for solving wide range of optimization problems. However, the performance of DE is dependent on the control parameters and to choose the right parameter value and tuning of these parameters is a challenging task. Therefore, a novel variant of differential evolution algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (DEPSO) is proposed to improve the overall performance of Differential evolution algorithm. In our proposed approach, we are using DE mutation strategy during the initial phase of evolution and therefore enlarge its search space possibly to the extent that helps in finding more encouraging results and thus avoid premature convergence. During the subsequent phase of evolution process, this value of sigmoid function reduces with the increase of number of iterations. In this scenario, there is a greater probability of operating PSO mutation strategy and thus this sigmoid function helps in improving the precision and convergence speed. The Performance of our proposed algorithm is tested with 10 benchmark test functions on 50 and 25 dimensions set, also tested with 11 test functions on 30- and 100-dimension test functions. We have also tested our proposed algorithm with 8 test functions on high dimension set as 500- and 1000-dimensions. The performance comparison shows that our proposed variant is giving significant improvement in convergence speed and thus avoiding premature convergence. Average performance of DEPSO is better than classical DE, PSO and other algorithms in comparison.},

  abstract     = {The classification of imbalanced data has presented a significant challenge for most well-known classification algorithms that were often designed for data with relatively balanced class distributions. Nevertheless skewed class distribution is a common feature in real world problems. It is especially prevalent in certain application domains with great need for machine learning and better predictive analysis such as disease diagnosis, fraud detection, bankruptcy prediction, and suspect identification. In this paper, we propose a novel tree-based algorithm based on the area under the precision–recall curve for variable selection in the classification context. Our algorithm, named as the “Precision–Recall curve classification tree”, or simply the “PRC classification tree” modifies two crucial stages in tree building. The first stage is to maximize the area under the precision–recall curve in node variable selection. The second stage is to maximize the harmonic mean of recall and precision (F-measure) for threshold selection. We found the proposed PRC classification tree, and its subsequent extension, the PRC random forest, work well especially for class-imbalanced data sets. We have demonstrated that our methods outperform their classic counterparts, the usual CART and random forest for both synthetic and real data. Furthermore, the ROC classification tree proposed by our group previously, based on the area under the ROC curve, has shown good performance in imbalanced data. Their combination, the PRC–ROC tree, has also shows great promise in identifying the minority class.},

To improve diagnostic accuracy from histopathology, this study evaluates the potential of the pre-trained deep-learning-based model on a large dataset for discrimination among sub-classes of breast cancer. A hybrid model is proposed by combining the pre-trained model (Xception and VGG16) along with conventional machine learning classifier to achieve highest accuracies in the classification of breast cancer without considering the magnification factor of the histopathological images. Real-time data augmentation is also applied to the dataset in order to reduce the problem of overfitting. The performance of developed hybrid models is compared for achieving the highest classification accuracies with an optimum running time. It has been found that VGG16 acquires an accuracy, precision, recall, f-score, area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC), average precision score of 78.67%, 0.76, 0.75, 0.75, 0.86, 0.60 with a running time of 39.72 min when used in conjunction with logistic regression which is further enhanced by the Xception model to 82.45%, 0.83, 0.82, 0.82, 0.90, 0.70 with a running time of 36.57 min.

Therefore, this paper introduces a new shortest path selection model, which is based on the shortest travel time required to travel (source to destination). For this prediction, an optimized Neural Network model is introduced, where the historical data is insisted under the training process. The factors considered for predicting the average travel time to reach the destination are congestion level, distance and time interval, respectively.

In recent years, there has been a notable development in the research associated with character recognition in handwritten Devanagari documents. To improve the recognition performance, this paper tactics to develop new handwritten character recognition model using an improved machine learning approach. The proposed character recognition model includes four stages like pre-processing, Segmentation, Feature Extraction, and Classification. Initially, the scanned handwritten document for Devanagari language is subjected to pre-processing, which includes stages like, RGB to gray, thresholding, complement of image, morphological operations, linearization and noise removal using Median Filter. Then, the characters of the pre-processed image are segmented using k-means clustering that is a popular method for cluster analysis. Further, the features like, Kirsch Directional Edge, Freeman chain code and neighborhood distance weight using Delaunay Triangulation are extracted from the segmented characters. Subsequently, the classification of characters is done using Neural Network (NN) where the new training algorithm is used, in which the weights are optimized using a hybrid optimization by combining Lion Optimization Algorithm and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO). Here, the update procedure of GWO is based on LA algorithm and hence, the proposed algorithm is named as Lion Updated GWO (LU-GWO). To the next of the implementation, a valuable comparative analysis confirms the improved performance of the proposed LU-GWO-NN model over conventional methods in classifying the consonants, numerals, and vowels from different characters.},

The proposed method uses the Frequent Pattern (FP)-Growth algorithm for mining the association rules from the database. At first, the FP-Growth algorithm extracts the FPs from the database by applying the support threshold and then, generates the association rules from the FPs by applying the confidence threshold. Then, the generated association rules are processed by the GA for producing the privacy preserved association rules while preserving the sensitive rules. Finally, the privacy preserved association rules are provided to the third party users. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated with the existing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for the evaluation metrics&#39; privacy and utility. The experimental results show that the proposed method mines the privacy preserved association rules from the database with the maximum privacy of 0.124 and the minimum utility of 0.0989 when compared to the existing method.},

Optimization within the WSN is the outstanding concern to provide intellect for the extensive period of network lifetime. Since clustering is a topological control method to decrease the process of SNs, it extensively improves overall system scalability and energy efficiency. Moreover, the appropriate selection of CH plays crucial role for attaining sustainable WSN. This paper proposes the firefly contribution with Firefly Cyclic Randomization (FCR) for the selection of cluster head in WSN. The randomly created solution in this algorithm is found based on three distribution functions like Uniform, Normal, and Gamma distributions. Moreover, the analysis is made on the second algorithm Firefly Cyclic Grey Wolf Optimization (FCGWO) by modifying $$r^{1}$$ and $$r^{2}$$ (random vectors) of Grey Wolf Optimization. In reality, the FCR and FGCGWO algorithms are planned on selecting the optimal cluster head by concentrating mainly on minimization of delay, minimization of the distance between nodes, and stabilization of energy.

  abstract     = {With the increasing number of traffic vehicles and urbanization, the frequencies of traffic accidents are growing exponentially. The research for routing emergency vehicles has gained significant attention in Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) topology. The path planning for an emergency vehicle can avoid congestion and minimize the travel time to prevent accidents. Thus, this work proposes a dynamic path planning scheme for routing emergency vehicles. At first, the VANET is simulated and the dynamic path planning is performed after the arrival of emergency vehicles. The proposed dynamic path planning includes two steps, namely travel-time forecasting, and bi-model routing. The travel time is predicted using the Support Vector Regression model and the bimodal is employed to route the emergency vehicles optimally. The bimodal consists of two steps, such as K-path discovery and optimal path selection process. Initially, the possible K shortest path is detected from which the optimal path is selected by the proposed Exponential Bird Swarm Optimization Algorithm (Exp-BSA). The proposed Exp-BSA algorithm is designed by integrating the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average concept in Bird Swarm Algorithm (BSA). Thus, the proposed Exp-BSA determines the optimal paths based on the devised fitness function, and the selected paths are suggested to emergency vehicles for faster routing. The performance of the proposed dynamic path planning for an emergency vehicle based on Exp-BSA is evaluated using three simulation setups based on the metrics, such as distance, average traffic density, average speed, and travel time. Also, the performance of the proposed method is compared with the existing methods, such as SFLA-KC, K-Path, and BSA. From the results, it is exposed that the proposed Exp-BSA method achieves the overall best performance than the existing methods with a minimal distance of 48.404 m, an average traffic density of 0.015 min, an average speed of 1.392 m/s, travel time of 19.608 s.},

  abstract     = {Target detection is one of the important subfields in the research of synthetic aperture radar (SAR). It faces many challenges, due to the stationary objects, leading to the presence of a scatter signal. Many researchers have been done on target detection, and most of them prefer filter based techniques. In this work, the moving target detection in SAR using decision fusion method is proposed. The newly developed scheme is named Bayesian fusion for moving target detection (BF-MTD) as the scheme utilizes the Bayesian model for identifying the target location. Initially, the received signals from the SAR are fed through the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and the matching filters for identifying the target location. Then, the results are fused together by the Bayesian fusion strategy for finding the actual target. For the fusion, the Naive Bayes classifier is used for determining the optimal parameter for the target detection. The simulation of the proposed BF-MTD model is evaluated by varying target, iteration; pulse repetition level and antenna turn velocity of the SAR. Simulation results reveal that the proposed BF-MTD has achieved significant performance for a detection time, missed target rate, and mean square error, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In H.265/high efficiency video coding encoding, the cost function is a significant feature that decides the mode and structure of the encoding and the effectiveness of the methods relies on the coding efficiency, minimal rate-distortion optimization, and encoding time. The issues associated with the aforementioned factors are tackled effectively by proposing a new block search, an Adaptive block searching algorithm (AdBS) along with the fractional rate-distortion trade-off (fractional RD trade-off). The motion estimation using the proposed Adaptive block searching algorithm uses the heptagon block search patterns with eight checkpoints in such a way to assure the fast processing, contributing towards the minimal encoding process. The coding efficiency is enhanced twice with the assured reconstruction quality and bandwidth. The analysis is performed with single and multiple videos obtained from the CIPR SIF Sequences database and the analysis in terms of Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and average time reveals the effectiveness of the proposed AdBS and fractional RD-trade-off- based motion estimation. The PSNR, SSIM, and average time of the proposed method are found to be 85.6548%, 45 dB, and 565 nano-secs for single videos and 88.9841%, 45 dB, and 2584 nano-secs for the multiple videos.},

Even though there are a large number of techniques employed for the video SR, all these existing techniques face a hectic challenge at various conditions. Thus, this paper proposes an effective video resolution strategy using the hybrid Support vector regression–Actor Critic Neural Network (SVR–ACNN) model for video enhancement. The SR images formed using the individual SVR model and ACNN are integrated using the weighted average concept. The ACNN is tuned optimally by the proposed Fractional-based Sine Cosine algorithm (F-SCA), which is responsible for the global optimal convergence. The experimentation of the proposed method utilizes three videos taken from the Cambridge-driving Labeled Video Database (CamVid), and the results are analyzed for three scaling factors. The results prove that the proposed model offers a better SR image with a better PSNR, SSIM, and SDME of 33.6447 dB, 0.9398, and 45.2779, respectively.},

  abstract     = {One of the recent ways of checking the internal organs such as kidneys, gallbladder, liver, and spleen is using an abdominal US image. US image is more familiar for its unique characteristics like radiation-free, safe, cheaper and faster. However, the thing to be considered is that US images cannot grant a precise view of affected regions. More particularly the unprocessed US images comprise a lot of embedded noises. Thus the digital processing is a promising result for improving the quality of US images. This paper intends to propose a novel model for abdominal masses detection with US images. This detection model comprises two phases: feature extraction as well as Classification. In the feature extraction process, texture features are extracted from the US image by AGLOH. Then in the classification stage, the optimized ISLSR model is used to detect whether the mass is present in the abdomen or not, where the coefficient matrix is optimally tuned using a new hybrid Lion and Whale Optimization algorithm. The performance analysis of the proposed method is compared with existing techniques such as GLCM-SVM, GLCM-NN, GLCM-LDCA, AGLOH-SVM, AGLOH-NN, AGLOH-LDCA, AGLOH-ISLSR-LA, and AGLOH-ISLSR-WOA. The performance of the developed method is analyzed in terms of both positive as well as negative measures: the positive measures include accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision, NPV, F1 Score, and MCC. The negative measures include FPR, FNR, and FDR, and the efficiency of the proposed model is proved.},

Hence, it is a necessity to detect cancer in an early stage due to the alarming increase in the reports. Various techniques are introduced for effective prostate cancer detection using histopathology images. Accordingly, an automatic method is proposed for segmenting and classifying prostate cancer. This paper presents the prostate cancer detection method using histopathology images by proposing the fuzzy-based salp swarm algorithm-based rider neural network (SSA-RideNN) classifier. At first, the input image is fed to the pre-processing step and then the segmentation is performed using Color Space transformation and thresholding. Once the segmentation is performed, the feature extraction is done by extracting multiple kernel scale invariant feature transform features along with the texture features that are extracted based on local optimal oriented pattern descriptor to improve the classification accuracy. Finally, the prostate cancer detection is done based on the proposed fuzzy-based SSA-RideNN, which is developed by integrating fuzzy approach with SSA-RideNN. The performance of the proposed fuzzy-based SSA-RideNN is analyzed using sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The proposed fuzzy-based SSA-RideNN produces the maximum accuracy of 0.9190, a maximum sensitivity of 0.9084, and maximum specificity of 0.9, indicating its superiority.},

The energy and the security crisis in the MANET are addressed effectively using the cluster head (CH) selection and intrusion detection strategies namely, fuzzy clustering and fuzzy Naive Bayes (fuzzy NB). Then, the multipath routing progresses using the secure nodes based on the routing protocol, Bird swarm-whale optimization algorithm (BSWOA), which is the integration of bird swarm optimization (BSA) in whale optimization algorithm (WOA). The selection of the optimal routes is based on fitness factors, such as connectivity, energy, trust, and throughput. The analysis of the methods is done using the attacks, such as flooding, blackhole, and selective packet drop based on the performance metrics. The proposed BSWOA acquired the maximal energy, throughput, detection rate, and a minimal delay of 9.48 Joule, 0.676 bps, 69.9%, and 0.00372 ms in the presence of the attack.},

Under such circumstances, it seeks an effective spent wash treatment, to eliminate the contaminants. Accordingly, this paper provides a relevant review regarding the distillery spent wash treatments, associated with the proper treatments and coagulants. At first, it reviews 67 recent research papers, from which 24 papers belong to distillery spent wash treatment and remaining belongs to other treatments. Further, it extends the valuable chronological review on distillery spent wash treatment. In addition, it describes the several processes such as anaerobic treatment, aerobic treatment, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, adsorption and electrochemical treatments, adopted to treat distillery spent wash as reported in the literature. In the same way, it analyses the usage of different types of coagulants such as natural, electro and chemical coagulants used in distillery spent wash treatment. To the next of the coagulant analysis, it checks out the performance review of entire contributions on distillery spent wash treatment. The conventional process for distillery spent wash treatment having limitations such as limited removal efficiency, high operating cost and maintenance also it needs a high detention time that eventually increases the on the whole treatment process time. The aforesaid limitation can be overcome by adopting soft computing techniques. Soft computing has been widely studied and applied in the past three decades for engineering and scientific research computing. In environmental engineering, engineers and researchers have effectively used various techniques of soft computing like fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems, and support vector machines which can be useful for the researchers to achieve further research on distillery spent wash treatment.},

However, the complexities such as variability, sustainability, multi-dimensional views, factory size, to name just a few negatively influences the performance of deploying lean manufacturing in industries. It is, therefore, very important for companies to recognize and understand the critical success factors for successfully implementing lean manufacturing. Hence, this paper plans to develop a model on concerning the analysis of lean manufacturing to find the most important factor regarding the technology among the industries. With this intention, this paper is analyzed through three phases. In the first phase, the prepared questionnaire is distributed to the professionals in various companies. In the questionnaire, all the mandatory questions are included. Then, the professional are recommended to fill the precise information as far as possible. In the second phase, the responses from the concerned practitioners associated with the industries are considered for analysis. Herein, the analysis is carried out based on structural equation modeling approaches with the contribution of higher order statistical analysis, which is performed using the input factors such as the lean awareness, lean technology, organizational support, organizational performance, employee involvement and management commitment among the industries via attaining better maximum likelihood values of the questionnaires. In the third phase, the Prediction of polynomial fitting of the response (i.e. the objective function) is achieved with the aid a novel optimization algorithm SLnO-EE model (Sea Lion with Enhanced Exploration phase), which is the extended version of SLnO (Sea Lion Optimization). Finally, the proposed SLnO-EE model is evaluated over traditional SLnO model in terms of certain performance evaluations to exhibit the improvement in prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, flexible alternating current transmission system devices, particularly unified power quality conditioner (UPQC) are found to have significant impacts on stability of rising power system. In power systems, several intellectual optimization methods were exploited to position the UPQC. However, those optimization models fail to offer more reliability and feedback signal. Hence, this paper presents a power quality improvement model, which is based on a hybrid algorithm that links genetic algorithm (GA) and DragonFly algorithm (DA). In the current research work, the optimal solution is determined based on the crossover operation of GA in dragonfly algorithm (DA), and hence, the adopted model is named as Genetically Modified DA algorithm. Moreover, the proposed model discovers the optimal location of UPQC device by focusing on the UPQC cost, power losses, and Voltage stability Index. The proposed model is carried out in IEEE 69, and IEEE 33 test bus systems. In addition, the performance of implemented model is distinguished over other conventional models such as artificial bee colony, firefly, grey wolf optimization, whale optimization algorithm, worst solution linked whale optimization algorithm update (WS-WU), GA and DA. The performance of the proposed model is effectively proved by performance and convergence analysis.},

  abstract     = {Age estimation is an interesting and challenging research area, gaining significant importance in the recent era and is employed in various applications, such as intelligent surveillance, face recognition, biometrics, and so on. Various techniques are employed in the literature for age estimation from the face images. This paper introduces the age estimation scheme from the face image, and estimation is done by defining a novel feature extraction strategy, named Local Transform Directional Pattern (LTDP). The database containing the input images has many unwanted regions, and thus, the Viola Jones algorithm detects the required face region. After detecting the face regions, active appearance model extracts the active appearance features, and the proposed LTDP extracts the texture features. The proposed LTDP feature extraction model modifies the existing Local Directional Pattern (LDP) with several other texture feature extraction models. After the feature extraction, the Cuckoo search based Deep Belief Network (CDBN) classifier estimates the age of the person from the face image based on the extracted features. The simulation results reveal that the proposed LTDP with the CDBN classifier achieved high performance with the values of 2.3416, 0.9803, and 0.9724 for MAE, AEO, and AEM, respectively.},

This paper concentrates on the land use classification and proposes an optimization algorithm, called Firefly Harmony Search (FHS) for training the Deep Belief Neural Network (DBN). The FHS algorithm is the integration of the Firefly Algorithm and Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA), which tunes the weights of DBN to perform the multi-class classification. For the effective classification, the multispectral image is subjected to the sparse Fuzzy C-Means to form segments such that the feature extraction is effective, free from dimensionality issues and computational complexities. The features extracted from the segments of the multi-spectral images include vegetation indices and statistical features. Then, these features are fed to the DBN, which is tuned using the FHS algorithm for performing the land use classification. Experimentation using four datasets proves the effectiveness of the proposed multi-class classification approach. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the method are found to be 0.9317, 0.9568, and 0.0379, respectively, that is effective over the existing land use classification methods.},

The classification of this signal is complex due to the large dataset, computational complexity and limited real time performance. This paper focuses on the detection and classification of electric power transmission using neural network with adaptive evolutionary learning and cascade support vector machine (SVM) with wavelet descriptors of the signal to overcome such limitations. Initially the wavelet decomposed fault signals are extracted from the simulated signals. The received signal consists of normal signals and fault signals such as transient, sag and swells signals respectively. The wavelet descriptors of different datasets are applied to the cascade SVM for better classification. This real experiment of this paper shows that this cascade SVM provides good generalization and much fast speed compared with traditional SVMs.},

  abstract     = {One of the major aspects regarding the operation and planning of a power system was to reduce the emission of pollutions and fuel costs in thermal power plants. This issue was resolved as an optimization crisis, where the reduction of emission of pollutions and fuel cost was done and it is known as the combined economic emission dispatch (CEED) problem. Various techniques were introduced for improving the performance of the power plants with respect to algorithm reliability, solution accuracy, global optimality, and convergence speed for resolving the CEED issues. Therefore, this work establishes a CEED approach for the smart grid system and resolves it by exploiting the hybridized concepts of the crow search algorithm (CSA) and differential evolution (DE). The hybridized model of the two well-known schemes is achieved by updating the solutions of both the schemes and merging them with the random searching model. Thus, the new approach is named as hybrid DE and CSA model. The CEED approach is subjected to reduce its cost and therefore, sufficient trade-off between the emission and economic costs could be sustained. The presented hybrid scheme is simulated on 3 diverse bus systems and its performance is evaluated over other state-of-the-art models in terms of CPU time and generation strategy.},

The features, such as tonal power ratio, Multiple Kernel Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MKMFCC) parameters, and the spectral flux are extracted and provided as the training input to the proposed Taylor-DBN classifier for identifying the emotions present in the signal. The experimentation is done with the help of the Berlin database, real database 1, and the real database 2. The experimental datasets contain the speech signals from different domain and language, and the performance of the proposed Taylor-DBN has shown minimal variations in each domain, and thus, the proposed model is suitable for various domains.

The network contains a group of sensor nodes, which are capable of sensing, computing, and transmitting. Energy efficiency is one of the most important challenging problems in WSN. Sensor nodes have inadequate energy and installed in remote areas. Hence, it is difficult to restore the batteries in WSN. Therefore, to maximize the network lifetime, appropriate clustering techniques and cluster head (CH) selection methods should be implemented. The main idea behind the clustering technique is that it clusters the sensor nodes and reduces the composed data simultaneously and then, it broadcasts the data. In this process, CH selection is an essential part. Therefore, this survey paper provides an overview of the clustering techniques for reducing energy consumption by reviewing several CH selection techniques in WSN that provide high energy efficiency. Several techniques have been employed for CH selection based on partitional clustering, optimization, low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy, hierarchical, distributed, and other classification methods. Finally, an analysis is done based on the implementation tools, metrics employed, accuracy, and achievements of the considered CH selection techniques.},

The forgered image appears original, as the objective region in spite of being forged, has attained the fundamental qualities of the similar image itself. The capability of the copy-move forgery detection (CMFD) technique is lacked due to some post-processing functions, like JPEG compression scaling, or rotation, etc. Therefore, this paper intends to develop a CMFD using Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), best-fin-first algorithm (BBF) and RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) directed by grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm. Initially, the keypoints are selected using SIFT principle, and BBF algorithm identifies the matched keypoints using keypoint threshold. Further, SIFT feature descriptor is determined, and the final extracted paired keypoints are given to RANSAC algorithm to remove all the mismatched keypoints. In this CMFD model, the parameters such as parameters keypoint threshold, maximum distance of inliers in RANSAC and distance threshold in SIFT features are optimized using GWO. The foremost purpose of this research work is maximizing the number of paired keypoints. Hence the proposed model is termed as GWO-based parameter optimization for CMFD (GWPO-CMD). The proposed model is compared over several other meta-heuristic-based keypoint threshold selections and proves its efficiency through diverse analysis.},

It introduces a performance prediction architecture that includes two modules. One module is to handle the big data via MapReduce framework (incorporates the concept of principle component analysis), whereas the second module is an intelligent module that predicts the performance of the students using data processing stages. For this, this paper introduces a new hybrid classifier, which hybridizes the deep belief network and support vector machine. The output from the proposed classifier gives an accurate prediction of student performance.

Accordingly, this paper introduces the trust-based topology-hiding multipath routing algorithm for the MANET. The proposed model finds the security factor of each node in the MANET, and the neighbor nodes are selected based on the defined security factor. The proposed routing method has four models for defining the security factor, namely the trusted model, energy model, delay model, and the mobility model. The proposed multipath routing determines the secured route between the sender and receiver based on the selected neighbor nodes. Finally, data communication is performed through the selected multipath. The performance of the proposed multipath routing is analyzed with the existing methods, such as topology-hiding multipath routing protocol, Fractional lion optimization to topology-hiding multi-path routing, and Adaptive Fractional lion optimization to topology-hiding multi-path routing for the performance metrics, such as throughput, delay, energy, and packet drop rate (PDR). Simulation results show that the proposed multipath routing has the better values of 0.330566, 0.376754, 0.319369, and 0.380559 after 50 s of simulation for throughput, delay, energy, and PDR than the existing models when there is an attack on the node.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, extensively obtainable personal data has made Privacy-Preserving Data Mining (PPDM) issues a significant one. PPDM handles securing the privacy of sensitive knowledge or personal data without leaking the utility of the data. Several techniques have been introduced with the concern of privacy, yet there exist certain limitations in PPDM in achieving the feasible standards. Hence, this paper intends to develop a sanitization and restoration model by concerning objective functions like, Hiding Failure rate, Information Preservation rate, False Rules generation rate, Degree of Modification, Compression Ratio, tampering and Low Pass Filter for better preservation of privacy data. In sanitization and restoration, a key is generated optimally using Hybrid model named Genetic Algorithm with Crow Search Algorithm (GA-CSA). Moreover, the sensitive data is restored efficiently by the authorized user at the receiving end. Finally, the proposed GA-CSA approach is compared over conventional schemes such as Firefly (FF), Self-Adaptive FF Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Differential Evolution approach and the enhanced outcomes are obtained.},

  abstract     = {Big data is the recent imminent technology, which can provide large benefits to the business administration. Owing to such huge volume, it becomes very complicated to ensure effective analysis by the existing techniques. The complications can be related to analyze, capture, sharing, storage, and visualization of the data. To tackle these challenges, a novel classification technique using Holoentropy based Correlative Naive Bayes classifier and MapReduce Model (HCNB-MRM) is proposed. The proposed HCNB, which is designed by combining the Holoentropy function with the correlative based Naive Bayes classifier deals with both high-dimensional data sets as well as extensive datasets to improve the benchmark, and classify the data based on dependent assumption. Therefore, the proposed HCNB-MRM is used to make the process simpler and to choose the best features from big dataset. The proposed HCNB with the MapReduce Model maximizes the performance of big data classification using probability index table, and posterior probability of the testing data samples. The performance of the proposed HCNB-MRM is evaluated using three metrics, such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. From the experimental results, it is analyzed that the proposed HCNB-MRM obtains a high classification accuracy of 93.5965% and 94.3369% for the localization dataset, and skin dataset when compared with the existing techniques.},

  abstract     = {Long term evolution (LTE) is a user-friendly network in providing a user requested service, and the growth of LTE is reported exponentially due to the attractive applications. The existence of the huge number of users and a massive presence of user demands in the network raise a question on the Quality-of-Service (QoS). In order to assure the required QoS with the available resources in the network, the paper proposes a call admission control scheme using a fuzzy-based decisive approach. The proposed method works based on the available resources in the network and allocates extra resource blocks when there is a lag in the demanded QoS. The flexible and user-friendly service is assured to three groups of users, for which the users are categorized based on the requested service as soon the service is requested. The simulation environment is developed to perform the fuzzy-based call admission control in LTE such that the results prove that the proposed method outperformed the existing methods in terms of delay, throughput, cell power, and call drops. The delay, throughput, cell power, and call drops using the proposed method are 0.1103 s, 1,294,932 bps, 44.2071 dBm, and 328, respectively. Also, the proposed method has the minimum call blocking probability of 0.0527 and 0.2901 for handoff users and new users. It has the call dropping probability of 0.0528 and 0.3357 for handoff users and new users, respectively.},

Ultrasound imaging is a noninvasive modality utilized commonly for the detection of breast cancer, which is a common and dangerous cancer found in women. This paper proposes an approach for the detection of breast cancer using ultrasound images using MKF-cuckoo search (MKF-CS) algorithm and hybrid based neural (H-BN) classifier. In pre-processing, the input images to be diagnosed are pre-processed by ROI extraction using a novel algorithm, four way search. The pre-processed image is allowed to perform segmentation using MKF-CS algorithm. The key features, such as mean, variance, standard deviation, and so on, are extracted in feature extraction and are fed to the proposed H-BN classifier. Based on the training data, H-BN classifier classifies the data into benign or malignant tumor classes, for the detection of breast cancer. To evaluate the performance of the proposed MKFCS-HBN approach, three metrics, such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, are utilized. The experimental results show that MKFCS-HBN could attain the maximum performance with an accuracy of 0.8889, the sensitivity of 1, and specificity of 0.85 and thus, prove its effectiveness.},

The major issue of the big medical data is about its complex data sets and volume, which is gradually increasing. This paper intends to propose a big data classification model (heart disease) in health care, which includes certain phases or steps. The steps are as follows: (1) Map-reduce framework (2) support vector machine (SVM) (3) optimized decision tree classifier (DT). Initially, the big data is supplied as the input to the MapReduce Framework, where it reduces the data content through some major operations. This framework uses the principle component analysis to reduce the dimensions of data. The reduced data is subjected to SVM, where it outputs the classes. The output data from SVM is processed with a new contribution called ‘Data transformation’ that paves way for optimal rule generation in decision tree classifier. The advanced optimization concept is involved in this process to optimize the weight and integer in data transformation. This paper introduces a new algorithm namely divergence based grey wolf optimization (DGWO). Finally, the transformed data is subjected to DT, where the classification takes place. The proposed DGWO model is compared over other conventional methods like firefly algorithm, artificial bee colony algorithm, particle swarm optimization algorithm, genetic algorithm and grey wolf optimizer algorithms.},

Activity recognition is performed to recognize the goals and actions of one or more people from a sequence of observations based on the actions and the environmental conditions. Still, there are numbers of challenges and issues, which motivate the development of new activity recognition method to enhance the accuracy under more realistic conditions. This paper proposes an error-based fuzzy dragon deep belief network (error-based DDBN), which is the integration of fuzzy with DDBN classifier, to recognize the human activity from a complex and diverse scenario, for which the keyframes are generated based on the Bhattacharya coefficient from the set of frames of the given video. The key frames from the Bhattacharya are extracted using the scale invariant feature transform, color histogram of the spatio-temporal interest dominant points, and hierarchical skeleton. Finally, the features are fed to the classifier, where the classification is done using the proposed error-based fuzzy DDBN to recognize the person. The experimentation is performed using two datasets, namely KTH and Weizmann for analyzing the performance of the proposed classifier. The experimental results reveal that the proposed classifier performs the activity recognition in a better way by obtaining the maximum accuracy of 1, a sensitivity of 0.99, and the specificity of 0.991.},

Numbers of research works are presented for image forensic analysis. Accordingly, this paper proposes a method named as Dragonfly Bayes Fusion System (DBFS) by integrating the Naive Bayes (NB) classifier and the Dragonfly optimization for detecting the tampered Joint Photographic Experts Group image. Initially, the input image is applied to the existing six forensic tools separately, and the classified binary map is generated. Then, the proposed DBFS fuses these decisions for generating the optimal decision. Here, the NB classifier creates the model by finding the mean and variance of every feature and this model is given as input to the Dragonfly optimization for optimally generating the probabilistic measures. Finally, the posterior probability of each feature is determined with respect to the tampered class, and the original class and the tampered image block is determined. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated with the existing methods, such as fuzzy theory based classification, rule-based classification, average method, and weighted average method for the evaluation metrics accuracy, False Positive Rate (FPR), and True Positive Rate (TPR). The experimental results show that the proposed system outperforms the existing methods by obtaining the maximum accuracy of 0.9519, minimum FPR of 0.0490, and maximum TPR of 0.8720 when compared to the existing methods.},

In addition to that, Sentiment analysis engine is preceded by topic classification, which classifies tweets into different categories and filters irrelevant tweets. The proposed method is compared with Lexicon, Naïve Bayesian classifier for uni-gram and bi-gram features. Out of the different approaches, the proposed HL-NBC method does sentiment classification in an improved way and gives accuracy of 82%, which is comparatively better than other methods. Also, the sentiment analysis is performed in a shorter time compared to traditional methods and achieves 93% improvement in processing time for larger datasets.},

  abstract     = {Sisal fiber cement is comprehensively deployed in the construction works owing to their flexibility as cladding panels and ridged equipment, and water containers that are accessible in a massive number of cultivation and construction applications. The most important reason for integrating the sisal fibers into the cement matrix is to increase the toughness; tensile strength and the bend features of the resulting composite. In recent times, the sisal fibers have been employed as reinforcement in concretes. These cementitious composites are presently deliberated to be one of the most accomplished structural equipment in the modern industrial technology. Accordingly, in the presented survey, several papers are taken for analyzing the performance of sisal fibers. In addition, the papers taken for review are studied depending on the composition of concrete and sisal constituents in the work of art of building. Moreover, the sisal fiber with a composition other than concrete is also illustrated. The contributions regarding the tensile strength and compression strength in the adopted papers are analyzed together with their percentage of composition. The evolutions of the adopted papers along with their various applications are moreover analyzed in detail.},

This paper proposes an advanced algorithm, called fractional whale optimization integrated adaptive dragonfly (F-WOADF) algorithm to perform the MT from the class diagram (CLD) to relational schema (RS) model. The proposed algorithm modifies the adaptive dragonfly (ADF) algorithm with the concept of whale optimization algorithm (WOA) using the fractional theory. The UML CLD is transformed into the RS model using the optimal blocks that are selected with the use of the proposed algorithm. The performance of the F-WOADF method is evaluated using automatic correctness (AC), and fitness measure. The proposed method produces the maximum AC of 0.8583 and the maximum fitness measure of 0.8984 that indicates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

A hybrid model was developed in the previous work using the Nearest Search Algorithm (NSA) and exponential weighted moving average (EWMA), for the video object retrieval. In NSA + EWMA, the object trajectories are retrieved based on the query specific distance. This work extends the previous work by developing a novel path equalization scheme for equalizing the path length of the query and the tracked object. Initially, a hybrid model based on Support Vector Regression and NSA tracks the position of the object in the video. The proposed density measure scheme equalizes the path length of the query and the object. Then, the identified path length related to the query is given to extended nearest neighbor classifier for retrieving the video. From the simulation results, it is evident that the proposed video retrieval scheme achieved high values of 0.901, 0.860, 0.849, and 0.922 for precision, recall, F-measure, and multiple object tracking precision, respectively.},

It simulates the GWOGS-based CR system relying on the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), to allocate the recourses optimally. After attaining the respective simulation, it compares the performance of the GWOGS to the conventional algorithms like Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Firefly (FF), GSO, GWO, and SOAP. Moreover, it provides the valuable comparative analysis in terms of convergence, ranking, cost and impact of orthogonality. In addition, it reveals the statistical analysis of the entire benchmark algorithm to attain the optimum result.

  abstract     = {To provide effective resolutions for complex real-life problems and other optimization problems, abundant, various procedures have been presented in the last few decades. This paper proposes a simple but efficient hybrid evolutionary algorithm called GOA-DE for solving visual tracking problems. In the proposed hybrid algorithm, Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) operates in refining the vector. In contrast, the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is used for transforming the decision vectors based on genetic operators. The improvement in maintaining the balance between exploration and exploitation abilities is made by incorporating genetic operators, namely, mutation and crossover in GOA. The success of GOA-DE is estimated by 23 classical benchmark functions, CEC05 functions, and CEC 2014 functions. The GOA-DE algorithm results prove that it is very viable associated with the metaheuristic up-to-date procedures. Similarly, visual tracking problems are resolved by the GOA-DE algorithm as a real challenging case study. Visual tracking several objects robustly in a video stream with complex backgrounds and objects are beneficial in subsequent generation computer vision structures. But, in exercise, it is problematic to plan an effective video-based visual tracking scheme owing to the fast-moving objects, probable occlusions, and diverse light circumstances. Investigational outcomes indicate that the GOA-DE-based tracker can energetically track a random target in many thought-provoking cases.},

The similarity between objects is computed through distance measure. Further, clustering has proven its significance for solving wide range of real-world optimization problems. This work presents water wave optimization (WWO) based metaheuristic algorithm for clustering task. It is seen that WWO algorithm is an effective algorithm for solving constrained and unconstrained optimization problems. But, sometimes WWO cannot obtain promising solution for complex optimization problems due to absence of global best information component and converged on premature solution. To address the absentia of global best information and premature convergence, some improvements are inculcated in WWO algorithm to make it more promising and efficient. These improvements are described in terms of modified search mechanism and decay operator. The absentia of global best information component is handled through updated search mechanism. While, the premature convergence is addressed through a decay operator. The performance of WWO algorithm is evaluated using thirteen benchmark clustering datasets using accuracy and F-score parameters. The simulation results are compared with several state of art existing clustering algorithms and it is observed proposed WWO clustering algorithm achieves a higher accuracy and F-score rates with most of clustering datasets as compared to existing clustering algorithms. It is also showed that the proposed WWO algorithm improves the accuracy and F-score rates an average of 4% and 7% respectively as compared to existing clustering algorithm. Further, statistical test is also conducted to validate the existence of proposed WWO algorithm and statistical results confirm the existence of WWO algorithm in clustering field.},

Various metrics like Fingerprints, DNA and Retina can be used for this purpose. Nonetheless, there is still a need for reliable alternatives in order to establish the identity of an individual on occasions where the above techniques are unavailable. Cheiloscopy is a technique of identifying an individual based on lip prints. It finds applications in medical fields predominantly in the forensic odontology. The patterns formed on the human lips and it’s shape is found to be unique for every individual. Patterns found on the human lips are perpetual unless subjected to major trauma or alterations. Analogous to the existing bio metrics, Lip prints can serve the purpose of confirming an individual’s identity. The main objective of this work is to design a robust computer-aided system that would identify an individual solely based on the lip-prints and work across diverse datasets. Local Binary Patterns are used to extract the texture based features from the segmented upper and lower lip. Shape related features are also extracted as a part of the feature extraction process. Finally, the extracted features are classified using various classifiers like Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Ensemble classifiers and Neural Networks. Performance of each and every classifier is analyzed. The classification results showed that the features extracted from the upper and the lower lip regions can be satisfactorily used to identify a person uniquely.},

The proposed method is joint implementation of Cuttle Fish Algorithm (CFA) and Crow Search Algorithm (CSA); is known CFCS method. Here, the CFA search behavior is modified by the CSA update position. The proposed CFCS system is utilized for optimal scheduling of micro-grid and considerably decreases the calculation load. The main purpose of proposed work is diminish the micro-grid operation cost together with the dispatch-able units operation cost, cost of power transmission as main grid with inconvenience cost recognized with consumers. The cost of power transmission from main phase can be positive or negative based on the flow direction of transmission line linking the microcircuit to main phase. Negative cost that represents an export of power to main grid emerges as economic advantage of micro-grid. Cost of inconvenience implies the penalty of modifiable loads programming outside the time intervals particular by the consumers. Constant penalty factor is utilized for prioritizing loads with respect to operation sensitivity inside the particular time intervals, in which a superior value of the penalty factor implies a least flexible load based on time interval operation settings. The value of the penalty factor is chosen reasonably greater to unit generation cost and market price. In proposed technique, the CFCS is used for establishing the correct program of the MG combinations according to load side power range. The CFCS method, objective function can be defined as system data subject to equality and inequality limitations. At that time, CFCS model is performed at MATLAB/Simulink working platform and performance is estimated to existing techniques.},

However, to explore the search space along with locating and maintaining a large number of global solutions is always a challenging problem. Hence, we propose a new niching strategy named, ‘niching Comprehensive Learning Gravitational Search algorithm’, in which the CLGSA algorithm is used to solve complex problems having multiple solutions. The proposed algorithm first efficiently tries to explore the search space without trapping in local optima’s and secondly it locates all possible global optima’s. This algorithm has an external memory that enhances its capability to find the maximum number of optima’s. The proposed approach is tested on the IEEE CEC-2013 Multimodal Optimization benchmark problems (Li et al. in Evolutionary computation and machine learning group, RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia, Technical Report, 2013). The results of the proposed scheme are compared with five other state-of-the-art methods. In order to show the efficiency of CLGSA algorithm over real-life multimodal optimization problems, it applied to non-linear, and a mixed variable problem this is, the Reactive Power Dispatch problem (RPD). A standard benchmark IEEE-57 bus system is considered to evaluate the efficiency of the CLGSA. The evaluated simulation results show that CLGSA algorithm successfully solve multimodal problems and the RPD problem with significant accuracy.},

A rich literature has been invested in this direction, however, most of the proposed approaches lack fast convergence and simplicity regarding the optimization process, which should directly affect the accuracy of the environment’s map and the estimated pose. It is a line of research that is always active, offering various solutions to this issue. Among many SLAM methods, the normal distributions transform approach (NDT) has shown high performances, where numerous works have been published up to date and many studies demonstrate its efficiency wrt other methods. Nevertheless, few works have been interested to solve the optimization issue. The proposed solution is based on NDT scan-matching using particle swarm optimization (PSO) and it is dubbed NDT-PSO. The main contribution is to solve the pose estimation problem based on PSO and iterative NDT maps. The performances of the NDT-PSO approach have been proven in real experiments performed on a car-like mobile robot in both static and dynamic environments. NDT-PSO is tested for different swarm sizes, and the results show that 70 particles are more than enough to find the best particle while avoiding local minima even in loop closing. The algorithm is also suitable for real time applications, with an average runnnig time of $$145 \rm{ms}$$ for 70 particles and 70 iterations of the optimization process. This value can be further reduced using fewer particles and iterations. The accuracy of the proposed approach is also evaluated wrt other SLAM methods widely used among the robot operating system community and it has been shown that NDT-PSO outperforms these algorithms.},

This algorithm uses a mathematical model based on trigonometric functions to solve optimization problems. Such an approach was developed to solve the drawbacks existing in classic clustering techniques such as the initialization of cluster centers and convergence towards the local optimum. In fact, to obtain an “optimal” cluster center and to improve the image segmentation quality, we propose this technique which begins with the generation of a random population. Then, we determine the number of clusters to exploit. Later, we formulate an objective function to maximize the interclass distance and minimize the intra-class distance. The resolution of this function gives the best overall solution used to update the rest of the population. The performances of the proposed approach are evaluated using a set of reference images and compared to several classic clustering methods, like k-means or fuzzy c-means and other meta-heuristic approaches, such as genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization. The results obtained from the different methods are analyzed based on the best fitness values, PSNR, RMSE, SC, XB, PC, S, SC, CE and the computation time.

  abstract     = {Optimization of structural members such as beams and columns has received increasing interest with advances in computing, manufacturing, and artificial intelligence. Designers pursuing multiobjective optimization are typically interested in minimizing the cost of the member while maximizing some performance metric related to load bearing capability or stress. In this study, thin-walled members listed in AISC tables were optimized in a similar manner using genetic algorithms. The influence of several objectives was considered, and emphasis was placed on providing the customer with a diverse choice of solutions. To demonstrate the approach, wide-flange I-beams and circular pipe cross-sections were examined. Multi-dimensional Pareto-fronts were obtained. Optimized cross-sections were compared to AISC beam tables. Multi-criteria decision-making techniques were used to select a preferred solution from a Pareto-front. For I-beams, improvements of 3–7% over tables were obtained and for pipes, it was 47–76%. Finally, the performance of two commonly used genetic algorithms, NSGA-II and SPEA-II, was compared using Pareto-front metrics. While SPEA-II produced several nondominated solutions, NSGA-II was shown to produce the overall superior front considering metrics presented from the literature.},

  abstract     = {Boolean functions are used as nonlinear filter functions and combiner functions in several stream ciphers. The security of these stream ciphers largely depends upon cryptographic properties of Boolean functions. Finding a balanced Boolean function with optimal cryptographic properties is an open research problem in the cryptographic community. Since the number of n-variable Boolean functions is $$2^{2^n}$$ , it is not computationally feasible to search the entire space of such functions for cryptographically significant functions when $$n \ge 6$$ . In general, the construction of Boolean functions with optimal or near optimal cryptographically significant properties is formulated as combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, we apply the Genetic algorithm with the integration of a local search procedure called hybrid GA (HGA) searching for the Boolean functions with high nonlinearity and low autocorrelation. The performance of the Genetic algorithm depends upon the tuning parameters such as crossover mechanism, mutation probability, selection criteria, and the choice of fitness/cost function. To achieve an optimal trade-off among two cryptographic properties, the choice of the cost function plays an important role for finding an optimal solution. So our main focus is to construct balanced Boolean functions using HGA with a new cost function and compare it with existing cost functions. Our experimental results shows that the HGA is more efficient than GA and the new cost function is more efficient than existing cost functions for reaching the optimal solutions.},

  abstract     = {Detecting code smells and treating them with refactoring are trivial part of maintaining vast and sophisticated software. There is an urgent need for automatic system to treat code smells. Tools provide variable results, based on threshold values and subjective interpretation of smells. Machine learning is one of the best approaches that provides effective solution to this problem. Practitioners do not need expert knowledge on smell’s characteristics for detection, which makes this approach accessible. In this paper, we have implemented 32 machine learning algorithms after performing feature selection through six variations of the filter method. We have used multiple correlation methodologies to discard similar features. Mutual information, fisher score, and univariate ROC–AUC feature selection techniques were used with brute force and random forest correlation strategies. Feature selection eliminates dimensionality curse and improves performance measures drastically. It is the selection of relevant feature subset based on the relation between dependent and independent variables. We have compared performance of classifiers implemented with and without performing feature selection. Results show that accuracy of machine learning models has increased up to 26.5%, f-measure by 70.9%, area under ROC curve has surged up to 26.74%, and average training time has reduced up to 62 s as compared to performance measures of machine learning models executed without feature selection. Mutual information feature selection strategy with random forest correlation methodology has the highest impact on performance measures among all the filter methods. Among 32 classifiers, boosted decision trees (J48) and Naive Bayes algorithms gave best performance after dimensionality reduction.},

Though the advantages of WSNs are plenty, the present challenge is to gain effective control over the depleting battery power and the network lifetime. Recent researches have proved that the energy consumption can be minimized if effective clustering mechanisms are incorporated. This paper proposes HOCK and HECK - novel energy efficient clustering algorithms to increase the network lifetime for homogeneous and heterogeneous environments, respectively. Both these algorithms are built using Krill herd and Cuckoo search. While the optimal cluster centroid positions are computed using the Krill herd algorithm, and the Cuckoo search is applied to select the optimal cluster heads. The performance of the HOCK algorithm is evaluated by varying base station locations and node density. To evaluate the HECK algorithm, two and three level heterogeneity are considered. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol is more effective in improving the network lifetime of WSNs compared to other existing methods such as GAECH, Hybrid HSAPSO, and ESO-LEACH.},

The proposed method extracts Gabor and histograms of oriented gradients features from landmark-based patches. The features are then concatenated, dimensionally reduced using principal component analysis, fused using canonical correlation analysis, and normalized using min-max normalization. Experimental results carried out on the FERET database have shown the outstanding performance of the proposed method compared to that of the state-of-the-art approaches.

Symbiotic organism search (SOS) is one of the latest metaheuristic algorithms introduced to solve DG placement problems. Unlike many other metaheuristic algorithms, SOS is simple to implement and does not use any control parameters which lead to enhancing performance stability. However, like other optimization algorithms SOS suffers with local optimal and stagnations which affects its accuracy and convergence especially in solving real world problems like DG placement problem. This work attempts to enhance performance of SOS by combining with cloud-based model. The proposed algorithm is named cloud based model symbiotic organism search (CMSOS). In CMSOS, Cloud-based theories have been used to generate random number operator in mutualism phase of the original SOS. To assess the performance of CMSOS in solving optimization problems 26 benchmark functions with different dimensions have been used. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been tested for real world DG placement problems.

Maximum applications built on these edge devices generate a massive amount of online data and also require real-time computation and decision making with low latency (e.g., robotics/ drones, self-driving cars, smart IoT, electronics/ wearable devices). To suffice the requirement, the future generation intelligent edge devices need to be capable of computing complex machine learning algorithms on live data in real-time. Considering different layers of IoT and distributed computing concept, this paper suggests three different operational models where the ML algorithm will be executed in a distributed manner between the edge and cloud layer of IoT so that the edge node can take a decision in real-time. The three models are; model 1: training and prediction both will be done locally by the edge, model 2: training at the server and decision making at the edge node, and model 3: distributed training and distributed decision making at the edge level with global shared knowledge and security. All three models have been tested using support vector machine using thirteen diverse datasets to profile their performance in terms of both training and inference time. A comparative study between the computational performance of the edge and cloud nodes is also presented here. Through the simulated experiments using the different datasets, it is observed that, the edge node inference time is approximately ten times faster than cloud time for all tested datasets for each proposed model. At the same time, the model 2 training time is approximately nine times faster than model 1 and eleven times faster than model 3.},

These problems are challenging and well known by the dynamic nature of their objective functions, constraint functions, and problem parameters which often change over time. In fact, dealing with these problems has not been investigated in detail using the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). Thus, we propose in this paper an EDA-based on Vine Copulas algorithm to deal with Dynamic Multiobjective Problems (DMOPs). Vines Copulas are graphical models that represent multivariate dependence using bivariate copulas. The proposed Copula-based Estimation of Distribution Algorithm, labeled Dynamic Vine-Copula Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (DynVC-EDA), is used to implement two search strategies. The first strategy is an algorithm that uses the model as a memory to save the status of the best solutions obtained during the current generation. The second strategy is a prediction-based algorithm that uses the history of the best solutions to predict a new population when a change occurs. The proposed algorithms are tested using a set of benchmarks provided with CEC2015 and the Gee-Tan-Abbass. Statistical findings show that the DynVC-EDA is competitive to the state-of-the-art methods in dealing with dynamic multiobjective optimization.},

  abstract     = {Decision tree is one of the best expressive classifiers in data mining. A decision tree is popular due to its simplicity and straightforward visualization capability for all types of datasets. Decision tree forest is an ensemble of decision trees. The prediction accuracy of the decision tree forest is more than a decision tree algorithm. Constant efforts are going on to create accurate and diverse trees in the decision tree forest. In this paper, we propose Tangent Weighted Decision Tree Forest (TWDForest), which is more accurate and diverse than random forest. The strength of this technique is that it uses a more accurate and uniform tangent weighting function to create a weighted decision tree forest. It also improves performance by taking opinions from previous trees to best fit the successor tree and avoids the toggling of the root node. Due to this novel approach, the decision trees from the forest are more accurate and diverse as compared to other decision forest algorithms. Experiments of this novel method are performed on 15 well known, publicly available UCI machine learning repository datasets of various sizes. The results of the TWDForest method demonstrate that the entire forest and decision trees produced in TWDForest have high prediction accuracy of 1–7% more than existing methods. TWDForest also creates more diverse trees than other forest algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Android has gained its popularity due to its open-source and number of freely available apps in its official play store. Appropriate functioning of Android apps depends upon the permission or set of permissions which an app demands at the time of installation and run-time. By taking the advantage of these permissions or set of permissions, cybercriminals are developing malware-infected apps daily. In this study, we proposed a framework named as “SOMDROID”, that work on the principle of unsupervised machine learning algorithm. To develop an effective and efficient Android malware detection model, we collect 5,00,000 distinct Android apps from promised repositories and extract 1844 unique features. Further, to select significant features or feature sets, we applied six different feature ranking approaches in this study. With the selected feature or feature sets, we implement the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm of Kohonen and measure four distinct performance parameters, i.e., Intra-cluster distance, Inter-cluster distance, Accuracy and F-measure. Empirical result reveals that our proposed framework is able to detect 98.7% malware that belongs to unknown families and in addition to that the detection rate is higher by 2% when compared to commercial anti-virus scanners and frameworks proposed in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Kidney exchange is among the effective methods that may permanently supply an important platform for incompatible donor-candidate pairs to exchange organs to achieve mutual benefit and guarantee treatment to people with kidney failure. However, building a dynamic model for Kidney Paired Exchange has become an increasingly urgent issue for augmenting the number of available kidneys in the field of organ transplantation. There has not been made a lot of research on the kidney exchange problem in a dynamic situation. Mathematically, maximizing the possible kidney exchanges for a given pool can be considered as an optimization problem and has attracted the attention of the community of researchers in the past few years. Thus, optimization approaches, like natural-inspired algorithms, can help Kidney paired exchange in defining which transplants should be made among all incompatible pairs according to some objectives. In this paper, a new natural stochastic-based algorithm called a Multiverse Optimizer is introduced to develop advanced dynamic approaches for kidney paired exchange. The objective of the proposed approach is to maximize the number of feasible cycles and chains among the pool pairs over time. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by providing the best performance compared to the results of genetic and antlion algorithms which are the only stochastic-based optimization algorithms applied to the kidney exchange. Furthermore, we applied more stochastic-based optimization algorithms for Kidney paired exchange to confirm the overall performance superiority of our proposed method. The performance of the proposed method in a dynamic situation demonstrates the competitiveness of the proposed method.},

Calculating the optimal joint angles from the operational space (i.e. inverse kinematics) and designing the optimal joint controller parameters are two important research topics. This paper proposes a 3-stage Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based methodology for solving the inverse kinematics and optimizing the controller parameters. In the first stage, a PSO algorithm solves the inverse kinematics problem by minimizing a multi-objective cost function in the operational space (i.e. the error in the end-effector’s pose) and therefore finds the optimal joint angles. In the second stage, polynomial functions generate the desired trajectory between the initial and final poses in the joint space. Finally, a second PSO algorithm tunes six proportional-derivative (PD) controllers, one for each joint, to track the desired trajectory by minimizing another multi-objective cost function in the joint space. Two case studies, based on six DoF Puma 560, validate the performance of the proposed methodology. Simulation results show that the proposed 3-stage methodology provides fast and accurate results as the PSO algorithms are effective in solving the inverse kinematics problem and tuning the optimal PD parameters.},

In this paper, a chaotic dragonfly algorithm (CDA) for WSCD is proposed to minimize the test time of embedded cores by balancing the packaged scan chains (WSCs).Since the WSCD problem is non-continuous, we improve the dragonfly algorithm (DA) with integer coding to make it suitable for the WSCD problem. In order to improve population diversity and prevent falling into local optimum state, we introduce chaotic strategy into DA. Furthermore, a repaired operator that considers the specific knowledge is added to the DA. Since the CDA is a swarm intelligence method, it is expected to effectively solve the NP-hard problem. The experimental results on ITC’02 SoC benchmark show that the proposed algorithm can improve the balanced results and shorten the test time compared with the existing algorithms.},

Hence, we try to offer the possibility of theoretical and empirical evaluation of metaheuristic techniques in TsC problem. In fact, we follow two main goals by performing this theoretical and empirical evaluation. These goals include: at the first, we would like to prove the effective role of metaheuristic techniques to enhance the efficiency of TsC algorithms, eliminate some challenges of such algorithms (e.g., sensitivity to initialization of some primary parameters), and indicates the popularity of their use in TsC problems during the last years because of their characteristics. Second, we would like to offer the possibility of a comparison between some metaheuristic techniques to analyze the percentage of their effectiveness for enhancing the accuracy of clustering results in TsC problems. The comparative analysis of results of the empirical evaluation for ten standard time series data sets collected from the UCR time series data sets repository show three keys conclusions: (1) generally, metaheuristic techniques have provided reasonable results and significant improvement in terms of efficiency in TsC problem in all experiments due to the main characteristic of metaheuristics that is finding an approximate solution more quickly. But, it is concluded that fuzzy metaheuristic techniques based on population solution class (e.g., FATPSO and FPSO) to provide better results versus single solution class in TsC algorithms. (2) It is deducted that consuming maximum computational time presented by fuzzy metaheuristic techniques in comparison to other optimization techniques in the performed experiments. (3) The paper has proposed that a hybrid of fuzzy metaheuristics (e.g., FATPSO) and the base TsC algorithms can be considered as a more adequate choice to present better results in terms of accuracy in different application areas.},

Naturally, metaheuristic is a suitable approach to solve the problem with large sizes in short computation time. Previously, several metaheuristics have been proposed for solving the problem. These algorithms might have a strong search intensification, and their diversification mechanisms may not be sufficient. Due to the random nature, population-based algorithms improve on the chance of finding a globally. In this paper, we propose a population-based algorithm that combines an ant colony algorithm (ACO), genetic algorithm (GA), and neighborhood descent with random neighborhood ordering (RVND). In the algorithm, the ACO and GA are used to explore the promising solution areas that are yet to refined while the RVND exploits them with the hope of improving a solution. Therefore, our metaheuristic algorithm balances between exploration and exploitation. Extensive numerical experiments and comparisons with the state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms in the literature show that the proposed algorithm reaches better solutions in many cases.},

In this paper, the resource allocation problem is considered as a bi-objective optimization problem, including minimizing response time and the utilization imbalance between resources. To optimize both the objectives simultaneously, the contributions of this paper are manifolds. First, the problem is modeled as an optimization problem by considering both the objectives in an integrated manner. Second, the resource allocation problem is formulated as a non-cooperative game. Finally, to derive the game’s solution in a distributed manner, a Best Response dynamics based Modified Grey Wolf Optimizer BR-MGWO is proposed. Further, to assess the efficacy of BR-MGWO, it is compared with two other approaches, i.e., GOS and NCOP on problem instances of various settings.

  abstract     = {Economic dispatch (ED) is one of the vital prospects in the energy management system for determining the optimal power generation distribution among several committed power generating units. The objective of ED is to generate the electric power to meet the load demand by minimizing the total operating cost subjected to various equality and inequality constraints. This ED problem is generally solved using conventional techniques such as a gradient method by assuming the objective function as linear and convex. However, in general, the ED problem is constrained, non-convex, large scale, multimodal and highly nonlinear optimization problem. In order to overcome this drawback, various heuristic techniques have been introduced in the literature. Symbiotic organism search (SOS) is one of the emerging nature-inspired meta-heuristic algorithms. Due to simple in implementation and free from algorithm-specific control parameters, the SOS algorithm has gained a reputation among the researchers. The SOS technique mimics the biological interaction between two distinct species to survive and proliferate in the ecosystem. To evade the suboptimal solution and to enhance the exploration and exploitation of the SOS algorithm, the disruption operator is integrated with the basic SOS to form a novel disruption based SOS (DSOS) algorithm. The disruption strategy is originated from astrophysics and has the ability to shift between exploration and exploitation during the process of finding an optimum solution. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, it is applied on various test systems such as 3-unit, 5-unit, 6-unit, 13-unit, 20-unit, 38-unit, and 110-unit systems to solve different ED problems, namely, without transmission losses (TL), with transmission losses, by simultaneously considering valve point loading (VPL) effect along with TL, by simultaneously considering the effect of ramp rate limits (RRLs), prohibited operating zones (POZs) and TLs, and dynamic economic load dispatch by considering RRLs, POZs, VPL, and TL. The comparison of DSOS based simulation results with other methods reveal the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method to provide minimum total generation cost in all the cases with better convergence rate and less computational time.},

The proposed model comprises three phases, such as (a) Data Acquisition, (b) Feature Extraction, and (c) Prediction. Initially, benchmark data available from local meteorological organizations are collected that includes the numerical weather forecasting data like temperature, dew point, humidity, visibility, wind speed, and other descriptive information. Once the data is collected, feature extraction is done by first-order and second-order statistical models. First Order Statistics, like mean, median, standard deviation, the maximum value of entire data, and minimum value of entire data, and Second-Order Statistics, like Kurtosis, skewness, correlation, and entropy are extracted as the features. These features are further applied to three machine learning algorithms named Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). As main novelty of this paper, the number of hidden neurons of all these networks is optimized by a hybrid algorithm merging both the Deer Hunting Optimization Algorithm (DHOA) and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), which is named as Grey Updated DHOA (GU-DHOA). The improvement of these networks with the assistance of a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm will be highly effective for solar irradiance prediction, overcoming the existing machine learning algorithms.},

All the experiments are performed in a scenario in which no-free-lunch theorems for machine learning (NFLM) do not apply on all the compared machines. The hypothesis is that in such a scenario some classifier can perform better than others. The experiments are performed on the real world UCI datasets and the SNHSVM is compared with the state of art support vector based classifiers with performance measure as accuracy. SNHSVM achieves the highest accuracy in 100% of the cases and the Friedman test confirms the better performance of SNHSVM on all of the datasets used.

  abstract     = {The Clustered Shortest-Path Tree Problem (CluSPT) has a great meaning in theoretical research as well as a wide range of applications in everyday life, especially in the field of network optimization. Being able to solve the CluSPT will path the way for improving practical systems such as agricultural irrigation and product distribution. Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm (MFEA) is a variant of Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) aiming at simultaneously solving multiple factorial tasks which can be diverse in types, dimensionalities and search spaces. The applications of MFEA have yet to be fully exploited, but the realm has recently attracted much interest from the research community, especially those who are working on evolutionary multitasking. Considering these characteristics, this paper describes a new approach using the MFEA for solving the CluSPT. The MFEA has two tasks: the first is solving the CluSPT problem and the second is solving a new problem which is decomposed from the CluSPT problem. The goal of the first task is finding the fittest solution as possible for the CluSPT while the goal of the second task is determining the best tree (w.r.t. cost minimization) which envelops all vertices of the problem. This paper also introduces mutation, crossover and population initialization operators for a proposed MFEA to solve the CluSPT. Each of these operators deals with individuals in two phases, one of which ensures that the resulted individual is a spanning tree and the other phase ensures that each of its clustered sub-graphs is also a spanning tree. As the MFEA had to deal with these two tasks, a decoding method was also created to allow communication between the tasks. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and methods, the authors implemented them on both Euclidean and Non-Euclidean instances. Experiment results show that the proposed MFEA outperformed the existing MFEA algorithms on two-thirds instances with average improvement value of 47%. Besides, this paper analysis the convergence trends of each task in generations and the affectation of the number of vertices in the largest cluster on the obtained results by using both the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and scatter graphs.},

  abstract     = {The focus of power producers has shifted from conventional energy sources to sustainable energy sources because of the depletion of fossil fuels and carbon emission causing global warming and climate change. Solar cells are the most prominent option to deal with these problems. The precise estimation of solar cell parameters is very much required before their installation to achieve high efficiency. In recent years applications of several optimization algorithms for parameter estimation of the solar cell have been addressed. Recently, intelligent grey wolf optimizer (IGWO), which is an advanced version of grey wolf optimizer (GWO) incorporating a sinusoidal truncated function as a bridging mechanism and opposition based learning has been introduced. The wide applicability of this variant has been examined over different conventional benchmark functions and on some real problems. This fact motivated authors to employ this variant on parameter extraction process. The main motivation behind the implementation of IGWO on solar cell parameter estimation process is the efficiency of this version to deal with complex optimization problems. To estimate the PV cell parameter values, measurement of voltage and current are considered at three important points. These are open circuit point, short circuit point and maximum power point, for two solar cell representative models i.e. single diode model and double diode model. Results of IGWO are compared with the results of other variants of GWO on these two models and for three films (Mono crystalline, poly crystalline and thin film). Results reveal that IGWO produces better results.},

  abstract     = {Differential equations can often be seen in many fields of scientific research and engineering. Typically, finding the analytical (exact) solution is expensive task in terms of computational effort and may not an attainable task for some complex tasks. To effectively handle a wide variety of linear and nonlinear differential equations, this paper presents an approximate methodology based on hybrid Harris hawks–Nelder–Mead optimization algorithm with the aim to achieve accurate and reliable solution. The proposed methodology is introduced on basis of Fourier series expansion and Harris hawks–Nelder–Mead optimization algorithm. In this sense, the differential equation is represented as an optimization model by the means of the weighted residual function (cost function) that needed to be minimized, where the boundary and initial conditions of the differential equation are considered as the constraints of the optimization model. The practicality and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated through six differential equations with different nature as well as four mechanical engineering differential equations. The comparison against different algorithms, by using the generational distance metric and Wilcoxon sign rank test, showed the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {One of the most economical forms of automated guided vehicles (AGV) is a vision-based line follower. A line follower uses machine vision to extract the path shape from the captured image and follows it. Among many methods for path detection, some studies suggested using the real-time application of meta-heuristic population-based algorithms for visual line follower AGV. Generally, Swarm Intelligence and Evolutionary Algorithms are not well suited for real-time applications as they need generations to evolve. For this reason, a comprehensive study is presented to find the best solutions to this particular application. Artificial Bee Colony, Genetic Algorithm, Harmony Search, Imperialist Competitive Algorithm, and Particle Swarm Optimization were studied with three proposed objective functions that could assist path shape detection. The fastest and most reliable solution is optimized and tested on a real AGV platform. The AGV designed for this research has an independent onboard Raspberry Pi 3 with an ARM processor and it is capable of traversing the track fast and reliably. Furthermore, the proposed system does not require edge detection or down-sampling on captured images. Additionally, our newly developed direction inferring technique, the Triangle Closest Midpoint, enables the AGV to find its path even with faulty or incomplete input. As a result, a novel real-time meta-heuristic line follower AGV is presented in this research.},

  abstract     = {Acute leukemia is the most frequently occurring malignancy present in human blood and a kind of liquid cancer. This hematological disorder can impinge on bone marrow and lymphatic system. Accordingly, a computer-aided classification system is proposed for French–American–British classification of Acute Leukemia using an ensemble of neural networks which is validated on 180 microscopic blood images taken from online benchmark dataset. As per the requirement of pathologists in real-life examination scenario various objectives are formulated as (i) correct nucleus segmentation in blood cell image, (ii) correct classification of FAB classes of acute leukemia (L1, L2, L3, M2, M3, and M5). To accomplish these research objectives the proposed method consist of segmentation section, feature extraction section, feature pruning section and classification section. The classification of the proposed method consists of two subsections as subsection1 is comprised of single six class PCA based neural network as PCA-NN0 (L1/L2/L3/M2/M3/M5) and subsection 2 contains an ensemble of 15 binary PCA based neural network classifiers as PCA-NN1 (L1/L2), PCA-NN2(L1/L3), PCA-NN3(L1/M2), PCA-NN4(L1/M3), PCA-NN5(L1/M5), PCA-NN6(L2/L3), PCA-NN7(L2/M2), PCA-NN8(L2/M3), PCA-NN9(L2/M5), PCA-NN10(L3/M2), PCA-NN11(L3/M3), PCA-NN12(L3/M5), PCA-NN13(M2/M3), PCA-NN14(M2/M5), PCA-NN15(M3/M5). The achieved accuracy for experiment 1 is 86.4% using PCA-NN0. The output of two most plausible classes predicted by PCA-NN0 is passed to other binary PCA based neural network i.e. PCA-NN1 to PCA-NN15. After passing all the test images to subsection 2, the achieved accuracy is 94.2% from the exhaustive experiment 2. The outcome of the work verifies the capabilities of computer-aided classification system to substitute the conventional diagnostic systems.},

  abstract     = {In evolutionary robotics, robot controllers are often evolved in simulation, as using the physical robot for fitness evaluation can take a prohibitively long time. Simulators provide a quick way to evaluate controller fitness. A simulator is tasked with providing appropriate sensor information to the controller. If the robot has an on-board camera, an entire virtual visual environment is needed to simulate the camera’s signal. In the past, these visual environments have been constructed by hand, requiring the use of hand-crafted models, textures and lighting, which is a tedious and time-consuming process. This paper proposes a deep neural network-based architecture for simulating visual environments. The neural networks are trained exclusively from images captured from the robot, creating a 3-dimensional visual environment without using hand-crafted models, textures or lighting. It does not rely on any external domain specific datasets, as all training data is captured in the physical environment. Robot controllers were evolved in simulation to discern between objects with different colours and shapes, and they successfully completed the same task in the real world.},

Recently, various population-based algorithms have been developed for solving optimization problems. In this paper, a random scale factor approach is proposed to modify the simple TLBO algorithm. Modified Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization with Opposite-Based-Learning algorithm is applied to solve the Permutation Flow-Shop-Scheduling Problem with the purpose of minimizing the makespan. The OBL approach is used to enhance the quality of the initial population and convergence speed. PFSSP is used extensively for solving scheduling problem, which belongs to the category of NP-hard optimization problems. First, MTLBO is developed to effectively determine the PFSSP using the Largest Order Value rule-based random key, so that individual job schedules are converted into discrete schedules. Second, new initial populations are generated in MTLBO using the Nawaz–Enscore–Ham heuristic mechanism. Finally, the local exploitation ability is enhanced in the MTLBO using effective swap, insert and inverse structures. The performance of proposed algorithm is validated using ten benchmark functions and the Wilcoxon rank test. The computational results and comparisons indicate that the proposed algorithm outperformed over five well-known datasets such as Carlier, Reeves, Heller, Taillards and VRF benchmark test functions, compared to other metaheuristic algorithms. The p-value indicated the significance and superiority of the proposed algorithm over other metaheuristic algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The salp swarm algorithm (SSA) has shown its fast search speed in several challenging problems. Research shows that not every nature-inspired approach is suitable for all applications and functions. Additionally, it does not provide the best exploration and exploitation for each function during the search process. Therefore, there were several researches attempts to improve the exploration and exploitation of the meta-heuristics by developing the newly hybrid approaches. This inspired our current research and therefore, we developed a newly hybrid approach called hybrid salp swarm algorithm with particle swarm optimization for searching the superior quality of optimal solutions of the standard and engineering functions. The hybrid variant integrates the advantages of SSA and PSO to eliminate many disadvantages such as the trapping in local optima and the unbalanced exploitation. We have used the velocity phase of the PSO approach in salp swarm approach in order to avoid the premature convergence of the optimal solutions in the search space, escape from ignoring in local minima and improve the exploitation tendencies. The new approach has been verified on different dimensions of the given functions. Additionally, the proposed technique has been compared with a wide range of algorithms in order to confirm its efficiency in solving standard CEC 2005, CEC 2017 test suits and engineering problems. The simulation results show that the proposed hybrid approach provides competitive, often superior results as compared to other existing algorithms in the research community.},
