  abstract     = {As an important research direction, operational research (OR) has always attracted scholars worldwide. We study the structure, trend and prospect in the OR field by conducting a bibliometric analysis of publications in the period of 1952–2020, which are included in the Web of Science (WoS) database. Using three effective bibliometric tools, namely, VOS viewer, CiteSpace, and Bibliometrix, a total of 5,353 publications were retrieved to show clear visual results using a series of scientific analyses. First, a performance analysis revealed the basic characteristics of publications considering the type distribution, annual trend, quantity and quality. Then, a cooperation analysis presented the influential countries/regions and showed the relationships among countries/regions, institutions and authors during different periods based on bibliometric indicators and co-authorship networks. Moreover, a keyword analysis was conducted to investigate the hot topics and development of the OR field, using co-occurrence analysis, timeline view analysis and evolution analysis. Finally, we discussed the implications and limitations, and summarized the main findings. This study hopes to provide important and valuable references for future research on the OR field.},

  abstract     = {For several classes of decisions, the use of target-based decision analysis (TBDA) is more appropriate than utility analysis. Recent literature on TBDA mainly focuses on different expression forms of targets and performance levels, and on different types of aggregation operators in terms of multi-attribute preference functions. However, different expression forms are usually introduced separately in literature, which cannot fully support the inherent complexity of problems along with different perception and knowledge levels of decision makers during assessing targets and performance levels. Furthermore, although there are attractive features of multilinear target-based preference functions (MTPFs), its applications are seldom considered because of the complexity of identifying their coefficients. In order to solve these two issues, an integrated approach is proposed for multilinear hybrid-information target-based decision analysis, which can deal with diverse forms of targets and performance levels, and identify the coefficients of MTPFs. First, given targets and performance levels for each attribute being expressed in multiple forms simultaneously, a generalized procedure is proposed to transform different forms into probability distributions, and to measure probability of target achievement for each attribute. Second, a novel procedure to identify the coefficients of MTPFs is proposed. This procedure is based on the multilinear model and 2-additive fuzzy measures, which is based on the equivalence between multilinear model based on fuzzy measures and MTPFs. The approach is applied to a case study involving customer competitive evaluation of smart thermometer patches to demonstrate its feasibility and advantages.},

We work only with tree networks and we assume that a minimum cost spanning tree network has already been constructed and now we are interested in the maintenance costs. The classic problem supposes that each agent stays for the entire time in the same node of the network. This paper introduces cost-allocation problems in a fixed-tree network with a set of agents whose activity over the nodes is fuzzy. Agent’s needs to pay for each period of time may differ. Moreover, the agents do not always remain in the same node for each period. We propose the extension of a very well-known solution for these problems: Bird’s rule.},

  abstract     = {Destruction of the roads and disruption in transportation networks are the aftermath of natural disasters, particularly if they are of great magnitude. As a version of the network capacity reliability problem, this work researches a post-disaster transportation network, where the reliability and operational capacity of links are uncertain. Uncertainty theory is utilized to develop a model of and solve the uncertain maximum capacity path (UMCP) problem to ensure that the maximum amount of relief materials and rescue vehicles arrive at areas impacted by the disaster. We originally present two new problems of $$\alpha$$ -maximum capacity path ( $$\alpha$$ -MCP), which aims to determine paths of highest capacity under a given confidence level $$ \alpha$$ , and most maximum capacity path (MMCP), where the objective is to maximize the confidence level under a given threshold of capacity value. We utilize these auxiliary programming models to explicate the method to, in an uncertain network, achieve the uncertainty distribution of the MCP value. A novel approach is additionally suggested to confront, in the framework of uncertainty programming, the stability analysis problem. We explicitly enunciate the method of computing the links’ tolerances in $${\mathcal{O}}\left( m \right)$$ time or $${\mathcal{O}}\left( {\left| {P^{*} } \right|m} \right)$$ time (where $$m$$ indicates the number of links in the network and $$\left| {{\text{P}}^{*} } \right|$$ the number of links on the given MCP $${\text{P}}^{*}$$ ). After all, the practical performance of the method and optimization model is illustrated by adopting two network samples from a real case study to show how our approach works in realistic contexts.},

  abstract     = {As a flexible and powerful method to resolve strategy conflicts, the graph model for conflict resolution has drawn much attention. In the graph model for conflict resolution, decision-makers need to provide their preference information for all possible scenarios. Most existing studies assumed that decision-makers adopt quantitative representation formats. However, in some real-life situations, decision-makers may tend to use qualitative assessments due to their cognitive expression habits. In addition, stakeholders involved in a graph model can be a group that is composed of a large number of participants. How to manage these participants’ inconsistent preference assessments is also a debatable issue. To fit these gaps, in this study, we propose a graph model for conflict resolution with linguistic preferences, and this model allows participants to use inconsistent assessments. To do this, we first construct a linguistic preference structure, with the necessary concepts being defined. Then, four stability definitions for both a two-decision-maker scenario and an n-decision-maker scenario are introduced. To illustrate the usefulness of the proposed model, an illustrative example regarding the Huawei conflict is provided.},

To study the stability of data transmission and network congestion, a min-max programming problem subject to addition-min FRI is proposed. From a cost-saving perspective, the optimal solution to the min-max programming problem may not be the minimal optimal solution. Furthermore, while the “optimal” solution provides better cost performance, the “minimal” solution provides for the least congestion of the file-sharing system. In this paper, we propose adopting a binding variable approach based on certain new theoretical properties to find a minimal optimal solution for the min-max programming problem. It is for these new properties that the minimal optimal solution obtained via the binding variable approach would minimize the maximum transmission level; further, the amounts of data download in the optimal solution would be as balanced as possible.

In traditional seepage equation, the strength of mass source is supposed to be deterministic. However, the mass source in practice is often affected by noise such as transformation of underground environment and geological activities. To depict the noise, some scholars attempted to employ a technique called Winner process. Unfortunately, it is unreasonable to model the noise in seepage equation with Winner process, since change rate of pressure will be infinite. As a alternative tool in uncertainty theory, Liu process is introduced to model the noise, which can refrain from the problem of infinity. Then this paper deduces the uncertain seepage equation in fissured porous media driven by Liu process. Furthermore, the analytic solution and its inverse uncertainty distribution are derived.

The main aim of this study is to propose a PHFE unification process which does not have the shortcomings of existing processes, and does not change the inherent characteristic of PHFE probabilities. Based on the proposed unification process, the current study seeks to extend the theory of arithmetic operations on PHFEs by proposing and developing novel types of PHFS division and subtraction.

For the ever-changing real asset market, this assumption may not always be satisfactory. Thus, it is sometimes more realistic to take the return rates as uncertain variables. However, for the existing works on multi-period uncertain portfolio selection problems, they do not find analytic optimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a method for deriving an analytic optimal solution to a multi-period uncertain portfolio selection problem. First, a new uncertain risk measure is defined to model the investment risk. Then, we formulate a bi-criteria optimization model, where the investment return is maximized, while the investment risk is minimized. On this basis, an equivalent transformation is presented to convert the uncertain bi-criteria optimization problem into an equivalent bi-criteria optimization problem. Then, by applying dynamic programming method, an analytic optimal solution is obtained. Finally, a numerical simulation is carried out to show that the proposed model is realistic and the method being developed is applicable and effective.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study a new type of fuzzy relation system called fuzzy relational inequalities with addition-min-product composition operations to model a peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing system. Some properties of this addition-min-product system are investigated. We then characterize the structure of the solution set. Furthermore, to reduce the network congestion and improve the stability of data transmission, a min–max programming problem with constraints of addition-min-product fuzzy relation inequalities is established and investigated. We divide this min–max programming problem into several subproblems with the constraint of a single equation. Based on the optimal solutions to these subproblems, we can solve the original fuzzy relation min–max programming problem. Two algorithms, with polynomial computational complexity, are developed to search for an optimal solution to our studied problem. The validity of the algorithms is examined through a numerical example.},

  abstract     = {In the decision-making process, retaining the original data information has become a most crucial step. Dual hesitant fuzzy sets (DHFS), which can reflect the original membership degree and non-membership degree information given by the DMs, is a kind of new tool for the DMs to provide the original information as much as possible. In this paper, we focus on the decision- making problem by a projection model (Algorithm I) whose attribute values are given in the forms of dual hesitant fuzzy elements (DHFEs). In order to reflect the information of the data more accurately, we first divide the dual hesitant fuzzy decision matrix into membership degree matrix and non-membership degree matrix. Then we gain the virtual positive ideal solution from the membership degree matrix and the negative positive ideal solution from the non-membership degree matrix. And then the projection values from every solution to the virtual positive ideal solution and the negative positive ideal solution are calculated. In combination with the two projection values, the relative consistent degree is further calculated to rank all the alternatives. At the same time, in order to guarantee the rationality of the decision-making result, a variation coefficient method is developed to determine the weights of the attributes under dual hesitant fuzzy environment objectively. Finally, the existing algorithms (Algorithm II and Algorithm III, Algorithm IV, Algorithm V) are compared with our algorithm (Algorithm I). The comparison result shows that Algorithm I is a valuable tool for decision making.},

A T2FN has two components: a primary membership and a secondary membership. Compared with T1FSs and interval type-2 fuzzy sets, T2FNs consider an additional dimension by introducing the secondary membership. The primary membership indicates the truth degree of judgment, and the secondary membership further indicates the reliability degree of the truth. We define simple operation rules on T2FNs such that they can be easily used to deal with decision-making problems, such as multi-criteria decision making and multi-stages decision making. Compared with existing related approaches, we verify our approach with several numerical examples.},

In the TPL provider selection process, uncertain information brings more challenges to decision makers. This paper uses probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) to describe uncertain decision making information. Firstly, we propose an improved Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory method, which allows a certain relationship between decision criteria and calculates criteria weights in multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problems. Then, in order to make full use of uncertain TPL provider information and maximize the values of data, the probabilistic linguistic complex proportional assessment method is proposed and applied to solve the MCDM problems under probabilistic linguistic environment, which needs much less computation than other MCDM methods. Finally, an application example of TPL provider selection is presented to demonstrate the proposed method. A comparative analysis is further conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

This paper studies group decision making (GDM) with normalized probability linguistic preference relations (NPLPRs). To achieve this goal, an acceptably multiplicative consistency based interactive algorithm is provided to derive common probability linguistic preference relations (CPLPRs) from PLPRs, by which a new acceptably multiplicative consistency concept for NPLPRs is defined. When the multiplicative consistency of NPLPRs is unacceptable, models for deriving acceptably multiplicatively consistent NPLPRs are constructed. Then, it studies incomplete NPLPRs (InNPLPRs) and offers a common probability and acceptably multiplicative consistency based interactive algorithm to determine missing judgments. Furthermore, a correlation coefficient between CPLPRs is provided, by which the weights of the DMs are ascertained. Meanwhile, a consensus index based on CPLPRs is defined. When the consensus does not reach the requirement, a model to increase the level of consensus is built that can ensure the adjusted LPRs to meet the multiplicative consistency and consensus requirement. Moreover, an interactive algorithm for GDM with NPLPRs is provided, which can address unacceptably multiplicatively consistent InNPLPRs. Finally, an example about the evaluation of green design schemes for new energy vehicles is provided to indicate the application of the new algorithm and comparative analysis is conducted.},

  abstract     = {When a decision-maker prefers to compare different alternatives in pairs to handle real situations, there are many different expression styles that can be used. Two representative expression styles are the probabilistic linguistic preference relation (PLPR), which originates from the fuzzy linguistic approach and the distributed preference relation (DPR), which originates from the evidential reasoning approach. Although these two expression styles look quite similar, their meanings, operations, and relevant decision making processes are significantly different. This presents the decision-maker with the challenge of selecting either PLPRs or DPRs in different real cases. To address this issue, this paper provides a detailed analysis of the similarities and differences between PLPRs and DPRs. The analysis is conducted from five perspectives, including modeling of decision making problems, handling of uncertainty, consistency between preference relations, information aggregation, and elicitation process. An engineer selection problem for an automobile manufacturing enterprise is investigated to demonstrate how to appropriately select PLPRs or DPRs to model and analyze decision making problems in real situations with consideration for the preferences of decision-makers.},

In this paper, we propose linguistic lattice-valued preference relation (LLVPR). LLVPR positive and negative matrixes are introduced to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of alternatives respectively. In order to get a reasonable result, we introduce a new algorithm to check and repair the consistency of a LLVPR. A linguistic lattice-valued 2-tuple representation model (LLV2-tuple) and some new aggregation operations are presented to get the comprehensive linguistic information without information loss. Considering different decision makers have different preferences, a multiple preferences implication operation of LLV2-tuple is introduced. Finally, we propose a novel linguistic analytic hierarchy process embedded in aggregation layer and implication layer, introducing algorithm and numerical examples.

To this end, we propose a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method incorporating personalized heuristic judgments in the prospect theory (PT). We focus on the role of personalized heuristic judgments on review helpfulness in the final decision outcomes. We demonstrate the consistency between the three common heuristic judgments (with respect to review valence, sentiment extremity, and aspiration levels) and the three behavioral principles of the PT. Then, the products are ranked with the probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS) input, based on the proposed adjustable PT framework, in which the coefficients of negativity bias are derived from the consumer’s heuristic judgments.
