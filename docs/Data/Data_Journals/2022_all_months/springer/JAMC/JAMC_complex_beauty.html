  abstract     = {We employ an age-structured susceptible-infected-quarantined-recovered model to simulate the progression of COVID-19 in France, Spain, and Germany. In the absence of a vaccine or conventional treatment, non-pharmaceutical interventions become more valuable, so our model takes into account the efficacy of official social distancing and lockdown measures. Using data from February to July 2020, we make useful predictions for the upcoming months, and further simulate the effect of lifting the lockdown at a later stage. A control model is also proposed and conditions for optimality are also obtained using optimal control theory. Motivated by the recent surge in cases in France and Spain, we also examine the possibility of a second wave of the pandemic. We conclude that further measures need to be taken in these two countries, while Germany is on its way to mitigating the disease.},

The backward Euler method is employed for the first order time derivative and the L1 formula is applied to the discretization of the Caputo time fractional derivative. For the spatial approximation, the DE Sinc-Galerkin method is employed. Using $$2N+1$$ Sinc points, the convergence rate of the DE Sinc-Galerkin scheme is $$O(\exp (-CN/\log (N))$$ . Three numerical experiments are implemented to show the feasibility and high efficiency of the proposed scheme. Besides, the numerical results demonstrate that the Sinc-Galerkin scheme can achieve expected convergence order for the problems with singular points.},

Sugammadex is a relaxant binding agent that can be sought after the management of the aminosterioid non-depolarizing neuromuscular-blocking factors. The role of topological indices in drug development research is updated. A series of definitions in the fields of topological indices and drug discovery technologies are introduced.

If left untreated, it can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). The Treatment involves antiretroviral therapy which maintains the immunity to a specific level and thus helps in suppressing the virus replication. This paper emphasizes on the development of the model involving healthy and infected population, virus population, antibodies and CTL cells. The investigation encapsulates the local stability based on thresholds followed by the local bifurcation analysis based on $$\beta _1$$ and $$R_0$$ . The global stability analysis is done the using Graph- theoretic approach. Further the optimal control problem is discussed using Linear feedback control method which aims to reduce the viral load by keeping antibodies to a certain level. Numerical discussion includes surface plots of the thresholds based on various parameters, graphs showing the comparison between without control and with control especially for the virus population, infected population and antibodies which are our target. Finally, we have also shown the curve-fitting for our data using optimized Nedlar-Mean algorithm.},

Furthermore, the uniform persistence of positive solutions is studied while there is not the direct transmission of disease by the infected individuals. Finally, the numerical examples are presented to verify the main results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a delay SIR model with a nonlinear incidence function and saturated treatment function is proposed and analyzed. The non-monotonous incidence function accounts for the behavior response of susceptible individuals towards the infective density in the population due to the impact of information about the disease. We obtain a threshold for disease persistence in the population. The system shows the possibility of multiple endemic equilibria. We analytically study the stability of endemic equilibrium, when it is unique. This stability of the unique endemic equilibrium depends on the delay parameter and is found to be locally asymptotically stable conditionally along with the existence of Hopf bifurcation. The direction and stability of Hopf-bifurcation are established analytically. Further, numerical results are provided in support of analytical findings. Numerically, we observe stability switch of unique endemic equilibrium and existence of endemic bubble due to change in delay parameter. We further exhibited the impact of delay when multiple equilibria are present in the system. In this case, we observe that bi-stable endemic equilibria in absence of delay can be transformed to oscillatory bi-stable limit cycles in presence of delay (when the delay is sufficiently large). Here the delay causes the change in stability of both the equilibria by generating two local Hopf bifurcations around both the equilibria which were stable in absence of delay. We also investigated the effect of information and disease transmission rate on disease persistence along with the incubation delay length. Thus, we conclude that the nonlinearity and delays in the model system account for rich and complex dynamics.},

  abstract     = {A flux neuron model with double time delays was developed by introducing a memristor. The first time delay is added to the memristor and another time delay is formed by the interaction of fast and slow variables in the HR model. The local stability and Hopf bifurcation of the equilibrium are obtained in four different combinations of time delays. The direction, stability, and periodic solution of the Hopf bifurcation are proved by the centre manifold theorem. Furthermore, using numerical simulations, the two-parameter bifurcation diagrams are obtained to give insight into the effect of time delays on chaos-mediated mixed-mode oscillations and non-chaos-mediated mixed-mode oscillations of the flux neuron model. Changing in time delays can lead to an increase or decrease in the number of periods, disappearance, chaos, and other rich phenomena in the system membrane voltage. These phenomena provide a satisfactory explanation for the abnormal brain discharges caused by magnetic field and time delays.},

However, previous meshless techniques, such as moving least square method, radious basis function method, and element free Galerkin method, often have complex shape functions, which make the ill-condition of the equation increase along with the adding of control points. In order to overcome above shortcomings, in this paper, we construct a new meshless method for solving nonlinear variable order fractional Ginzburg–Landau equation. The method uses the bases of bicubic spline space as shape functions and applies continuation technique to make the operation simple and the calculation accelerated. Eventually, numerical examples demonstrate that our method can obtain higher accuracy and efficiency even though the step size is larger than other methods.},

The illicit drug uses and act of terrorism have become a crucial issue in the recent years as it ruins the future of the young generation and affects economy of several nations. Here in this study, a mathematical model approach was used to study the role of illicit drug use on terrorism spread dynamics in a population. A model was developed with a seven-dimensional deterministic ordinary differential equation. Equilibrium points, local stability, and global stability were analyzed analytically and numerically. The model exhibits backwards bifurcation, which indicates it will be difficult to eradicate illicit drug use and terrorism in the population, even when $$\mathcal {R}_0 &lt; 1$$ except some conditions are met. MATLAB R2013 computing software was used for numerical simulations; those simulation provides more confirmation to all analytical results. The results from sensitivity analysis encourage the rehabilitation of terrorist. It can be also be deduced from the results that the problem of terrorism spread in the population can be controlled if the use of illicit drug is properly checked.},

Beddington–De Angelis incidence rate has been chosen to observe the effects of measure of inhibition taken by both: susceptible and infective. This includes measure of inhibition taken by susceptibles as wearing proper mask, personal hygiene and maintaining social distance and the measure of inhibition taken by infectives may be quarantine or any other available treatment facility. Holling type II treatment rate has been considered for the present model for its ability to capture the effects of available limited treatment facilities in case of Covid 19. To include the neglected effect of memory property in integer order system, Caputo form of non-integer derivative has been considered, which exists in most biological systems. It has been observed that the model is well posed i.e., the solution with a positive initial value is reviewed for non-negativity and boundedness. Basic reproduction number $$R_{0}$$ is determined by next generation matrix method. Routh Hurwitz criteria has been used to determine the presence and stability of equilibrium points and then stability analyses have been conducted. It has been observed that the disease-free equilibrium $$Q^{d}$$ is stable for $$ R_{0} 1$$ , it becomes unstable, and the system will tend towards endemic equilibrium $$Q^{e}$$ . Further, global stability analysis is carried out for both the equilibria using $$R_{0}$$ .

Accelerated proximal boosting machine (APBM) is a boosting algorithm built upon the proximal point algorithm and employed Nesterov’s accelerated descent. However, in the acceleration process, the momentum term will accumulate errors, which may cause the algorithm to diverge. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named CAPBM, which incorporates corrected pseudo residual into the design of APBM in boosting process. By applying the corrected pseudo residual to update the momentum sequence, CAPBM can reduce the error generated when fitting the residual, and further ensure the algorithm convergence. Finally, we theoretically prove that CAPBM is convergent with a rate of $$O(1/t^2)$$ . Numerical experiments on real datasets are carried out to illustrate that the proposed CAPBM algorithm is effective and competitive.},

Based on Lobatto orthogonal polynomials a high-order L-RKM is carried out. Lobatto orthogonal polynomials are constructed by Legendre polynomials, and the reproducing kernel function in Hilbert space is represented by Lobatto polynomials. The reproducing kernel function is used to represent the solution of the operator equation, which is obtained by replacing the variables of the original model. Then, the approximate solution of the model is obtained by the inverse operation of variable replacement. The error estimation and approximate solution of polynomial fitting are given. It is shown that the method introduced in this paper has certain significance in terms of running speed and accuracy of results. Therefore, it can be confirmed by numerical results that the method has high precision accuracy in different spaces.},

It is proved that there are only two possible values of the 4-adic complexity for the two-prime quaternary generator, which are at least $$pq-1-\max {\log _4(pq^2),\log _4(p^2q)}$$ . Examples for primes p and q with $$5\le p, q &lt;10000$$ illustrate that the 4-adic complexity only takes one value larger than $$pq-\max {\log _4(p),\log _4(q)}$$ , which is close to its period.

  abstract     = {The aim of this work is to formulate and analyze nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) schemes for a recognized virus-patch dynamic model. We introduce a simple and efficient approach to study the global asymptotic stability (GAS) of the constructed NSFD schemes. This approach is based on the Lyapunov stability theorem for discrete-time dynamical systems in combination with a well-known result on the GAS of discrete-time nonlinear cascade systems. As an important consequence, we obtain dynamically consistent NSFD schemes that provide reliable numerical approximations for the virus-patch dynamic model regardless of chosen step sizes. In addition, the convergence and error bounds for the constructed NSFD schemes are also investigated. Finally, a set of numerical examples is performed to support and illustrate the theoretical results. The numerical results show that some typical standard Runge–Kutta schemes fail to preserve the positivity and GAS of the continuous model for some given step sizes, meanwhile, the NSFD schemes preserve these properties for the same step sizes.},

The formula of the basic reproduction number of the deterministic model is obtained by utilizing the existence of the endemic equilibrium. Next, we define a stopping time, then the existence of a unique global positive solution for the stochastic model is proved by constructing appropriate Lyapunov function to demonstrate the stopping time is infinite. In addition, we also manifest sufficient conditions for diseases extinction and the existence of ergodic stationary distribution by constructing appropriate stochastic Lyapunov functions.

But, all papers determine such parameters based on conventional arithmetic operators, though the valid operations on FMs are max–min. To the best of our knowledge no papers are published to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors based on max–min operators. In this paper, a novel technique is adapted to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an interval-valued fuzzy graph (IVFG) using max–min operators. The energy of an IVFG is defined and computed using max–min operators. Finally, an application of eigenvalues of an IVFG is discussed for the ecological system. In ecology, the amount of food consumed by a predator from the preys is represented as an interval valued fuzzy membership values which is natural as the consumption of food for a predator from preys is uncertain. So this application is very much appropriate for eigenvalues and eigenvectors as well as energy of an IVFG.},

The analytic computations show that the disease-free equilibrium in the absence of travel is globally asymptotically stable when $$R_\omega \le 1$$ and unstable otherwise. The trans-critical bifurcation occurs at $$R_\omega =1$$ and the locally stable endemic equilibrium point appears if $$R_\omega &gt;1$$ near to $$R_\omega =1$$ . The numerical simulations are performed to verify the analytical computation and explore the dynamic behavior with respect to different model parameters.

Here we aim to study the rumor spread mechanism and the influential factors using epidemic like model. We have divided the total population into three groups, namely, ignorant, spreader and aware. We have used delay differential equations to describe the dynamics of rumor spread process and studied the stability of the steady-state solutions using the threshold value of influence which is analogous to the basic reproduction number in disease model. Global stability of rumor prevailing state has been proved by using Lyapunov function. An optimal control system is set up using media awareness campaign to minimize the spreader population and the corresponding cost. Hopf bifurcation analyses with respect to time delay and the transmission rate of rumors are discussed here both analytically and numerically. Moreover, we have derived the stability region of the system corresponding to change of transmission rate and delay values.},

For simplicity, the main problem has been studied in the one-dimensional case, however, the proposed method can be applied for high dimensional setting. We have applied the shifted Chebyshev wavelets for discretizing the space derivatives and the finite difference approximations for the discretization of time fractional derivatives, in this process, we use the Taylor expansion to linearize the nonlinear terms in the equations. The proposed algorithm along with the collocation approach reduces the main problem to the solution of ill-conditioned linear algebraic equations. To alleviate the difficulties arising from solving the resultant ill-conditioned linear system, a type of regularization technique is utilized to obtain a stable solution. The convergence analysis and the accuracy of the method have been discussed. Two examples will be taken into account to demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed algorithm.},

In this paper, we proposed and discussed a stochastic SIRI epidemic model incorporating double saturated incidence rates and relapse. The dynamical properties of the model were analyzed. The existence and uniqueness of a global positive solution were proven. Sufficient conditions were derived to guarantee the extinction and persistence in mean of the epidemic model. Additionally, ergodic stationary distribution of the stochastic SIRI model was discussed. Our results indicated that the intensity of relapse and stochastic perturbations greatly affected the dynamics of epidemic systems and if the random fluctuations were large enough, the disease could be accelerated to extinction while the stronger relapse rate were detrimental to the control of the disease.},

Thus, a continuous fractional sliding mode controller is designed to compensate not necessarily integer-order differentiable disturbances. The theoretical results demonstrate that both the disturbance is exactly compensated and the pseudo-state converges asymptotically to the origin. A numerical simulation is carried out to demonstrate the reliability and efficacy of the proposed method, where a comparison to a conventional sliding mode scheme reveals a superior performance for the proposed fractional sliding mode approach.},

Under the assumption that the gradient of objective function is linearly independent, we prove that the methods can always produce a subsequence that converges to the local Pareto point of the problem, and analysis its worst-case iteration complexity.

  abstract     = {Although novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) was widely spread in mainland China in early 2020, it was soon controlled. To study the impact of government interventions on the spread of disease during epidemics, a differential equation system is established to simulate the process of virus propagation in this paper. We first analyze its basic properties, basic reproduction number $$R_{0}$$ and existence of equilibria. Then we prove that the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) is Globally Asymptotically Stable when $$R_{0}$$ is less than 1. Through the analysis of the daily epidemic data from January 10, 2020 to March 11, 2020, combined with the implementation of the national epidemic policy, we divide the whole process into three stages: the first stage (natural state), the second stage (isolation state), the third stage (isolation, detection and treatment). By using the weighted nonlinear least square method to fit the data of three stages, the parameters are obtained, and three basic reproduction numbers are calculated, which are: $$R_{01} =2.6735$$ , $$R_{02} = 0.85077$$ , $$R_{03} = 0.18249$$ . Sensitivity analysis of threshold parameters and corresponding graphical results were also performed to examine the relative importance of various model parameters to the spread and prevalence of COVID-19. Finally, we simulate the trend of three stages and verify the theory of Global Asymptotic Stability of DFE. The conclusion of this paper proves theoretically that the Chinese government’s epidemic prevention measures are effective in the fight against the spread of COVID-19. This study can not only provide a reference for research methods to simulate COVID-19 transmission in other countries or regions, but also provide recommendations on COVID-19 prevention measures for them.},

In this paper, we have studied the effects of impulsive control strategies on the spread of mosquito-borne diseases considering the latent period. Therefore, we proposed and analyzed a mosquito-borne disease model governed by a system of impulsive delay differential equations. The proposed mosquito-borne disease model also accounts for three different impulsive control strategies, namely vaccination, pesticides, and adulticides. Two thresholds $$R_1$$ and $$R_2$$ established for the global attractivity of the disease-free state and the persistence of the endemic state. The non-trivial disease-free solution of the proposed model is globally asymptotically stable if $$R_1$$ and $$R_2$$ less than one. It is shown that a unique positive endemic periodic solution exists only when $$ R_1 $$ and $$ R_2$$ greater than unity, which makes for the persistence of the disease. Numerical simulation supports the analytical finding and shows the effectiveness of the impulse control strategies.},

So the paper consists of two main parts: studying the regularity of solution and introducing a simple structure and efficient numerical method. The method generates approximate solution with fractional power terms having the same behavior of the exact solution of the given problem. The convergence analysis of the method is also investigated in $$L^{2}$$ -norm. Some illustrative examples are given to confirm the theoretical results and the accuracy of the approximate solution.

By solving a new accelerated subspace quadratic optimization problem which can take the advantages of the linear conjugate gradient method, a new conjugate parameter is obtained and a new truncation strategy is proposed to modify the conjugate parameter. Thus, a three-term conjugate gradient method for solving unconstrained optimization problem is proposed under the standard Wolfe line search technique. Under general assumption, the global convergence of the algorithm is discussed and obtained. Finally, the numerical performance for our method is reported via testing about 100 examples and comparing with other two algorithms. Numerical results show that the proposed method is promising.},

By analyzing corresponding characteristic equations, the local stabilities of feasible equilibria are addressed. With the help of suitable Lyapunov functionals and LaSalle’s invariance principle, it is proven that the global dynamics of the system is completely determined by the immunity-inactivated and immunity-activated reproduction ratios: if the immunity-inactivated reproduction ratio is less than unity, the infection-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable; if the immunity-inactivated reproduction ratio is greater than unity, while the immunity-activated reproduction ratio is less than unity, the immunity-inactivated equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable; if the immunity-activated reproduction ratio is greater than unity, the immunity-activated equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable.

Then we have investigated that the model has a unique dynamical bifurcation point $$\varTheta $$ with the following conditions: if $$\varTheta 0$$ then a stable unique invariant measure on $${\mathbf {R}}_{+}$$ occurs, and the Dirac measure concentrated at zero is unstable.

  abstract     = {Usually, juvenile predators are small in size, comparatively feeble and in the earlier phase of learning the tricky manoeuvre skills of predation. Due to small prey–predator size-ratio, juvenile predators and preys become two deadliest opponents, therefore, whenever both face off, the outcome may be utterly unpredictable. In response to the juvenile predators’ attack, preys also come up with a countermeasure and try to defend themselves but a sharp role-reversal in the predator–prey ecology occurs when preys kill the juvenile predators during the counter-attacking strategies. In this paper, we propose and analyze a biologically motivated delayed predator–prey system to explore the joint impact of counterattacking strategies and multiple delays on the predator–prey interactions. We have introduced the transformation of immature to mature predators including delay $$\tau _1$$ as an average time to reach maturity. Another time delay $$\tau _2$$ owing to the gestation of the adult predators, is taken into account. After the brief discussion of the basic ecosystem properties for the model in absence of delay, we have performed the stability analysis of the delayed system comprehensively. In this context, existence of Hopf bifurcation at the interior equilibrium is established and its stability as well as direction of the Hopf bifurcation is also investigated. Numerical simulations are also performed to corroborate the theoretical findings. Through this work, it has been illustrated that counterattacking of preys suppresses the unstable oscillations in the population, on the other hand, large delays always destabilize the interior steady state. Hence, in the realistic predator–prey ecology, where counterattack and delays are showing opposite behavior in the same ecosystem, the results of this paper are important to disclose the actual crossover and synergies between both the ecological properties.},

Some basic results on threshold dimension and threshold partition number also have been discussed. Finally, an application is presented on this developed concept. Due to the wide range of complex Pythagorean fuzzy sets $$(\mathcal {CPFS}_{s})$$ , it is obvious that $$\mathcal {CPFTG}_{s}$$ are more helpful and beneficial in modeling a problem as compared to complex fuzzy threshold graphs $$(\mathcal {CFTG}_{s})$$ and complex intuitionistic fuzzy threshold graphs $$(\mathcal {CIFTG}_{s})$$ .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the dynamics of stochastic time-delayed predator–prey model with modified Leslie–Gower and ratio-dependent schemes including additional food for predator and prey with Michaelis–Menten type harvest. We introduce the effects of time delay, Michaelis–Menten type harvest and stochastic perturbation under the structure of the original model to make the model more consistent with the actual system. We first prove that the system has a globally unique positive solution. Secondly we obtain conditions for the persistence in mean and extinction of the system. Besides, we verify that the system is stochastic permanence under certain conditions. In addition to that, we prove that the system has an ergodic stationary distribution when the parameters satisfy certain conditions. Finally, some numerical simulations were performed to verify the correctness and validity of the theoretical results.},

A multi-patch deterministic model for BTV is formulated and analysed to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination, quarantine, insecticide spraying and the use of repellent control strategies in reducing the within and between-patches transmission. By using optimal control theory, the effectiveness of these strategies is established. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are calculated to determine the most cost-effective strategy. In a single patch, vaccination, insecticide spraying and the use of repellents are all highly effective in minimising transmission, but the most cost-effective is vaccination. In patches connected by host and midge movements, if any of these controls is applied in a high-risk patch, a disease-free status is achieved in both patches, but if implemented in a low-risk patch, it is not attained in any patch. If hosts and midges move, quarantine has no effect, but for no midge movement, the effect can be large in a low-risk patch if it’s internally imposed.},

  abstract     = {In the present study, a time-delayed SIR epidemic model with a logistic growth of susceptibles, Crowley–Martin type incidence, and Holling type III treatment rates is proposed and analyzed mathematically. We consider two explicit time-delays: one in the incidence rate of new infection to measuring the impact of the latent period, and another in the treatment rate of infectives to analyzing the effect of late treatment availability. The stability behavior of the model is analyzed for two equilibria: the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and the endemic equilibrium (EE). We derive the threshold quantity, the basic reproduction number $$R_0$$ , which determines the eradication or persistence of infectious diseases in the host population. Using the basic reproduction number, we show that the DFE is locally asymptotically stable when $$R_0 1$$ for the time-delayed system. We analyze the system without a latent period, revealing the forward bifurcation at $$R_0= 1$$ , which implies that keeping $$R_0$$ below unity can diminish the disease. Further, the stability behavior for the EE is investigated, demonstrating the occurrence of oscillatory and periodic solutions through Hopf bifurcation concerning every possible grouping of two time-delays as the bifurcation parameter. To conclude, the numerical simulations in support of the theoretical findings are carried out.},

The Cartesian product of G and H, denoted by $$G\Box H$$ , is the graph with vertex set $$V(G)\times V(H)$$ , where $$(x,u)\sim (y,v)$$ if and only if $$x=y$$ and $$u\sim v$$ in H, or $$x\sim y$$ in G and $$u=v$$ . The lexicographic product of G and H, denoted by G[H], is the graph with vertex set $$V(G)\times V(H)$$ , where $$(x,u)\sim (y,v)$$ if and only if $$x\sim y$$ in G, or $$x=y$$ and $$u\sim v$$ in H. The resistance diameter of graph G refers to the maximum resistance distance among all pairs of vertices in G. Let $$P_n$$ be the path of n vertices. In this paper, the resistance diameters of $$P_n\Box P_m$$ and $$P_n[P_m]$$ are studied. Meanwhile, the maximal resistance distance, which is among some pairs of vertices in the lexicographic product of connected graph and orderable graph, is given.},

In this work, we propose a structure-preserving finite element discretization for the time-dependent NP equation combining a reformulated Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme and Scharfetter-Gummel (SG) approximation. The JKO scheme transforms a partial differential equation solution problem into an optimization problem. Our finite element discretization strategy with the SG stabilization technique and the Fisher information regularization term in the reformulated JKO scheme can guarantee the convexity of the discrete objective function in the optimization problem. In this paper, we prove that our scheme can preserve discrete solution nonnegativity, maintain total mass conservation, and preserve the decay property of energy. These properties are all validated with our numerical experiments. Moreover, the later numerical results show that our scheme performs better than the traditional Galerkin method with linear Lagrangian basis functions in keeping the above physical properties even when the convection term is dominant and the grid is coarse.},

An inertial Bregman generalized alternating direction method of multiplies is investigated for solving the nonconvex optimization. The iterative schemes are formulated in the spirit of the proximal alternating direction method of multipliers and its inertial variant. The proximal term is introduced via Bregman distance, a fact that allows us to derive new proximal splitting algorithms for large-scale separable optimization problems. Under some assumptions, we prove that the iterative sequence generated by the algorithm converges to a critical point of the considered problem. Finally, we report some preliminary numerical results on solving signal recovery and SCAD penalty problems to verify the efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) often emerges from applied science, such as orbital mechanics, quantum mechanics, physical chemistry, electronics. As we all know, Runge-Kutta-Nyström (RKN) method is indispensable when solving the second-order ODE. In addition, there are also some intrinsic properties in these fields. How to preserve these properties must be considered when seeking the numerical solutions. Thus, in this paper, we focus on the construction of the implicit RKN method. Combining the symmetry conditions and symplecticness conditions, sixth-order implicit exponentially fitted/trigonometrically fitted RKN integrators are obtained. The designed methods have the power of solving Hamiltonian system. And we make some numerical experiments to show the efficiency and competence of the new methods compared with some highly efficient implicit codes in the literature.},

With the help of a normalized generating set, we explicitly determine the dimension and a generating set of the Galois dual of each $$\Lambda $$ -MT code of length n over $$\mathbb {F}_{q}.$$ We also provide a trace description of all $$\Lambda $$ -MT codes of length n over $$\mathbb {F}_{q}$$ by using the generalized discrete Fourier transform (GDFT), which gives rise to a method to construct these codes. We further provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which a Euclidean self-dual $$\Lambda $$ -MT code of length n over $$\mathbb {F}_{2^e}$$ is a Type II code when $$\lambda _i=1$$ and $$m_i = n_i2^a$$ for $$ 1\le i \le \ell ,$$ where $$a \ge 0$$ is an integer and $$n_1, n_2, \cdots , n_{\ell }$$ are odd positive integers satisfying $$n_1 \equiv n_2 \equiv \cdots \equiv n_{\ell }~ (\text {mod }4).$$ Besides this, we obtain several linear codes with best-known and optimal parameters from 1-generator $$\Lambda $$ -MT codes over $$\mathbb {F}_{q},$$ where $$2 \le q \le 7.$$ It is worth mentioning that these code parameters can not be attained by any of their subclasses (such as constacyclic and quasi-twisted codes) containing record breaker codes.},

In our work we consider regularizing the problem by introducing a bounded approximation of the second derivative by using Cubic smoothing splines. We derive a bound for the approximate derivative and show how to obtain stability estimates for the method. Numerical tests show that the method works well and can produce accurate results.

The diffusion coefficient in the underlying PDE is a quadratic function of the space variable and contains a perturbation parameter. While such problems have been studied in the case of boundary layers, little has been achieved for interior layer problems where the coefficient functions are considered to be dependent on the space variable alone. In this work, we focus our attention to such problems where the coefficient functions are dependent of both the space and time variables. Following the work of Liseikin (USSR Computational Mathematics and Mathematical Physics 26(6), 133–139, 1986), we establish bounds on the solution and its derivatives. Then we discretize the time derivative using an implicit Euler method. This discretization results in a set of two-point boundary value problems (TPBVPs). We then construct a fitted mesh finite difference method to solve these TPBVPs. This method is analyzed for stability and convergence. We proved that it satisfies a minimum principle and is uniformly convergent with respect to the perturbation parameter. In order to improve the accuracy of the proposed method, we use the Richardson extrapolation. Finally, we present some numerical experiments to validate our theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {A graph is called Hamilton-connected if there exists a Hamiltonian path between every pair of its vertices. Determining whether or not a graph is Hamilton-connected is an NP-complete problem. In this paper, we present two methods to show Hamilton-connectivity in graphs. The first method uses the vertex connectivity and Hamiltoniancity of graphs, and, the second is the definition-based constructive method which constructs Hamiltonian paths between every pair of vertices. By employing these proof techniques, we show that the line graphs of the generalized Petersen, anti-prism and wheel graphs are Hamilton-connected. Combining it with some existing results, it shows that some of these families of Hamilton-connected line graphs have their underlying graph families non-Hamilton-connected. This, in turn, shows that the underlying graph of a Hamilton-connected line graph is not necessarily Hamilton-connected. As side results, the detour index being also an NP-complete problem, has been calculated for the families of Hamilton-connected line graphs. Finally, by computer we generate all the Hamilton-connected graphs on $$\le 7$$ vertices and all the Hamilton-laceable graphs on $$\le 10$$ vertices. Our research contributes towards our proposed conjecture that almost all graphs are Hamilton-connected.},

The algorithms belong to the family of non-uniform covering methods. For the algorithms we prove propositions about convergence to an $$\varepsilon $$ -solution in terms of the objective function. We illustrate the performance of the algorithms using several test numerical examples with non-Lipschitz continuous objective functions.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this paper is to establish a control strategy in order to prevent the congestion in the transportation network subject to additive uncertainties. This is achieved by stabilizing the lanes around their nominal situations where the risk to generate congestion is very low. Firstly, by using the store and forward approach, the system is modeled as a linear discrete time model with additive uncertainties. Then, a state feedback traffic light control law that stabilizes the lanes while satisfying the constraints on both state and control variables is established. In order to estimate the uncertainties that may cause bad effects on the control performance, an observer is proposed to achieve this objective. As an illustrative example, many simulations are realized to show the effectiveness of our observer and our proposed control with different level of uncertainties.},

Moreover, to address conceptual depth within this approach, we supply series of innovative and nontrivial examples to illustrate the established results along with computer simulation, thereby propounding the concept in a quite novel way.

We study how these two ecosystem services respond to different types of harvesting plans applied to the system. In individual harvesting, we observe that prey harvesting is suitable for generating more yield while either predator harvesting gives more resilience. Several patterns are possible based on the intensity of harvesting efforts applied to prey or the predator in simultaneous harvesting. This study shows that a balanced harvest between prey and predators may give more than the selective harvesting of any species yielding and stabilizing the ecosystem. Even if this fair strategy is not a cooperative situation for both resilience and yield, it may be the most favorable approach to scale those services. Finally, we may state that it would help us correlate the safest position (corresponds to the maximizing resilience yield) and the good views (which corresponds to the maximum sustainable return) to safeguard our ecosystems.},

In presence of predator, prey adopted optimal strategies to avoid predation and to increase their survival. The antipedator behaviour exhibited by prey against predator’s fear; have potential to change the qualitative dynamics of food web systems. In the present study, we demonstrate the impacts of simultaneous fears exerted by two predators bidirectionally in a simple tri-trophic intraguild-predation (IGP) food-web model when IGP has point stability and chaotic dynamical states in absence of fear. The antipredator behaviour exhibited by prey against the fear of predators lead chaotic system into point stability and enhances coexistence. We carried out general mathematical phenomenon such as equilibrium analysis, stability and persistence. We also verified the stability by Routh Hurwitz criteria. By one and two parameter bifurcation diagram, we concluded that fear enhances stability. Our numerical simulations reveal that fear of mesopredator stabilize the system while top predator fear has dampening ability of chaos.},

We investigate the dynamics of this model by addressing the existence, local and global stability of equilibria, uniform persistence as well as saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations. Numerical simulations are presented to explore the joint impacts of inter-specific and intra-specific competition on competition outcomes. Though inter-specific competition along does not admit a stable coexistence equilibrium, with intra-specific competition, the coexistence of the two competing predator species becomes possible and the two coexisting predator species may maintain at two different equilibrium populations.},

By utilizing Sotomayor’s theorem, bifurcation analysis has been proposed and obtain one saddle-node bifurcation. Furthermore, in view of Poincaré transformation, the behaviors near infinity and the nonexistence of close orbits are obtained and lead to the presentation of all possible global phase portraits. The global phase portrait in $$R_{5}$$ with two stable node $$E_{2}$$ and $$E_{1}^{*}$$ is a new case due to the appearance of bistable structure. Finally, some numerical examples are offered to verify and extend the analytical results and visualize the interesting phenomenon.},

The proposed algorithm combines the parametric approach and the Huard method of centers. That’s we extend the Method of Centers of Roubi for solving minimax fractional programs to continuous minimax problems. On the other hand, calculating the exact optimal solution of the proposed parametric problems, requires an extraordinary computational work per iteration. To overcome this problem we use an iterative entropic regularization method which allows us to solve each auxiliary problem inexactly generating an approximate sequence of optimal values and then the continuous minimax problem is reduced into a sequence of finite minimax problems. Examples for illustration are given to test our algorithm.},

With several new stepsize rules considered, the methods can work with or without knowing previously the Lipschitz constant of cost operator. Unlike known hybrid methods, the strong convergence of the proposed methods comes from the regularization technique. Several applications to signal recovery problems and optimal control problems together with numerical experiments are also presented in this paper.

So far, there are two main categories that differ from each other by the nature of filtering process controlling the communication step: random-context clauses or polarization. Several studies have proven that both of them are computationally complete through efficient simulations of universal computational models such as Turing machines and 2-tag systems. Nevertheless, the indirect conversion between the two network variants results in an exponential increase of the computational complexity. In this paper, we suggest a direct simulation of polarized NEP through NEP with random-context filters which incurs in lower complexity costs.},

  abstract     = {The objective of this paper is to introduce a method for constructing a minimal lattice-valued tree automaton with membership values in a totally ordered lattice (in short $$\mathcal {LTA}),$$ based on the solvability of a system of fuzzy polynomial equations. Since the minimization problem strongly depends on the equivalence problem, at first, the equivalence problem is examined. For this purpose, the notion of h-equivalence is defined, and a necessary and sufficient condition for the equivalence between two $$\mathcal {LTA}s$$ is provided. It is shown that the equivalence problem of $$\mathcal {LTA}s$$ is decidable. In the minimization problem, the following question is replied: given an $$\mathcal {LTA}$$ $$\mathbb {A}$$ and a positive integer k,  is there an $$\mathcal {LTA}$$ with k states equivalent to $$\mathbb {A}?$$ Decidability of the minimization problem is demonstrated, and an approach to return a minimal $$\mathcal {LTA}$$ equivalent to the original one is presented. Also, the time complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed. Finally, some examples are presented to clarify the minimization problem.},

Existence, uniqueness of solutions and Ulam–Hyers stability results are displayed. To solve the considered equations a numerical approximation based on the shifted Legendre polynomials are proposed. To perform the method, an operational matrix of fractional derivative with variable-order is derived for the shifted Legendre polynomials to be applied for developing the unknown function. By substituting the aforesaid operational matrix into the considered equations and using the properties of the shifted Legendre polynomials together with the collocation points, the main equations are reduced to a system of algebraic equations. The approximate solution is calculated by solving the obtained system which is technically easier for checking. We also study the error analysis for the approximate solution yielded by the introduced method. Finally, the accuracy and performance of the proposed method are checked by some illustrative examples. The illustrative examples results establish the applicability and usefulness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the variable-order (VO) time-fractional diffusion equations. For a VO function $$\alpha (t)\in (0,1)$$ , we develop an exponential-sum-approximation (ESA) technique to approach the VO Caputo fractional derivative. The ESA technique keeps both the quadrature exponents and the number of exponentials in the summation unchanged at different time level. Approximating parameters are properly selected to achieve the efficient accuracy. Compared with the general direct method, the proposed method reduces the storage requirement from $${\mathcal {O}}(n)$$ to $${\mathcal {O}}(\log ^2 n)$$ and the computational cost from $${\mathcal {O}}(n^2)$$ to $$\mathcal {O}(n\log ^2 n)$$ , respectively, with n being the number of the time levels. When this fast algorithm is exploited to construct a fast ESA scheme for the VO time-fractional diffusion equations, the computational complexity of the proposed scheme is only of $${\mathcal {O}}(mn\log ^2 n)$$ with $${\mathcal {O}}(m\log ^2n)$$ storage requirement, where m denotes the number of spatial grid points. Theoretically, the unconditional stability and error analysis of the fast ESA scheme are given. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by numerical examples.},

Here our aim mainly is to demonstrate the impact of both the Allee effect and hunting cooperation on the system dynamics. Mathematically our analysis primarily focuses on the stability of coexisting equilibrium points and all possible bifurcations that the system may exhibit.

Then, the operational matrices based on LCB-S functions are constructed, for the first time, including the fractional Riemann-Liouville integral operational matrix, the stochastic integral operational matrix, and the integer integral operational matrix. The main characteristic of the new scheme is to convert the FSI-D equation into a linear system of algebraic equations which can be easily solved by applying a suitable method. Also, the convergence analysis and error estimate of the proposed method are studied and an upper bound of error is obtained. Numerical experiments are provided to show the potential and efficiency of the new method.

Using Shishkin mesh with the Haar wavelet scheme contains a novelty in itself. We comprehensively explain an approach to solve the Robin boundary conditions involving the proposed Haar wavelet scheme. Through rigorous analysis, the order of convergence of the present scheme is shown quadratic and linear in the spatial and temporal directions, respectively.

  abstract     = {Fuzzy graph theory provides tools for modeling different types of real-world networks. However, we should consider more relations, especially the relationship between edges with their corresponding vertices, which usually refer to incidences, when external factors influence the real flow in a network. Then, fuzzy incidence graphs may sometimes model certain real-world situations better. The present study aims to define incidence valid edges, the recognition of which is easy, and their number is more than that of effective edges. In this regard, we introduce dominating sets in fuzzy incidence graphs by using incidence valid edges due to the importance of the concept of domination and its application in various issues. In addition, several important sets related to the dominating set such as independent and irredundant sets are investigated. Further, the concepts of domination, upper domination, and independent domination number, as well as independence, irredundant, and upper irredundant number in fuzzy incidence graphs are evaluated, along with their relation. Finally, an application of the concept of domination in a fuzzy incidence graph is obtained.},

We find that C and its image $$\Phi (C)$$ have the same homogeneous distance, and the cyclic shift of any codeword of $$\Phi (C)$$ is still contained in $$\Phi (C)$$ over $$\mathbb {F}_2[v]/\langle v^2\rangle $$ , but $$\Phi (C)$$ is not a cyclic code in some cases. These properties help us to determine the lower bound and the upper bound for the homogeneous distance of C by discussing the same problem of $$\Phi (C)$$ . With these bounds, exact homogeneous distances of some $$(1+u^2)$$ -constacyclic codes are given. On the other hand, we consider the application of homogeneous distances in computing Hamming distances of a class of binary linear quasi-cyclic codes, and derive some optimal binary linear quasi-cyclic codes.},

An algorithm is presented to create a zero-divisor graph for the ring of Gaussian integers modulo $$2^{n}$$ for $$n\ge 1$$ . The zero-divisor graph $$\Gamma (\mathbb {Z}_{2^{n}}[i])$$ can be expressed as a generalized join graph $$G[G_{1}, \dots , G_{j}]$$ , where $$G_{i}$$ is either a complete graph (including loops) or its complement and G is the compressed zero-divisor graph of $$\mathbb {Z}_{2^{2n}}$$ . Next, we show that the number of isomorphisms between the zero-divisor graphs for the ring of Gaussian integers modulo $$2^{n}$$ and the ring of integers modulo $$2^{2n}$$ is equal to $$\prod _{j=1}^{2(n-1)}2^{j}!$$ .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a mathematical model to assess the impact of social media advertisements in combating the coronavirus pandemic in India. We assume that dissemination of awareness among susceptible individuals modifies public attitudes and behaviours towards this contagious disease which results in reducing the chance of contact with the coronavirus and hence decreasing the disease transmission. Moreover, the individual’s behavioral response in the presence of global information campaigns accelerate the rate of hospitalization of symptomatic individuals and also encourage the asymptomatic individuals for conducting health protocols, such as self-isolation, social distancing, etc. We calibrate the proposed model with the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases for the Republic of India. We estimate eight epidemiologically important parameters, and also the size of basic reproduction number for India. We find that the basic reproduction number for India is greater than unity, which represents the substantial outbreak of COVID-19 in the country. Sophisticated techniques of sensitivity analysis are employed to determine the impacts of model parameters on basic reproduction number and symptomatic infected population. Our results reveal that to reduce disease burden in India, non-pharmaceutical interventions strategies should be implemented effectively to decrease basic reproduction number below unity. Continuous propagation of awareness through the internet and social media platforms should be regularly circulated by the health authorities/government officials for hospitalization of symptomatic individuals and quarantine of asymptomatic individuals to control the prevalence of disease in India.},
