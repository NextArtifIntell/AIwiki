  abstract     = {We propose the usage of two power indices from cooperative game theory and public choice theory for ranking attributes of closed sets, namely intents of formal concepts (or closed itemsets). The introduced indices are related to extensional concept stability and are also based on counting of generators, especially of those that contain a selected attribute. The introduction of such indices is motivated by the so-called interpretable machine learning, which supposes that we do not only have the class membership decision of a trained model for a particular object, but also a set of attributes (in the form of JSM-hypotheses or other patterns) along with individual importance of their single attributes (or more complex constituent elements). We characterise computation of the Shapley and Banzhaf-Penrose values of a formal concept in terms of minimal generators and their order filters, provide the reader with their properties important for computation purposes, prove related #P-completeness results, and show experimental results with model and real datasets. We also show how this approach can be applied in both supervised (classification) and unsupervised (pattern mining) settings.},

  abstract     = {Recent approaches for knowledge-graph embeddings aim at connecting quantitative data structures used in machine learning to the qualitative structures of logics. Such embeddings are of a hybrid nature, they are data models that also exhibit conceptual structures inherent to logics. One motivation to investigate embeddings is to design conceptually adequate machine learning (ML) algorithms that learn or incorporate ontologies expressed in some logic. This paper investigates a new approach to embedding ontologies into geometric models that interpret concepts by geometrical structures based on convex cones. The ontologies are assumed to be represented in an orthologic, a logic with a full (ortho)negation. As a proof of concept this cone-based embedding was implemented within two ML algorithms for weak supervised multi-label learning. Both algorithms rely on cones but the first addresses ontologies expressed in classical propositional logic whereas the second addresses a weaker propositional logic, namely a weak orthologic that does not fulfil distributivity. The algorithms were evaluated and showed promising results that call for investigating other (sub)classes of cones and developing fine-tuned algorithms based on them.},

Among the fastest algorithms for this task belong algorithms which are based on Close-by-One (CbO), a tree recursive algorithm using lexicographical order of formal concepts to ensure that each formal concept is enumerated exactly once. State-of-the-art algorithms based on CbO, e.g. FCbO, In-Close4, and In-Close5, employ several techniques, which we call pruning, to avoid some unnecessary computations. However, the number of the formal concepts can be exponential w.r.t. dimension of the input data. Therefore, the algorithms do not scale well and large datasets become intractable. To resolve this weakness, several parallel and distributed algorithms were proposed. We propose four new CbO-based algorithms intended for Apache Spark or a similar programming model and show how the pruning can be incorporated into them. We experimentally evaluate the impact of the pruning and demonstrate the scalability of the new algorithms.},

In the past years, researchers have proposed many F-DCOP solving algorithms with excellent performance. Nonetheless, there are some shortcomings in existing F-DCOP solving algorithms, such as the lack of anytime property, the limitation of constraint cost functions, and the inability to guarantee convergence. To deal with these problems, we proposed a Dual-population Search Differential Evolution Algorithm for F-DCOP (DSDE-FD). Firstly, we designed dual-population for local and global search respectively to balance the exploration and exploitation. Secondly, specific mutation operators are designed for local and global population. Finally, adaptive population size is designed to balance computational overhead and search ability. It is proved that the proposed algorithm is an anytime algorithm and has global convergence.The extensive experiments performed based on four types of benchmark problems shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art F-DCOP solving algorithms.},

[1] and Kaczmarczyk and Faliszewski [2]. In constructive shift bribery (Elkind et al. [1]), an attacker seeks to make a designated candidate win the election by bribing voters to shift this candidate in their preferences; in destructive shift bribery (Kaczmarczyk and Faliszewski [2]), the briber’s goal is to prevent this candidate’s victory. We show that many iterative voting systems are resistant to these types of attack, i.e., the corresponding decision problems are NP-hard. These iterative voting systems include iterated plurality as well as the voting rules due to Hare, Coombs, Baldwin, and Nanson; variants of Hare voting are also known as single transferable vote, instant-runoff voting, and alternative vote.},

Our focus is on deriving refutations, i.e. proofs of unsatisfiability, of such programs using cutting planes as a proof system. We also look at several properties of these refutations. HCSs can be considered a more general form of Horn formulas, i.e., CNF formulas with at most one positive literal per clause. Cutting plane calculus (CP) is a well-known calculus for deciding the unsatisfiability of propositional CNF formulas and integer programs. Usually, CP consists of a pair of inference rules. These are called the addition rule (ADD) and the division rule (DIV). In this paper, we show that cutting plane calculus is still complete for HCSs when every intermediate constraint is required to be Horn. We also investigate the lengths of cutting plane proofs for Horn constraint systems.},

  abstract     = {Cross-dockingis a useful concept used by many companies to control the product flow. It enables the transshipment process of products from suppliers to customers. This research thus extends the benefit of cross-docking with reverse logistics, since return process management has become an important field in various businesses. The vehicle routing problem in a distribution network is considered to be an integrated model, namely the vehicle routing problem with reverse cross-docking (VRP-RCD). This study develops a mathematical model to minimize the costs of moving products in a four-level supply chain network that involves suppliers, cross-dock, customers, and outlets. A matheuristic based on an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm and a set partitioning formulation is introduced to solve benchmark instances. We compare the results against those obtained by optimization software, as well as other algorithms such as ALNS, a hybrid algorithm based on large neighborhood search and simulated annealing (LNS-SA), and ALNS-SA. Experimental results show the competitiveness of the matheuristic that is able to obtain all optimal solutions for small instances within shorter computational times. For larger instances, the matheuristic outperforms the other algorithms using the same computational times. Finally, we analyze the importance of the set partitioning formulation and the different operators.},

  abstract     = {Bio-inspired optimization aims at adapting observed natural behavioral patterns and social phenomena towards efficiently solving complex optimization problems, and is nowadays gaining much attention. However, researchers recently highlighted an inconsistency between the need in the field and the actual trend. Indeed, while nowadays it is important to design innovative contributions, an actual trend in bio-inspired optimization is to re-iterate the existing knowledge in a different form. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap. More precisely, we start first by highlighting new examples for this problem by considering and describing the concepts of chunking and cooperative learning. Second, by considering particle swarm optimization (PSO), we present a novel bridge between these two notions adapted to the problem of feature selection. In the experiments, we investigate the practical importance of our approach while exploring both its strength and limitations. The results indicate that the approach is mainly suitable for large datasets, and that further research is needed to improve the computational efficiency of the approach and to ensure the independence of the sub-problems defined using chunking.},

  abstract     = {The support vector classification-regression machine for K-class classification (K-SVCR) is a novel multi-class classification method based on the “1-versus-1-versus-rest” structure. In this paper, we propose a least squares version of K-SVCR named LSK-SVCR. Similarly to the K-SVCR algorithm, this method assesses all the training data into a “1-versus-1-versus-rest” structure, so that the algorithm generates ternary outputs {− 1,0,+ 1}. In LSK-SVCR, the solution of the primal problem is computed by solving only one system of linear equations instead of solving the dual problem, which is a convex quadratic programming problem in K-SVCR. Experimental results on several benchmark, MC-NDC, and handwritten digit recognition data sets show that not only does the LSK-SVCR have better performance in the aspects of classification accuracy to that of K-SVCR and Twin-KSVC algorithms but also has remarkably higher learning speed.},

In this work, a novel DBC method that performs well in high-dimensions is presented. The novelty of the proposed method can be summed up as follows: a hybrid first-second order optimization algorithm for identifying high-density data points; an adaptive scan radius for identifying reachable points. Theoretical results on the validity of the proposed method are presented in this work. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach are illustrated via rigorous experimental evaluations. The proposed method is compared with the well known DBC methods on synthetic and real data from the literature.

  abstract     = {The ever increasing demand for container transportation has led to the congestion of maritime container terminals in the world. In this work, the two interrelated problems of berth and quay crane scheduling are considered in an integrated multiobjective mathematical model. A special character of this model is that the arrival times of vessels and the failure (working) times of quay cranes are not deterministic and can vary based on some scenarios. Hence, a robust model is devised for the problem having three objectives of minimising the deviations from target berthing locations and times as well as departure delays of all vessels. This robust optimisation seeks to minimise the value of the objectives regarding all the scenarios. An exact solution approach based on the 𝜖-constraint method by the Gurobi software is applied. Moreover, regarding the complexity of the problem, two Simulated Annealing (SA) based metaheuristics, namely a Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA) and a Pareto Simulated Annealing (PSA) approach are adapted with a novel solution encoding scheme. The three methods are compared based on some multiobjective metrics and a statistical test. The advantage of the integration of berth and quay crane scheduling is examined as well.},

The objective is to build a linear relationship between multiple output variables and input variables of a multitask learning process, taking into account the general covariance structure for the errors of the regression model in one hand, and reduced-rank regression model in another hand. The problem is formulated as minimizing a nonconvex function in two joint matrix variables (X,Θ) under the low-rank constraint on X and positive definiteness constraint on Θ. It has a double difficulty due to the non-convexity of the objective function as well as the low-rank constraint. We investigate a nonconvex, nonsmooth optimization approach based on DC (Difference of Convex functions) programming and DCA (DC Algorithm) for this hard problem. A penalty reformulation is considered which takes the form of a partial DC program. An alternating DCA and its inexact version are developed, both algorithms converge to a weak critical point of the considered problem. Numerical experiments are performed on several synthetic and benchmark real multitask linear regression datasets. The numerical results show the performance of the proposed algorithms and their superiority compared with three classical alternating/joint methods.},

Unfortunately, for general (non-differentiable and/or constrained) convex problems, its fixed points may not be global minima. We present two classes of linear programs (LPs) that coordinate-wise minimization solves exactly. We show that these classes subsume the dual LP relaxations of several well-known combinatorial optimization problems and the method finds a global minimum with sufficient accuracy in reasonable runtimes. Moreover, we experimentally show that the method frequently yields good suboptima or even optima for sparse LPs where optimality is not guaranteed in theory. Though the presented problems can be solved by more efficient methods, our results are theoretically non-trivial and can lead to new large-scale optimization algorithms in the future.},

The government and banks are recognized as playing irreplaceable and important roles in promoting PV investment. Therefore, this study applies a tripartite evolutionary game model to theoretically analyze the evolutionary stable strategies of the government, banks, and PV investors in China’s distributed PV market, and quantitatively discuss the contributions and limitations of government subsidies and bank loans in the diffusion of PV facilities. Simultaneously, numerical simulations are conducted to elaborate on the dynamic evolution paths of tripartite stakeholders in different stages. The results show that there are five possible evolutionary stable strategies in the early, middle, and mature stages of PV industry. But not all stages are suitable to induce PV investors. Compared with the early and mature stage, only in the middle-term stage, government subsidies and bank loans can very critically induce PV investors to start installing or installing larger-capacity equipment. In addition, the results reveal that both the government and banks prefer PV investors to install larger capacity equipment, which corresponds to higher investment costs, but accordingly, PV investors are more likely to obtain government or bank support. These conclusions provide unique insights and valuable support for the establishment of government subsidy policies and bank loan strategies.},

The paper aims to fill the gap in the relation between the column generation process and the uniqueness of the equilibrium route-flow traffic assignment pattern. The independence of routes is showed to be highly significant when travel time functions are arc-additive. Indeed, on the one hand, the independence of routes is proved to guarantee the uniqueness of the equilibrium route-flow traffic assignment pattern. On the other hand, the independence of routes appears to be crucial for column generation when solving the route-flow traffic assignment problem since the equilibrium travel time is proven to be decreased only by adding independent candidate route. Obtained results contribute to the development of algorithms for route-flow traffic assignment based on travel times equilibration procedure.},

Since the problem includes two different objectives, namely the minimizing the operational cost and maximum workload imbalance, the Pareto-optimal solutions are found by employing the second version of the augmented ε-constrained (AUGMECON2) method. To investigate the impact of qualification of workers on the system performance, a set of scenarios is constructed based on the worker skill levels. Each scenario is determined based on the nature of the worker pool in which workers are assigned to the stations. The optimization model and implemented method are validated through data taken from water-meter and elevator producers. The computational results reveal that the scenarios have a great impact on system performance. In particular, it is revealed that as the skill levels of workers increases, the quality of the Pareto-optimal solutions increase by up to 30\% in terms of the comparison metrics. Therefore, an order release mechanism and worker training activities are suggested to be performed to enhance system performance.},

In this article we show that the gaussoid axioms logically imply every inference rule of at most two antecedents which is valid for regular Gaussians over any ground set. The proof is accomplished by exhibiting for each inclusion-minimal gaussoid extension of at most two CI statements a regular Gaussian realization. Moreover we prove that all those gaussoids have rational positive-definite realizations inside every ε-ball around the identity matrix. For the proof we introduce the concept of algebraic Gaussians over arbitrary fields and of positive Gaussians over ordered fields and obtain the same two-antecedental completeness of the gaussoid axioms for algebraic and positive Gaussians over all fields of characteristic zero as a byproduct.},

This enables us to compare mathematical objects possibly across different domains in a uniform way which is crucial for AI-systems. It turns out that our notion of analogical proportions has appealing mathematical properties. As we construct our model from first principles using only elementary concepts of universal algebra, and since our model questions some basic properties of analogical proportions presupposed in the literature, to convince the reader of the plausibility of our model we show that it can be naturally embedded into first-order logic via model-theoretic types and prove from that perspective that analogical proportions are compatible with structure-preserving mappings. This provides conceptual evidence for its applicability. In a broader sense, this paper is a first step towards a theory of analogical reasoning and learning systems with potential applications to fundamental AI-problems like common sense reasoning and computational learning and creativity.},

  abstract     = {The prominent formal framework for belief change established by Alchourrón, Gärdenfors and Makinson circumscribes the territory of all rational belief-revision policies, encoded in the so-called AGM revision functions. A type of well-behaved and highly-expressive AGM revision function, induced from fixed total preorders over possible worlds, is that of uniform-revision operators (abbrev. UR operators). In this article, we introduce, both axiomatically and semantically (in terms of all popular constructive models for belief revision), a new class of AGM revision functions that is a proper sub-class of the class of AGM revision functions, but strictly larger (thus, more expressive) than the class of UR operators; hence, our proposal generalizes uniform revision. We call the presented operators theory-relational revision operators (abbrev. TR operators), since each such operator is uniquely defined through a single binary relation over theories of the language, called strong theory-relation. The connection between the semantic constructions of TR and UR operators is investigated, whereas, it is shown how a generalization (weakening) of a strong theory-relation —which is also a single fixed binary relation over theories, called weak theory-relation— can induce any AGM revision function. This latter result immediately proves an upper bound for the total number of AGM revision functions.},

This is in particular true when deriving canonical bases in formal concept analysis (FCA). Therefore, it is necessary to find techniques that on the one hand reduce the data set size, but on the other hand preserve enough structure to extract useful knowledge. Many successful methods are based on random processes to reduce the size of the investigated data set. This, however, makes them hardly interpretable with respect to the discovered knowledge. Other approaches restrict themselves to highly supported subsets and omit rare and (maybe) interesting patterns. An essentially different approach is used in network science, called k-cores. These cores are able to reflect rare patterns, as long as they are well connected within the data set. In this work, we study k-cores in the realm of FCA by exploiting the natural correspondence of bi-partite graphs and formal contexts. This structurally motivated approach leads to a comprehensible extraction of knowledge cores from large formal contexts.},

A generalizer of two terms t and $t^{\prime }$ is a term $t^{\prime \prime }$ of which t and $t^{\prime }$ are substitution instances. The dual of most general equational unifiers is that of least general equational generalizers, i.e., most specific anti-instances modulo equations. In a previous work, we extended the classical untyped generalization algorithm to: (1) an order-sorted typed setting with sorts, subsorts, and subtype polymorphism; (2) work modulo equational theories, where function symbols can obey any combination of associativity, commutativity, and identity axioms (including the empty set of such axioms); and (3) the combination of both, which results in a modular, order-sorted equational generalization algorithm. However, Cerna and Kutsia showed that our algorithm is generally incomplete for the case of identity axioms and a counterexample was given. Furthermore, they proved that, in theories with two identity elements or more, generalization with identity axioms is generally nullary, yet it is finitary for both the linear and one-unital fragments, i.e., either solutions with repeated variables are disregarded or the considered theories are restricted to having just one function symbol with an identity or unit element. In this work, we show how we can easily extend our original inference system to cope with the non-linear fragment and identify a more general class than one–unit theories where generalization with identity axioms is finitary.},

  abstract     = {Unification is a central operation in constructing a range of computational logic systems based on first-order and higher-order logics. First-order unification has several properties that guide its incorporation in such systems. In particular, first-order unification is decidable, unary, and can be performed on untyped term structures. None of these three properties hold for full higher-order unification: unification is undecidable, unifiers can be incomparable, and term-level typing can dominate the search for unifiers. The so-called pattern subset of higher-order unification was designed to be a small extension to first-order unification that respects the laws governing λ-binding (i.e., the equalities for α, β, and η-conversion) but which also satisfied those three properties. While the pattern fragment of higher-order unification has been used in numerous implemented systems and in various theoretical settings, it is too weak for many applications. This paper defines an extension of pattern unification that should make it more generally applicable, especially in proof assistants that allow for higher-order functions. This extension’s main idea is that the arguments to a higher-order, free variable can be more than just distinct bound variables. In particular, such arguments can be terms constructed from (sufficient numbers of) such bound variables using term constructors and where no argument is a subterm of any other argument. We show that this extension to pattern unification satisfies the three properties mentioned above.},

  abstract     = {Supervised learning in neural nets means optimizing synaptic weights W such that outputs y(x;W) for inputs x match as closely as possible the corresponding targets t from the training data set. This optimization means minimizing a loss function ${\mathscr{L}}(\mathbf {W})$ that usually motivates from maximum-likelihood principles, silently making some prior assumptions on the distribution of output errors y −t. While classical crossentropy loss assumes triangular error distributions, it has recently been shown that generalized power error loss functions can be adapted to more realistic error distributions by fitting the exponent q of a power function used for initializing the backpropagation learning algorithm. This approach can significantly improve performance, but computing the loss function requires the antiderivative of the function f(y) := yq− 1/(1 − y) that has previously been determined only for natural $q\in \mathbb {N}$ . In this work I extend this approach for rational q = n/2m where the denominator is a power of 2. I give closed-form expressions for the antiderivative ${\int \limits } f(y) dy$ and the corresponding loss function. The benefits of such an approach are demonstrated by experiments showing that optimal exponents q are often non-natural, and that error exponents q best fitting output error distributions vary continuously during learning, typically decreasing from large q &gt; 1 to small q &lt; 1 during convergence of learning. These results suggest new adaptive learning methods where loss functions could be continuously adapted to output error distributions during learning.},

A default conditional $\alpha \mathrel |\joinrel \sim \beta $ is read as ‘if α, then normally β’ and can be given several interpretations, including a ‘size’-oriented one: ‘in mostα-situations, β is also true’. Typically, this asks for making the set of (α ∧ β)-worlds a ‘large’ subset of the α-worlds and the set of (α ∧¬β)-worlds a ‘small’ subset of the same set. Technically, this is achieved via a ‘most’ generalized quantifier (‘most A s are B s’) and we proceed to investigate the default consequence relations emerging upon defining such quantifiers with tools from mathematical analysis. Within topology, we identify ‘large’ sets with topologically dense sets: we show that the unrestricted topological interpretation introduces a consequence relation weaker than the KLM preferential relations (system P) while the restriction to the finite complement topology over infinite sets captures rational consequence (system R). Measure theory, seemingly the most fitting tool for a ‘size’-oriented treatment of default conditionals, introduces a rather weak consequence relation, in accordance with probabilistic approaches. It turns out however, that our measure-theoretic approach is essentially equivalent to J. Hawthorne’s system O supplemented with negation rationality. Our results in this paper, show that a ‘size’-oriented interpretation of default reasoning is context-sensitive and in ‘most’ cases it departs from the preferential approach.},

  abstract     = {This paper suggests a new approach for repeated Stackelberg security games (SSGs) based on manipulation. Manipulation is a strategy interpreted by the Machiavellianism social behavior theory, which consists on three main concepts: view, tactics, and immorality. The world is conceptualized by manipulators and manipulated (view). Players employ Machiavelli’s tactics and Machiavellian intelligence in order to manipulate attacker/defender situations. The immorality plays a fundamental role in these games, defenders are able to not be attached to a conventional moral in order to achieve their goals. We consider a security game model involving manipulating defenders and manipulated attackers engaged cooperatively in a Nash game and at the same time restricted by a Stackelberg game. The resulting game is non-cooperative bargaining game. The cooperation is represented by the Nash bargaining solution. We propose an analytical formula for solving the manipulation game, which arises as the maximum of the quotient of two Nash products. The role of the players in the Stackelberg security game are determined by the weights of the players for the Nash bargaining approach. We consider only a subgame perfect equilibrium where the solution of the manipulation game is a Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium (SSE). We employ a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for the implementation of the immorality. A numerical example related to developing a strategic schedule for the efficient use of resources for patrolling in a smart city is handled using a class of homogeneous, ergodic, controllable, and finite Markov chains for showing the usefulness of the method for security resource allocation.},

We use the well-known Atkinson index to measure inequality and we focus on the distributed approach to multiagent resource allocation, where new allocations emerge as the result of a sequence of local deals between groups of agents who agree on an exchange of some of the items in their possession. Our results show that it is possible to design systems that provide theoretical guarantees for optimal outcomes that minimise inequality, but also that there are significant computational hurdles to be overcome in the worst case. In particular, finding an optimal allocation is computationally intractable and under the distributed approach a large number of structurally complex deals, possibly involving many agents and items, may be required before convergence to a socially optimal allocation. This remains true even in severely restricted resource allocation scenarios where all agents have the same utility function. From a methodological point of view, while much work in multiagent resource allocation relies on combinatorial arguments, here we instead use insights from basic calculus.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops a logical theory that unifies all three standard types of argumentative attack in AI, namely rebutting, undercutting and undermining attacks. We build on default justification logic that already represents undercutting and rebutting attacks, and we add undermining attacks. Intuitively, undermining does not target default inference, as undercutting, or default conclusion, as rebutting, but rather attacks an argument’s premise as a starting point for default reasoning. In default justification logic, reasoning starts from a set of premises, which is then extended by conclusions that hold by default. We argue that modeling undermining defeaters in the view of default theories requires changing the set of premises upon receiving new information. To model changes to premises, we give a dynamic aspect to default justification logic by using the techniques from the logic of belief revision. More specifically, undermining is modeled with belief revision operations that include contracting a set of premises, that is, removing some information from it. The novel combination of default reasoning and belief revision in justification logic enriches both approaches to reasoning under uncertainty. By the end of the paper, we show some important aspects of defeasible argumentation in which our logic compares favorably to structured argumentation frameworks.},

  abstract     = {Dependence Logic was introduced by Jouko Väänänen in 2007. We study a propositional variant of this logic (PDL) and investigate a variety of parameterisations with respect to central decision problems. The model checking problem (MC) of PDL is NP-complete (Ebbing and Lohmann, SOFSEM 2012). The subject of this research is to identify a list of parameterisations (formula-size, formula-depth, treewidth, team-size, number of variables) under which MC becomes fixed-parameter tractable. Furthermore, we show that the number of disjunctions or the arity of dependence atoms (dep-arity) as a parameter both yield a paraNP-completeness result. Then, we consider the satisfiability problem (SAT) which classically is known to be NP-complete as well (Lohmann and Vollmer, Studia Logica 2013). There we are presenting a different picture: under team-size, or dep-arity SAT is paraNP-complete whereas under all other mentioned parameters the problem is FPT. Finally, we introduce a variant of the satisfiability problem, asking for a team of a given size, and show for this problem an almost complete picture.},

  abstract     = {AI systems often need to deal with inconsistent information. For this reason, since the early 2000s, some AI researchers have developed ways to measure the amount of inconsistency in a knowledge base. By now there is a substantial amount of research about various aspects of inconsistency measuring. The problem is that most of this work applies only to knowledge bases formulated as sets of formulas in propositional logic. Hence this work is not really applicable to the way that information is actually stored. The purpose of this paper is to extend inconsistency measuring to real world information. We first define the concept of general information space which encompasses various types of databases and scenarios in AI systems. Then, we show how to transform any general information space to an inconsistency equivalent propositional knowledge base, and finally apply propositional inconsistency measures to find the inconsistency of the general information space. Our method allows for the direct comparison of the inconsistency of different information spaces, even though the data is presented in different ways. We demonstrate the transformation on four general information spaces: a relational database, a graph database, a spatio-temporal database, and a Blocks world scenario, where we apply several inconsistency measures after performing the transformation. Then we review so-called rationality postulates that have been developed for propositional knowledge bases as a way to judge the intuitive properties of these measures. We show that although general information spaces may be nonmonotonic, there is a way to transform the postulates so they can be applied to general information spaces and we show which of the measures satisfy which of the postulates. Finally, we discuss the complexity of inconsistency measures for general information spaces.},

  abstract     = {Conditionals are defeasible rules of the form If A then usually B, and they play a central role in many approaches to nonmonotonic reasoning. Normal forms of conditional knowledge bases consisting of a set of such conditionals are useful to create, process, and compare the knowledge represented by them. In this article, we propose several new normal forms for conditional knowledge bases. Compared to the previously introduced antecedent normal form, the reduced antecedent normal form (RANF) represents conditional knowledge with significantly fewer conditionals by taking nonmonotonic entailments licenced by system P into account. The renaming normal form (ρNF) addresses equivalences among conditional knowledge bases induced by renamings of the underlying signature. Combining the concept of renaming normal form with other normal forms yields the renaming antecedent normal form (ρ ANF) and the renaming reduced antecedent normal form (ρ RANF). For all newly introduced normal forms, we show their key properties regarding, existence, uniqueness, model equivalence, and inferential equivalence, and we develop algorithms transforming every conditional knowledge base into an equivalent knowledge base being in the respective normal form. For the most succinct normal form, the ρ RANF, we present an algorithm KBρra systematically generating knowledge bases over a given signature in ρ RANF. We show that the generated knowledge bases are consistent, pairwise not antecedentwise equivalent, and pairwise not equivalent under signature renaming. Furthermore, the algorithm is complete in the sense that, when taking signature renamings and model equivalence into account, every consistent knowledge base is generated. Observing that normalizing the set of all knowledge bases over a signature Σ to ρ RANF yields exactly the same result as KBρra (Σ), highlights the interrelationship between normal form transformations on the one hand and systematically generating knowledge bases in normal form on the other hand.},

  abstract     = {For nonmonotonic reasoning in the context of a knowledge base $\mathcal {R}$ containing conditionals of the form If A then usually B, system P provides generally accepted axioms. Inference solely based on system P, however, is inherently skeptical because it coincides with reasoning that takes all ranking models of $\mathcal {R}$ into account. System Z uses only the unique minimal ranking model of $\mathcal {R}$ , and c-inference, realized via a complex constraint satisfaction problem, takes all c-representations of $\mathcal {R}$ into account. C-representations constitute the subset of all ranking models of $\mathcal {R}$ that are obtained by assigning non-negative integer impacts to each conditional in $\mathcal {R}$ and summing up, for every world, the impacts of all conditionals falsified by that world. While system Z and c-inference license in general different sets of desirable entailments, the first major objective of this article is to present system W. System W fully captures and strictly extends both system Z and c-inference. Moreover, system W can be represented by a single strict partial order on the worlds over the signature of $\mathcal {R}$ . We show that system W exhibits further inference properties worthwhile for nonmonotonic reasoning, like satisfying the axioms of system P, respecting conditional indifference, and avoiding the drowning problem. The other main goal of this article is to provide results on our investigations, underlying the development of system W, of upper and lower bounds that can be used to restrict the set of c-representations that have to be taken into account for realizing c-inference. We show that the upper bound of n − 1 is sufficient for capturing c-inference with respect to $\mathcal {R}$ having n conditionals if there is at least one world verifying all conditionals in $\mathcal {R}$ . In contrast to the previous conjecture that the number of conditionals in $\mathcal {R}$ is always sufficient, we prove that there are knowledge bases requiring an upper bound of 2n− 1, implying that there is no polynomial upper bound of the impacts assigned to the conditionals in $\mathcal {R}$ for fully capturing c-inference.},

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to investigate the inner representation of DNNs through topological data analysis (TDA). Persistent homology (PH), one of the outstanding methods in TDA, was employed for investigating the complexities of trained DNNs. We constructed clique complexes on trained DNNs and calculated the one-dimensional PH of DNNs. The PH reveals the combinational effects of multiple neurons in DNNs at different resolutions, which is difficult to be captured without using PH. Evaluations were conducted using fully connected networks (FCNs) and networks combining FCNs and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets. Evaluation results demonstrate that the PH of DNNs reflects both the excess of neurons and problem difficulty, making PH one of the prominent methods for investigating the inner representation of DNNs.},

Two such popular algorithms exist to find good solutions to DCOP: DSA and GDBA. In this paper, we propose DSAB, a new algorithm that merges ideas from both algorithms to allow extensive handling of constraint privacy.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we discuss algorithms for the problem of finding read-once resolution refutations of unsatisfiable 2CNF formulas within the resolution refutation system. Broadly, a read-once resolution refutation is one in which each constraint (input or derived) is used at most once. Read-once resolution refutations have been widely studied in the literature for a number of constraint system-refutation system pairs. For instance, read-once resolution has been analyzed for boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form (CNF) and read-once cutting planes have been analyzed for polyhedral systems. By definition, read-once refutations are compact, and hence valuable in applications that place a premium on visualization. The satisfiability problem (SAT) is concerned with finding a satisfying assignment for a boolean formula in CNF. While SAT is NP-complete in general, there exist some interesting subclasses of CNF formulas, for which it is decidable in polynomial time. One such subclass is the class of 2CNF formulas, i.e., CNF formulas in which each clause has at most two literals. The existence of efficient algorithms for satisfiability checking in 2CNF formulas (2SAT), makes this class useful from the perspective of modeling selected logic programs. The work in this paper is concerned with the read-once refutability problem (under resolution) in this subclass. Although 2SAT is decidable in polynomial time, the problem of finding a read-once resolution refutation of an unsatisfiable 2CNF formula is NP-complete. We design non-trivial, parameterized and exact exponential algorithms for this problem. Additionally, we study the computational complexity of finding a shortest read-once resolution refutation of a 2CNF formula.},
