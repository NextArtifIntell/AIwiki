As a consequence, we get a new proof of the degree formula relating the degree of the surface, the degree of the parametrization, the base point multiplicity and the degree of the rational map induced by the parametrization. In addition, we extend both formulas to the case of dominant rational maps of the projective plane and describe how the base point loci of a parametrization and its reparametrizations are related. As an application of these results, we explore how the degree of a surface reparametrization is affected by the presence of base points.},

In the complex setting, Simpson shows that there is a complex analytic morphism from the moduli space for the vector bundles with integrable connection to the moduli space of representations of a finitely generated group as algebraic varieties.

  abstract     = {When milling part surfaces with a ball-end tool in 5-axis CNC machining, maintaining a constant cutting speed by keeping a fixed inclination angle between the tool axis and surface normal is crucial to ensure safe operation and achieve high quality of the machined surface. Under this constraint, the variation of tool orientation is expected to be “smoothest possible” to reduce the angular speed of the rotary axes for the efficient and robust machining. To address this issue, the spatial tractrix which is the extension of classic tractrix is presented to establish the geometry model of the tool orientation kinematics in the part coordinate system. The proposed model describes the relations between the tilt angle and the variation of ball-end tool orientation. Two spatial tractrix-based methods, synchronizing tractrix-based method and equilibrating tractrix-based method, are developed to minimize the variation of tool orientation by controlling the variation of tilt angle. These methods are used to plan the tool orientation on a part surface modeled by a bicubic spline surface. The performance evaluation carried by intense simulations demonstrates the equilibrating tractrix-based method provide the best results in most cases compared with the existing differential geometry-based methods such as the tractrix-based method and parallel transport method. The synchronizing tractrix-based method works well in some special cases.},

  abstract     = {Experimental design is an effective statistical tool that is extensively applied in modern industry, engineering, and science. It is proved that experimental design is a powerful and efficient means to screen the relationships between input factors and their responses, and to distinguish significant and unimportant factor effects. In many practical situations, experimenters are faced with large experiments having four-level factors. Even though there are several techniques provided to design such experiments, the challenge faced by the experimenters is still daunting. The practice has demonstrated that the existing techniques are highly time-consuming optimization procedures, satisfactory outcomes are not guaranteed, and non-mathematicians face a significant challenge in dealing with them. A new technique that can overcome these defects of the existing techniques is presented in this paper. The results demonstrated that the proposed technique outperformed the current techniques in terms of construction simplicity, computational efficiency and achieving satisfactory results capability. For non-mathematician experimenters, the new technique is much easier and simpler than the current techniques, as it allows them to design optimal large experiments without the recourse to optimization softwares. The optimality is discussed from four basic perspectives: maximizing the dissimilarity among experimental runs, maximizing the number of independent factors, minimizing the confounding among factors, and filling the experimental domain uniformly with as few gaps as possible.},

The 2D and 3D numerical experiments show that the proposed method has an accuracy rate of over 97% for the final optimization results. After training, the new approach can save time greatly for the new topology optimization compared with traditional solid isotropic material with penalization method and IGA method.

One of these measures is logarithmic, while others contains the power of variables, named as joint representation of Renyi’s–Tsallis divergence measure. Then, we propose a divergence measure based on Jensen–Renyi’s–Tsallis entropy which is known as a Jensen–Renyi’s–Tsallis divergence measure. It is a generalization of J-divergence information measure. One of the silent features of this measure is that we can allot the equal weight to each probability distribution. This makes it specifically reasonable for the study of decision problems, where the weights could be the prior probabilities. Further, the idea has been generalized from probabilistic to fuzzy similarity/dissimilarity measure. Besides the validation of the proposed measure, some of its key properties are also studied. Further, the performance of the proposed measure is contrasted with some existing measures.

The estimation herein is based on complete and censored samples. Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation is used to discuss the behavior of the estimators for each approach.

To handle the identifiability issue, we take a time-independent covariate as nonresponse instrument which is independent of nonresponse propensity conditioned on other covariates and responses to ensure the identifiability of nonresponse propensity. The nonresponse propensity is assumed to be a parametric model, and the corresponding parameters are estimated by using the generalized method of moments approach. Then the marginal response means are estimated by inverse probability weighting method. Furthermore, to improve the robustness of estimators, we derive an augmented inverse probability weighting estimator which is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. Simulation studies and a real-data analysis show that the proposed approach yields highly efficient estimators.},

The unimodality of initial B-spline approximations associated with given data is a promising characteristic of locating optimal knots and has been applied successfully. The initial B-spline approximations herein are required to approximate given data well enough and characterized by the unimodality if jumps from the highest-order derivatives of the approximations at some interior knots are local maxima. In this paper, we prove the unimodality of the initial B-spline approximations that are constructed under two assumptions: Data points are sampled uniformly and sufficiently from B-spline functions, and initial knots are chosen as the parameters of sampling points. Our work establishes the theoretical basis of the unimodality of initial B-spline approximations and pioneers the theoretical study of locating optimal knots.},

Yet its complexity for systems subject to the white noise remains significant. The issue appears due to the fact that the random increments generated by the Brownian motion result in a growing set of random variables with respect to which the process could be measured. In order to cope with this high dimensionality, we present a novel transformation of stochastic processes driven by the white noise. In particular, we show that under suitable assumptions, the diffusion arising from white noise can be cast into a logarithmic gradient induced by the measure of the process. Through this transformation, the resulting equation describes a stochastic process whose randomness depends only on the initial condition. Therefore, the stochasticity of the transformed system lives in the initial condition and it can be treated conveniently with chaos expansion tools.},

The model analysis shows that the model has two equilibria which are named as disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and endemic equilibrium (EE). The stability analysis has been performed for the local and global behavior of the DFE and EE. With the help of the basic reproduction number $$ \left( {R_{0} } \right) $$ , we investigate that DFE is locally asymptotically stable when $$ R_{0} &lt; 1 $$ and unstable when $$ R_{0} &gt; 1 $$ . The local stability of DFE at $$ R_{0} = 1 $$ has been analyzed, and it is obtained that DFE exhibits a forward transcritical bifurcation. Further, we identify conditions for the existence of EE and show the local stability of EE under certain conditions. Moreover, the global stability behavior of DFE and EE has been investigated.

Recently, large-scale geometry data become more and more available, and the learned geometry priors have been successfully applied to 3D computer vision and computer graphics fields. Different from the regular representation of images, surface meshes have irregular structures with different vertex numbers and topologies. Therefore, the traditional convolution neural networks used for images cannot be directly used to handle surface meshes, and thus, many methods have been proposed to solve this problem. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of existing geometric deep learning methods for mesh processing. We first introduce the relevant knowledge and theoretical background of geometric deep learning and some basic mesh data knowledge, including some commonly used mesh datasets. Then, we review various deep learning models for mesh data with two different types: graph-based methods and mesh structure-based methods. We also review the deep learning-based applications for mesh data. In the final, we give some potential research directions in this field.},

Both the influence of high-dimensional parameters and measurement errors need to be considered to avoid severely biases. We consider the problem of variable selection in error-in-variables and introduce the DCoCoLasso-FDP procedure, a new variable selection method. By constructing the consistent estimator of false discovery proportion (FDP) and false discovery rate (FDR), our method can prioritize the important variables and control FDP and FDR at a specifical level in error-in-variables models. An extensive simulation study is conducted to compare DCoCoLasso-FDP procedure with existing methods in various settings, and numerical results are provided to present the efficiency of our method.},

  abstract     = {One of the important issues in order to survey multivariate distribution or model dependency structure between interested variables is finding the proper copula function. Extensive studies have been done based on Akaike information criterion (AIC), copula information criterion (CIC), and pseudo-likelihood ratio and fitness test of the copula function. The previous methods of selecting copula functions when the sample size is too small are not satisfactory. Therefore, our method in this paper is based on tracking interval for the parametric copula function which is obtained using expected Kullback–Leibler risk between the two proposed non-nested parametric copula model. It can be find that optimal parametric copula between proposed copula functions in a good level of significance. Finally, efficiency and capability of our method using simulation and applied example have been shown.},

In this model, the suitable number of fuzzy sets and their specific elements are determined automatically. In addition, using the percentage variations of series between consecutive periods of time, we build the fuzzy function. Incorporating all these improvements, we have a new fuzzy time series model that is better than many existing ones through the well-known data sets. The calculation of the proposed model can be performed conveniently and efficiently by a MATLAB procedure . The proposed model is also used in forecasting for an urgent problem in Vietnam. This application also shows the advantages of the proposed model and illustrates its effectiveness in practical application.},

  abstract     = {Consider n nodes $$\{X_i\}_{1 \le i \le n}$$ independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) across N cities located within the unit square S. Each city is modelled as an $$r_n \times r_n$$ square, and $$\mathrm{{MSTC}}_n$$ denotes the weighted length of the minimum spanning tree containing all the n nodes, where the edge length between nodes $$X_i$$ and $$X_j$$ is weighted by a factor that depends on the individual locations of $$X_i$$ and $$X_j.$$ We use approximation methods to obtain variance estimates for $$\mathrm{{MSTC}}_n$$ and prove that if the cities are well connected in a certain sense, then $$\mathrm{{MSTC}}_n$$ appropriately centred and scaled converges to zero in probability. Using the above proof techniques we also study $$\mathrm{{MST}}_n,$$ the length of the minimum weighted spanning tree for nodes distributed throughout the unit square S with location-dependent edge weights. In this case, the variance of $$\mathrm{{MST}}_n$$ grows at most as a power of the logarithm of n and we use a subsequence argument to get almost sure convergence of $$\mathrm{{MST}}_n,$$ appropriately centred and scaled.},
