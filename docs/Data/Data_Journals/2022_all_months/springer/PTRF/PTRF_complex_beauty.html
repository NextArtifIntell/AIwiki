  abstract     = {Among probability measures on d-dimensional real projective space, one which maximizes the expected angle $$\arccos (\frac{x}{|x|}\cdot \frac{y}{|y|})$$ between independently drawn projective points x and y was conjectured to equidistribute its mass over the standard Euclidean basis $$\{e_0,e_1,\ldots , e_d\}$$ by Fejes Tóth (Acta Math Acad Sci Hung 10:13–19, 1959. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02063286 ). If true, this conjecture evidently implies the same measure maximizes the expectation of $$\arccos ^\alpha (\frac{x}{|x|}\cdot \frac{y}{|y|})$$ for any exponent $$\alpha &gt; 1$$ . The kernel $$\arccos ^\alpha (\frac{x}{|x|}\cdot \frac{y}{|y|})$$ represents the objective of an infinite-dimensional quadratic program. We verify discrete and continuous versions of this milder conjecture in a non-empty range $$\alpha &gt; \alpha _{\Delta ^d} \ge 1$$ , and establish uniqueness of the resulting maximizer $${\hat{\mu }}$$ up to rotation. We show $${\hat{\mu }}$$ no longer maximizes when $$\alpha &lt;\alpha _{\Delta ^d}$$ . At the endpoint $$\alpha =\alpha _{\Delta ^d}$$ of this range, we show another maximizer $$\mu $$ must also exist which is not a rotation of $${\hat{\mu }}$$ . For the continuous version of the conjecture, an “Appendix A” provided by Bilyk et al in response to an earlier draft of this work combines with the present improvements to yield $$\alpha _{\Delta ^d}&lt;2$$ . The original conjecture $${\alpha _{\Delta ^d}}=1$$ remains open (unless $$d=1$$ ). However, in the maximum possible range $$\alpha &gt;1$$ , we show $${\hat{\mu }}$$ and its rotations maximize the aforementioned expectation uniquely on a sufficiently small ball in the $$L^\infty $$ -Kantorovich–Rubinstein–Wasserstein metric $$d_\infty $$ from optimal transportation; the same is true for any measure $$\mu $$ which is mutually absolutely continuous with respect to $${\hat{\mu }}$$ , but the size of the ball depends on $$\alpha ,d$$ , and $$\Vert \frac{d {\hat{\mu }}}{d\mu }\Vert _{\infty }$$ .},

We assume some second-moment conditions and that the above randomness is left invariant by the action of the group $$\mathbb {G}=\mathbb {R}^d$$ or $$\mathbb {G}=\mathbb {Z}^d$$ . We then add a site-exclusion interaction, thus making the particle system a simple exclusion process. We show that, for almost all environments, under diffusive space–time rescaling the system exhibits a hydrodynamic limit in path space. The hydrodynamic equation is non-random and governed by the effective homogenized matrix D of the single random walk, which can be degenerate. The above result covers a very large family of models including e.g. simple exclusion processes built from random conductance models on $$\mathbb {Z}^d$$ and on crystal lattices (possibly with long conductances), Mott variable range hopping, simple random walks on Delaunay triangulations, random walks on supercritical percolation clusters.},

It is well-known that when the drift $$ {\mathsf {b}}$$ , the diffusion matrix $$ {\mathsf {a}}$$ and the scalar potential V are regular enough and not growing too fast, the classical solution g of this PDE, is represented by the Feynman-Kac formula $$ g_t(x)=E_R[\exp \left( \int _{[t,T]} V(s,X_s)\,ds\right) g(X_T)\mid X_t=x] $$ where R is the Markov measure with generator $$ {\mathsf {L}}$$ . We do not assume that g, $$ {\mathsf {b}}$$ and V are regular, and only require that their growth is controlled by a finite entropy condition. These hypotheses are less restrictive than the standard assumptions of the theory of viscosity solutions, and allow for instance V to belong to some Kato class. We prove that g defined by the Feynman-Kac formula belongs to the domain of the extended generator $$ {\mathcal {L}}$$ of the Markov measure R and satisfies the trajectorial identity: $$ [({\mathcal {L}} +V)g] (t,X_t)=0,\ dtdP\text {-}{a.e.}$$ where the path measure P is defined by $$ P:= f(X_0)\exp \left( \int _{[0,T]}V(t,X_t)\,dt\right) g(X_T)\ R, $$ with $$ f:{\mathbb {R}}^n\rightarrow [0, \infty )$$ another nonnegative function. We also show that the forward drift $$ {\mathsf {b}}^P$$ of P satisfies $$ {\mathsf {b}}^P(t,X_t)=[ {\mathsf {b}}+ {\mathsf {a}}{\widetilde{\nabla }}\log g](t,X_t),$$ $$dtdP\text {-}{a.e.},$$ where $${\widetilde{\nabla }}$$ is some extension of the standard derivative.

There is an explicit formula for the expected number of $$(k-1)$$ -dimensional faces of $$C_{n,d}$$ which involves Stirling numbers of both kinds. Motivated by this formula, we introduce a distribution, called the Lah distribution, and study its properties. In particular, we provide a combinatorial interpretation of the Lah distribution in terms of random compositions and records, and explicitly compute its factorial moments. Limit theorems which we prove for the Lah distribution imply neighborliness properties of $$C_{n,d}$$ .

These results are similar to those of Chung et al. (Ann Probab 15(3):1148–1165, 1987) on the so-called Chung–Diaconis–Graham process, which corresponds to the case $$d=1$$ . Our proof is based on the initial arguments of Chung, Diaconis and Graham, and relies extensively on the properties of the dynamical system $$x \mapsto A^{\top } x$$ on the continuous torus $$\mathbb {R}^{d} / \mathbb {Z}^{d}$$ . Having no eigenvalue of modulus one makes this dynamical system a hyperbolic toral automorphism, a typical example of a chaotic system known to have a rich behaviour. As such our proof sheds new light on the speed-up gained by applying a deterministic map to a Markov chain.},

  abstract     = {Lott–Sturm–Villani theory of curvature on geodesic spaces has been extended to discrete graph spaces by C. Léonard by replacing $$W_2$$ -Wasserstein geodesics by Schrödinger bridges in the definition of entropic curvature (Léonard in Discrete Contin Dyn Syst A 34(4):1533–1574, 2014; Ann Probab 44(3):1864–1915, 2016; in: Gigli N (ed) Measure theory in non-smooth spaces. Sciendo Migration,Warsaw, pp 194–242, 2017). As a remarkable fact, as a temperature parameter goes to zero, these Schrödinger bridges are supported by geodesics of the space. We analyse this property on discrete graphs to reach entropic curvature on discrete spaces. Our approach provides lower bounds for the entropic curvature for several examples of graph spaces: the lattice $$\mathbb {Z}^n$$ endowed with the counting measure, the discrete cube endowed with product probability measures, the circle, the complete graph, the Bernoulli–Laplace model. Our general results also apply to a large class of graphs which are not specifically studied in this paper. As opposed to Erbar–Maas results on graphs (Erbar and Maas in Arch Ration Mech Anal 206(3):997–1038, 2012; Discrete Contin Dyn Syst A 34(4):1355–1374, 2014; Maas in J Funct Anal 261(8):2250–2292, 2011), entropic curvature results of this paper imply new Prékopa–Leindler type of inequalities on discrete spaces, and new transport-entropy inequalities related to refined concentration properties for the graphs mentioned above. For example on the discrete hypercube $$\{0,1\}^n$$ and for the Bernoulli Laplace model, a new $$W_2-W_1$$ transport-entropy inequality is reached, that can not be derived by usual induction arguments over the dimension n. As a surprising fact, our method also gives improvements of weak transport-entropy inequalities (see Gozlan et al. in J Funct Anal 273(11):3327–3405, 2017) associated to the so-called convex-hull method by Talagrand (Publ Math l’Inst Hautes Etudes Sci 81(1):73–205, 1995).},

As a corollary, we deduce that the negative moments of imaginary chaos on the unit circle do not correspond to the analytic continuation of the Fyodorov-Bouchaud formula, even when well-defined. Somewhat surprisingly, basic density results are not easy to prove for imaginary chaos and one of the main contributions of the article is introducing Malliavin calculus to the study of (complex) multiplicative chaos. To apply Malliavin calculus to imaginary chaos, we develop a new decomposition theorem for non-degenerate log-correlated fields via a small detour to operator theory, and obtain small ball probabilities for Sobolev norms of imaginary chaos.},

They have a geometric interpretation as branched covers of the sphere and their enumeration as Hurwitz numbers was extensively studied in algebraic combinatorics and enumerative geometry. On the probabilistic side, several models and properties of permutation factorizations were studied in previous works, in particular minimal factorizations of cycles into transpositions (which corresponds to the case $$g=0$$ of this work). Using the representation of factorizations via unicellular maps, we first exhibit an algorithm which samples an asymptotically uniform factorization of genus g in linear time. In a second time, we code a factorization as a process of chords appearing one by one in the unit disk, and we prove the convergence (as $$n\rightarrow \infty $$ ) of the process associated with a uniform genus g factorization of the n-cycle. The limit process can be explicitly constructed from a Brownian excursion. Finally, we establish the convergence of a natural genus process, coding the appearance of the successive genera in the factorization.},

  abstract     = {Large deviation behavior of the largest eigenvalue $$\lambda _1$$ of Wigner matrices including those arising from an Erdős-Rényi random graph $${\mathcal {G}}_{n,p}$$ with i.i.d. random conductances on the edges has been the topic of considerable interest. However, despite several recent advances, not much is known when the underlying graph is sparse i.e., $$p\rightarrow 0$$ , except the recent works (Bhattacharya et al., Ann Probab 49(4):1847–1885, 2021and Bhattacharya and Ganguly, SIAM J Discret Math, 2020) which consider the simpler case of the graph without additional edge weights. Under sufficiently general conditions on the conductance distribution, one expects the ‘dense’ behavior as long as the average degree np is at least logarithmic in n. In this article we focus on the case of constant average degree i.e., $$p=\frac{d}{n}$$ for some fixed $$d&gt;0$$ with standard Gaussian weights. Results in Bandeira and Van Handel (Ann Probab 44(4):2479–2506, 2016) about general non-homogeneous Gaussian matrices imply that in this regime $$\lambda _1$$ scales like $$\sqrt{\log n}.$$ We prove the following results towards a precise understanding of the large deviation behavior in this setting. As an immediate corollary, one obtains that $$\lambda _1$$ is typically $$(1+o(1))\sqrt{2\log n}$$ , a result which surprisingly appears to be new. A key ingredient in our proofs is an extremal spectral theory for weighted graphs obtained by an $$\ell _1-$$ reduction of the standard $$\ell _2-$$ variational formulation of the largest eigenvalue via the classical Motzkin-Straus theorem [37], which could be of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {Suppose that red and blue points form independent homogeneous Poisson processes of equal intensity in \({{\mathbb {R}}}^d\) . For a positive (respectively, negative) parameter \(\gamma \) we consider red-blue matchings that locally minimize (respectively, maximize) the sum of \(\gamma \) th powers of the edge lengths, subject to locally minimizing the number of unmatched points. The parameter can be viewed as a measure of fairness. The limit \(\gamma \rightarrow -\infty \) is equivalent to Gale-Shapley stable matching. We also consider limits as \(\gamma \) approaches 0, \(1-\) , \(1+\) and \(\infty \) . We focus on dimension \(d=1\) . We prove that almost surely no such matching has unmatched points. (This question is open for higher d ). For each \(\gamma &lt;1\) we establish that there is almost surely a unique such matching, and that it can be expressed as a finitary factor of the points. Moreover, its typical edge length has finite r th moment if and only if \(r&lt;1/2\) . In contrast, for \(\gamma =1\) there are uncountably many matchings, while for \(\gamma &gt;1\) there are countably many, but it is impossible to choose one in a translation-invariant way. We obtain existence results in higher dimensions (covering many but not all cases). We address analogous questions for one-colour matchings also.},

Because of these new parameters the previously known results about vertex models cannot be directly applied, but nevertheless the integrability remains, and we prove explicit integral expressions for q-deformed moments of the (colored) height functions of the model. Following known techniques our model can be interpreted as a q-discretization of the Beta polymer model from (Probab Theory Relat Fields 167(3):1057–1116 (2017). arXiv:1503.04117 ) with a new family of parameters, also attached to diagonals.

For a proper hyperbolic space M, we obtain explicit bounds that depend only on M, the size of support of the measure as in the classical case of sums of independent random variables, and on the norm of the driving probability measure in the left regular representation of the group of isometries. We obtain uniform bounds in the case of hyperbolic groups and effective bounds for simple linear groups of rank-one. In a second part, using our concentration inequalities, we give quantitative finite-time estimates on the probability that two independent random walks on the isometry group of a hyperbolic space generate a free non-abelian subgroup. Our concentration results follow from a more general, but less explicit statement that we prove for cocycles which satisfy a certain cohomological equation. For example, this also allows us to obtain subgaussian concentration bounds around the top Lyapunov exponent of random matrix products in arbitrary dimension.},

A general spectral criterion is provided for the absorbing time to be close to an exponential random variable, whatever the starting point. When exiting points are added to the state space, our criterion also insures that the exit time and position are almost independent. Since this is valid for any exiting extension of the state space, it corresponds to an instance of the metastability phenomenon. Simple examples at small temperature suggest that this new spectral criterion is quite sharp. But the main interest of the underlying quantitative approach, based on Poisson equations, is that it does not rely on a small parameter such as temperature, nor on reversibility.},

The natural candidate for the large-N limit of the empirical distribution of eigenvalues is thus the Brown measure of $$b_{t}$$ . In previous work, the second and third authors showed that this Brown measure is supported in the closure of a region $$\Sigma _{t}$$ that appeared in the work of Biane. In the present paper, we compute the Brown measure completely. It has a continuous density $$W_{t}$$ on $$\overline{\Sigma }_{t},$$ which is strictly positive and real analytic on $$\Sigma _{t}$$ . This density has a simple form in polar coordinates: $$\begin{aligned} W_{t}(r,\theta )=\frac{1}{r^{2}}w_{t}(\theta ), \end{aligned}$$ where $$w_{t}$$ is an analytic function determined by the geometry of the region $$\Sigma _{t}$$ . We show also that the spectral measure of free unitary Brownian motion $$u_{t}$$ is a “shadow” of the Brown measure of $$b_{t}$$ , precisely mirroring the relationship between the circular and semicircular laws. We develop several new methods, based on stochastic differential equations and PDE, to prove these results.},

They proved this conjecture for $$\log n\ll d\leqslant n^{1/3-o(1)}$$ , with a defect in the sandwiching: $${\mathscr {G}}(n,d)$$ contains $${\mathscr {G}}(n,p_1)$$ perfectly, but is not completely contained in $${\mathscr {G}}(n,p_2)$$ .

In this paper, we prove Kim–Vu’s sandwich conjecture, with perfect containment on both sides, for all d where $$\min \{d, n-d\}\gg n/\sqrt{\log n}$$ . The sandwich theorem allows translation of many results from $${\mathscr {G}}(n,p)$$ to $${\mathscr {G}}(n,d)$$ such as Hamiltonicity, the chromatic number, the diameter, etc. It also allows translation of threshold functions of phase transitions from $${\mathscr {G}}(n,p)$$ to bond percolation of $${\mathscr {G}}(n,d)$$ . In addition to sandwiching regular graphs, our results cover graphs whose degrees are asymptotically equal. The proofs rely on estimates for the probability of small subgraph appearances in a random factor of a pseudorandom graph, which is of independent interest.},

We consider two different types of boundary rates: the “Liggett boundaries” that correspond to the projection of the infinite dynamics, and the reversible boundaries, that correspond to the contact with particle reservoirs in equilibrium. The proof is based on the control of the Lax boundary entropy–entropy flux pairs and a coupling argument.},

Every particle jumps with a jump rate depending on its position and on the empirical measure of the system. Jumps are simultaneous, that is, at each jump time, all particles of the system are affected by this jump and receive a random jump height that is centred and scaled in $$N^{-1/2}$$ . This particular scaling implies that the limit of the empirical measures of the system is random, describing the conditional distribution of one particle in the limit system. We call such limits conditional McKean–Vlasov limits. The conditioning in the limit measure reflects the dependencies between coexisting particles in the limit system such that we are dealing with a conditional propagation of chaos property. As a consequence of the scaling in $$N^{-1/2}$$ and of the fact that the limit of the empirical measures is not deterministic the limit system turns out to be solution of a non-linear SDE, where not independent martingale measures and white noises appear having an intensity that depends on the conditional law of the process.},

We show that the deviation-optimal minimax sub-Gaussian rate for confidence $$1-\delta $$ is $$\begin{aligned} \max \left( \frac{\ell ^*(\Sigma ^{1/2}S)}{\sqrt{N}}, \sup _{v\in S}\left\| \Sigma ^{1/2}v\right\| _2\sqrt{\frac{\log (1/\delta )}{N}}\right) \end{aligned}$$ where $$\ell ^*(\Sigma ^{1/2}S)$$ is the Gaussian mean width of $$\Sigma ^{1/2}S$$ and $$\Sigma $$ the covariance of the data. This improves the entropic minimax lower bound from Lugosi and Mendelson (Probab Theory Relat Fields 175(3–4):957–973, 2019) and closes the gap characterized by Sudakov’s inequality between the entropy and the Gaussian mean width for this problem. This shows that the right statistical complexity measure for the mean estimation problem is the Gaussian mean width. We also show that this rate can be achieved by a solution to a convex optimization problem in the adversarial and $$L_2$$ heavy-tailed setup by considering minimum of some Fenchel–Legendre transforms constructed using the median-of-means principle. We finally show that this rate may also be achieved in situations where there is not even a first moment but a location parameter exists.},

We define the notion of Gaussian processes, Brownian motion and stochastic (partial) differential equations taking values in Grassmann algebras. We use them to study the long time behavior of finite and infinite dimensional Langevin Grassmann stochastic differential equations driven by Gaussian space-time white noise and to describe their invariant measures.

Our results form a comprehensive high-dimensional analogue of well-known phenomena related to connectivity in the Erdős-Rényi graph and random geometric graphs. We first prove that there is a sequence of sharp phase transitions describing homological connectivity in different dimensions. Next, we analyze the behavior of the complex inside each of the critical windows. We show that the cycles obstructing homological connectivity have a very unique and simple shape. In addition, we prove that the process counting the last obstructions converges to a Poisson process. We make a heavy use of Morse theory, and its adaptation to distance functions. In particular, our results classify the critical points of random distance functions according to their exact effect on homology.},

The connection between extreme values and the geometric action is mediated by the action of the group G on its limit set equipped with the Patterson–Sullivan measure. Based on motivation from extreme value theory, we introduce an invariant of the action called extremal cocycle growth which measures the distortion of measures on the boundary in comparison to the movement of points in the space X and show that its non-vanishing is equivalent to finiteness of the Bowen–Margulis measure for the associated unit tangent bundle U(X/G) provided X/G has non-arithmetic length spectrum. As a consequence, we establish a dichotomy for the growth-rate of a partial maxima sequence of stationary symmetric $$\alpha $$ -stable ( $$0&lt; \alpha &lt; 2$$ ) random fields indexed by groups acting on such spaces. We also establish analogous results for normal subgroups of free groups.},

  abstract     = {Many correlation inequalities for high-dimensional functions in the literature, such as the Harris–Kleitman inequality, the Fortuin–Kasteleyn–Ginibre inequality and the celebrated Gaussian Correlation Inequality of Royen, are qualitative statements which establish that any two functions of a certain type have non-negative correlation. Previous work has used Markov semigroup arguments to obtain quantitative extensions of some of these correlation inequalities. In this work, we augment this approach with a new extremal bound on power series, proved using tools from complex analysis, to obtain a range of new and near-optimal quantitative correlation inequalities. These new results include: A quantitative version of Royen’s celebrated Gaussian Correlation Inequality (Royen, 2014). In (Royen, 2014) Royen confirmed a conjecture, open for 40 years, stating that any two symmetric convex sets must be non-negatively correlated under any centered Gaussian distribution. We give a lower bound on the correlation in terms of the vector of degree-2 Hermite coefficients of the two convex sets, conceptually similar to Talagrand’s quantitative correlation bound for monotone Boolean functions over $$\{0,1\}^n$$ (Talagrand in Combinatorica 16(2):243–258, 1996). We show that our quantitative version of Royen’s theorem is within a logarithmic factor of being optimal. A quantitative version of the well-known FKG inequality for monotone functions over any finite product probability space. This is a broad generalization of Talagrand’s quantitative correlation bound for functions from $$\{0,1\}^n$$ to $$\{0,1\}$$ under the uniform distribution (Talagrand in Combinatorica 16(2):243–258, 1996). In the special case of p-biased distributions over $$\{0,1\}^n$$ that was considered by Keller, our new bound essentially saves a factor of $$p \log (1/p)$$ over the quantitative bounds given in Keller (Eur J Comb 33:1943–1957, 2012; Improved FKG inequality for product measures on the discrete cube, 2008; Influences of variables on Boolean functions. PhD thesis, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2009).},

After remarking that this problem is degenerate for a large class of standard losses ( $$L_p$$ , Hellinger, total variation, etc.), we focus on the Wasserstein loss, for which we build an estimator, based on kernel density estimation, whose rate of convergence depends on d and the regularity $$s\le k-1$$ of the underlying density, but not on the ambient dimension. In particular, we show that the estimator is minimax and matches previous rates in the literature in the case where the manifold M is a d-dimensional cube. The related problem of the estimation of the volume measure of M for the Wasserstein loss is also considered, for which a minimax estimator is exhibited.},

The model is defined on $${\mathbb {Z}}^d$$ by passing to the limit for a sequence of finite volume models with general boundary conditions. Several questions and problems are investigated: existence, uniqueness, phase transition, DLR equations. Our main result involves the existence of a threshold $$0&lt;p^*(d)&lt;1$$ such that any infinite volume model is necessary the vacuum state in subcritical regime (no open edges) and is non trivial in the supercritical regime (existence of a stationary unbounded connected cluster). Bounds for $$p^*(d)$$ are given and show that it is drastically smaller than the standard bond percolation threshold in $${\mathbb {Z}}^d$$ .

  abstract     = {This paper has two main goals. The first is universality of the KPZ equation for fluctuations of dynamic interfaces associated to interacting particle systems in the presence of open boundary. We consider generalizations on the open-ASEP from Corwin and Shen (Commun Pure Appl Math 71(10):2065–2128, 2018), Parekh (Commun Math Phys 365:569–649, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00220-018-3258-x ). but admitting non-simple interactions both at the boundary and within the bulk of the particle system. These variations on open-ASEP are not integrable models, similar to the long-variations on ASEP considered in Dembo and Tsai (Commun Math Phys 341(1):219–261, 2016), Yang (Kardar–Parisi–Zhang equation from long-range exclusion processes, 2020. arXiv:2002.05176 [math.PR]). We establish the KPZ equation with the appropriate Robin boundary conditions as scaling limits for height function fluctuations associated to these non-integrable models, providing further evidence for the aforementioned universality of the KPZ equation. We specialize to compact domains and address non-compact domains in a second paper (Yang in KPZ equation from non-simple dynamics with boundary in the non-compact regime). The procedure that we employ to establish the aforementioned theorem is the second main point of this paper. Invariant measures in the presence of boundary interactions generally lack reasonable descriptions. Thus, global analyses done through the invariant measure, including the theory of energy solutions in Goncalves and Jara (Arch Ration Mech Anal 212:597, 2014), Goncalves and Jara (Stoch Process Appl 127(12):4029–4052, 2017), Goncalves et al. (Ann Probab 43(1):286–338, 2015), is immediately obstructed. To circumvent this obstruction, we appeal to the almost entirely local nature of the analysis in Yang (2020).},

Then, given approximating marginal measures $$\tilde{\mu }\approx \mu , \tilde{\nu }\approx \nu $$ in convex order, we show that there exists an approximating martingale coupling $$\tilde{\pi }\approx \pi $$ with marginals $$\tilde{\mu }, \tilde{\nu }$$ . In mathematical finance, prices of European call/put option yield information on the marginal measures of the arbitrage free pricing measures. The above result asserts that small variations of call/put prices lead only to small variations on the level of arbitrage free pricing measures. While these facts have been anticipated for some time, the actual proof requires somewhat intricate stability results for the adapted Wasserstein distance. Notably the result has consequences for several related problems. Specifically, it is relevant for numerical approximations, it leads to a new proof of the monotonicity principle of martingale optimal transport and it implies stability of weak martingale optimal transport as well as optimal Skorokhod embedding. On the mathematical finance side this yields continuity of the robust pricing problem for exotic options and VIX options with respect to market data.

Second, using a result of Pajor, the supremum of the process is lower bounded in terms of packing numbers by means of mixed-volume inequalities (Minkowski’s first inequality).},

We prove, without any further assumption on the base graph $${\mathcal {G}}$$ , that the capacity of sign clusters on $$\widetilde{{\mathcal {G}}}$$ is finite almost surely. This leads to a new and effective criterion to determine whether the sign clusters of the free field on $$\widetilde{{\mathcal {G}}}$$ are bounded or not. It also elucidates why the critical parameter for percolation of level sets on $$\widetilde{{\mathcal {G}}}$$ vanishes in most instances in the massless case and establishes the continuity of this phase transition in a wide range of cases, including all vertex-transitive graphs. When the sign clusters on $$\widetilde{{\mathcal {G}}}$$ do not percolate, we further determine by means of isomorphism theory the exact law of the capacity of compact clusters at any height. Specifically, we derive this law from an extension of Sznitman’s refinement of Lupu’s recent isomorphism theorem relating the free field and random interlacements, proved along the way, and which holds under the sole assumption that sign clusters on $$\widetilde{{\mathcal {G}}}$$ are bounded. Finally, we show that the law of the cluster capacity functionals obtained in this way actually characterizes the isomorphism theorem, i.e. the two are equivalent.},

We show that as the dimension tends to infinity, the spectral radius is equivalent to the square root of the dimension in probability. This result can also be seen as the convergence of the support in the circular law theorem under optimal moment conditions. In the proof we establish the convergence in law of the reciprocal characteristic polynomial to a random analytic function outside the unit disc, related to a hyperbolic Gaussian analytic function. The proof is short and differs from the usual approaches for the spectral radius. It relies on a tightness argument and a joint central limit phenomenon for traces of fixed powers.},

For a class of initial conditions satisfying certain technical assumptions, we are able to derive large-time, large-period limit of the joint distribution, under the relaxation time scale $$t=O(L^{3/2})$$ when the height fluctuations are critically affected by the finite geometry. The assumptions are verified for the step and flat initial conditions.

The special case when $$H(\rho )=\frac{\rho ^2}{2}$$ (Burgers equation) has in particular received extensive interest in the past and is now understood for various random initial conditions. We prove in this paper a conjecture on the profile of the solution at any time $$t&gt;0$$ for a general class of Hamiltonians H and show that it is a stationary piecewise-smooth Feller process. Along the way, we study the excursion process of the two-sided linear Brownian motion W below any strictly convex function $$\phi $$ with superlinear growth and derive a generalized Chernoff distribution of the random variable $$\text {argmax}_{z \in {\mathbb {R}}} (W(z)-\phi (z))$$ . Finally, when $$\rho (\cdot ,0)$$ is a white noise derived from an abrupt Lévy process, we show that the structure of shocks of the solution is a.s discrete at any fixed time $$t&gt;0$$ under some mild assumptions on H.},

In the case of a metric ball boundary, our result combined with earlier work of Gwynne (Commun Math Phys 378(1):625–689, 2020. arXiv:1909.08588 ) gives a formula for the a.s.

Our proof is based on the potential theoretic approach to metastability through accurate estimation of the capacity between metastable valleys. We carry out this estimation by developing a novel method to compute the sharp asymptotics of the capacity without relying on variational principles such as the Dirichlet principle or the Thomson principle.},

Let P be a self-adjoint non-commutative polynomial. In Voiculescu (Int Math Res Notices 1:41–63, 1998), Voiculescu showed that the empirical measure of the eigenvalues of this polynomial evaluated in Haar unitary matrices and deterministic matrices converges towards a deterministic measure defined thanks to free probability theory. Now, let f be a smooth function. The main technical result of this paper is a precise bound of the difference between the expectation of $$\begin{aligned} \frac{1}{MN} {{\,\mathrm{Tr}\,}}_{{\mathbb {M}}_N({\mathbb {C}})}\otimes {{\,\mathrm{Tr}\,}}_{{\mathbb {M}}_M({\mathbb {C}})}\left( f(P(U^N\otimes I_M,Z^{NM})) \right) , \end{aligned}$$ and its limit when N goes to infinity. If f is seven times differentiable, we show that it is bounded by $$M^2 \left\| f\right\| _{{\mathcal {C}}^6} \ln ^2(N)\times N^{-2}$$ . As a corollary we obtain a new proof with quantitative bounds of a result of Collins and Male which gives sufficient conditions for the operator norm of a polynomial evaluated in Haar unitary matrices and deterministic matrices to converge almost surely towards its free limit. Our result also holds in much greater generality. For instance, it allows to prove that if $$U^N$$ and $$Y^{M_N}$$ are independent and $$M_N=o(N^{1/3}\ln ^{-2/3}(N))$$ , then the norm of any polynomial in $$(U^N\otimes I_{M_N}, I_N\otimes Y^{M_N})$$ converges almost surely towards its free limit. Previous results required that $$M=M_N$$ is constant.},

  abstract     = {We consider a system of N interacting particles, governed by transport and diffusion, that converges in a mean-field limit to the solution of a McKean–Vlasov equation. From the observation of a trajectory of the system over a fixed time horizon, we investigate nonparametric estimation of the solution of the associated nonlinear Fokker–Planck equation, together with the drift term that controls the interactions, in a large population limit $$N \rightarrow \infty $$ . We build data-driven kernel estimators and establish oracle inequalities, following Lepski’s principle. Our results are based on a new Bernstein concentration inequality in McKean–Vlasov models for the empirical measure around its mean, possibly of independent interest. We obtain adaptive estimators over anisotropic Hölder smoothness classes built upon the solution map of the Fokker–Planck equation, and prove their optimality in a minimax sense. In the specific case of the Vlasov model, we derive an estimator of the interaction potential and establish its consistency.},

  abstract     = {The interest is in models of integer-valued height functions on shift-invariant planar graphs whose maximum degree is three. We prove delocalisation for models induced by convex nearest-neighbour potentials, under the condition that each potential function is an excited potential, that is, a convex symmetric potential function V with the property that $$V(\pm 1)\le V(0)+\log 2$$ . Examples of such models include the discrete Gaussian and solid-on-solid models at inverse temperature $$\beta \le \log 2$$ , as well as the uniformly random K-Lipschitz function for fixed $$K\in {\mathbb {N}}$$ . In fact, $$\beta V$$ is an excited potential for any convex symmetric potential function V whenever $$\beta $$ is sufficiently small. To arrive at the result, we develop a new technique for symmetry breaking, and then study the geometric percolation properties of sets of the form $$\{\varphi \ge a\}$$ and $$\{\varphi \le a\}$$ , where $$\varphi $$ is the random height function and a a constant. Along the same lines, we derive delocalisation for models induced by convex symmetric nearest-neighbour potentials which force the parity of the height of neighbouring vertices to be distinct. This includes models of uniformly random graph homomorphisms on the honeycomb lattice and the truncated square tiling, as well as on the same graphs with each edge replaced by N edges linked in series. The latter resembles cable-graph constructions which appear in the analysis of the Gaussian free field.},

  abstract     = {We obtain a new relation between the distributions $$\upmu _t$$ at different times $$t\ge 0$$ of the continuous-time totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) started from the step initial configuration. Namely, we present a continuous-time Markov process with local interactions and particle-dependent rates which maps the TASEP distributions $$\upmu _t$$ backwards in time. Under the backwards process, particles jump to the left, and the dynamics can be viewed as a version of the discrete-space Hammersley process. Combined with the forward TASEP evolution, this leads to a stationary Markov dynamics preserving $$\upmu _t$$ which in turn brings new identities for expectations with respect to $$\upmu _t$$ . The construction of the backwards dynamics is based on Markov maps interchanging parameters of Schur processes, and is motivated by bijectivizations of the Yang–Baxter equation. We also present a number of corollaries, extensions, and open questions arising from our constructions.},

The distribution is given in terms of a determinantal point process with extended Airy kernel. Our result can be regarded as an eigenvector counterpart of the BBP eigenvalue phase transition [6]. The derivation of the distribution makes use of the recently re-discovered eigenvector–eigenvalue identity, together with the determinantal point process representation of the GUE minor process with external source.},

  abstract     = {We consider one-dimensional excited random walks (ERWs) with i.i.d. Markovian cookie stacks in the non-boundary recurrent regime. We prove that under diffusive scaling such an ERW converges in the standard Skorokhod topology to a multiple of Brownian motion perturbed at its extrema (BMPE). All parameters of the limiting process are given explicitly in terms of those of the cookie Markov chain at a single site. While our results extend the results in Dolgopyat and Kosygina (Electron Commun Probab 17:1–14, 2012) (ERWs with boundedly many cookies per stack) and Kosygina and Peterson (Electron J Probab 21:1–24, 2016) (ERWs with periodic cookie stacks), the approach taken is very different and involves coarse graining of both the ERW and the random environment changed by the walk. Through a careful analysis of the environment left by the walk after each “mesoscopic” step, we are able to construct a coupling of the ERW at this “mesoscopic” scale with a suitable discretization of the limiting BMPE. The analysis is based on generalized Ray–Knight theorems for the directed edge local times of the ERW stopped at certain stopping times and evolving in both the original random cookie environment and (which is much more challenging) in the environment created by the walk after each “mesoscopic” step.},

Here we revisit one of these models, random regular k-nae-sat: knowing the satisfiability threshold, it is natural to study, in the satisfiable regime, the number of solutions in a typical instance. We prove here that these solutions have a well-defined free energy (limiting exponential growth rate), with explicit value matching the one-step replica symmetry breaking prediction. The proof develops new techniques for analyzing a certain “survey propagation model” associated to this problem. We believe that these methods may be applicable in a wide class of related problems.},
