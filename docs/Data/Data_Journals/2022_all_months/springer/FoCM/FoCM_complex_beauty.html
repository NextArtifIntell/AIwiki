  abstract     = {Characterising intractable high-dimensional random variables is one of the fundamental challenges in stochastic computation. The recent surge of transport maps offers a mathematical foundation and new insights for tackling this challenge by coupling intractable random variables with tractable reference random variables. This paper generalises the functional tensor-train approximation of the inverse Rosenblatt transport recently developed by Dolgov et al. (Stat Comput 30:603–625, 2020) to a wide class of high-dimensional non-negative functions, such as unnormalised probability density functions. First, we extend the inverse Rosenblatt transform to enable the transport to general reference measures other than the uniform measure. We develop an efficient procedure to compute this transport from a squared tensor-train decomposition which preserves the monotonicity. More crucially, we integrate the proposed order-preserving functional tensor-train transport into a nested variable transformation framework inspired by the layered structure of deep neural networks. The resulting deep inverse Rosenblatt transport significantly expands the capability of tensor approximations and transport maps to random variables with complicated nonlinear interactions and concentrated density functions. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach on a range of applications in statistical learning and uncertainty quantification, including parameter estimation for dynamical systems and inverse problems constrained by partial differential equations.},

We first explain why the group cycle consistency information is essential for effectively solving group synchronization problems. We then establish exact recovery and linear convergence guarantees for the proposed message passing procedure under a deterministic setting with adversarial corruption. These guarantees hold as long as the ratio of corrupted cycles per edge is bounded by a reasonable constant. We also establish the stability of the proposed procedure to sub-Gaussian noise.

Particular flows of great interest have been continuous limits of Nesterov’s algorithm and the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm, respectively. In this paper, we approach the solutions of linear ill-posed problems by dynamical flows. Because the squared norm of the residual of a linear operator equation is a convex functional, the theoretical results from convex analysis for energy minimising flows are applicable. However, in the restricted situation of this paper they can often be significantly improved. Moreover, since we show that the proposed flows for minimising the norm of the residual of a linear operator equation are optimal regularisation methods and that they provide optimal convergence rates for the regularised solutions, the given rates can be considered the benchmarks for further studies in convex analysis.},

  abstract     = {We study the problem of recovering an unknown signal $${\varvec{x}}$$ given measurements obtained from a generalized linear model with a Gaussian sensing matrix. Two popular solutions are based on a linear estimator $$\hat{\varvec{x}}^\mathrm{L}$$ and a spectral estimator $$\hat{\varvec{x}}^\mathrm{s}$$ . The former is a data-dependent linear combination of the columns of the measurement matrix, and its analysis is quite simple. The latter is the principal eigenvector of a data-dependent matrix, and a recent line of work has studied its performance. In this paper, we show how to optimally combine $$\hat{\varvec{x}}^\mathrm{L}$$ and $$\hat{\varvec{x}}^\mathrm{s}$$ . At the heart of our analysis is the exact characterization of the empirical joint distribution of $$({\varvec{x}}, \hat{\varvec{x}}^\mathrm{L}, \hat{\varvec{x}}^\mathrm{s})$$ in the high-dimensional limit. This allows us to compute the Bayes-optimal combination of $$\hat{\varvec{x}}^\mathrm{L}$$ and $$\hat{\varvec{x}}^\mathrm{s}$$ , given the limiting distribution of the signal $${\varvec{x}}$$ . When the distribution of the signal is Gaussian, then the Bayes-optimal combination has the form $$\theta \hat{\varvec{x}}^\mathrm{L}+\hat{\varvec{x}}^\mathrm{s}$$ and we derive the optimal combination coefficient. In order to establish the limiting distribution of $$({\varvec{x}}, \hat{\varvec{x}}^\mathrm{L}, \hat{\varvec{x}}^\mathrm{s})$$ , we design and analyze an approximate message passing algorithm whose iterates give $$\hat{\varvec{x}}^\mathrm{L}$$ and approach $$\hat{\varvec{x}}^\mathrm{s}$$ . Numerical simulations demonstrate the improvement of the proposed combination with respect to the two methods considered separately.},

The above algorithmic result is built on new representation theoretic results on the cohomology of symmetric semi-algebraic sets. We prove that the Specht modules corresponding to partitions having long lengths cannot occur in the isotypic decompositions of low-dimensional cohomology modules of closed semi-algebraic sets defined by symmetric polynomials having small degrees. This result generalizes prior results obtained by the authors giving restrictions on such partitions in terms of their ranks and is the key technical tool in the design of the algorithm mentioned in the previous paragraph.},

We present efficient and robust derivative-free methods called randomised Itoh–Abe methods. These are generalisations of the Itoh–Abe discrete gradient method, a well-known scheme from geometric integration, which has previously only been considered in the smooth setting. We demonstrate that the method and its favourable energy dissipation properties are well defined in the nonsmooth setting. Furthermore, we prove that whenever the objective function is locally Lipschitz continuous, the iterates almost surely converge to a connected set of Clarke stationary points. We present an implementation of the methods, and apply it to various test problems. The numerical results indicate that the randomised Itoh–Abe methods can be superior to state-of-the-art derivative-free optimisation methods in solving nonsmooth problems while still remaining competitive in terms of efficiency.},

The $$C^2$$ cubic space on such a refined triangulation has a stable dimension and optimal approximation power. Moreover, any spline function in this space can be locally built on each of the macro-triangles independently via Hermite interpolation. We provide a simplex spline basis for the space of $$C^2$$ cubics defined on a single macro-triangle which behaves like a Bernstein/B-spline basis over the triangle. The basis functions inherit recurrence relations and differentiation formulas from the simplex spline construction, they form a nonnegative partition of unity, they admit simple conditions for $$C^2$$ joins across the edges of neighboring triangles, and they enjoy a Marsden-like identity. Also, there is a single control net to facilitate control and early visualization of a spline function over the macro-triangle. Thanks to these properties, the complex geometry of the Wang–Shi macro-structure is transparent to the user. Stable global bases for the full space of $$C^2$$ cubics on the Wang–Shi refined triangulation $${\mathcal {T}}$$ are deduced from the local simplex spline basis by extending the concept of minimal determining sets.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the approximation of a diffusion model problem with contrasted diffusivity for various nonconforming approximation methods. The essential difficulty is that the Sobolev smoothness index of the exact solution may be just barely larger than 1. The lack of smoothness is handled by giving a weak meaning to the normal derivative of the exact solution at the mesh faces. We derive robust and quasi-optimal error estimates. Quasi-optimality means that the approximation error is bounded, up to a generic constant, by the best approximation error in the discrete trial space, and robustness means that the generic constant is independent of the diffusivity contrast. The error estimates use a mesh-dependent norm that is equivalent, at the discrete level, to the energy norm and that remains bounded as long as the exact solution has a Sobolev index strictly larger than 1. Finally, we briefly show how the analysis can be extended to the Maxwell’s equations.},

  abstract     = {Learning mappings of data on manifolds is an important topic in contemporary machine learning, with applications in astrophysics, geophysics, statistical physics, medical diagnosis, biochemistry, and 3D object analysis. This paper studies the problem of learning real-valued functions on manifolds through filtered hyperinterpolation of input–output data pairs where the inputs may be sampled deterministically or at random and the outputs may be clean or noisy. Motivated by the problem of handling large data sets, it presents a parallel data processing approach which distributes the data-fitting task among multiple servers and synthesizes the fitted sub-models into a global estimator. We prove quantitative relations between the approximation quality of the learned function over the entire manifold, the type of target function, the number of servers, and the number and type of available samples. We obtain the approximation rates of convergence for distributed and non-distributed approaches. For the non-distributed case, the approximation order is optimal.},

  abstract     = {Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz (KL) exponent plays an important role in estimating the convergence rate of many contemporary first-order methods. In particular, a KL exponent of $$\frac{1}{2}$$ for a suitable potential function is related to local linear convergence. Nevertheless, KL exponent is in general extremely hard to estimate. In this paper, we show under mild assumptions that KL exponent is preserved via inf-projection. Inf-projection is a fundamental operation that is ubiquitous when reformulating optimization problems via the lift-and-project approach. By studying its operation on KL exponent, we show that the KL exponent is $$\frac{1}{2}$$ for several important convex optimization models, including some semidefinite-programming-representable functions and some functions that involve $$C^2$$ -cone reducible structures, under conditions such as strict complementarity. Our results are applicable to concrete optimization models such as group-fused Lasso and overlapping group Lasso. In addition, for nonconvex models, we show that the KL exponent of many difference-of-convex functions can be derived from that of their natural majorant functions, and the KL exponent of the Bregman envelope of a function is the same as that of the function itself. Finally, we estimate the KL exponent of the sum of the least squares function and the indicator function of the set of matrices of rank at most k.},

We study the problem of inferring this interaction kernel from observations of the positions of the particles, in either continuous or discrete time, along multiple independent trajectories. We introduce a nonparametric inference approach to this inverse problem, based on a regularized maximum likelihood estimator constrained to suitable hypothesis spaces adaptive to data. We show that a coercivity condition enables us to control the condition number of this problem and prove the consistency of our estimator, and that in fact it converges at a near-optimal learning rate, equal to the min–max rate of one-dimensional nonparametric regression. In particular, this rate is independent of the dimension of the state space, which is typically very high. We also analyze the discretization errors in the case of discrete-time observations, showing that it is of order 1/2 in terms of the time spacings between observations. This term, when large, dominates the sampling error and the approximation error, preventing convergence of the estimator. Finally, we exhibit an efficient parallel algorithm to construct the estimator from data, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm with numerical tests on prototype systems including stochastic opinion dynamics and a Lennard-Jones model.},

In this paper, we give conditions under which the PL approximation of an isomanifold is topologically equivalent to the isomanifold. The conditions are easy to satisfy in the sense that they can always be met by taking a sufficiently fine and thick triangulation $$\mathcal {T}$$ . This contrasts with previous results on the triangulation of manifolds where, in arbitrary dimensions, delicate perturbations are needed to guarantee topological correctness, which leads to strong limitations in practice. We further give a bound on the Fréchet distance between the original isomanifold and its PL approximation.

  abstract     = {Partial differential equations (PDEs) are a fundamental tool in the modeling of many real-world phenomena. In a number of such real-world phenomena the PDEs under consideration contain gradient-dependent nonlinearities and are high-dimensional. Such high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs can in nearly all cases not be solved explicitly, and it is one of the most challenging tasks in applied mathematics to solve high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs approximately. It is especially very challenging to design approximation algorithms for nonlinear PDEs for which one can rigorously prove that they do overcome the so-called curse of dimensionality in the sense that the number of computational operations of the approximation algorithm needed to achieve an approximation precision of size $${\varepsilon }&gt; 0$$ grows at most polynomially in both the PDE dimension $$d \in \mathbb {N}$$ and the reciprocal of the prescribed approximation accuracy $${\varepsilon }$$ . In particular, to the best of our knowledge there exists no approximation algorithm in the scientific literature which has been proven to overcome the curse of dimensionality in the case of a class of nonlinear PDEs with general time horizons and gradient-dependent nonlinearities. It is the key contribution of this article to overcome this difficulty. More specifically, it is the key contribution of this article (i) to propose a new full-history recursive multilevel Picard approximation algorithm for high-dimensional nonlinear heat equations with general time horizons and gradient-dependent nonlinearities and (ii) to rigorously prove that this full-history recursive multilevel Picard approximation algorithm does indeed overcome the curse of dimensionality in the case of such nonlinear heat equations with gradient-dependent nonlinearities.},

  abstract     = {Randomized trace estimation is a popular and well-studied technique that approximates the trace of a large-scale matrix B by computing the average of $$x^T Bx$$ for many samples of a random vector X. Often, B is symmetric positive definite (SPD) but a number of applications give rise to indefinite B. Most notably, this is the case for log-determinant estimation, a task that features prominently in statistical learning, for instance in maximum likelihood estimation for Gaussian process regression. The analysis of randomized trace estimates, including tail bounds, has mostly focused on the SPD case. In this work, we derive new tail bounds for randomized trace estimates applied to indefinite B with Rademacher or Gaussian random vectors. These bounds significantly improve existing results for indefinite B, reducing the number of required samples by a factor n or even more, where n is the size of B. Even for an SPD matrix, our work improves an existing result by Roosta-Khorasani and Ascher (Found Comput Math, 15(5):1187–1212, 2015) for Rademacher vectors. This work also analyzes the combination of randomized trace estimates with the Lanczos method for approximating the trace of f(B). Particular attention is paid to the matrix logarithm, which is needed for log-determinant estimation. We improve and extend an existing result, to not only cover Rademacher but also Gaussian random vectors.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a methodology to study non-twist invariant circles and their bifurcations for area preserving maps, which is supported on the theoretical framework developed in Gonzalez-Enriquez et al. (Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. 227:vi+115, 2014). We recall that non-twist invariant circles are characterized not only by being invariant, but also by having some specified normal behavior. The normal behavior may endow them with extra stability properties (e.g., against external noise), and hence, they appear as design goals in some applications, e.g., in plasma physics, astrodynamics and oceanography. The methodology leads to efficient algorithms to compute and continue, with respect to parameters, non-twist invariant circles. The algorithms are quadratically convergent and, when implemented using FFT, have low storage requirement and low operations count per step. Furthermore, the algorithms are backed up by rigorous a posteriori theorems, proved and discussed in detail in Gonzalez-Enriquez et al. (Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. 227:vi+115, 2014), which give sufficient conditions guaranteeing the existence of a true non-twist invariant circle, provided an approximate invariant circle is known. Hence, one can compute confidently even very close to breakdown. With some extra effort, the calculations could be turned into computer-assisted proofs, see Figueras et al. (Found. Comput. Math. 17:1123–1193, 2017) for examples of the latter. The algorithms are also guaranteed to converge up to the breakdown of the invariant circles, and then, they are suitable to compute regions of parameters where the non-twist invariant circles exist. The calculations involved in the computation of the boundary of these regions are very robust, and they do not require symmetries and can run without continuous manual adjustments, largely improving methods based on the computation of very long period periodic orbits to approximate invariant circles. This paper contains a detailed description of our algorithms, the corresponding implementation and some numerical results, obtained by running the computer programs. In particular, we include calculations for two-dimensional parameter regions where non-twist invariant circles (with a prescribed frequency) exist. Indeed, we present systematic results in systems that do not contain symmetry lines, which seem to be unaccessible for previous methods. These numerical explorations lead to some open questions, also included here.},

  abstract     = {Parallel transport is a fundamental tool to perform statistics on Riemannian manifolds. Since closed formulae do not exist in general, practitioners often have to resort to numerical schemes. Ladder methods are a popular class of algorithms that rely on iterative constructions of geodesic parallelograms. And yet, the literature lacks a clear analysis of their convergence performance. In this work, we give Taylor approximations of the elementary constructions of Schild’s ladder and the pole ladder with respect to the Riemann curvature of the underlying space. We then prove that these methods can be iterated to converge with quadratic speed, even when geodesics are approximated by numerical schemes. We also contribute a new link between Schild’s ladder and the Fanning scheme which explains why the latter naturally converges only linearly. The extra computational cost of ladder methods is thus easily compensated by a drastic reduction of the number of steps needed to achieve the requested accuracy. Illustrations on the 2-sphere, the space of symmetric positive definite matrices and the special Euclidean group show that the theoretical errors we have established are measured with a high accuracy in practice. The special Euclidean group with an anisotropic left-invariant metric is of particular interest as it is a tractable example of a non-symmetric space in general, which reduces to a Riemannian symmetric space in a particular case. As a secondary contribution, we compute the covariant derivative of the curvature in this space.},

We obtain the order conditions for sampling the invariant measure for a class of Runge–Kutta methods applied to the constrained overdamped Langevin equation. The analysis is valid for arbitrarily high order and relies on an extension of the exotic aromatic Butcher-series formalism. To illustrate the methodology, a method of order two is introduced, and numerical experiments on the sphere, the torus and the special linear group confirm the theoretical findings.},

A measure of optimal performance, called stable manifold widths, for approximating a model class K in a Banach space X by stable manifold methods is introduced. Fundamental inequalities between these stable manifold widths and the entropy of K are established.

To this end, we use the results in Berahas et al.

The algorithm which realizes the bound is a least squares algorithm based on a specific set of sampling nodes. These are constructed out of a random draw in combination with a down-sampling procedure coming from the celebrated proof of Weaver’s conjecture, which was shown to be equivalent to the Kadison–Singer problem. Our result is non-constructive since we only show the existence of a linear sampling operator realizing the above bound. The general result can for instance be applied to the well-known situation of $$H^s_{\text {mix}}(\mathbb {T}^d)$$ in $$L_2(\mathbb {T}^d)$$ with $$s&gt;1/2$$ .

  abstract     = {Combining the classical theory of optimal transport with modern operator splitting techniques, we develop a new numerical method for nonlinear, nonlocal partial differential equations, arising in models of porous media, materials science, and biological swarming. Our method proceeds as follows: first, we discretize in time, either via the classical JKO scheme or via a novel Crank–Nicolson-type method we introduce. Next, we use the Benamou–Brenier dynamical characterization of the Wasserstein distance to reduce computing the solution of the discrete time equations to solving fully discrete minimization problems, with strictly convex objective functions and linear constraints. Third, we compute the minimizers by applying a recently introduced, provably convergent primal dual splitting scheme for three operators (Yan in J Sci Comput 1–20, 2018). By leveraging the PDEs’ underlying variational structure, our method overcomes stability issues present in previous numerical work built on explicit time discretizations, which suffer due to the equations’ strong nonlinearities and degeneracies. Our method is also naturally positivity and mass preserving and, in the case of the JKO scheme, energy decreasing. We prove that minimizers of the fully discrete problem converge to minimizers of the spatially continuous, discrete time problem as the spatial discretization is refined. We conclude with simulations of nonlinear PDEs and Wasserstein geodesics in one and two dimensions that illustrate the key properties of our approach, including higher-order convergence our novel Crank–Nicolson-type method, when compared to the classical JKO method.},

One particularly successful way to prove complexity bounds for these types of problems is based on sums of squares (SOS) as nonnegativity certificates. In this article, we initiate optimization problems over the boolean hypercube via a recent, alternative certificate called sums of nonnegative circuit polynomials (SONC). We show that key results for SOS-based certificates remain valid: First, for polynomials, which are nonnegative over the n-variate boolean hypercube with constraints of degree d there exists a SONC certificate of degree at most $$n+d$$ . Second, if there exists a degree d SONC certificate for nonnegativity of a polynomial over the boolean hypercube, then there also exists a short degree d SONC certificate that includes at most $$n^{O(d)}$$ nonnegative circuit polynomials. Moreover, we prove that, in opposite to SOS, the SONC cone is not closed under taking affine transformation of variables and that for SONC there does not exist an equivalent to Putinar’s Positivstellensatz for SOS. We discuss these results from both the algebraic and the optimization perspective.},

Several different symmetry structures are considered, and it is shown that for most of the structures, the generic change in the eigenvalues is analogous to the case of generic perturbations that ignore the structure. However, for some odd/even and palindromic structures, there is a different behavior for the eigenvalues 0 and $$\infty $$ , respectively, $$+1$$ and $$-1$$ . The differences arise in those cases where the parity of the partial multiplicities in the perturbed matrix pencil provided by the generic behavior in the general structure-ignoring case is not in accordance with the restrictions imposed by the structure. The new results extend results for the rank-1 and rank-2 cases that were obtained in Batzke (Linear Algebra Appl 458:638–670, 2014, Oper Matrices 10:83–112, 2016) for the case of special structure-preserving perturbations.

As in previous works (without sparsity), the underlying strategy is to consider an infinite-dimensional linear program on measures whose optimal value is the volume of the set. This is a particular instance of a generalized moment problem which in turn can be approximated as closely as desired by solving a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations of increasing size. The novelty with respect to previous work is that by exploiting the sparsity pattern we can provide a sparse formulation for which the associated semidefinite relaxations are of much smaller size. In addition, we can decompose the sparse relaxations into completely decoupled subproblems of smaller size, and in some cases computations can be done in parallel. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first contribution that exploits correlative sparsity for volume computation of semi-algebraic sets which are possibly high-dimensional and/or non-convex and/or non-connected.},

  abstract     = {A signature result in compressed sensing is that Gaussian random sampling achieves stable and robust recovery of sparse vectors under optimal conditions on the number of measurements. However, in the context of image reconstruction, it has been extensively documented that sampling strategies based on Fourier measurements outperform this purportedly optimal approach. Motivated by this seeming paradox, we investigate the problem of optimal sampling for compressed sensing. Rigorously combining the theories of wavelet approximation and infinite-dimensional compressed sensing, our analysis leads to new error bounds in terms of the total number of measurements m for the approximation of piecewise $$\alpha $$ -Hölder functions. Our theoretical findings suggest that Fourier sampling outperforms random Gaussian sampling when the Hölder exponent $$\alpha $$ is large enough. Moreover, we establish a provably optimal sampling strategy. This work is an important first step towards the resolution of the claimed paradox and provides a clear theoretical justification for the practical success of compressed sensing techniques in imaging problems.},

  abstract     = {We prove that with “high probability” a random Kostlan polynomial in $$n+1$$ many variables and of degree d can be approximated by a polynomial of “low degree” without changing the topology of its zero set on the sphere $$\mathbb {S}^n$$ . The dependence between the “low degree” of the approximation and the “high probability” is quantitative: for example, with overwhelming probability, the zero set of a Kostlan polynomial of degree d is isotopic to the zero set of a polynomial of degree $$O(\sqrt{d \log d})$$ . The proof is based on a probabilistic study of the size of $$C^1$$ -stable neighborhoods of Kostlan polynomials. As a corollary, we prove that certain topological types (e.g., curves with deep nests of ovals or hypersurfaces with rich topology) have exponentially small probability of appearing as zero sets of random Kostlan polynomials.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose and analyze zeroth-order stochastic approximation algorithms for nonconvex and convex optimization, with a focus on addressing constrained optimization, high-dimensional setting, and saddle point avoiding. To handle constrained optimization, we first propose generalizations of the conditional gradient algorithm achieving rates similar to the standard stochastic gradient algorithm using only zeroth-order information. To facilitate zeroth-order optimization in high dimensions, we explore the advantages of structural sparsity assumptions. Specifically, (i) we highlight an implicit regularization phenomenon where the standard stochastic gradient algorithm with zeroth-order information adapts to the sparsity of the problem at hand by just varying the step size and (ii) propose a truncated stochastic gradient algorithm with zeroth-order information, whose rate of convergence depends only poly-logarithmically on the dimensionality. We next focus on avoiding saddle points in nonconvex setting. Toward that, we interpret the Gaussian smoothing technique for estimating gradient based on zeroth-order information as an instantiation of first-order Stein’s identity. Based on this, we provide a novel linear-(in dimension) time estimator of the Hessian matrix of a function using only zeroth-order information, which is based on second-order Stein’s identity. We then provide a zeroth-order variant of cubic regularized Newton method for avoiding saddle points and discuss its rate of convergence to local minima.},

  abstract     = {The paper deals with the problem of extrapolating data derived from sampling a $$C^m$$ function at scattered sites on a Lipschitz region $$\varOmega $$ in $$\mathbb R^d$$ to points outside of $$\varOmega $$ in a computationally efficient way. While extrapolation problems go back to Whitney and many such problems have had successful theoretical resolutions, practical, computationally efficient implementations seem to be lacking. The goal here is to provide one way of obtaining such a method in a solid mathematical framework. The method utilized is a novel two-step moving least squares procedure (MLS) where the second step incorporates an error term obtained from the first MLS step. While the utility of the extrapolation degrades as a function of the distance to the boundary of $$\varOmega $$ , the method gives rise to improved meshfree approximation error estimates when using the local Lagrange kernels related to certain radial basis functions.},
