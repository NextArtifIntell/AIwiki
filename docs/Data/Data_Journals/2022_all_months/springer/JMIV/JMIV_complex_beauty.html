We model the output of simple cells through a family of Gabor filters and the propagation of the neural signal accordingly to the functional geometry induced by horizontal connectivity. Then we model the deformation between two images as a path relying two different outputs. This path is obtained by optimal transport considering the Wasserstein distance geodesics associated to some probability measures naturally induced by the outputs on V1. The frame of Gabor filters allows to project back the output path, therefore obtaining an associated image stimulus deformation. We perform a numerical implementation of our cortical model, assessing its ability in reconstructing rigid motions of simple shapes.},

  abstract     = {A new video inpainting technique for videos taken from free moving cameras is suggested in this research paper. The effective results of video inpainting can be achieved by maintaining spatiotemporal coherence while filling the holes in the target frames. This is possible only with the proper registration of source frames to the target frame. Image registration plays a vital role in the process of video inpainting to obtain effective results. An advanced homography-based image registration method is introduced, based on HALF-SIFT: high accurate localization feature for SIFT to extract feature points without localization error. The covariance matrix has been used to estimate the localization error. Further, new inlier selection method using CW MLESAC and refining is carried out for homography matrix with CW L-M. This iteration process can improve the accuracy of image registration. After registering frames to the target frame, the hole is inpainted by globally minimizing the energy cost function. The proposed video inpainting is applied to several complex video sequences. Experimental results are outperformed in visual quality when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The performance metrics like peak signal-to-noise ratio and Structural Similarity Index are determined and compared with existing methods for different video sequences.},

  abstract     = {Manifold-valued functional data analysis (FDA) has become an active area of research motivated by the rising availability of trajectories or longitudinal data observed on nonlinear manifolds. The challenges of analyzing such data come from many aspects, including infinite dimensionality and nonlinearity, as well as time domain or phase variability. In this paper, we study the amplitude part of manifold-valued functions on $$\mathbb {S}^2$$ , which is invariant to random time warping or re-parameterization. We represent a smooth function on $$\mathbb {S}^2$$ using a pair of components: a starting point and a transported square-root velocity curve (TSRVC). Under this representation, the space of all smooth functions on $$\mathbb {S}^2$$ forms a vector bundle, and the simple $$L_2$$ norm becomes a time-warping invariant metric on this vector bundle. Utilizing the nice geometry of $$\mathbb {S}^2$$ , we develop a set of efficient and accurate tools for temporal alignment of functions, geodesic computing, and sample mean and covariance calculation. At the heart of these tools, they rely on gradient descent algorithms with carefully derived gradients. We show the advantages of these newly developed tools over its competitors with extensive simulations and real data and demonstrate the importance of considering the amplitude part of functions instead of mixing it with phase variability in manifold-valued FDA.},

  abstract     = {We present a method to locally reconstruct dense video depth maps of a non-rigidly deformable object directly from a video sequence acquired by a static orthographic camera. The estimation of depth is performed locally on spatiotemporal patches of the video, and then, the full depth video is recovered by combining them together. Since the geometric complexity of a local spatiotemporal patch of a deforming non-rigid object is often simple enough to be faithfully represented with a parametric model, we artificially generate a database of small deforming rectangular meshes rendered with different material properties and light conditions, along with their corresponding depth videos, and use such data to train a convolutional neural network. Since the database images are rendered with an orthographic camera model, linear deformations along the optical axis cannot be recovered from the training images. These are known in the literature as generalized bas-relief (GBR) transformations. We address this ambiguity problem by employing the invariant-theoretic normalization procedure in order to obtain complete invariants with respect to this group of transformations, and use them in the loss function of a neural network. We tested our method on both synthetic and Kinect data and experimentally observed that the reconstruction error is significantly lower than the one obtained using conventional non-rigid structure from motion approaches and state-of-the-art video depth estimation techniques.},

  abstract     = {Our aim is to explain and characterize the behavior of adaptive total variation (TV) regularization. TV has been widely used as an edge-preserving regularizer. However, objects are often over-regularized by TV, becoming blob-like convex structures of low curvature. This phenomenon was explained mathematically in the analysis of Andreau et al. They have shown that a TV regularizer can spatially preserve perfectly sets which are nonlinear eigenfunctions of the form $$\lambda u \in \partial J_{TV}(u)$$ , where $$\partial J_{TV}(u)$$ is the TV subdifferential. For TV, these shapes are indeed convex sets of low curvature. A compelling approach to better preserve structures is to use adaptive anisotropic functionals, which adapt the regularization in an image-driven manner, with strong regularization along edges and low across them. This follows the seminal work of Weickert on anisotropic diffusion. Adaptive anisotropic TV (A $$^2$$ TV) was successfully used in several studies in the past decade. However, there is little analysis of the type of structures which can be well preserved. In this study, we address this question by a joint methodology of mathematical derivations and experiments. We rely on a recently developed theory of Burger et al on nonlinear spectral analysis of one-homogeneous functionals. We have that eigenfunction sets, admitting $$\lambda u \in \partial J_{A^2TV}(u)$$ , are perfectly preserved under A $$^2$$ TV flow or minimization with $$L^2$$ square fidelity. We thus investigate these eigenfunctions theoretically and numerically. We prove non-convex sets can be eigenfunctions in certain conditions and provide numerical results which characterize well the relations between the degree of local anisotropy of the functional and the admitted maximal curvature. A nonlinear spectral representation is formulated, where shapes are well preserved and can be manipulated effectively. Finally, examples of possible applications related to shape manipulation and guided regularization of medical and depth data are shown.},

  abstract     = {Incorporating prior knowledge into a segmentation process, whether it is geometrical constraints such as volume penalisation, (partial) convexity enforcement, or topological prescriptions to preserve the contextual relations between objects, proves to improve accuracy in medical image segmentation, in particular when addressing the issue of weak boundary definition. Motivated by this observation, the proposed contribution aims to provide a unified variational framework including geometrical constraints in the training of convolutional neural networks in the form of a penalty in the loss function. These geometrical constraints take several forms and encompass level curve alignment through the integration of the weighted total variation, an area penalisation phrased as a hard constraint in the modelling, and an intensity homogeneity criterion based on a combination of the standard Dice loss with the piecewise constant Mumford‚ÄìShah model. The mathematical formulation yields a non-smooth non-convex optimisation problem, which rules out conventional smooth optimisation techniques and leads us to adopt a Lagrangian setting. The application falls within the scope of organ-at-risk segmentation in CT (computed tomography) images, in the context of radiotherapy planning. Experiments demonstrate that our method provides significant improvements (i) over existing non-constrained approaches both in terms of quantitative criteria, such as the measure of overlap, and qualitative assessment (spatial regularisation/coherency, fewer outliers), (ii) over in-layer constrained deep convolutional networks, and shows a certain degree of versatility.},

Specifically, hyperchaotic and chaotic systems are used to generate pseudo-random sequences. These sequences are thus used to define random first-order difference equations, chaotic permutations and logic circuits. Image encryption based on these three randomized modules shows high computational efficiency as well as strong robustness against statistical, differential, and chosen-plaintext attacks. The proposed scheme leads to almost zero correlation in the encrypted images, entropy values of more than 7.99 for the test images, and a key space size of $$2^{572}$$ . Furthermore, differential analysis shows that the number of pixel change rate (NPCR) and the unified average change intensity (UACI) for the proposed technique are on average 99.61 and 33.35%, respectively.},

In state estimation, the time-dependent image reconstruction problem is modeled by separate state evolution and observation models.

The proposed approach is evaluated using radially golden angle sampled simulated and experimental small animal data from a rat brain. In our method, the state estimates are updated after each new spoke of radial data becomes available, leading to faster frame rate compared with the conventional approaches. The results are compared with the estimates with the sliding window method. The results show that the state estimation approach with the data-driven process noise covariance can improve both spatial and temporal resolution.},

  abstract     = {In mathematical morphology, connected filters based on dynamics are used to filter the extrema of an image. Similarly, persistence is a concept coming from persistent homology and Morse theory that represents the stability of the extrema of a Morse function. Since these two concepts seem to be closely related, in this paper we examine their relationship, and we prove that they are equal on n-D Morse functions, $$n\ge 1$$ . More exactly, pairing a minimum with a 1-saddle by dynamics or pairing the same 1-saddle with a minimum by persistence leads exactly to the same pairing, assuming that the critical values of the studied Morse function are unique. This result is a step further to show how much topological data analysis and mathematical morphology are related, paving the way for a more in-depth study of the relations between these two research fields.},

Indeed, it is an ill-posed inverse problem, since different structures exist having the same projections along all lines whose directions range in U. Characteristic of ambiguous reconstructions are special configurations, called switching components, whose understanding represents a main issue in discrete tomography, and an independent interesting geometric problem as well. The investigation of switching component usually bases on some kind of prior knowledge that is incorporated in the tomographic problem. In this paper, we focus on switching components under the constraint of convexity along the horizontal and the vertical directions imposed to the unknown object. Moving from their geometric characterization in windows and curls, we provide a numerical description, by encoding them as special sequences of integers. A detailed study of these sequences leads to the complete understanding of their combinatorial structure, and to a polynomial-time algorithm that explicitly reconstructs any of them from a pair of integers arbitrarily given.},

  abstract     = {Mathematical morphology is a valuable theory of nonlinear operators widely used for image processing and analysis. Although initially conceived for binary images, mathematical morphology has been successfully extended to vector-valued images using several approaches. Vector-valued morphological operators based on total orders are particularly promising because they circumvent the problem of false colors. On the downside, they often introduce irregularities in the output image. This paper proposes measuring the irregularity of a vector-valued morphological operator by the relative gap between the generalized sum of pixel-wise distances and the Wasserstein metric. Apart from introducing a measure of the irregularity, referred to as the irregularity index, this paper also addresses its computational implementation. Precisely, we distinguish between the ideal global and the practical local irregularity indexes. The local irregularity index, which can be computed more quickly by aggregating values of local windows, yields a lower bound for the global irregularity index. Computational experiments with natural images illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed irregularity indexes.},

P-convolution layers were proposed as a possible solution to this issue since they can act as smooth differentiable approximation of $$\min $$ and $$\max $$ operations, yielding pseudo-dilation or pseudo-erosion layers. In a recent work, we proposed two novel morphological layers based on the same principle as the p-convolution, while circumventing its principal drawbacks, and showcased their capacity to efficiently learn grayscale morphological operators while raising several edge cases. In this work, we complete those previous results by thoroughly analyzing the behavior of the proposed layers and by investigating and settling the reported edge cases. We also demonstrate the compatibility of one of the proposed morphological layers with binary morphological frameworks.},

It solves many problems related to its usual definitions, like possible non-connectedness or non-simple connectedness, while encompassing its desirable features. Fully convex sets are digitally convex, but are also connected and simply connected. They have a morphological characterization, which induces a simple convexity test algorithm. Arithmetic planes are fully convex too. Full convexity implies local full convexity, hence it enables local shape analysis, with an unambiguous definition of convex, concave and planar points. As a kind of relative full convexity, we propose a natural definition of tangent subsets to a digital set. It gives rise to the tangential cover in 2D, and to consistent extensions in arbitrary dimension. Finally, we present two applications of tangency: the first one is a simple algorithm for building a polygonal mesh from a set of digital points, with reversibility property, the second one is the definition and computation of shortest paths within digital sets.},

  abstract     = {A nonnegative integer sequence is k-graphic if it is the degree sequence of a k-uniform simple hypergraph. The problem of deciding whether a given sequence $$\pi $$ is 3-graphic has recently been proved to be NP-complete, after years of studies. Thus, it acquires primary relevance to detect classes of degree sequences whose graphicality can be tested in polynomial time in order to restrict the NP-hard core of the problem and design algorithms that can also be useful in different research areas. Several necessary and few sufficient conditions for $$\pi $$ to be k-graphic, with $$k\ge 3$$ , appear in the literature. Frosini et al. defined a polynomial time algorithm to reconstruct k-uniform hypergraphs having regular or almost regular degree sequences. Our study fits in this research line providing a combinatorial characterization of span-two sequences, i.e., sequences of the form $$\pi =(d,\ldots ,d,d-1,\ldots ,d-1,d-2,\ldots ,d-2)$$ , $$d\ge 2$$ , which are degree sequences of some 3-uniform hypergraphs. Then, we define a polynomial time algorithm to reconstruct one of the related 3-uniform hypergraphs. Our results are likely to be easily generalized to $$k \ge 4$$ and to other families of degree sequences having simple characterization, such as gap-free sequences.},

We then introduce in this paper a new method to temper the algorithmic bias in Neural-Network-based classifiers. Our method is Neural-Network architecture agnostic and scales well to massive training sets of images. It indeed only overloads the loss function with a Wasserstein-2-based regularization term for which we back-propagate the impact of specific output predictions using a new model, based on the G√¢teaux derivatives of the predictions distribution. This model is algorithmically reasonable and makes it possible to use our regularized loss with standard stochastic gradient-descent strategies.

Convergence of the classic Arrow‚ÄìHurwicz method, however, is known only when some more restrictive conditions are additionally assumed, such as strong convexity of the functions or some demanding requirements on the step sizes. In this short note, we show by very simple counterexamples that the classic Arrow‚ÄìHurwicz method with any constant step size is not necessarily convergent for solving generic convex saddle point problems, including some fundamental cases such as the canonical linear programming model and the bilinear saddle point problem. This result plainly fathoms the convergence understanding of the Arrow‚ÄìHurwicz method and retrospectively validates the rationale of studying its convergence under various additional conditions in image processing literature.},

However, the classification functions in the existing network architecture of CNNs are simple and lack capabilities to handle important spatial information as have been done by many well-known traditional variational image segmentation models. Priors such as spatial regularization, volume prior and shapes priors cannot be handled by existing DCNNs. We propose a novel Soft Threshold Dynamics (STD) framework which can integrate many spatial priors of the classic variational models into the DCNNs for image segmentation. The novelty of our method is to interpret the softmax activation function as a dual variable in a variational problem, and thus many spatial priors can be imposed in the dual space. From this viewpoint, we can build a STD based framework which can enable the outputs of DCNNs to have many special priors such as spatial regularization, volume preservation and star-shape prior. The proposed method is a general mathematical framework and it can be applied to any image segmentation DCNNs with a softmax classification layer. To show the efficiency of our method, we applied it to the popular DeepLabV3+ image segmentation network, and the experiments results show that our method can work efficiently on data-driven image segmentation DCNNs.},

  abstract     = {The $$\mathscr {G}^0$$ distribution is an apt model for speckled data, such as SAR imagery, because it possesses the ability to characterize areas with different degrees of texture. In the monopolarized case, this distribution depends on three parameters: the texture, the scale, and the number of looks. The first one is related to the roughness of the image, so its estimation deserves special attention. This paper proposes and compares estimation methods of the texture parameter in intensity format. We treat the multilook case. The proposal is to estimate this parameter by minimizing the triangular distance between the $$\mathscr {G}^0$$ density and an estimate of the underlying density function using asymmetric kernels. We assess the properties of these estimators with analytic results and simulation. We use actual images to evaluate the performance of our proposal.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we focus on the inverse problem of reconstructing distributional brain activity with cortical and weakly detectable deep components in non-invasive Electroencephalography. We consider a recently introduced hybrid reconstruction strategy combining a hierarchical Bayesian model to incorporate a priori information and the advanced randomized multiresolution scanning (RAMUS) source space decomposition approach to reduce modelling errors, respectively. In particular, we aim to generalize the previously extensively used conditionally Gaussian prior (CGP) formalism to achieve distributional reconstructions with higher focality. For this purpose, we introduce as a hierarchical prior, a general exponential distribution, which we refer to as conditionally exponential prior (CEP). The first-degree CEP corresponds to focality enforcing Laplace prior, but it also suffers from strong depth bias, when applied in numerical modelling, making the deep activity unrecoverable. We sample over multiple resolution levels via RAMUS to reduce this bias as it is known to depend on the resolution of the source space. Moreover, we introduce a procedure based on the physiological a priori knowledge of the brain activity to obtain the shape and scale parameters of the gamma hyperprior that steer the CEP. The posterior estimates are calculated using iterative statistical methods, expectation maximization and iterative alternating sequential algorithm, which we show to be algorithmically similar and to have a close resemblance to the iterative $$\ell _1$$ and $$\ell _2$$ reweighting methods. The performance of CEP is compared with the recent sampling-based dipole localization method Sequential semi-analytic Monte Carlo estimation (SESAME) in numerical experiments of simulated somatosensory evoked potentials related to the human median nerve stimulation. Our results obtained using synthetic sources suggest that a hybrid of the first-degree CEP and RAMUS can achieve an accuracy comparable to the second-degree case (CGP) while being more focal. Further, the proposed hybrid is shown to be robust to noise effects and compares well with the dipole reconstructions obtained with SESAME.},

  abstract     = {Autoencoders and generative models produce some of the most spectacular deep learning results to date. However, understanding and controlling the latent space of these models presents a considerable challenge. Drawing inspiration from principal component analysis and autoencoders, we propose the principal component analysis autoencoder (PCA-AE). This is a novel autoencoder whose latent space verifies two properties. Firstly, the dimensions are organised in decreasing importance with respect to the data at hand. Secondly, the components of the latent space are statistically independent. We achieve this by progressively increasing the latent space during training, and with a covariance loss applied to the latent codes. The resulting autoencoder produces a latent space which separates the intrinsic attributes of the data into different components of the latent space, in a completely unsupervised manner. We also describe an extension of our approach to the case of powerful, pre-trained GANs. We show results on both synthetic examples of shapes and on a state-of-the-art GAN. For example, we are able to separate the colour shade scale of hair, pose of faces and gender, without accessing any labels. We compare the PCA-AE with other state-of-the-art approaches, in particular with respect to the ability to disentangle attributes in the latent space. We hope that this approach will contribute to better understanding of the intrinsic latent spaces of powerful deep generative models.},

  abstract     = {As a copyright protection technology, zero-watermarking has received widespread attention in recent years. The zero-watermarking algorithm based on moments has been extensively studied due to its better comprehensive performance and has made great progress. However, three issues of the moments-based zero-watermarking methods should be addressed: first, most of them ignore the analysis and experiment on discriminability, which leads to the high false positive ratio; second, direct computation of the moments from their definition is inefficient, numerically unstable and inaccurate, which severely affects the performances of these moments-based methods; third, most of the algorithms are only suitable for grayscale images, which leads to the limitation of the algorithms in practical applications. In this paper, we present a new color image zero-watermarking using fast quaternion log-polar radial harmonic Fourier moments. This algorithm firstly introduces log-polar coordinates to make traditional RHFMs scale-invariant, secondly improves their speed and accuracy, then introduces the concept of quaternion to make it suitable for color images, and finally applies it to the zero-watermark technology. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that compared to the existing algorithms, the BER value of the proposed algorithm is 0 under some attacks, which can prove its effectiveness and achieved a good trade-off between discriminability and robustness, and has certain superiority in terms of security, capacity and speed.},

  abstract     = {The ability to handle large scale variations is crucial for many real-world visual tasks. A straightforward approach for handling scale in a deep network is to process an image at several scales simultaneously in a set of scale channels. Scale invariance can then, in principle, be achieved by using weight sharing between the scale channels together with max or average pooling over the outputs from the scale channels. The ability of such scale-channel networks to generalise to scales not present in the training set over significant scale ranges has, however, not previously been explored. In this paper, we present a systematic study of this methodology by implementing different types of scale-channel networks and evaluating their ability to generalise to previously unseen scales. We develop a formalism for analysing the covariance and invariance properties of scale-channel networks, including exploring their relations to scale-space theory, and exploring how different design choices, unique to scaling transformations, affect the overall performance of scale-channel networks. We first show that two previously proposed scale-channel network designs, in one case, generalise no better than a standard CNN to scales not present in the training set, and in the second case, have limited scale generalisation ability. We explain theoretically and demonstrate experimentally why generalisation fails or is limited in these cases. We then propose a new type of foveated scale-channel architecture, where the scale channels process increasingly larger parts of the image with decreasing resolution. This new type of scale-channel network is shown to generalise extremely well, provided sufficient image resolution and the absence of boundary effects. Our proposed FovMax and FovAvg networks perform almost identically over a scale range of 8, also when training on single-scale training data, and do also give improved performance when learning from data sets with large scale variations in the small sample regime.},

We relax this non-convex problem with its Shor‚Äôs relaxation, a convex program that can be solved by off-the-shelf tools. We follow the empirical observation that redundant but independent constraints tighten the relaxation. For that, we leverage equivalent definitions of the set of essential matrices based on the translation vectors between the cameras. Overconstrained characterizations of the set of essential matrices are derived by the combination of these definitions. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real data, our proposal is empirically proved to remain tight and to require only 7 milliseconds to be solved even for the overconstrained formulations, finding the optimal solution under a wide variety of configurations, including highly noisy data and outliers. The solver cannot certify the solution only in very extreme cases, e.g.noise $$100~{\texttt {pix}} $$ and number of pair-wise correspondences under 15. The proposal is thus faster than other overconstrained formulations while being faster than the minimal ones, making it suitable for real-world applications that require optimality certification.},

However, neural synthesis methods still struggle to reproduce large-scale structures, especially with high-resolution textures. To address this issue, we first introduce a simple multi-resolution framework that efficiently accounts for long-range dependency. Then, we show that additional statistical constraints further improve the reproduction of textures with strong regularity. This can be achieved by constraining both the Gram matrices of a neural network and the power spectrum of the image. Alternatively, one may constrain only the autocorrelation of the features of the network and drop the Gram matrices constraints. In an experimental part, the proposed methods are then extensively tested and compared to alternative approaches, both in an unsupervised way and through a user study. Experiments show the advantage of the multi-scale scheme for high-resolution textures and the advantage of combining it with additional constraints for regular textures.},

Coregistration of both data sets allows to combine the temporal (but 2D) information with more detailed spatial 3D information. Our approach is variational and uses a hyperelastic deformation regularization, as is appropriate for biological material. As a particular feature, the out-of-plane deformation is estimated based on the out-of-focus blur inside the 2D microscopy image.

While these are convex and can therefore be reliably optimized, they suffer from a shrinking bias that degrades the solution quality in the presence of noise. This well-known drawback has given rise to a fauna of non-convex alternatives, which usually features better global minima at the price of maybe getting stuck in undesired local minima. We focus in particular penalties based on the quadratic envelope, which have been shown to have global minima which even coincide with the ‚Äúoracle solution,‚Äù i.e.,¬†there is no bias at all. So, which one do we choose, convex with a definite bias, or non-convex with no bias but less predictability?

While in most cases spatial and temporal constraints are added artificially to the minimization process, our approach is to exploit Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), a spectral decomposition technique that naturally extracts spatio-temporal patterns from data. Applied to video data, DMD can compute background models. However, the original DMD algorithm for background modeling is neither efficient nor robust. In this paper, we present an equivalent reformulation with constraints leading to a more suitable decomposition into fore- and background. Due to the reformulation, which uses sparse and low-dimensional structures, an efficient and robust algorithm is derived that computes accurate background models.

  abstract     = {We present a closed form solution to the problem of registration of fully overlapping 3D point clouds undergoing unknown rigid transformations, as well as for detection and registration of sub-parts undergoing unknown rigid transformations. The solution is obtained by adapting the general framework of the universal manifold embedding (UME) to the case where the transformations the object may undergo are rigid. The UME nonlinearly maps functions related by certain types of geometric transformations of coordinates to the same linear subspace of some Euclidean space while retaining the information required to recover the transformation. Therefore registration, matching and classification can be solved as linear problems in a low dimensional linear space. In this paper, we extend the UME framework to the special case where it is a priori known that the geometric transformations are rigid. While a variety of methods exist for point cloud registration, the method proposed in this paper is notably different as registration is achieved by a closed form solution that employs the UME low dimensional representation of the shapes to be registered.},

  abstract     = {Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are widely used for Earth observation to complement optical imaging. By combining information on the polarization and the phase shift of the radar echos, SAR images offer high sensitivity to the geometry and materials that compose a scene. This information richness comes with a drawback inherent to all coherent imaging modalities: a strong signal-dependent noise called ‚Äúspeckle.‚Äù This paper addresses the mathematical issues of performing speckle reduction in a transformed domain: the matrix-log domain. Rather than directly estimating noiseless covariance matrices, recasting the denoising problem in terms of the matrix-log of the covariance matrices stabilizes noise fluctuations and makes it possible to apply off-the-shelf denoising algorithms. We refine the method MuLoG by replacing heuristic procedures with exact expressions and improving the estimation strategy. This corrects a bias of the original method and should facilitate and encourage the adaptation of general-purpose processing methods to SAR imaging.},

  abstract     = {Extending computational harmonic analysis tools from the classical setting of regular lattices to the more general setting of graphs and networks is very important, and much research has been done recently. The generalized Haar‚ÄìWalsh transform (GHWT) developed by Irion and Saito (2014) is a multiscale transform for signals on graphs, which is a generalization of the classical Haar and Walsh‚ÄìHadamard transforms. We propose the extended generalized Haar‚ÄìWalsh transform (eGHWT), which is a generalization of the adapted time‚Äìfrequency tilings of Thiele and Villemoes (1996). The eGHWT examines not only the efficiency of graph-domain partitions but also that of ‚Äúsequency-domain‚Äù partitions simultaneously. Consequently, the eGHWT and its associated best-basis selection algorithm for graph signals significantly improve the performance of the previous GHWT with the similar computational cost, $$O(N \log N)$$ , where N is the number of nodes of an input graph. While the GHWT best-basis algorithm seeks the most suitable orthonormal basis for a given task among more than $$(1.5)^N$$ possible orthonormal bases in $$\mathbb {R}^N$$ , the eGHWT best-basis algorithm can find a better one by searching through more than $$0.618\cdot (1.84)^N$$ possible orthonormal bases in $$\mathbb {R}^N$$ . This article describes the details of the eGHWT best-basis algorithm and demonstrates its superiority using several examples including genuine graph signals as well as conventional digital images viewed as graph signals. Furthermore, we also show how the eGHWT can be extended to 2D signals and matrix-form data by viewing them as a tensor product of graphs generated from their columns and rows and demonstrate its effectiveness on applications such as image approximation.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the similarity measurement issue, in the context of texture images comparison, is tackled from a geometrical point of view by computing the Rao Geodesic distance on the Generalized Gamma distributions (G $$\Gamma $$ D) manifold. This latter permits a generic and flexible characterization thanks to its three-parameters modeling. We take advantage of information geometry tools to consider the G $$\Gamma $$ D as a geometrical manifold and thus to define the geodesic distance (GD) as a real and intuitive similarity measure rather than the purely statistical Kullback-Leibler divergence. However, the three-parameter space turns out to be cumbersome when it comes to solving the geodesic equations. This explains why the main studies that tried to solve this problem have been content to use mappings to some embedded submanifolds to modify and approximate the accurate geodesic model by computing geodesic distances only on integrable submanifolds. Our main contribution is to approximate the GD in a more general manner, i.e considering all cases of the manifold coordinates. We managed to derive a closed-form of the modified geodesic model on sub-manifolds when the shape parameters are fixed. In the case of the fixed scale parameters, the geodesic equations are solved and a numerical approximation is directly applied to derive the geodesic distance. When the three parameters are allowed to vary, we approximate the GD using two different ways. The first is treated by the mean of a polynomial approach, while the second is subject to a graph-based approach. The proposed approaches are evaluated considering the Content-Based Texture Retrieval (CBTR) application on three different databases (VisTex, Brodatz, and USPTex) in order to show their effectiveness over the state-of-the-art methods.},

By sharing the learnt parameters between multiple scale channels, and by using the transformation properties of the scale-space primitives under scaling transformations, the resulting network becomes provably scale covariant. By in addition performing max pooling over the multiple scale channels, or other permutation-invariant pooling over scales, a resulting network architecture for image classification also becomes provably scale invariant. We investigate the performance of such networks on the MNIST Large Scale dataset, which contains rescaled images from the original MNIST dataset over a factor of 4 concerning training data and over a factor of 16 concerning testing data. It is demonstrated that the resulting approach allows for scale generalization, enabling good performance for classifying patterns at scales not spanned by the training data.},

By keeping the contours isomorphic, it is possible to prevent over-segmentation and under-segmentation, as well as to adhere to given topologies. The Self-repelling Snakes model (SR) is a variational model that preserves contour topology by combining a non-local repulsion term with the geodesic active contour model. The SR is traditionally solved using the additive operator splitting (AOS) scheme. In our paper, we propose an alternative solution to the SR using the Split Bregman method. Our algorithm breaks the problem down into simpler sub-problems to use lower-order evolution equations and a simple projection scheme rather than re-initialization. The sub-problems can be solved via fast Fourier transform or an approximate soft thresholding formula which maintains stability, shortening the convergence time, and reduces the memory requirement. The Split Bregman and AOS algorithms are compared theoretically and experimentally.},

The paper presents a linear algorithm for determining the ordered list of polygon vertices which are pixels determined from the point list of the given 4-contour. The algorithm relies on local extremity and semi-local shortest path requirements, and it uses only simple operations of integer calculus. The resulting polygon approximates what would be a generalization of the minimal perimeter polygon. The latter is known from the literature for 4-contours only for restricted cases such as digital Jordan curves related to simple grid continua, or certain types of subsets of rectangular mosaics, where it has been applied to perimeter estimation and for convexity and concavity analysis. We apply the polygon proposed to approximate 4-contours corresponding to weakly simple curves of known perimeter and report on experiments of perimeter estimation.},

And when the optical center moves on the danger cylinder, accordingly the optical centers of the two other solutions of the corresponding P3P problem form a new surface, characterized by a polynomial equation of degree 12 in the optical center coordinates, called the deltoidal surface of danger cylinder (DSDC). This indicates the danger cylinder always has a companion deltoidal surface. For the significance of DSDC, we show that when the optical center passes through the DSDC, the number of solutions of P3P constraint system must change by 2, or DSDC acts as a delimitating surface of the P3P solution space. These new findings shed some new lights on the P3P multi-solution phenomenon, an important issue in P3P study.},

The camera model supports an arbitrary number of cameras and assumes a linear relative motion with constant velocity between the cameras and the object. We distinguish two motion configurations. In the first configuration, all cameras move with independent motion vectors. In the second configuration, the cameras are mounted rigidly with respect to each other and therefore share a common motion vector. The camera model can model arbitrary lens distortions by supporting arbitrary positions of the line sensor with respect to the optical axis. We propose an algorithm to calibrate a multi-view telecentric line-scan camera setup. To facilitate a 3D reconstruction, we prove that an image pair acquired with two telecentric line-scan cameras can always be rectified to the epipolar standard configuration, in contrast to line-scan cameras with entocentric lenses, for which this is possible only under very restricted conditions. The rectification allows an arbitrary stereo algorithm to be used to calculate disparity images. We propose an efficient algorithm to compute 3D coordinates from these disparities. Experiments on real images show the validity of the proposed multi-view telecentric line-scan camera model.},

  abstract     = {Modern imaging devices can capture faithful color and characteristics of natural and man-made scenes. However, there exist conditions in which the light radiated by objects cannot reach the camera‚Äôs lens or it is naturally degraded. Thus, the resulting captured images suffer from color loss. This article addresses the problem of underwater image restoration by using an optics-based formulation to model the interaction between light and any underwater suspended particle. Our approach uses a factorial Markov random field (FMRF) to reformulate and solve the general nonlinear participating media optical model. This novel formulation also has the particularity of considering attenuation coefficients, beside global light, as to probabilistic latent variables, inferred from a single image. Due to this unique feature, our FMRF methodology for itself is enough to deal with images acquired in underwater scenes. The generality of our optical model makes it applicable in other participating media such as fog or haze, more commonly addressed in the current literature. Results have shown the capabilities to improve the degraded images using our methodology in several scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In practice, the objects of interest have some shape priors, which would be destroyed by occlusions, distortions and noises. Therefore, the characterization of the shape priors attracts increasing attention. This paper is devoted to characterization of convexity prior and its applications in objects segmentation in two-dimensional (2D) spaces using level set function. The shape convexity can be characterized by the Laplacian nonnegativity of the associated signed distance function on the whole image domain, zero-sublevel set and zero-superlevel set. This result is extended to characterization for multiple convex objects and ring shape object with outer, inner and both convex boundaries. One of the advantages of this method is that only one signed distance function is needed to characterize a single object, multiple objects and ring shape with boundary(ies) convexity prior. The characterization methods are incorporated into image segmentation model. In addition, some labels on the foreground and background and landmarks on the boundary of the object(s) can be taken into account as constraints to improve the accuracy of segmentation. A general and efficient numerical framework is developed to solve the proposed models using alternative direction method. Experiments on various images validated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed models and algorithms.},

In studying the empirical performance, we note that there are few failure cases reported in the literature, in particular for estimation problems with a single rotation, motivating us to gain further theoretical understanding. A general framework based on tools from algebraic geometry is introduced for analyzing the power of semidefinite relaxations of problems with quadratic objective functions and rotational constraints. Applications include registration, hand‚Äìeye calibration, and rotation averaging. We characterize the extreme points and show that there exist failure cases for which the relaxation is not tight, even in the case of a single rotation. We also show that some problem classes are always tight given an appropriate parametrization. Our theoretical findings are accompanied with numerical simulations, providing further evidence and understanding of the results.},

  abstract     = {Silhouettes are building elements of logos, graphic symbols and fonts. These shapes can be designed and exchanged in vector form, but more often they are drawn, printed, scanned, or directly found in digital images. Such raster forms require vectorization to get scale-invariant exchangeable formats. There is a need for a mathematically well-defined and justified shape vectorization process, which also provides a minimal set of control points with geometric meaning. In this paper, we propose a new silhouette vectorization paradigm. It extracts the outline of a 2D shape from a raster binary image and converts it to a combination of cubic B√©zier polygons and perfect circles. The proposed method uses the sub-pixel curvature extrema and affine scale-space for silhouette vectorization. By construction, our control points are geometrically stable under affine transformations. The proposed method can also be used as a reliable feature point detector for silhouettes. Compared to state-of-the-art image vectorization software, our algorithm demonstrates a superior reduction in the number of control points while maintaining high accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Tubular and membranous shapes display a wide range of morphologies that are difficult to analyze within a common framework. By generalizing the classical Helfrich energy of biomembranes, we model them as solutions to a curvature optimization problem in which the principal curvatures may play asymmetric roles. We then give a novel phase-field formulation to approximate this geometric problem, and study its Gamma-limsup convergence. This results in an efficient GPU algorithm that we validate on well-known minimizers of the Willmore energy; the software for the implementation of our algorithm is freely available online. Exploring the space of parameters reveals that this comprehensive framework leads to a wide continuum of shape textures. This first step towards a unifying theory will have several implications, in biology for quantifying tubular shapes or designing bio-mimetic scaffolds, but also in computer graphics, materials science, or architecture.},

  abstract     = {We present an information-theoretic approach to the registration of images with directional information, especially for diffusion-weighted images (DWIs), with explicit optimization over the directional scale. We call it locally orderless registration with directions (LORDs). We focus on normalized mutual information as a robust information-theoretic similarity measure for DWI. The framework is an extension of the LOR-DWI density-based hierarchical scale-space model that varies and optimizes the integration, spatial, directional and intensity scales. As affine transformations are insufficient for inter-subject registration, we extend the model to nonrigid deformations. We illustrate that the proposed model deforms orientation distribution functions (ODFs) correctly and is capable of handling the classic complex challenges in DWI registrations, such as the registration of fiber crossings along with kissing, fanning, and interleaving fibers. Our experimental results clearly illustrate a novel promising regularizing effect, which comes from the nonlinear orientation-based cost function. We show the properties of the different image scales, and we show that including orientational information in our model makes the model better at retrieving deformations in contrast to standard scalar-based registration.},
