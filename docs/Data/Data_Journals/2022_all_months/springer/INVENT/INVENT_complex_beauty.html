  abstract     = {Given an algebraic differential equation of order greater than one, it is shown that if there is any nontrivial algebraic relation amongst any number of distinct nonalgebraic solutions, along with their derivatives, then there is already such a relation between three solutions. In the autonomous situation when the equation is over constant parameters the assumption that the order be greater than one can be dropped, and a nontrivial algebraic relation exists already between two solutions. These theorems are deduced as an application of the following model-theoretic result: Suppose p is a stationary nonalgebraic type in the theory of differentially closed fields of characteristic zero; if any three distinct realisations of p are independent then p is minimal. If the type is over the constants then minimality (and complete disintegratedness) already follow from knowing that any two realisations are independent. An algebro-geometric formulation in terms of D-varieties is given. The same methods yield also an analogous statement about families of compact Kähler manifolds.},

In this article, we are interested in studying limits when $$\beta \rightarrow 0$$ of Kähler–Einstein metrics $$\omega _\beta $$ with a cone singularity of angle $$2\pi \beta $$ along D. In our first result, we assume that $$X\setminus D$$ is a locally symmetric space and we show that $$\omega _\beta $$ converges to the locally symmetric metric and further give asymptotics of $$\omega _\beta $$ when $$X\setminus D$$ is a ball quotient. Our second result deals with the case when X is Fano and D is anticanonical. We prove a folklore conjecture asserting that a rescaled limit of $$\omega _\beta $$ is the complete, Ricci flat Tian–Yau metric on $$X\setminus D$$ . Furthermore, we prove that $$(X,\omega _\beta )$$ converges to an interval in the Gromov–Hausdorff sense.},

We completely describe the behavior of the four eigenvalues close to zero of the linearized equations at the Stokes wave, as the Floquet exponent is turned on. We prove in particular the conjecture that a pair of non-purely imaginary eigenvalues depicts a closed figure “8”, parameterized by the Floquet exponent, in full agreement with numerical simulations. Our new spectral approach to the Benjamin-Feir instability phenomenon uses a symplectic version of Kato’s theory of similarity transformation to reduce the problem to determine the eigenvalues of a $$ 4 \times 4 $$ complex Hamiltonian and reversible matrix. Applying a procedure inspired by KAM theory, we block-diagonalize such matrix into a pair of $$2 \times 2 $$ Hamiltonian and reversible matrices, thus obtaining the full description of its eigenvalues.},

Revisiting a construction of Howard and Fouquet, we construct an explicit section $$\mathscr {P}$$ of a sheaf of Selmer groups over $$\mathscr {X}$$ . We show, answering a question of Howard, that $$\mathscr {P}$$ is a universal Heegner class, in the sense that it interpolates geometrically defined Heegner classes at all the relevant classical points of $$\mathscr {X}$$ . We also propose a ‘Bertolini–Darmon’ conjecture for the leading term of $$\mathscr {P}$$ at classical points. We then prove that the p-adic height of $$\mathscr {P}$$ is given by the cyclotomic derivative of a p-adic L-function. This formula over $$\mathscr {X}$$ (which is an identity of functionals on some universal ordinary automorphic representations) specialises at classical points to all the Gross–Zagier formulas for $$\mathrm {G}$$ that may be expected from representation-theoretic considerations. Combined with a result of Fouquet, the formula implies the p-adic analogue of the Beilinson–Bloch–Kato conjecture in analytic rank one, for the selfdual motives attached to Hilbert modular forms and their twists by CM Hecke characters. It also implies one half of the first example of a non-abelian Iwasawa main conjecture for derivatives, in $$2[F:\mathbf {Q}]$$ variables. Other applications include two different generic non-vanishing results for Heegner classes and p-adic heights.},

This provides partial or full answers to multiple open questions arising in the literature. The anisotropic energy is required to satisfy a novel ellipticity condition, which holds for instance in a $$C^{1,1}$$ neighborhood of the area functional. This condition is proved to imply the atomic condition. In particular we provide the first non-trivial class of examples of anisotropic energies in high codimension satisfying the atomic condition, addressing an open question in the field. As a byproduct, we deduce the rectifiability of varifolds (resp. of the mass of varifolds) with locally bounded anisotropic first variation for a $$C^{1,1}$$ (resp. $$C^1$$ ) neighborhood of the area functional. In addition to these examples, we also provide a class of anisotropic energies in high codimension, far from the area functional, for which the rectifiability of the mass of varifolds with locally bounded anisotropic first variation holds. To conclude, we show that the atomic condition excludes non-trivial Young measures in the case of anisotropic stationary graphs.},

The latter is defined as an associated isoperimetric type of deficit. The focus is mostly on the case $$n=3$$ (where it is explained why the estimates are optimal in their corresponding settings), but we also address the necessary adaptations for the results in higher dimensions. We also obtain linear stability estimates for both cases in all dimensions. These can be regarded as Korn-type inequalities for the combination of the quadratic form associated with the isometric (resp. conformal) deficit on $${\mathbb {S}}^{n-1}$$ and the isoperimetric one.},

We prove that primitive components $$\gamma _1, \dots ,\gamma _k$$ of a random multicurve $$m_1\gamma _1+\dots +m_k\gamma _k$$ represent linearly independent homology cycles with asymptotic probability 1 and that all its weights $$m_i$$ are equal to 1 with asymptotic probability $$\sqrt{2}/2$$ . We prove analogous properties for random square-tiled surfaces. In particular, we show that all conical singularities of a random square-tiled surface belong to the same leaf of the horizontal foliation and to the same leaf of the vertical foliation with asymptotic probability 1. We show that the number of components of a random multicurve and the number of maximal horizontal cylinders of a random square-tiled surface of genus g are both very well approximated by the number of cycles of a random permutation for an explicit non-uniform measure on the symmetric group of $$3g-3$$ elements. In particular, we prove that the expected value of these quantities has asymptotics $$(\log (6g-6) + \gamma )/2 + \log 2$$ as $$g\rightarrow \infty $$ , where $$\gamma $$ is the Euler–Mascheroni constant. These results are based on our formula for the Masur–Veech volume $${\text {Vol}}{\mathcal {Q}}_g$$ of the moduli space of holomorphic quadratic differentials combined with deep large genus asymptotic analysis of this formula performed by A. Aggarwal and with the uniform asymptotic formula for intersection numbers of $$\psi $$ -classes on $${\overline{{\mathcal {M}}}}_{g,n}$$ for large g proved by A. Aggarwal in 2020.},

More precisely, given a measurable set $$\Omega \subset {\mathbb {R}}^{2d}$$ having measure $$s&gt; 0$$ , we prove that the quantity $$\begin{aligned} \Phi _\Omega =\max \Big \{\int _\Omega |{\mathcal {V}}f(x,\omega )|^2\,dxd\omega : f\in L^2({\mathbb {R}}^d),\ \Vert f\Vert _{L^2}=1\Big \}, \end{aligned}$$ is largest possible if and only if $$\Omega $$ is equivalent, up to a negligible set, to a ball of measure s, and in this case we characterize all functions f that achieve equality. This result leads to a sharp uncertainty principle for the “essential support” of the STFT (when $$d=1$$ , this can be summarized by the optimal bound $$\Phi _\Omega \le 1-e^{-|\Omega |}$$ , with equality if and only if $$\Omega $$ is a ball). Our approach, using techniques from measure theory after suitably rephrasing the problem in the Fock space, also leads to a local version of Lieb’s uncertainty inequality for the STFT in $$L^p$$ when $$p\in [2,\infty )$$ , as well as to $$L^p$$ -concentration estimates when $$p\in [1,\infty )$$ , thus proving a related conjecture.

  abstract     = {The primary goal of this paper is to study Spanier–Whitehead duality in the K(n)-local category. One of the key players in the K(n)-local category is the Lubin–Tate spectrum $$E_n$$ , whose homotopy groups classify deformations of a formal group law of height n, in the implicit characteristic p. It is known that $$E_n$$ is self-dual up to a shift; however, that does not fully take into account the action of the automorphism group $${\mathbb {G}}_n$$ of the formal group in question. In this paper we find that the $${\mathbb {G}}_n$$ -equivariant dual of $$E_n$$ is in fact $$E_n$$ twisted by a sphere with a non-trivial (when $$n&gt;1$$ ) action by $${\mathbb {G}}_n$$ . This sphere is a dualizing module for the group $${\mathbb {G}}_n$$ , and we construct and study such an object $$I_{{\mathcal {G}}}$$ for any compact p-adic analytic group $${\mathcal {G}}$$ . If we restrict the action of $${\mathcal {G}}$$ on $$I_{{\mathcal {G}}}$$ to certain type of small subgroups, we identify $$I_{{\mathcal {G}}}$$ with a specific representation sphere coming from the Lie algebra of $${\mathcal {G}}$$ . This is done by a classification of p-complete sphere spectra with an action by an elementary abelian p-group in terms of characteristic classes, and then a specific comparison of the characteristic classes in question. The setup makes the theory quite accessible for computations, as we demonstrate in the later sections of this paper, determining the K(n)-local Spanier–Whitehead duals of $$E_n^{hH}$$ for select choices of p and n and finite subgroups H of $${\mathbb {G}}_n$$ .},

AMS, Providence, pp 199–230, 2018) in 2016, we construct and prove consistency of the canonical wall structure. This construction starts with a log Calabi–Yau pair (X, D) and produces a wall structure, as defined in Gross et al. (Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. 278(1376), 1376, 1–103, 2022). Roughly put, the canonical wall structure is a data structure which encodes an algebro-geometric analogue of counts of Maslov index zero disks. These enumerative invariants are defined in terms of the punctured invariants of Abramovich et al. (Punctured Gromov–Witten invariants, 2020. arXiv:2009.07720v2 [math.AG]). There are then two main theorems of the paper. First, we prove consistency of the canonical wall structure, so that, using the setup of Gross et al. (Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. 278(1376), 1376, 1–103, 2022), the canonical wall structure gives rise to a mirror family. Second, we prove that this mirror family coincides with the intrinsic mirror constructed in Gross and Siebert (Intrinsic mirror symmetry, 2019. arXiv:1909.07649v2 [math.AG]). While the setup of this paper is narrower than that of Gross and Siebert (Intrinsic mirror symmetry, 2019. arXiv:1909.07649v2 [math.AG]), it gives a more detailed description of the mirror.},

The Markoff morphisms act on $$V_{k}({\mathbb {Z}})$$ with finitely many orbits and a numerical study points to some basic conjectures about these “class numbers” and Hasse failures. Some of the analysis may be extended to less special affine cubic surfaces.},

The local well-posedness of this equation in the Sobolev spaces $$H^s({\mathop {{\mathbb {R}}}\nolimits })$$ is well understood since a couple of decades, while the global well-posedness is not completely settled. For the latter issue, the best known results up-to-date concern either Cauchy data in $$H^{\frac{1}{2}}({\mathop {{\mathbb {R}}}\nolimits })$$ with mass strictly less than $$4\pi $$ or general initial conditions in the weighted Sobolev space $$H^{2, 2}({\mathop {{\mathbb {R}}}\nolimits })$$ . In this article, we prove that the derivative nonlinear Schrödinger equation is globally well-posed for general Cauchy data in $$H^{\frac{1}{2}}({\mathop {{\mathbb {R}}}\nolimits })$$ and that furthermore the $$H^{\frac{1}{2}}$$ norm of the solutions remains globally bounded in time. The proof is achieved by combining the profile decomposition techniques with the integrability structure of the equation.},

In fact, provided that the lengths of the singular curves under consideration are bounded with respect to a given complete Riemannian metric, we demonstrate that such a set is a semianalytic curve. As a consequence, combining our techniques with recent developments on the regularity of sub-Riemannian minimizing geodesics, we prove that minimizing sub-Riemannian geodesics in 3-dimensional analytic manifolds are always of class $$C^1$$ , and actually they are analytic outside of a finite set of points.},

This is in contrast to the 2-dimensional case where the order of vanishing is a topological invariant. The proof uses the microlocal approach to dynamical zeta functions, giving a geometric description of generalized Pollicott–Ruelle resonant differential forms at 0 in the hyperbolic case and using first variation for the perturbation. To show that the first variation is generically nonzero we introduce a new identity relating pushforwards of products of resonant and coresonant 2-forms on the sphere bundle $$S\Sigma $$ with harmonic 1-forms on $$\Sigma $$ .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we prove the mean-convex neighborhood conjecture for neck singularities of the mean curvature flow in $${\mathbb {R}}^{n+1}$$ for all $$n\ge 3$$ : we show that if a mean curvature flow $$\{M_t\}$$ in $${\mathbb {R}}^{n+1}$$ has an $$S^{n-1}\times {\mathbb {R}}$$ singularity at $$(x_0,t_0)$$ , then there exists an $$\varepsilon =\varepsilon (x_0,t_0)&gt;0$$ such that $$M_t\cap B(x_0,\varepsilon )$$ is mean-convex for all $$t\in (t_0-\varepsilon ^2,t_0+\varepsilon ^2)$$ . As in the case $$n=2$$ , which was resolved by the first three authors in Choi et al. (Acta Math, 2018), the existence of such a mean-convex neighborhood follows from classifying a certain class of ancient Brakke flows that arise as potential blowup limits near a neck singularity. Specifically, we prove that any ancient unit-regular integral Brakke flow with a cylindrical blowdown must be either a round shrinking cylinder, a translating bowl soliton, or an ancient oval. In particular, combined with a prior result of the last two authors (Hershkovits and White in Commun Pure Appl Math 73(3):558–580, 2020), we obtain uniqueness of mean curvature flow through neck singularities. The main difficulty in addressing the higher dimensional case is in promoting the spectral analysis on the cylinder to global geometric properties of the solution. Most crucially, due to the potential wide variety of self-shrinking flows with entropy lower than the cylinder when $$n\ge 3$$ , smoothness does not follow from the spectral analysis by soft arguments. This precludes the use of the classical moving plane method to derive symmetry. To overcome this, we introduce a novel variant of the moving plane method, which we call “moving plane method without assuming smoothness”—where smoothness and symmetry are established in tandem.},

The set of Lorentzian metrics satisfying the curvature bounds has a non-empty interior in the sense of arbitrary, smooth perturbations of the metric, whereas all previous results on this problem impose conditions on the metric that force it to be real analytic with respect to a suitably defined time variable. The analogous problem on Riemannian manifolds is called the Calderón problem, and in this case the known results require the metric to be independent of one of the variables. Our approach is based on a new unique continuation result in the exterior region of double null cones. The approach shares features with the classical Boundary Control method, and can be viewed as a generalization of this method to cases where no real analyticity is assumed.},

They are formal power series analogues of elementary spherical functions on G in which the role of the quasi-simple admissible G-representations is replaced by Verma modules. For generic highest weight we express the formal elementary spherical functions in terms of Harish-Chandra series and integrate them to spherical functions on the regular part of G. We show that they produce eigenstates for spin versions of quantum hyperbolic Calogero–Moser systems. In the second part of the paper we define and study special subclasses of global and formal elementary spherical functions, which we call global and formal N-point spherical functions. Formal N-point spherical functions arise as limits of correlation functions for boundary Wess–Zumino–Witten conformal field theory on the cylinder when the position variables tend to infinity. We construct global N-point spherical functions in terms of compositions of equivariant differential intertwiners associated with principal series representations, and express them in terms of Eisenstein integrals. We show that the eigenstates of the quantum spin Calogero–Moser system associated to N-point spherical functions are also common eigenfunctions of a commuting family of first-order differential operators, which we call asymptotic boundary Knizhnik–Zamolodchikov–Bernard operators.

Lurie and show that the $$\infty $$ -categories of $$T\!\left( n\right) $$ -local spectra are $$\infty $$ -semiadditive for all n, where $$T\!\left( n\right) $$ is the telescope on a $$v_{n}$$ -self map of a type n spectrum. This generalizes and provides a new proof for the analogous result of Hopkins–Lurie on $$K\!\left( n\right) $$ -local spectra. Moreover, we show that $$K\!\left( n\right) $$ -local and $$T\!\left( n\right) $$ -local spectra are respectively, the minimal and maximal 1-semiadditive localizations of spectra with respect to a homotopy ring, and that all such localizations are in fact $$\infty $$ -semiadditive. As a consequence, we deduce that several different notions of “bounded chromatic height” for homotopy rings are equivalent, and in particular, that $$T\!\left( n\right) $$ -homology of $$\pi $$ -finite spaces depends only on the nth Postnikov truncation. A key ingredient in the proof of the main result is a construction of a certain power operation for commutative ring objects in stable 1-semiadditive $$\infty $$ -categories. This is closely related to some known constructions for Morava E-theory and is of independent interest. Using this power operation we also give a new proof, and a generalization, of a nilpotence conjecture of J. P. May, which was proved by A. Mathew, N. Naumann, and J. Noel.},

Our main structural result is that the boundary $$\partial X$$ is homeomorphic to a manifold away from a set of codimension 2, and is $$N-1$$ rectifiable. Along the way, we show effective measure bounds on the boundary and its tubular neighborhoods. These results are new even for Gromov–Hausdorff limits $$(M_i^N,{\mathsf {d}}_{g_i},p_i) \rightarrow (X,{\mathsf {d}},p)$$ of smooth manifolds with boundary, and require new techniques beyond those needed to prove the analogous statements for the regular set, in particular when it comes to the manifold structure of the boundary $$\partial X$$ . The key local result is an $$\varepsilon $$ -regularity theorem, which tells us that if a ball $$B_{2}(p)\subset X$$ is sufficiently close to a half space $$B_{2}(0)\subset {\mathbb {R}}^N_+$$ in the Gromov–Hausdorff sense, then $$B_1(p)$$ is biHölder to an open set of $${\mathbb {R}}^N_+$$ . In particular, $$\partial X$$ is itself homeomorphic to $$B_1(0^{N-1})$$ near $$B_1(p)$$ . Further, the boundary $$\partial X$$ is $$N-1$$ rectifiable and the boundary measure is Ahlfors regular on $$B_1(p)$$ with volume close to the Euclidean volume. Our second collection of results involve the stability of the boundary with respect to noncollapsed mGH convergence $$X_i\rightarrow X$$ . Specifically, we show a boundary volume convergence which tells us that the $$N-1$$ Hausdorff measures on the boundaries converge to the limit Hausdorff measure on $$\partial X$$ . We will see that a consequence of this is that if the $$X_i$$ are boundary free then so is X.},

Our main result is that the count of (possibly disconnected) essential surfaces in terms of their Euler characteristic always has a short generating function and hence has quasi-polynomial behavior. This gives remarkably concise formulae for the number of such surfaces, as well as detailed asymptotics. We give algorithms that allow us to compute these generating functions and the underlying surfaces, and apply these to almost 60,000 manifolds, providing a wealth of data about them. We use this data to explore the delicate question of counting only connected essential surfaces and propose some conjectures. Our methods involve normal and almost normal surfaces, especially the work of Tollefson and Oertel, combined with techniques pioneered by Ehrhart for counting lattice points in polyhedra with rational vertices. We also introduce a new way of testing if a normal surface in an ideal triangulation is essential that avoids cutting the manifold open along the surface; rather, we use almost normal surfaces in the original triangulation.},

By applying this theory we establish almost-sure local well-posedness for semilinear Schrödinger equations in the full subcritical range relative to the probabilistic scaling (Theorem 1.1). The solution we construct has an explicit expansion in terms of multilinear Gaussians with adapted random tensor coefficients. As a byproduct we also obtain new results concerning regular data and long-time solutions, in particular Theorem 1.6, which provides long-time control for random homogeneous data, demonstrating the highly nontrivial fact that the first energy cascade happens at a much later time than in the deterministic setting. In the random setting, the probabilistic scaling is the natural scaling for dispersive equations, and is different from the natural scaling for parabolic equations. Our theory of random tensors can be viewed as the dispersive counterpart of the existing parabolic theories (regularity structures, para-controlled calculus and renormalization group techniques).},

This is an analogue of Serre’s celebrated modularity conjecture (which concerned irreducible, odd representations $${\bar{\rho }}: \Gamma _{{\mathbb {Q}}} \rightarrow \mathrm {GL}_2(k)$$ ) for reducible, odd representations. Our proof lifts $${\bar{\rho }}$$ to an irreducible geometric p-adic representation $$\rho $$ which is known to arise from a newform by results of Skinner–Wiles and Pan. We likewise prove automorphy of many reducible representations $${\bar{\rho }}:\Gamma _{F} \rightarrow \mathrm {GL}_n(k)$$ when F is a global function field of characteristic different from p, by establishing a p-adic lifting theorem and invoking the work of L. Lafforgue. Crucially, in both cases we show that the actual representation $${\bar{\rho }}$$ , rather than just its semisimplification, arises from reduction of the geometric representation attached to a cuspidal automorphic representation. Our main theorem establishes a geometric lifting result for mod p representations $${\bar{\rho }}:\Gamma _{F} \rightarrow G(k)$$ of Galois groups of global fields F, valued in reductive groups G(k), and assumed to be odd when F is a number field. Thus we find that lifting theorems, combined with automorphy lifting results pioneered by Wiles in the number field case and the results in the global Langlands correspondence proved by Drinfeld and L. Lafforgue in the function field case, give the only known method to access modularity of mod p Galois representations both in reducible and irreducible cases.},

  abstract     = {Since their introduction by Erdős in 1950, covering systems (that is, finite collections of arithmetic progressions that cover the integers) have been extensively studied, and numerous questions and conjectures have been posed regarding the existence of covering systems with various properties. In particular, Erdős asked if the moduli can be distinct and all arbitrarily large, Erdős and Selfridge asked if the moduli can be distinct and all odd, and Schinzel conjectured that in any covering system there exists a pair of moduli, one of which divides the other. Another beautiful conjecture, proposed by Erdős and Graham in 1980, states that if the moduli are distinct elements of the interval [n, Cn], and n is sufficiently large, then the density of integers uncovered by the union is bounded below by a constant (depending only on C). This conjecture was confirmed (in a strong form) by Filaseta, Ford, Konyagin, Pomerance and Yu in 2007, who moreover asked whether the same conclusion holds if the moduli are distinct and sufficiently large, and $$\sum _{i=1}^k \frac{1}{d_i} 0$$ . We also show that no such lower bound (i.e., depending only on C) on the density of the uncovered set holds when $$\mu (p^i)$$ is replaced by any function of the form $$1+O(1/p)$$ . Our method has a number of further applications. Most importantly, as our second main theorem, we prove the conjecture of Schinzel stated above, which was made in 1967. We moreover give an alternative (somewhat simpler) proof of a breakthrough result of Hough, who resolved Erdős’ minimum modulus problem, with an improved bound on the smallest difference. Finally, we make further progress on the problem of Erdős and Selfridge.},

In an influential paper, Lebowitz et al. (J Stat Phys 50(3–4):657–687, 1988) proposed a critical mass threshold given by the mass of the ground state on the real line. We provide a proof for the optimality of this critical mass threshold. The proof also applies to the two-dimensional radial problem posed on the unit disc. In this case, we answer a question posed by Bourgain and Bulut (Ann Inst H Poincaré Anal Non Linéaire 31(6):1267–1288, 2014) on the optimal mass threshold. Furthermore, in the one-dimensional case, we show that the Gibbs measure is indeed normalizable at the optimal mass threshold, thus answering an open question posed by Lebowitz et al. (1988). This normalizability at the optimal mass threshold is rather striking in view of the minimal mass blowup solution for the focusing quintic nonlinear Schrödinger equation on the one-dimensional torus.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this paper is to show an unexpected connection between Diophantine approximation and the behavior of waves on black hole interiors with negative cosmological constant $$\Lambda &lt;0$$ and explore the consequences of this for the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture in general relativity. We study linear scalar perturbations $$\psi $$ of Kerr–AdS solving $$\Box _g\psi -\frac{2}{3}\Lambda \psi =0$$ with reflecting boundary conditions imposed at infinity. Understanding the behavior of $$\psi $$ at the Cauchy horizon corresponds to a linear analog of the problem of Strong Cosmic Censorship. Our main result shows that if the dimensionless black hole parameters mass $${\mathfrak {m}} = M \sqrt{-\Lambda }$$ and angular momentum $${\mathfrak {a}} = a \sqrt{-\Lambda }$$ satisfy a certain non-Diophantine condition, then perturbations $$\psi $$ arising from generic smooth initial data blow up $$|\psi |\rightarrow +\infty $$ at the Cauchy horizon. The proof crucially relies on a novel resonance phenomenon between stable trapping on the black hole exterior and the poles of the interior scattering operator that gives rise to a small divisors problem. Our result is in stark contrast to the result on Reissner–Nordström–AdS (Kehle in Commun Math Phys 376(1):145–200, 2020) as well as to previous work on the analogous problem for $$\Lambda \ge 0$$ —in both cases such linear scalar perturbations were shown to remain bounded. As a result of the non-Diophantine condition, the set of parameters $${\mathfrak {m}}, {\mathfrak {a}}$$ for which we show blow-up forms a Baire-generic but Lebesgue-exceptional subset of all parameters below the Hawking–Reall bound. On the other hand, we conjecture that for a set of parameters $${\mathfrak {m}}, {\mathfrak {a}} $$ which is Baire-exceptional but Lebesgue-generic, all linear scalar perturbations remain bounded at the Cauchy horizon $$|\psi |\le C$$ . This suggests that the validity of the $$C^0$$ -formulation of Strong Cosmic Censorship for $$\Lambda &lt;0$$ may change in a spectacular way according to the notion of genericity imposed.},

Let $${\mathbb {G}}$$ be a connected reductive subgroup of $$\mathrm{Aut}(X)_0$$ that contains a maximal torus of $$\mathrm{Aut}(X)_0$$ . We prove that X admits a Kähler–Einstein metric if and only if X is $${\mathbb {G}}$$ -uniformly K-stable. This proves a version of Yau–Tian–Donaldson conjecture for arbitrary singular Fano varieties. A key new ingredient is a valuative criterion for $${\mathbb {G}}$$ -uniform K-stability.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we prove a wall-crossing formula for $$\epsilon $$ -stable quasimaps to GIT quotients conjectured by Ciocan-Fontanine and Kim, for all targets in all genera, including the orbifold case. We prove that stability conditions in adjacent chambers give equivalent invariants, provided that both chambers are stable. In the case of genus-zero quasimaps with one marked point, we compute the invariants in the left-most stable chamber in terms of the small I-function. Using this we prove that the quasimap J-functions are on the Lagrangian cone of the Gromov–Witten theory. The proofs are based on virtual localization on a master space, obtained via some universal construction on the moduli of weighted curves. The fixed-point loci are in one-to-one correspondence with the terms in the wall-crossing formula.},

As a result of our study we obtain proofs (under relatively mild hypotheses) of Perrin-Riou’s Heegner point main conjecture, a p-converse to the theorem of Gross–Zagier and Kolyvagin, and the p-part of the Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer formula in analytic rank 1, for Eisenstein primes p.},

  abstract     = {We put forward a new method for obtaining quantitative lower bounds on the top Lyapunov exponent of stochastic differential equations. Our method combines (i) a new identity connecting the top Lyapunov exponent to a Fisher information-like functional of the stationary density of the Markov process tracking tangent directions with (ii) a novel, quantitative version of Hörmander’s hypoelliptic regularity theory in an $$L^1$$ framework which estimates this (degenerate) Fisher information from below by a $$W^{s,1}_{\mathrm {loc}}$$ Sobolev norm. This method is applicable to a wide range of systems beyond the reach of currently existing mathematically rigorous methods. As an initial application, we prove the positivity of the top Lyapunov exponent for a class of weakly-dissipative, weakly forced stochastic differential equations; in this paper we prove that this class includes the Lorenz 96 model in any dimension, provided the additive stochastic driving is applied to any consecutive pair of modes.},

This resolves a conjecture of Vasconcelos. We prove a similar result for the first Koszul homology module of I. When R is a localisation of a polynomial ring over a field K of characteristic zero, Vasconcelos conjectured that R/I is a reduced complete intersection if the module $$\Omega _{(R/I)/K}$$ of Kähler differentials has finite projective dimension; we prove this contingent on the Eisenbud-Mazur conjecture. The arguments exploit the structure of the homotopy Lie algebra associated to I in an essential way. By work of Avramov and Halperin, if every degree 2 element of the homotopy Lie algebra is radical, then I is generated by a regular sequence. Iyengar has shown that free summands of $$I/I^2$$ give rise to central elements of the homotopy Lie algebra, and we establish an analogous criterion for constructing radical elements, from which we deduce our main result.},

In a suitable range of energy supercritical parameters (d, p), we prove the existence of $${\mathcal {C}}^\infty $$ well localized spherically symmetric initial data such that the corresponding unique strong solution blows up in finite time. Unlike other known blow up mechanisms, the singularity formation does not occur by concentration of a soliton or through a self similar solution, which are unknown in the defocusing case, but via a front mechanism. Blow up is achieved by compression for the associated hydrodynamical flow which in turn produces a highly oscillatory singularity. The front blow up profile is chosen among the countable family of $${\mathcal {C}}^\infty $$ spherically symmetric self similar solutions to the compressible Euler equation whose existence and properties in a suitable range of parameters are established in the companion paper (Merle et al. in Preprint (2019)) under a non degeneracy condition which is checked numerically.},
