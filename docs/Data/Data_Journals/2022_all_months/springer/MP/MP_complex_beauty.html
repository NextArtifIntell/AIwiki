  abstract     = {The paper investigates analytical properties of dynamic probabilistic constraints (chance constraints). The underlying random distribution is supposed to be continuous. In the first part, a general multistage model with decision rules depending on past observations of the random process is analyzed. Basic properties like (weak sequential) (semi-) continuity of the probability function or existence of solutions are studied. It turns out that the results differ significantly according to whether decision rules are embedded into Lebesgue or Sobolev spaces. In the second part, the simplest meaningful two-stage model with decision rules from $$L^2$$ is investigated. More specific properties like Lipschitz continuity and differentiability of the probability function are considered. Explicitly verifiable conditions for these properties are provided along with explicit gradient formulae in the Gaussian case. The application of such formulae in the context of necessary optimality conditions is discussed and a concrete identification of solutions presented.},

  abstract     = {We study multistage distributionally robust mixed-integer programs under endogenous uncertainty, where the probability distribution of stage-wise uncertainty depends on the decisions made in previous stages. We first consider two ambiguity sets defined by decision-dependent bounds on the first and second moments of uncertain parameters and by mean and covariance matrix that exactly match decision-dependent empirical ones, respectively. For both sets, we show that the subproblem in each stage can be recast as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). Moreover, we extend the general moment-based ambiguity set in Delage and Ye (Oper Res 58(3):595–612, 2010) to the multistage decision-dependent setting, and derive mixed-integer semidefinite programming (MISDP) reformulations of stage-wise subproblems. We develop methods for attaining lower and upper bounds of the optimal objective value of the multistage MISDPs, and approximate them using a series of MILPs. We deploy the Stochastic Dual Dynamic integer Programming (SDDiP) method for solving the problem under the three ambiguity sets with risk-neutral or risk-averse objective functions, and conduct numerical studies on multistage facility-location instances having diverse sizes under different parameter and uncertainty settings. Our results show that the SDDiP quickly finds optimal solutions for moderate-sized instances under the first two ambiguity sets, and also finds good approximate bounds for the multistage MISDPs derived under the third ambiguity set. We also demonstrate the efficacy of incorporating decision-dependent distributional ambiguity in multistage decision-making processes.},

NC-NBD is based on solving dynamically improved mixed-integer linear outer approximations of the MINLP, obtained by piecewise linear relaxations of nonlinear functions. Those MILPs are solved to global optimality using an enhancement of nested Benders decomposition, in which regularization, dynamically refined binary approximations of the state variables and Lagrangian cut techniques are combined to generate Lipschitz continuous non-convex approximations of the value functions. Those approximations are then used to decide whether the approximating MILP has to be dynamically refined and in order to compute feasible solutions for the original MINLP. We prove that NC-NBD converges to an $$\varepsilon $$ -optimal solution in a finite number of steps. We provide promising computational results for some unit commitment problems of moderate size.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study multistage stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MS-MINLP). This general class of problems encompasses, as important special cases, multistage stochastic convex optimization with non-Lipschitzian value functions and multistage stochastic mixed-integer linear optimization. We develop stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP) type algorithms with nested decomposition, deterministic sampling, and stochastic sampling. The key ingredient is a new type of cuts based on generalized conjugacy. Several interesting classes of MS-MINLP are identified, where the new algorithms are guaranteed to obtain the global optimum without the assumption of complete recourse. This significantly generalizes the classic SDDP algorithms. We also characterize the iteration complexity of the proposed algorithms. In particular, for a $$(T+1)$$ -stage stochastic MINLP satisfying L-exact Lipschitz regularization with d-dimensional state spaces, to obtain an $$\varepsilon $$ -optimal root node solution, we prove that the number of iterations of the proposed deterministic sampling algorithm is upper bounded by $${\mathcal {O}}((\frac{2LT}{\varepsilon })^d)$$ , and is lower bounded by $${\mathcal {O}}((\frac{LT}{4\varepsilon })^d)$$ for the general case or by $${\mathcal {O}}((\frac{LT}{8\varepsilon })^{d/2-1})$$ for the convex case. This shows that the obtained complexity bounds are rather sharp. It also reveals that the iteration complexity depends polynomially on the number of stages. We further show that the iteration complexity depends linearly on T, if all the state spaces are finite sets, or if we seek a $$(T\varepsilon )$$ -optimal solution when the state spaces are infinite sets, i.e. allowing the optimality gap to scale with T. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that reports global optimization algorithms as well as iteration complexity results for solving such a large class of multistage stochastic programs. The iteration complexity study resolves a conjecture by the late Prof. Shabbir Ahmed in the general setting of multistage stochastic mixed-integer optimization.},

  abstract     = {We propose a dynamic version of the classical node packing problem, also called the stable set or independent set problem. The problem is defined by a node set, a node weight vector, and an edge probability vector. For every pair of nodes, an edge is present or not according to an independent Bernoulli random variable defined by the corresponding entry in the probability vector. At each step, the decision maker selects an available node that maximizes the expected weight of the final packing, and then observes edges adjacent to this node. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and show that it is NP-Hard even on star graphs. Next, we introduce relaxations of the problem’s achievable probabilities polytope, analogous to the linear and bilinear edge-based formulations in the deterministic case; we show that these relaxations can be weak, motivating a polyhedral study. We derive classes of valid inequalities arising from cliques, paths, and cycles. For cliques, we completely characterize the polytope and show that it is a submodular polyhedron. For both paths and cycles, we give an implicit representation of the polytope via a cut-generating linear program of polynomial size based on a compact dynamic programming formulation. Our computational results show that our inequalities can greatly reduce the upper bound and improve the linear relaxation’s gap, particularly when the instance’s expected density is high.},

We interpret this pricing problem as a zero-sum game between the seller, who chooses a selling mechanism, and a fictitious adversary or ‘nature’, who chooses the buyer’s values from within the uncertainty set. Using duality techniques rooted in robust optimization, we prove that this game admits a Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies that can be computed in closed form. The Nash strategy of the seller is a randomized posted price mechanism under which the goods are sold separately, while the Nash strategy of nature is a distribution on the uncertainty set under which the buyer’s values are comonotonic. We further show that the restriction of the pricing problem to deterministic mechanisms is solved by a deteministic posted price mechanism under which the goods are sold separately.},

  abstract     = {Optimization problems with uncertain black-box constraints, modeled by warped Gaussian processes, have recently been considered in the Bayesian optimization setting. This work considers optimization problems with aggregated black-box constraints. Each aggregated black-box constraint sums several draws from the same black-box function with different decision variables as arguments in each individual black-box term. Such constraints are important in applications where, e.g., safety-critical measures are aggregated over multiple time periods. Our approach, which uses robust optimization, reformulates these uncertain constraints into deterministic constraints guaranteed to be satisfied with a specified probability, i.e., deterministic approximations to a chance constraint. While robust optimization typically considers parametric uncertainty, our approach considers uncertain functions modeled by warped Gaussian processes. We analyze convexity conditions and propose a custom global optimization strategy for non-convex cases. A case study derived from production planning and an industrially relevant example from oil well drilling show that the approach effectively mitigates uncertainty in the learned curves. For the drill scheduling example, we develop a custom strategy for globally optimizing integer decisions.},

Seeking an appropriately defined local minimum, we propose an iterative adaptive sampling algorithm that, during each iteration, performs a statistical local optimality test followed by a line search when the test detects a stochastic descent direction. We prove a number of results. First, the true function values at the iterates generated by the algorithm form an almost-supermartingale process, and the iterates are absorbed with probability one into the set of local minima in finite time. Second, such absorption happens exponentially fast in iteration number and in oracle calls. This result is analogous to non-standard rate guarantees in stochastic continuous optimization contexts that involve sharp minima. Third, the oracle complexity of the proposed algorithm increases linearly in the dimensionality of the local neighborhood. As a solver, primarily due to combining line searches that use common random numbers with statistical tests for local optimality, the proposed algorithm is effective on a variety of problems. We illustrate such performance using three problem suites, on problems ranging from 25 to 200 dimensions.},

Fixing first-stage variables, we formulate a second-stage subproblem for each element, and exploiting information from the dual of these problems, we provide conditions that the partition must satisfy to obtain an optimal solution. These conditions provide guidance on how to refine the partition, iteratively approaching an optimal solution. The results from computational experiments show how the method automatically refines the partition of the uncertainty space in the regions of interest for the problem.

Next, we analyze the rate of convergence of optimal solutions of the SAA to optimal solutions of the true problem for problems with a finite feasible region, such as bounded integer programming problems. For problems with non-finite feasible region, we propose modified “padded” SAA problems and demonstrate in two cases that such problems can yield, with high confidence, solutions that are certain to have a feasible recourse decision.

The existing MIP formulations are known to have weak continuous relaxation bounds, and, consequently, for hard instances with small radius, or with large problem sizes, the branch-and-bound based solution processes suffer from large optimality gaps even after hours of computation time. This significantly hinders the practical application of the DR-CCP paradigm. Motivated by these challenges, we conduct a polyhedral study to strengthen these formulations. We reveal several hidden connections between DR-CCP and its nominal counterpart (the sample average approximation), mixing sets, and robust 0–1 programming. By exploiting these connections in combination, we provide an improved formulation and two classes of valid inequalities for DR-CCP. We test the impact of our results on a stochastic transportation problem numerically. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach; in particular our improved formulation and proposed valid inequalities reduce the overall solution times remarkably. Moreover, this allows us to significantly scale up the problem sizes that can be handled in such DR-CCP formulations by reducing the solution times from hours to seconds.},

  abstract     = {In a bottleneck combinatorial problem, the objective is to minimize the highest cost of elements of a subset selected from the combinatorial solution space. This paper studies data-driven distributionally robust bottleneck combinatorial problems (DRBCP) with stochastic costs, where the probability distribution of the cost vector is contained in a ball of distributions centered at the empirical distribution specified by the Wasserstein distance. We study two distinct versions of DRBCP from different applications: (i) Motivated by the multi-hop wireless network application, we first study the uncertainty quantification of DRBCP (denoted by DRBCP-U), where decision-makers would like to have an accurate estimation of the worst-case value of DRBCP. The difficulty of DRBCP-U is to handle its max–min–max form. Fortunately, similar to the strong duality of linear programming, the alternative forms of the bottleneck combinatorial problems using clutters and blocking systems allow us to derive equivalent deterministic reformulations, which can be computed via mixed-integer programs. In addition, by drawing the connection between DRBCP-U and its sampling average approximation counterpart under empirical distribution, we show that the Wasserstein radius can be chosen in the order of negative square root of sample size, improving the existing known results; and (ii) Next, motivated by the ride-sharing application, decision-makers choose the best service-and-passenger matching that minimizes the unfairness. That is, we study the decision-making DRBCP, denoted by DRBCP-D. For DRBCP-D, we show that its optimal solution is also optimal to its sampling average approximation counterpart, and the Wasserstein radius can be chosen in a similar order as DRBCP-U. When the sample size is small, we propose to use the optimal value of DRBCP-D to construct an indifferent solution space and propose an alternative decision-robust model, which finds the best indifferent solution to minimize the empirical variance. We further show that the decision robust model can be recast as a mixed-integer conic program. Finally, we extend the proposed models and solution approaches to the distributionally robust $$\varGamma $$ —sum bottleneck combinatorial problem ( $$\hbox {DR}\varGamma \hbox {BCP}$$ ), where decision-makers are interested in minimizing the worst-case sum of $$\varGamma $$ highest costs of elements.},

Besides that, we prove that an approximation factor for the underlying problem can be carried over to our problem. Finally, we present exact approaches including a branch-and-price algorithm.

  abstract     = {Novel convex and concave relaxations are proposed for the solutions of parametric ordinary differential equations (ODEs), to aid in furnishing bounding information for deterministic global dynamic optimization methods. These relaxations are constructed as the solutions of auxiliary ODE systems with embedded convex optimization problems, whose objective functions employ convex and concave relaxations of the original ODE right-hand side. Unlike established relaxation methods, any valid convex and concave relaxations for the original right-hand side are permitted in the approach, including the McCormick relaxations and the $$\alpha $$ BB relaxations. In general, tighter such relaxations will necessarily translate into tighter relaxations for the ODE solutions, thus providing tighter bounding information for an overarching global dynamic optimization method. Notably, if McCormick relaxations are employed in the new approach, then the obtained relaxations are guaranteed to be at least as tight as state-of-the-art ODE relaxations based on generalized McCormick relaxations. The new relaxations converge rapidly to the original system as the considered parametric subdomain shrinks. Several examples are presented for comparison with established ODE relaxations, based on a proof-of-concept implementation in MATLAB. In a global optimization case study, the new ODE relaxations are shown to lead to fewer branch-and-bound global optimization iterations than state-of-the-art relaxations.},

  abstract     = {The network reconfiguration problem seeks to find a rooted tree T such that the energy of the (unique) feasible electrical flow over T is minimized. The tree requirement on the support of the flow is motivated by operational constraints in electricity distribution networks. The bulk of existing results on convex optimization over vertices of polytopes and on the structure of electrical flows do not easily give guarantees for this problem, while many heuristic methods have been developed in the power systems community as early as 1989. Our main contribution is to give the first provable approximation guarantees for the network reconfiguration problem. We provide novel lower bounds and corresponding approximation factors for various settings ranging from $$\min {{\mathcal {O}}(m-n), {\mathcal {O}}(n)}$$ for general graphs, to $${\mathcal {O}}(\sqrt{n})$$ over grids with uniform resistances on edges, and $${\mathcal {O}}(1)$$ for grids with uniform edge resistances and demands. To obtain the result for general graphs, we propose a new method for (approximate) spectral graph sparsification, which may be of independent interest. Using insights from our theoretical results, we propose a general heuristic for the network reconfiguration problem that is orders of magnitude faster than existing methods in the literature, while obtaining comparable performance.},

Such problems are called loosely coupled or nearly decomposable. In this paper, we exploit the idea of resource-directive decomposition to reformulate the problem so that it can be decomposed into a resource-directive master problem and a set of multiobjective programming subproblems. Recent methods developed for solving multiobjective problems enable us to formulate a relaxation of the master problem that is an IP whose solution yields a dual bound on the value of the original IP. This perspective provides a new, general framework for IP decomposition, in which many alternative algorithm designs are possible. Here, we develop one such algorithm, and demonstrate its viability and potential benefits with the aid of computational experiments knapsack-based instances with up to five coupling constraints and 7500 variables, comparing it with both a standard IP solver and a generic branch-and-price solver.},

  abstract     = {We consider the least squares regression problem, penalized with a combination of the $$\ell _{0}$$ and squared $$\ell _{2}$$ penalty functions (a.k.a. $$\ell _0 \ell _2$$ regularization). Recent work shows that the resulting estimators enjoy appealing statistical properties in many high-dimensional settings. However, exact computation of these estimators remains a major challenge. Indeed, modern exact methods, based on mixed integer programming (MIP), face difficulties for problems where the number of features $$p \sim 10^4$$ . In this work, we present a new exact MIP framework for $$\ell _0\ell _2$$ -regularized regression that can scale to $$p \sim 10^7$$ , achieving speedups of at least 5000x, compared to state-of-the-art exact methods. Unlike recent work, which relies on commercial MIP solvers, we design a specialized nonlinear branch-and-bound (BnB) framework, by critically exploiting the problem structure. A key distinguishing component in our framework lies in efficiently solving the node relaxations using a specialized first-order method, based on coordinate descent (CD). Our CD-based method effectively leverages information across the BnB nodes through using warm starts, active sets, and gradient screening. In addition, we design a novel method for obtaining dual bounds from primal CD solutions, which certifiably works in high dimensions. Experiments on synthetic and real high-dimensional datasets demonstrate that our framework is not only significantly faster than the state of the art, but can also deliver certifiably optimal solutions to statistically challenging instances that cannot be solved with existing methods. We open source the implementation through our toolkit L0BnB.},

Clique relaxations, such as s-defective clique and s-plex, emerged as attractive, more practical alternatives to cliques in network-based cluster detection models arising in numerous applications. This paper establishes continuous cubic formulations for the maximum s-defective clique problem and the maximum s-plex problem by generalizing the Motzkin–Straus formulation to the corresponding clique relaxations. The formulations are used to extend Turán’s theorem and other known lower bounds on the clique number to the considered clique relaxations. Results of preliminary numerical experiments with the CONOPT solver demonstrate that the proposed formulations can be used to quickly compute high-quality solutions for the maximum s-defective clique problem and the maximum s-plex problem.

  abstract     = {We study the polyhedral structure of a mixed 0-1 set arising from the submodular maximization problem, given by $$P = {(w,x)\in {\mathbb {R}}\times {0,1}^n: w\le f(x), x\in {\mathcal {X}}}$$ , where submodular function f(x) is represented by a concave function composed with an affine function, and $${\mathcal {X}}$$ is the feasible region of binary variables x. For $${\mathcal {X}}= {0,1}^n$$ , two families of facet-defining inequalities are proposed for the convex hull of P through restriction and lifting using submodular inequalities. When $${\mathcal {X}}$$ involves multiple disjoint cardinality constraints, we propose a new class of facet-defining inequalities for the convex hull of P through multidimensional sequence independent lifting. The derived polyhedral results not only strengthen and generalize some existing developments in the literature, but are also linked to the classical results for the mixed 0-1 knapsack and single-node flow sets. Our computational study on a set of randomly generated submodular maximization instances demonstrates the superiority of the proposed facet-defining inequalities within a branch-and-cut scheme.},

  abstract     = {We study a family of discrete optimization problems asking for the maximization of the expected value of a concave, strictly increasing, and differentiable function composed with a set-union operator. The expected value is computed with respect to a set of coefficients taking values from a discrete set of scenarios. The function models the utility function of the decision maker, while the set-union operator models a covering relationship between two ground sets, a set of items and a set of metaitems. This problem generalizes the problem introduced by Ahmed S, Atamtürk A (Mathematical programming 128(1-2):149–169, 2011), and it can be modeled as a mixed integer nonlinear program involving binary decision variables associated with the items and metaitems. Its goal is to find a subset of metaitems that maximizes the total utility corresponding to the items it covers. It has applications to, among others, maximal covering location, and influence maximization problems. In the paper, we propose a double-hypograph decomposition which allows for projecting out the variables associated with the items by separately exploiting the structural properties of the utility function and of the set-union operator. Thanks to it, the utility function is linearized via an exact outer-approximation technique, whereas the set-union operator is linearized in two ways: either (i) via a reformulation based on submodular cuts, or (ii) via a Benders decomposition. We analyze from a theoretical perspective the strength of the inequalities of the resulting reformulations, and embed them into two branch-and-cut algorithms. We also show how to extend our reformulations to the case where the utility function is not necessarily increasing. We then experimentally compare our algorithms inter se, to a standard reformulation based on submodular cuts, to a state-of-the-art global-optimization solver, and to the greedy algorithm for the maximization of a submodular function. The results reveal that, on our testbed, the method based on combining an outer approximation with Benders cuts significantly outperforms the other ones.},

In this technical note we prove that the Wasserstein ball is weakly compact under mild conditions, and we offer necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal solutions. We also characterize the sparsity of solutions if the Wasserstein ball is centred at a discrete reference measure. In comparison with the existing literature, which has proved similar results under different conditions, our proofs are self-contained and shorter, yet mathematically rigorous, and our necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal solutions are easily verifiable in practice.},

By exploiting the close link between the notion of trimmings of a probability measure and the partial mass transportation problem, we construct a data-driven Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) framework to hedge the decision against the intrinsic error in the process of inferring conditional information from limited joint data. We show that our approach is computationally as tractable as the standard (without side information) Wasserstein-metric-based DRO and enjoys performance guarantees. Furthermore, our DRO framework can be conveniently used to address data-driven decision-making problems under contaminated samples. Finally, the theoretical results are illustrated using a single-item newsvendor problem and a portfolio allocation problem with side information.},

This discrete notion, along with its fractional counterpart, showed up earlier in the literature under various names. The domain we consider is an M-convex set, that is, the set of integral elements of an integral base-polyhedron. A fundamental difference between the fractional and the discrete case is that a base-polyhedron has always a unique dec-min element, while the set of dec-min elements of an M-convex set admits a rich structure, described here with the help of a ‘canonical chain’. As a consequence, we prove that this set arises from a matroid by translating the characteristic vectors of its bases with an integral vector. By relying on these characterizations, we prove that an element is dec-min if and only if the square-sum of its components is minimum, a property resulting in a new type of min-max theorems. The characterizations also give rise, as shown in the companion paper, to a strongly polynomial algorithm, and to several applications in the areas of resource allocation, network flow, matroid, and graph orientation problems, which actually provided a major motivation to the present investigations. In particular, we prove a conjecture on graph orientation.},

Given a function $$\varPhi : {\mathbb {R}}^d \rightarrow {\mathbb {R}}$$ that is convex and twice continuously differentiable, we study a closed-loop control system that is governed by the operators $$\nabla \varPhi $$ and $$\nabla ^2 \varPhi $$ together with a feedback control law $$\lambda (\cdot )$$ satisfying the algebraic equation $$(\lambda (t))^p\Vert \nabla \varPhi (x(t))\Vert ^{p-1} = \theta $$ for some $$\theta \in (0, 1)$$ . Our first contribution is to prove the existence and uniqueness of a local solution to this system via the Banach fixed-point theorem. We present a simple yet nontrivial Lyapunov function that allows us to establish the existence and uniqueness of a global solution under certain regularity conditions and analyze the convergence properties of trajectories. The rate of convergence is $$O(1/t^{(3p+1)/2})$$ in terms of objective function gap and $$O(1/t^{3p})$$ in terms of squared gradient norm. Our second contribution is to provide two algorithmic frameworks obtained from discretization of our continuous-time system, one of which generalizes the large-step A-HPE framework of Monteiro and Svaiter (SIAM J Optim 23(2):1092–1125, 2013) and the other of which leads to a new optimal p-th order tensor algorithm. While our discrete-time analysis can be seen as a simplification and generalization of Monteiro and Svaiter (2013), it is largely motivated by the aforementioned continuous-time analysis, demonstrating the fundamental role that the feedback control plays in optimal acceleration and the clear advantage that the continuous-time perspective brings to algorithmic design. A highlight of our analysis is that we show that all of the p-th order optimal tensor algorithms that we discuss minimize the squared gradient norm at a rate of $$O(k^{-3p})$$ , which complements the recent analysis in Gasnikov et al.

In this paper, we resolve this numerical challenge by developing a fast Newton-type algorithm. As a theoretical cornerstone, we establish a first-order optimality condition for SNP based on the concept of strong $$\beta $$ -Lagrangian stationarity via the Lagrangian function, and reformulate it as a system of nonlinear equations called the Lagrangian equations. The nonsingularity of the corresponding Jacobian is discussed, based on which the Lagrange–Newton algorithm (LNA) is then proposed. Under mild conditions, we establish the locally quadratic convergence and its iterative complexity estimation. To further demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of our proposed algorithm, we apply LNA to two specific problems arising from compressed sensing and sparse high-order portfolio selection, in which significant benefits accrue from the restricted Newton step.},

  abstract     = {The notion of best approximation mapping (BAM) with respect to a closed affine subspace in finite-dimensional spaces was introduced by Behling, Bello Cruz and Santos to show the linear convergence of the block-wise circumcentered-reflection method. The best approximation mapping possesses two critical properties of the circumcenter mapping for linear convergence. Because the iteration sequence of a BAM linearly converges, the BAM is interesting in its own right. In this paper, we naturally extend the definition of BAM from closed affine subspaces to nonempty closed convex sets and from $${\mathbb {R}}^{n}$$ to general Hilbert spaces. We discover that the convex set associated with the BAM must be the fixed point set of the BAM. Hence, the iteration sequence generated by a BAM linearly converges to the nearest fixed point of the BAM. Connections between BAMs and other mappings generating convergent iteration sequences are considered. Behling et al. proved that the finite composition of BAMs associated with closed affine subspaces is still a BAM in $${\mathbb {R}}^{n}$$ . We generalize their result from $${\mathbb {R}}^{n}$$ to general Hilbert spaces and also construct a new constant associated with the composition of BAMs. This provides a new proof of the linear convergence of the method of alternating projections. Moreover, compositions of BAMs associated with general convex sets are investigated. In addition, we show that convex combinations of BAMs associated with affine subspaces are BAMs. Last but not least, we connect BAMs with circumcenter mappings in Hilbert spaces and we report on Cegielski’s results on relationships with strongly quasinonexpansive mappings.},

Discrete 2-convexity generalizes known classes of integrally convex functions such as the well-established M-/M $${}^\natural $$ -convex and L-/L $${}^\natural $$ -convex functions by Murota et al., the recently investigated globally/locally discrete midpoint convex functions by Moriguchi, Murota, Tamura, and Tardella, the directed discrete midpoint convex functions by Tamura and Tsurumi, and BS $${}^*$$ -convex and UJ-convex functions by one of the authors. We provide a unifying view of all these functions within the class of integrally convex functions having discrete 2-convexity. We also introduce a new subclass of discrete 2-convex functions, called signed discrete 2-convex functions and we consider signed discrete 2-convex functions with a locally hereditary orientation property. We show that parallelogram inequalities, scalability, and proximity hold for such signed discrete 2-convex functions, which include globally/locally discrete midpoint convex functions and directed discrete midpoint convex functions. Hence, our results extend similar results recently established by Moriguchi, Murota, Tamura, and Tardella and by Tamura and Tsurumi.},

A new dynamical system, called Nesterov accelerated gradient (NAG) flow, is derived from the connection between acceleration mechanism and A-stability of ODE solvers, and the exponential decay of a tailored Lyapunov function along with the solution trajectory is proved. Numerical discretizations of NAG flow are then considered and convergence rates are established via a discrete Lyapunov function. The proposed differential equation solver approach can not only cover existing accelerated methods, such as FISTA, Güler’s proximal algorithm and Nesterov’s accelerated gradient method, but also produce new algorithms for composite convex optimization that possess accelerated convergence rates. Both the convex and the strongly convex cases are handled in a unified way in our approach.},

Unfortunately, current stopping criteria for SGD methods are often heuristics that rely on asymptotic normality results or convergence to stationary distributions, which may fail to exist for nonconvex functions and, thereby, limit the applicability of such stopping criteria. To address this issue, in this work, we rigorously develop two stopping criteria for SGD that can be applied to a broad class of nonconvex functions, which we term Bottou-Curtis-Nocedal functions. Moreover, as a prerequisite for developing these stopping criteria, we prove that the gradient function evaluated at SGD’s iterates converges strongly to zero for Bottou-Curtis-Nocedal functions, which addresses an open question in the SGD literature. As a result of our work, our rigorously developed stopping criteria can be used to develop new adaptive step size schemes or bolster other downstream analyses for nonconvex functions.},

However, these have important applications, e.g., in the analysis of electricity and gas markets, where often a limited number of firms interacts on various subsequent markets. In this paper, we consider a special class of two-level multi-leader multi-follower games that can be applied, e.g., to model strategic booking decisions in the European entry-exit gas market. For this nontrivial class of games, we develop a solution algorithm that is able to compute the complete set of Nash equilibria instead of just individual solutions or a bigger set of stationary points. Additionally, we prove that for this class of games, the solution set is finite and provide examples for instances without any Nash equilibria in pure strategies. We apply the algorithm to a case study in which we compute strategic booking and nomination decisions in a model of the European entry-exit gas market system. Finally, we use our algorithm to provide a publicly available test library for the considered class of multi-leader multi-follower games. This library contains problem instances with different economic and mathematical properties so that other researchers in the field can test and benchmark newly developed methods for this challenging class of problems.},

With this as motivation, we propose new mixed integer programs (MIPs) for the clique problem that have more desirable worst-case properties, especially for sparse graphs. The smallest MIP that we propose has just $$O(n+m)$$ nonzeros for graphs with n vertices and m edges. Nevertheless, it ensures a root LP bound of at most $$d+1$$ , where d denotes the graph’s degeneracy (a measure of density), and is solved in $$O(2^d n)$$ branch-and-bound nodes. Meanwhile, the strongest MIP that we propose visits fewer nodes, $$O(1.62^d n)$$ . Further, when a best-bound node selection strategy is used, $$O(2^g n)$$ nodes are visited, where $$g=(d+1)-\omega $$ is the clique-core gap. Often, g is so small that it can be treated as a constant in which case O(n) nodes are visited. Experiments are conducted to understand their performance in practice.},

It has only been scarcely adopted in the literature so far, despite the great flexibility in designing algorithmic proofs for the completeness of polyhedral descriptions that it offers. We suspect that this is partly due to the rather heavy algebraic framework its original statement entails. This is why we present a much more lightweight and accessible approach to Zuckerberg’s proof technique, building on ideas from Gupte et al. (Discrete Optim 36:100569, 2020). We introduce the concept of set characterizations to replace the set-theoretic expressions needed in the original version and to facilitate the construction of algorithmic proof schemes. Along with this, we develop several different strategies to conduct Zuckerberg-type convex-hull proofs. Very importantly, we also show that our concept allows for a significant extension of Zuckerberg’s proof technique. While the original method was only applicable to 0/1-polytopes, our extended framework allows to treat arbitrary polyhedra and even general convex sets. We demonstrate this increase in expressive power by characterizing the convex hull of Boolean and bilinear functions over polytopal domains. All results are illustrated with indicative examples to underline the practical usefulness and wide applicability of our framework.},

This problem spans multiple domains including quantum mechanics and chemistry sciences and we investigate the geometric properties of this optimization problem. Fourth-order optimality conditions are derived for characterizing local and global minima. When the matrix in the quadratic term is diagonal, the problem has no spurious local minima and global solutions can be represented explicitly and calculated in $$O(n\log {n})$$ operations. When A is a rank one matrix, the global minima of the problem are unique under certain phase shift schemes. The strict-saddle property, which can imply polynomial time convergence of second-order-type algorithms, is established when the coefficient $$\beta $$ of the quartic term is either at least $$O(n^{3/2})$$ or not larger than O(1). Finally, the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz exponent of quartic–quadratic problem is estimated and it is shown that the largest exponent is at least 1/4 for a broad class of stationary points.},

Herein, a configuration describes a possible placement on one of the target locations, and the IP is used to choose suitable configurations covering the items. We give an augmented IP formulation, which we call the module configuration IP. It can be described within the framework of n-fold integer programming and, therefore, be solved efficiently. As an application, we consider scheduling problems with setup times in which a set of jobs has to be scheduled on a set of identical machines with the objective of minimizing the makespan. For instance, we investigate the case that jobs can be split and scheduled on multiple machines. However, before a part of a job can be processed, an uninterrupted setup depending on the job has to be paid. For both of the variants that jobs can be executed in parallel or not, we obtain an efficient polynomial time approximation scheme (EPTAS) of running time $$f(1/\varepsilon )\cdot \mathrm {poly}(|I|)$$ . Previously, only constant factor approximations of 5/3 and $$4/3 + \varepsilon $$ , respectively, were known. Furthermore, we present an EPTAS for a problem where classes of (non-splittable) jobs are given, and a setup has to be paid for each class of jobs being executed on one machine.},

The central tool is an exact penalty function scheme equipped with a penalty-parameter updating rule. The feasible-start algorithm merely has to satisfy certain general requirements, and so is the updating rule. Under mild assumptions, the framework is proved to converge on CQPs with both inequality and equality constraints and, at a negligible additional cost per iteration, produces an infeasibility certificate, together with a feasible point for an (approximately) $$\ell _1$$ -least relaxed feasible problem, when the given problem does not have a feasible solution. The framework is applied to a feasible-start constraint-reduced interior-point algorithm previously proved to be highly performant on problems with many more inequality constraints than variables (“imbalanced”). Numerical comparison with popular codes (OSQP, qpOASES, MOSEK) is reported on both randomly generated problems and support-vector machine classifier training problems. The results show that the former typically outperforms the latter on imbalanced problems. Finally, application of the proposed infeasible-start framework to other feasible-start algorithms is briefly considered, and is tested on a simplex iteration.},

This submodularity viewpoint enables us to unify and extend existing results on valid inequalities and convex hulls of the intersection of multiple mixing sets with common binary variables. Then, we study such intersections under an additional linking constraint lower bounding a linear function of the continuous variables. This is motivated from the desire to exploit the information encoded in the knapsack constraint arising in joint linear CCPs via the quantile cuts. We propose a new class of valid inequalities and characterize when this new class along with the mixing inequalities are sufficient to describe the convex hull.},

  abstract     = {Semidefinite programming (SDP) with diagonal constraints arise in many optimization problems, such as Max-Cut, community detection and group synchronization. Although SDPs can be solved to arbitrary precision in polynomial time, generic convex solvers do not scale well with the dimension of the problem. In order to address this issue, Burer and Monteiro (Math Program 95(2):329–357, 2003) proposed to reduce the dimension of the problem by appealing to a low-rank factorization and solve the subsequent non-convex problem instead. In this paper, we present coordinate ascent based methods to solve this non-convex problem with provable convergence guarantees. More specifically, we prove that the block-coordinate maximization algorithm applied to the non-convex Burer–Monteiro method globally converges to a first-order stationary point with a sublinear rate without any assumptions on the problem. We further show that this algorithm converges linearly around a local maximum provided that the objective function exhibits quadratic decay. We establish that this condition generically holds when the rank of the factorization is sufficiently large. Furthermore, incorporating Lanczos method to the block-coordinate maximization, we propose an algorithm that is guaranteed to return a solution that provides $$1-{\mathcal {O}}\left( 1/r\right) $$ approximation to the original SDP without any assumptions, where r is the rank of the factorization. This approximation ratio is known to be optimal (up to constants) under the unique games conjecture, and we can explicitly quantify the number of iterations to obtain such a solution.},

We establish that these problems cannot be approximated to any degree of either relative or additive error, regardless of the scheme used.

We develop approximation schemes of this type for the classes of problems mentioned above. In light of our hardness results, such approximation schemes are “best possible”.

Motivated by the fact that existing ODEs do not distinguish between two fundamentally different algorithms—Nesterov’s accelerated gradient method for strongly convex functions (NAG-SC) and Polyak’s heavy-ball method—we study an alternative limiting process that yields high-resolution ODEs. We show that these ODEs permit a general Lyapunov function framework for the analysis of convergence in both continuous and discrete time. We also show that these ODEs are more accurate surrogates for the underlying algorithms; in particular, they not only distinguish between NAG-SC and Polyak’s heavy-ball method, but they allow the identification of a term that we refer to as “gradient correction” that is present in NAG-SC but not in the heavy-ball method and is responsible for the qualitative difference in convergence of the two methods. We also use the high-resolution ODE framework to study Nesterov’s accelerated gradient method for (non-strongly) convex functions, uncovering a hitherto unknown result—that NAG-C minimizes the squared gradient norm at an inverse cubic rate. Finally, by modifying the high-resolution ODE of NAG-C, we obtain a family of new optimization methods that are shown to maintain the accelerated convergence rates of NAG-C for smooth convex functions.},

  abstract     = {We address the problem of prescribing an optimal decision in a framework where the cost function depends on uncertain problem parameters that need to be learned from data. Earlier work proposed prescriptive formulations based on supervised machine learning methods. These prescriptive methods can factor in contextual information on a potentially large number of covariates to take context specific actions which are superior to any static decision. When working with noisy or corrupt data, however, such nominal prescriptive methods can be prone to adverse overfitting phenomena and fail to generalize on out-of-sample data. In this paper we combine ideas from robust optimization and the statistical bootstrap to propose novel prescriptive methods which safeguard against overfitting. We show indeed that a particular entropic robust counterpart to such nominal formulations guarantees good performance on synthetic bootstrap data. As bootstrap data is often a sensible proxy to actual out-of-sample data, our robust counterpart can be interpreted to directly encourage good out-of-sample performance. The associated robust prescriptive methods furthermore reduce to convenient tractable convex optimization problems in the context of local learning methods such as nearest neighbors and Nadaraya–Watson learning. We illustrate our data-driven decision-making framework and our novel robustness notion on a small newsvendor problem.},

This problem can be viewed as an algebraic generalization of the bipartite matching problem and was considered by Iwata and Murota (SIAM J Matrix Anal Appl 16(3):719–734, 1995). Recent interests in this problem lie in the connection with non-commutative Edmonds’ problem by Ivanyos et al. (Comput Complex 27:561–593, 2018) and Garg et al. (Found. Comput. Math. 20:223–290, 2020), where a result by Iwata and Murota implicitly states that the rank and non-commutative rank (nc-rank) are the same for this class of symbolic matrices. The main result of this paper is a simple and combinatorial $$O((\mu \nu )^2 \min { \mu , \nu })$$ -time algorithm for computing the symbolic rank of a $$(2 \times 2)$$ -type generic partitioned matrix of size $$2\mu \times 2\nu $$ . Our algorithm is inspired by the Wong sequence algorithm by Ivanyos et al. for the nc-rank of a general symbolic matrix, and requires no blow-up operation, no field extension, and no additional care for bounding the bit-size. Moreover it naturally provides a maximum rank completion of A for an arbitrary field $$\mathbf {F}$$ .},

  abstract     = {Community detection in graphs that are generated according to stochastic block models (SBMs) has received much attention lately. In this paper, we focus on the binary symmetric SBM—in which a graph of n vertices is randomly generated by first partitioning the vertices into two equal-sized communities and then connecting each pair of vertices with probability that depends on their community memberships—and study the associated exact community recovery problem. Although the maximum-likelihood formulation of the problem is non-convex and discrete, we propose to tackle it using a popular iterative method called projected power iterations. To ensure fast convergence of the method, we initialize it using a point that is generated by another iterative method called orthogonal iterations, which is a classic method for computing invariant subspaces of a symmetric matrix. We show that in the logarithmic sparsity regime of the problem, with high probability the proposed two-stage method can exactly recover the two communities down to the information-theoretic limit in $${\mathcal {O}}(n\log ^2n/\log \log n)$$ time, which is competitive with a host of existing state-of-the-art methods that have the same recovery performance. We also conduct numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data sets to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method and complement our theoretical development.},

We formulate a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer program, in which the timing of the stage is random. In our model, the recourse problem is a mixed-integer program. We prove the problem is NP-hard, and using simple examples, we illustrate properties that differ from the problem’s deterministic counterpart. Obtaining a reasonably tight optimality gap can require a large number of samples in a sample average approximation, leading to large-scale instances that are computationally expensive to solve. Therefore, we develop a branch-and-cut decomposition algorithm, in which spatial branching of the first stage continuous variables and linear programming approximations for the recourse problem are sequentially tightened. We test our decomposition algorithm with multiple improvements and show it can significantly reduce solution time over solving the problem directly.},

  abstract     = {There has been a long history of using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to understand the dynamics of discrete-time algorithms (DTAs). Surprisingly, there are still two fundamental and unanswered questions: (i) it is unclear how to obtain a suitable ODE from a given DTA, and (ii) it is unclear the connection between the convergence of a DTA and its corresponding ODEs. In this paper, we propose a new machinery—an $$O(s^r)$$ -resolution ODE framework—for analyzing the behavior of a generic DTA, which (partially) answers the above two questions. The framework contains three steps: 1. To obtain a suitable ODE from a given DTA, we define a hierarchy of $$O(s^r)$$ -resolution ODEs of a DTA parameterized by the degree r, where s is the step-size of the DTA. We present a principal approach to construct the unique $$O(s^r)$$ -resolution ODEs from a DTA; 2. To analyze the resulting ODE, we propose the $$O(s^r)$$ -linear-convergence condition of a DTA with respect to an energy function, under which the $$O(s^r)$$ -resolution ODE converges linearly to an optimal solution; 3. To bridge the convergence properties of a DTA and its corresponding ODEs, we define the properness of an energy function and show that the linear convergence of the $$O(s^r)$$ -resolution ODE with respect to a proper energy function can automatically guarantee the linear convergence of the DTA. To better illustrate this machinery, we utilize it to study three classic algorithms—gradient descent ascent (GDA), proximal point method (PPM) and extra-gradient method (EGM)—for solving the unconstrained minimax problem $$\min _{x\in \mathbb {R}^n} \max _{y\in \mathbb {R}^m} L(x,y)$$ . Their O(s)-resolution ODEs explain the puzzling convergent/divergent behaviors of GDA, PPM and EGM when L(x, y) is a bilinear function, and showcase that the interaction terms help the convergence of PPM/EGM but hurts the convergence of GDA. Furthermore, their O(s)-linear-convergence conditions not only unify the known scenarios when PPM and EGM have linear convergence, but also showcase that these two algorithms exhibit linear convergence in much broader contexts, including when solving a class of nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problems. Finally, we show how this ODE framework can help design new optimization algorithms for minimax problems, by studying the difference between the O(s)-resolution ODE of GDA and that of PPM/EGM.},

By successive application of a proximal operator, we construct a sequence of functions parameterized by the sampling time that corresponds to the discretization of the continuous-time system. Under certain mild assumptions on the regularity with respect to the time argument, and using appropriate tools from functional and variational analysis, this sequence is then shown to converge to the unique solution of the original differential inclusion. The result is applied to develop conditions for well-posedness of differential equations interconnected with nonsmooth time-dependent complementarity relations, using passivity of underlying dynamics (equivalently expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities).},

We analyze the performance of a class of infeasible-start primal-dual algorithms for the Domain-Driven form in returning the certificates for the defined statuses.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the lower iteration complexity bounds for finding the saddle point of a strongly convex and strongly concave saddle point problem: $$\min _x\max _yF(x,y)$$ . We restrict the classes of algorithms in our investigation to be either pure first-order methods or methods using proximal mappings. For problems with gradient Lipschitz constants ( $$L_x, L_y$$ and $$L_{xy}$$ ) and strong convexity/concavity constants ( $$\mu _x$$ and $$\mu _y$$ ), the class of pure first-order algorithms with the linear span assumption is shown to have a lower iteration complexity bound of $$\Omega \,\left( \sqrt{\frac{L_x}{\mu _x}+\frac{L_{xy}^2}{\mu _x\mu _y}+\frac{L_y}{\mu _y}}\cdot \ln \left( \frac{1}{\epsilon }\right) \right) $$ , where the term $$\frac{L_{xy}^2}{\mu _x\mu _y}$$ explains how the coupling influences the iteration complexity. Under several special parameter regimes, this lower bound has been achieved by corresponding optimal algorithms. However, whether or not the bound under the general parameter regime is optimal remains open. Additionally, for the special case of bilinear coupling problems, given the availability of certain proximal operators, a lower bound of $$\Omega \left( \sqrt{\frac{L_{xy}^2}{\mu _x\mu _y}}\cdot \ln (\frac{1}{\epsilon })\right) $$ is established under the linear span assumption, and optimal algorithms have already been developed in the literature. By exploiting the orthogonal invariance technique, we extend both lower bounds to the general pure first-order algorithm class and the proximal algorithm class without the linear span assumption. As an application, we apply proper scaling to the worst-case instances, and we derive the lower bounds for the general convex concave problems with $$\mu _x = \mu _y = 0$$ . Several existing results in this case can be deduced from our results as special cases.},

  abstract     = {A classic result by Cook, Gerards, Schrijver, and Tardos provides an upper bound of $$n \Delta $$ on the proximity of optimal solutions of an Integer Linear Programming problem and its standard linear relaxation. In this bound, n is the number of variables and $$\Delta $$ denotes the maximum of the absolute values of the subdeterminants of the constraint matrix. Hochbaum and Shanthikumar, and Werman and Magagnosc showed that the same upper bound is valid if a more general convex function is minimized, instead of a linear function. No proximity result of this type is known when the objective function is nonconvex. In fact, if we minimize a concave quadratic, no upper bound can be given as a function of n and $$\Delta $$ . Our key observation is that, in this setting, proximity phenomena still occur, but only if we consider also approximate solutions instead of optimal solutions only. In our main result we provide upper bounds on the distance between approximate (resp., optimal) solutions to a Concave Integer Quadratic Programming problem and optimal (resp., approximate) solutions of its continuous relaxation. Our bounds are functions of $$n, \Delta $$ , and a parameter $$\epsilon $$ that controls the quality of the approximation. Furthermore, we discuss how far from optimal are our proximity bounds.},

Our main contribution is a full characterization of the facets of Q, provided it has a certain network representation. In the second half of the paper, we work-out a number of applications from the literature, e.g., special ordered sets of type 2, logical constraints, the cardinality indicating polytope, union of simplicies, etc., along with a more complex recent example. Furthermore, we describe a new formulation for piecewise linear functions defined on a grid triangulation of a rectangular region $$D \subset {\mathbb {R}}^d$$ using a logarithmic number of auxilirary variables in the number of gridpoints in D for any fixed d. The series of applications demonstrates the richness of the class of disjunctive constraints for which our method can be applied.},

Applied to the problem of approximate error correction in quantum information theory, this gives hierarchies of efficiently computable outer bounds on the success probability of approximate quantum error correction codes in any dimension. The first level of our hierarchies corresponds to a previously studied relaxation (Leung and Matthews in IEEE Trans Inf Theory 61(8):4486, 2015) and positive partial transpose constraints can be added to give a sufficient criterion for the exact convergence at a given level of the hierarchy. To quantify the worst case convergence speed of our sum-of-squares hierarchies, we derive novel quantum de Finetti theorems that allow imposing linear constraints on the approximating state. In particular, we give finite de Finetti theorems for quantum channels, quantifying closeness to the convex hull of product channels as well as closeness to local operations and classical forward communication assisted channels. As a special case this constitutes a finite version of Fuchs-Schack-Scudo’s asymptotic de Finetti theorem for quantum channels. Finally, our proof methods answer a question of Brandão and Harrow (Proceedings of the forty-fourth annual ACM symposium on theory of computing, STOC’12, p 307, 2012) by improving the approximation factor of de Finetti theorems with no symmetry from $$O(d^{k/2})$$ to $${\mathrm {poly}}(d,k)$$ , where d denotes local dimension and k the number of copies.},

  abstract     = {Randomized Kaczmarz, Motzkin Method and Sampling Kaczmarz Motzkin (SKM) algorithms are commonly used iterative techniques for solving a system of linear inequalities (i.e., $$Ax \le b$$ ). As linear systems of equations represent a modeling paradigm for solving many optimization problems, these randomized and iterative techniques are gaining popularity among researchers in different domains. In this work, we propose a Generalized Sampling Kaczmarz Motzkin (GSKM) method that unifies the iterative methods into a single framework. In addition to the general framework, we propose a Nesterov-type acceleration scheme in the SKM method called Probably Accelerated Sampling Kaczmarz Motzkin (PASKM). We prove the convergence theorems for both GSKM and PASKM algorithms in the $$L_2$$ norm perspective with respect to the proposed sampling distribution. Furthermore, we prove sub-linear convergence for the Cesaro average of iterates for the proposed GSKM and PASKM algorithms. From the convergence theorem of the GSKM algorithm, we find the convergence results of several well-known algorithms like the Kaczmarz method, Motzkin method and SKM algorithm. We perform thorough numerical experiments using both randomly generated and real-world (classification with support vector machine and Netlib LP) test instances to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods. We compare the proposed algorithms with SKM, Interior Point Method and Active Set Method in terms of computation time and solution quality. In the majority of the problem instances, the proposed generalized and accelerated algorithms significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods.},

We elucidate this connection by presenting a new dynamical system – Meta-Algorithm – and showing that the IRLS algorithms and the slime mold dynamics can both be obtained by specializing it to disjoint sets of variables. Subsequently, and building on work on slime mold dynamics for finding shortest paths, we prove convergence and obtain complexity bounds for the Meta-Algorithm that can be viewed as a “damped” version of the IRLS algorithm. A consequence of this latter result is a slime mold dynamics to solve the undirected transshipment problem that computes a $$(1+\varepsilon )-$$ approximate solution in time polynomial in the size of the input graph, maximum edge cost, and $$\frac{1}{\varepsilon }$$ – a problem that was left open by the work of (Bonifaci V et al.

(J Comb Optim 34(2):554–573, 2017). We show that the two problems with lower and upper bound constraints on the size of the intersection can be reduced to weighted matroid intersection, and thus be solved with a strongly polynomial-time primal-dual algorithm. We also present a strongly polynomial, primal-dual algorithm that computes a minimum cost solution for every feasible size of the intersection k in one run with asymptotic running time equal to one run of Frank’s matroid intersection algorithm. Additionally, we discuss generalizations of the problems from matroids to polymatroids, and from two to three or more matroids.

They are common in statistics too—principal component, canonical correlation, and correspondence analyses may all be viewed as methods for extracting flags from a data set. The main goal of this article is to develop the tools needed for optimizing over a set of flags, which is a smooth manifold called the flag manifold, and it contains the Grassmannian as the simplest special case. We will derive closed-form analytic expressions for various differential geometric objects required for Riemannian optimization algorithms on the flag manifold; introducing various systems of extrinsic coordinates that allow us to parameterize points, metrics, tangent spaces, geodesics, distances, parallel transports, gradients, Hessians in terms of matrices and matrix operations; and thereby permitting us to formulate steepest descent, conjugate gradient, and Newton algorithms on the flag manifold using only standard numerical linear algebra.},

For measures on a d-dimensional manifold and under some non-degeneracy assumptions, this leads to a global optimization algorithm with a complexity scaling as $$\log (1/\epsilon )$$ in the desired accuracy $$\epsilon $$ , instead of $$\epsilon ^{-d}$$ for convex methods. The key theoretical tools are a local convergence analysis in Wasserstein space and an analysis of a perturbed mirror descent in the space of measures. Our bounds involve quantities that are exponential in d which is unavoidable under our assumptions.},

We use Jacobi’s technique from (Math Z 237(2):259–273, 2001) to provide an alternative proof with an effective degree bound on the sums of squares weights in such certificates. As a consequence, it allows one to define a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations for a general polynomial optimization problem. Convergence of this hierarchy to a neighborhood of the optimal value as well as strong duality and analysis are guaranteed. In a second contribution, we introduce a new numerical method for solving systems of polynomial inequalities and equalities with possibly uncountably many solutions. As a bonus, one can apply this method to obtain approximate global optimizers in polynomial optimization.},

This approach is shown here to lead to a fast algorithm for the problem with general convex fidelity and regularization functions, and a faster algorithm if, in addition, the fidelity functions are differentiable and the regularization functions are strictly convex. Both algorithms achieve the best theoretical worst case complexity over existing algorithms for the classes of objective functions studied here.

In this paper, we develop a Riemannian proximal gradient method (RPG) and its accelerated variant (ARPG) for similar problems but constrained on a manifold. The global convergence of RPG is established under mild assumptions, and the O(1/k) is also derived for RPG based on the notion of retraction convexity. If assuming the objective function obeys the Rimannian Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz (KL) property, it is further shown that the sequence generated by RPG converges to a single stationary point. As in the Euclidean setting, local convergence rate can be established if the objective function satisfies the Riemannian KL property with an exponent. Moreover, we show that the restriction of a semialgebraic function onto the Stiefel manifold satisfies the Riemannian KL property, which covers for example the well-known sparse PCA problem. Numerical experiments on random and synthetic data are conducted to test the performance of the proposed RPG and ARPG.},

  abstract     = {Choice of a risk measure for quantifying risk of an investment portfolio depends on the decision maker’s risk preference. In this paper, we consider the case when such a preference can be described by a law invariant coherent risk measure but the choice of a specific risk measure is ambiguous. We propose a robust spectral risk approach to address such ambiguity. Differing from Wang and Xu (SIAM J Optim 30(4):3198–3229, 2020), the new robust model allows one to elicit the decision maker’s risk preference through pairwise comparisons and use the elicited preference information to construct an ambiguity set of risk spectra. The robust spectral risk measure (RSRM) is based on the worst case risk spectrum from the set. To calculate RSRM and solve the associated optimal decision making problem, we use a technique from Acerbi and Simonetti (Portfolio optimization with spectral measures of risk. Working paper, 2002) to develop a new computational approach which is independent of order statistics and reformulate the robust spectral risk optimization problem as a single deterministic convex programming problem when the risk spectra in the ambiguity set are step-like. Moreover, we propose an approximation scheme when the risk spectra are not step-like and derive a bound for the model approximation error and its propagation to the optimal decision making problems. Some preliminary numerical test results are reported about the performance of the robust model and the computational scheme.},

The proposed method combines general stochastic higher order steps derived from an underlying proximal type fixed-point equation with additional stochastic proximal gradient steps to guarantee convergence. Based on suitable bounds on the step sizes, we establish global convergence to stationary points in expectation and an extension of the approach using variance reduction techniques is discussed. Motivated by large-scale and big data applications, we investigate a stochastic coordinate-type quasi-Newton scheme that allows to generate cheap and tractable stochastic higher order directions.

For this problem, Lendl et al. (Matroid bases with cardinality constraints on the intersection, arXiv:1907.04741v2 , 2019) discussed modular cost functions: they reduced the problem to weighted matroid intersection for the case where the cardinality constraint is $$|X_1 \cap X_2|\le k$$ or $$|X_1 \cap X_2|\ge k$$ ; and designed a new primal-dual algorithm for the case where the constraint is $$|X_1 \cap X_2|=k$$ . The aim of this paper is to generalize the problems to have nonlinear convex cost functions, and to comprehend them from the viewpoint of discrete convex analysis. We prove that each generalized problem can be solved via valuated independent assignment, valuated matroid intersection, or $$\mathrm {M}$$ -convex submodular flow, to offer a comprehensive understanding of weighted matroid intersection with intersection constraints. We also show the NP-hardness of some variants of these problems, which clarifies the coverage of discrete convex analysis for those problems. Finally, we present applications of our generalized problems in the recoverable robust matroid basis problem, combinatorial optimization problems with interaction costs, and matroid congestion games.},

This parameter, introduced by Kaibel &amp; Weltge (2015), captures the complexity of linear descriptions of X without using auxiliary variables.

Additionally, $${{\,\mathrm{rc}\,}}(X)$$ can be algorithmically computed when X is at most three-dimensional, or X satisfies one of the conditions (b), (c), or (d) above.

  abstract     = {We study the equilibrium computation problem for two classical resource allocation games: atomic splittable congestion games and multimarket Cournot oligopolies. For atomic splittable congestion games with singleton strategies and player-specific affine cost functions, we devise the first polynomial time algorithm computing a pure Nash equilibrium. Our algorithm is combinatorial and computes the exact equilibrium assuming rational input. The idea is to compute an equilibrium for an associated integrally-splittable singleton congestion game in which the players can only split their demands in integral multiples of a common packet size. While integral games have been considered in the literature before, no polynomial time algorithm computing an equilibrium was known. Also for this class, we devise the first polynomial time algorithm and use it as a building block for our main algorithm. We then develop a polynomial time computable transformation mapping a multimarket Cournot competition game with firm-specific affine price functions and quadratic costs to an associated atomic splittable congestion game as described above. The transformation preserves equilibria in either game and, thus, leads – via our first algorithm – to a polynomial time algorithm computing Cournot equilibria. Finally, our analysis for integrally-splittable games implies new bounds on the difference between real and integral Cournot equilibria. The bounds can be seen as a generalization of the recent bounds for single market oligopolies obtained by Todd (Math Op Res 41(3):1125–1134 2016, https://doi.org/10.1287/moor.2015.0771 ).},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of computing the minimum value $$f_{\min ,K}$$ of a polynomial f over a compact set $$K\subseteq {\mathbb {R}}^n$$ , which can be reformulated as finding a probability measure $$\nu $$ on $$K$$ minimizing $$\int _Kf d\nu $$ . Lasserre showed that it suffices to consider such measures of the form $$\nu = q\mu $$ , where q is a sum-of-squares polynomial and $$\mu $$ is a given Borel measure supported on $$K$$ . By bounding the degree of q by 2r one gets a converging hierarchy of upper bounds $$f^{(r)}$$ for $$f_{\min ,K}$$ . When K is the hypercube $$[-1, 1]^n$$ , equipped with the Chebyshev measure, the parameters $$f^{(r)}$$ are known to converge to $$f_{\min , K}$$ at a rate in $$O(1/r^2)$$ . We extend this error estimate to a wider class of convex bodies, while also allowing for a broader class of reference measures, including the Lebesgue measure. Our analysis applies to simplices, balls and convex bodies that locally look like a ball. In addition, we show an error estimate in $$O(\log r / r)$$ when $$K$$ satisfies a minor geometrical condition, and in $$O(\log ^2 r / r^2)$$ when $$K$$ is a convex body, equipped with the Lebesgue measure. This improves upon the currently best known error estimates in $$O(1 / \sqrt{r})$$ and $$O(1/r)$$ for these two respective cases.},

  abstract     = {We propose a doubly nonnegative (DNN) relaxation for polynomial optimization problems (POPs) with binary and box constraints. This work is an extension of the work by Kim, Kojima and Toh in 2016 from quadratic optimization problems to POPs. The dense and sparse DNN relaxations are reduced to a simple conic optimization problem (COP) to which an accelerated bisection and projection (BP) algorithm is applied. The COP involves a single equality constraint in a matrix variable which is restricted to the intersection of the positive semidefinite cone and a polyhedral cone representing the algebraic properties of binary and box constraints as well as the sparsity structure of the objective polynomial. Our DNN relaxation serves as a variant of the Lasserre moment-SOS hierarchy of relaxations for binary and box constrained POPs when the size of the cones is gradually increased to compute tighter lower bounds for their optimal values. A significant part of the paper is devoted to deriving and analyzing a class of polyhedral cones to strengthen the DNN relaxation, and the design of efficient computation of the metric projections onto these cones in the accelerated BP algorithm. Numerical results on various POPs are available in Ito et al. (ACM Trans Math Softw 45, Article 34, 2019).},

  abstract     = {Non-convex optimization with local search heuristics has been widely used in machine learning, achieving many state-of-art results. It becomes increasingly important to understand why they can work for these NP-hard problems on typical data. The landscape of many objective functions in learning has been conjectured to have the geometric property that “all local optima are (approximately) global optima”, and thus they can be solved efficiently by local search algorithms. However, establishing such property can be very difficult. In this paper, we analyze the optimization landscape of the random over-complete tensor decomposition problem, which has many applications in unsupervised learning, especially in learning latent variable models. In practice, it can be efficiently solved by gradient ascent on a non-convex objective. We show that for any small constant $$\varepsilon &gt; 0$$ , among the set of points with function values $$(1+\varepsilon )$$ -factor larger than the expectation of the function, all the local maxima are approximate global maxima. Previously, the best-known result only characterizes the geometry in small neighborhoods around the true components. Our result implies that even with an initialization that is barely better than the random guess, the gradient ascent algorithm is guaranteed to solve this problem. However, achieving such a initialization with random guess would still require super-polynomial number of attempts. Our main technique uses Kac–Rice formula and random matrix theory. To our best knowledge, this is the first time when Kac–Rice formula is successfully applied to counting the number of local optima of a highly-structured random polynomial with dependent coefficients.},

  abstract     = {Quantum states are represented by positive semidefinite Hermitian operators with unit trace, known as density matrices. An important subset of quantum states is that of separable states, the complement of which is the subset of entangled states. We show that the problem of deciding whether a quantum state is entangled can be seen as a moment problem in real analysis. Only a small number of such moments are accessible experimentally, and so in practice the question of quantum entanglement of a many-body system (e.g, a system consisting of several atoms) can be reduced to a truncated moment problem. By considering quantum entanglement of n identical atoms we arrive at the truncated moment problem defined for symmetric measures over a product of n copies of unit balls in $${\mathbb {R}}^d$$ . We work with moments up to degree 2 only, since these are most readily available experimentally. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for belonging to the moment cone, which can be expressed via a linear matrix inequality of size at most $$2d+2$$ , which is independent of n. The linear matrix inequalities can be converted into a set of explicit semialgebraic inequalities giving necessary and sufficient conditions for membership in the moment cone, and show that the two conditions approach each other in the limit of large n. The inequalities are derived via considering the dual cone of nonnegative polynomials, and its sum-of-squares relaxation. We show that the sum-of-squares relaxation of the dual cone is asymptotically exact, and using symmetry reduction techniques (Blekherman and Riener: Symmetric nonnegative forms and sums of squares. arXiv:1205.3102 , 2012; Gatermann and Parrilo: J Pure Appl Algebra 192(1–3):95–128. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpaa.2003.12.011 , 2004), it can be written as a small linear matrix inequality of size at most $$2d+2$$ , which is independent of n. For the cone of symmetric nonnegative polynomials with the relevant support we also prove an analogue of the half-degree principle for globally nonnegative symmetric polynomials (Riener: J Pure Appl Algebra 216(4): 850–856. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpaa.2011.08.012 , 2012; Timofte: J Math Anal Appl 284(1):174–190. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-247X(03)00301-9 , 2003).},

While polynomial time smoothed analysis guarantees have been obtained for worst-case intractable problems like tensor decomposition and learning mixtures of Gaussians, such guarantees have been hard to obtain for several other important problems in data analysis. A core technical challenge in analyzing algorithms is obtaining lower bounds on the least singular value for random matrix ensembles with dependent entries, that are given by low-degree polynomials of a few base underlying random variables. In this work, we address this challenge by obtaining high-confidence lower bounds on the least singular value of new classes of structured random matrix ensembles of the above kind. We then use these bounds to design algorithms with polynomial time smoothed analysis guarantees for the following three important problems in high-dimensional data analysis:},

We show that if $$m &gt; rsim n^{3/2} r$$ then there is a polynomial time algorithm based on the sixth level of the sum-of-squares hierarchy for completing it. Our estimate agrees with almost all of T’s entries almost exactly and works even when our observations are corrupted by noise. This is also the first algorithm for tensor completion that works in the overcomplete case when $$r &gt; n$$ , and in fact it works all the way up to $$r = n^{3/2-\epsilon }$$ . Our proofs are short and simple and are based on establishing a new connection between noisy tensor completion (through the language of Rademacher complexity) and the task of refuting random constraint satisfaction problems. This connection seems to have gone unnoticed even in the context of matrix completion. Furthermore, we use this connection to show matching lower bounds. Our main technical result is in characterizing the Rademacher complexity of the sequence of norms that arise in the sum-of-squares relaxations to the tensor nuclear norm. These results point to an interesting new direction: Can we explore computational vs. sample complexity tradeoffs through the sum-of-squares hierarchy?},

  abstract     = {We present an algorithm for the minimization of a nonconvex quadratic function subject to linear inequality constraints and a two-sided bound on the 2-norm of its solution. The algorithm minimizes the objective using an active-set method by solving a series of trust-region subproblems (TRS). Underpinning the efficiency of this approach is that the global solution of the TRS has been widely studied in the literature, resulting in remarkably efficient algorithms and software. We extend these results by proving that nonglobal minimizers of the TRS, or a certificate of their absence, can also be calculated efficiently by computing the two rightmost eigenpairs of an eigenproblem. We demonstrate the usefulness and scalability of the algorithm in a series of experiments that often outperform state-of-the-art approaches; these include calculation of high-quality search directions arising in Sequential Quadratic Programming on problems of the CUTEst collection, and Sparse Principal Component Analysis on a large text corpus problem (70 million nonzeros) that can help organize documents in a user interpretable way.},

  abstract     = {In a Hilbert space $$ {\mathcal H}$$ , we introduce a new class of first-order algorithms which naturally occur as discrete temporal versions of an inertial differential inclusion jointly involving viscous friction and dry friction. The function $$f:{\mathcal H}\rightarrow {\mathbb {R}}$$ to be minimized is supposed to be differentiable (not necessarily convex), and enters the algorithm via its gradient. The dry friction damping function $$\phi :{\mathcal H}\rightarrow {\mathbb {R}}_+$$ is convex with a sharp minimum at the origin, (typically $$\phi (x) = r \Vert x\Vert $$ with $$r &gt;0$$ ). It enters the algorithm via its proximal mapping, which acts as a soft threshold operator on the velocities. As a result, we obtain a new class of splitting algorithms involving separately the proximal and gradient steps. The sequence of iterates has a finite length, and therefore strongly converges towards an approximate critical point $$x_{\infty }$$ of f (typically $$\Vert \nabla f(x_{\infty })\Vert \le r$$ ). Under a geometric property satisfied by the limit point $$x_{\infty }$$ , we obtain geometric and finite rates of convergence. The convergence results tolerate the presence of errors, under the sole assumption of their asymptotic convergence towards zero. By replacing the function f by its Moreau envelope, we extend the results to the case of nonsmooth convex functions. In this case, the algorithm involves the proximal operators of f and $$\phi $$ separately. Several variants of this algorithm are considered, including the case of the Nesterov accelerated gradient method. We then consider the extension in the case of additive composite optimization, thus leading to new splitting methods. Numerical experiments are given for Lasso-type problems. The performance profiles, as a comparison tool, demonstrate the efficiency of the Nesterov accelerated method with asymptotic vanishing damping combined with dry friction.},

Replacing the intractable cone in this formulation by the larger but tractable cone of doubly nonnegative matrices, i.e., the cone of positive semidefinite and componentwise nonnegative matrices, one obtains the so-called doubly nonnegative relaxation, whose optimal value yields a lower bound on that of the original problem. We present a full algebraic characterization of the set of instances of standard quadratic programs that admit an exact doubly nonnegative relaxation. This characterization yields an algorithmic recipe for constructing such an instance. In addition, we explicitly identify three families of instances for which the doubly nonnegative relaxation is exact. We establish several relations between the so-called convexity graph of an instance and the tightness of the doubly nonnegative relaxation. We also provide an algebraic characterization of the set of instances for which the doubly nonnegative relaxation has a positive gap and show how to construct such an instance using this characterization.},

Such problems often arise in many practical applications as, e.g., optimization problems constrained by partial differential equations with uncertain inputs. Unfortunately, for many popular risk models including the coherent risk measures, the resulting risk-averse objective function is nonsmooth. This lack of differentiability complicates the numerical approximation of the objective function as well as the numerical solution of the optimization problem. To address these challenges, we propose a primal–dual algorithm for solving large-scale nonsmooth risk-averse optimization problems. This algorithm is motivated by the classical method of multipliers and by epigraphical regularization of risk measures. As a result, the algorithm solves a sequence of smooth optimization problems using derivative-based methods. We prove convergence of the algorithm even when the subproblems are solved inexactly and conclude with numerical examples demonstrating the efficiency of our method.},

For a holistic understanding of the problem, an infinite-period model is proposed. Such a model provides a unified view of a capacitated lot-sizing problem. The usefulness of the infinite-period model is shown by the principle that the firm’s production schedule drives the subcontractor’s supply schedule. For efficient construction of the production schedule, an innovative technique–coined using the concept of the shadow period–is presented to designate the optimal marginal supply cost. The success of the infinite-period model is finally proved with the concept of the effective period, indicating the supply coverage over periods. This fills the gap between the uncapacitated techniques and the capacitated techniques, making it possible to apply the best techniques from the lot-sizing literature. With this novel approach, we improve existing algorithms and provide new ones for concave production and supply cost structures involving setups.},

Global and linear convergence results are established when the cost function satisfies the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz property without imposing convexity requirements on the smooth function. Two prominent special cases of the investigated setting are regularized finite sum minimization and the sharing problem; in particular, an immediate byproduct of our analysis leads to novel convergence results and rates for the popular Finito/MISO algorithm in the nonsmooth and nonconvex setting with very general sampling strategies.},

The geometrical damping driven by the Hessian intervenes in the dynamics in the form $$\nabla ^2 f (x(t)) \dot{x} (t)$$ . By treating this term as the time derivative of $$ \nabla f (x (t)) $$ , this gives, in discretized form, first-order algorithms in time and space.

The introduction of time scale factors makes it possible to further accelerate these algorithms. We also report numerical results on structured problems to support our theoretical findings.},

We present similar sufficient conditions under which the projected epigraph of the SDP gives the convex hull of the epigraph in the original QCQP.

However, it is applicable mostly for strictly positive matrices. For sparse matrices, it often diverges and gives a wrong answer. We present the “selective greedy method” that works equally well for all non-negative product families, including sparse ones. For this method, we prove a quadratic rate of convergence and demonstrate its efficiency in numerical examples.

  abstract     = {We introduce an iterative framework for solving graph coloring problems using decision diagrams. The decision diagram compactly represents all possible color classes, some of which may contain edge conflicts. In each iteration, we use a constrained minimum network flow model to compute a lower bound and identify conflicts. Infeasible color classes associated with these conflicts are removed by refining the decision diagram. We prove that in the best case, our approach may use exponentially smaller diagrams than exact diagrams for proving optimality. We also develop a primal heuristic based on the decision diagram to find a feasible solution at each iteration. We provide an experimental evaluation on all 137 DIMACS graph coloring instances. Our procedure can solve 52 instances optimally, of which 44 are solved within 1 minute. We also compare our method to a state-of-the-art graph coloring solver based on branch-and-price, and show that we obtain competitive results. Lastly, we report an improved lower bound for the open instance C2000.9.},

Tasks have random sizes $$X_j$$ , and our goal is to non-adaptively select t tasks to minimize the expected maximum load over all resources, where the load on any resource i is the total size of all selected tasks that use i. For example, when resources are points and tasks are intervals in a line, we obtain an $$O(\log \log m)$$ -approximation algorithm. Our technique is also applicable to other problems with some geometric structure in the relation between tasks and resources; e.g., packing paths, rectangles, and “fat” objects. Our approach uses a strong LP relaxation using the cumulant generating functions of the random variables. We also show that this LP has an $$\varOmega (\log ^* m)$$ integrality gap, even for the problem of selecting intervals on a line; here $$\log ^* m$$ is the iterated logarithm function.},

Such popular branchings have a natural application in liquid democracy. The popular branching problem is to decide if G admits a popular branching or not. We give a characterization of popular branchings in terms of dual certificates and use this characterization to design an efficient combinatorial algorithm for the popular branching problem. When preferences are weak rankings, we use our characterization to formulate the popular branching polytope in the original space and also show that our algorithm can be modified to compute a branching with least unpopularity margin.

  abstract     = {In a digraph with a source and several destination nodes with associated demands, an unsplittable flow routes each demand along a single path from the common source to its destination. Given some flow x that is not necessarily unsplittable but satisfies all demands, it is a natural question to ask for an unsplittable flow y that does not deviate from x by too much, i.e., $$y_a\approx x_a$$ for all arcs a. Twenty years ago, in a landmark paper, Dinitz et al. (Combinatorica 19:17–41, 1999) proved that there exists an unsplittable flow y such that $$y_a\le x_a+d_{\max }$$ for all arcs a, where $$d_{\max }$$ denotes the maximum demand value. Our first contribution is a considerably simpler one-page proof for this classical result, based upon an entirely new approach. Secondly, using a subtle variant of this approach, we obtain a new result: There is an unsplittable flow y such that $$y_a\ge x_a-d_{\max }$$ for all arcs a. Finally, building upon an iterative rounding technique previously introduced by Kolliopoulos and Stein (SIAM J Comput 31:919–946, 2002) and Skutella (Math Program 91:493–514, 2002), we prove existence of an unsplittable flow that simultaneously satisfies the upper and lower bounds for the special case when demands are integer multiples of each other. For arbitrary demand values, we prove the weaker simultaneous bounds $$x_a/2-d_{\max }\le y_a\le 2x_a+d_{\max }$$ for all arcs a.},

  abstract     = {In the classic maximum coverage problem, we are given subsets $$T_1, \ldots , T_m$$ of a universe [n] along with an integer k and the objective is to find a subset $$S \subseteq [m]$$ of size k that maximizes $$C(S) :=|\cup _{i \in S} T_i|$$ . It is well-known that the greedy algorithm for this problem achieves an approximation ratio of $$(1-e^{-1})$$ and there is a matching inapproximability result. We note that in the maximum coverage problem if an element $$e \in [n]$$ is covered by several sets, it is still counted only once. By contrast, if we change the problem and count each element e as many times as it is covered, then we obtain a linear objective function, $$C^{(\infty )}(S) = \sum _{i \in S} |T_i|$$ , which can be easily maximized under a cardinality constraint. We study the maximum $$\ell $$ -multi-coverage problem which naturally interpolates between these two extremes. In this problem, an element can be counted up to $$\ell $$ times but no more; hence, we consider maximizing the function $$C^{(\ell )}(S) = \sum _{e \in [n]} \min {\ell , |{i \in S : e \in T_i}| }$$ , subject to the constraint $$|S| \le k$$ . Note that the case of $$\ell = 1$$ corresponds to the standard maximum coverage setting and $$\ell = \infty $$ gives us a linear objective. We develop an efficient approximation algorithm that achieves an approximation ratio of $$1 - \frac{\ell ^{\ell }e^{-\ell }}{\ell !}$$ for the $$\ell $$ -multi-coverage problem. In particular, when $$\ell = 2$$ , this factor is $$1-2e^{-2} \approx 0.73$$ and as $$\ell $$ grows the approximation ratio behaves as $$1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \ell }}$$ . We also prove that this approximation ratio is tight, i.e., establish a matching hardness-of-approximation result, under the Unique Games Conjecture. This problem is motivated by the question of finding a code that optimizes the list-decoding success probability for a given noisy channel. We show how the multi-coverage problem can be relevant in other contexts, such as combinatorial auctions.},

The motivation behind this problem is twofold. First, from fairness considerations: each color/group should receive a similar service guarantee, and second, from the algorithmic challenges it poses: this problem combines the difficulties of clustering along with the subset-sum problem. In particular, we show that this combination results in strong integrality gap lower bounds for several natural linear programming relaxations. Our main result is an efficient approximation algorithm that overcomes these difficulties to achieve an approximation guarantee of 3, nearly matching the tight approximation guarantee of 2 for the classical k-center problem which this problem generalizes. algorithms either opened more than k centers or only worked in the special case when the input points are in the plane.},

  abstract     = {We consider so called 2-stage stochastic integer programs (IPs) and their generalized form, so called multi-stage stochastic IPs. A 2-stage stochastic IP is an integer program of the form $$\max { c^T x \mid {\mathcal {A}} x = b, \,l \le x \le u,\, x \in {\mathbb {Z}}^{s + nt} }$$ where the constraint matrix $${\mathcal {A}} \in {\mathbb {Z}}^{r n \times s +nt}$$ consists roughly of n repetitions of a matrix $$A \in {\mathbb {Z}}^{r \times s}$$ on the vertical line and n repetitions of a matrix $$B \in {\mathbb {Z}}^{r \times t}$$ on the diagonal. In this paper we improve upon an algorithmic result by Hemmecke and Schultz from 2003 [Hemmecke and Schultz, Math. Prog. 2003] to solve 2-stage stochastic IPs. The algorithm is based on the Graver augmentation framework where our main contribution is to give an explicit doubly exponential bound on the size of the augmenting steps. The previous bound for the size of the augmenting steps relied on non-constructive finiteness arguments from commutative algebra and therefore only an implicit bound was known that depends on parameters r, s, t and $$\Delta $$ , where $$\Delta $$ is the largest entry of the constraint matrix. Our new improved bound however is obtained by a novel theorem which argues about intersections of paths in a vector space. As a result of our new bound we obtain an algorithm to solve 2-stage stochastic IPs in time $$f(r,s,\Delta ) \cdot \mathrm {poly}(n,t)$$ , where f is a doubly exponential function. To complement our result, we also prove a doubly exponential lower bound for the size of the augmenting steps.},

  abstract     = {Lattice-free gradient polyhedra can be used to certify optimality for mixed integer convex minimization models. We consider how to construct these polyhedra for unconstrained models with two integer variables under the assumption that all level sets are bounded. In this setting, a classic result of Bell, Doignon, and Scarf states the existence of a lattice-free gradient polyhedron with at most four facets. We present an algorithm for creating a sequence of gradient polyhedra, each of which has at most four facets, that finitely converges to a lattice-free gradient polyhedron. Each update requires constantly many gradient evaluations. Our updates imitate the gradient descent algorithm, and consequently, it yields a gradient descent type of algorithm for problems with two integer variables.},

  abstract     = {We introduce the integrality number of an integer program (IP). Roughly speaking, the integrality number is the smallest number of integer constraints needed to solve an IP via a mixed integer (MIP) relaxation. One notable property of this number is its invariance under unimodular transformations of the constraint matrix. Considering the largest minor $$\varDelta $$ of the constraint matrix, our analysis allows us to make statements of the following form: there exists a number $$\tau (\varDelta )$$ such that an IP with n many variables and $$n + \sqrt{n /\tau (\varDelta )}$$ many inequality constraints can be solved via a MIP relaxation with fewer than n integer constraints. From our results it follows that IPs defined by only n constraints can be solved via a MIP relaxation with $$O(\sqrt{\varDelta })$$ many integer constraints.},

The key ingredients in this construction are a simplicial conic relaxation of S and an S-free set: a convex zone whose interior does not intersect S. Ideally, such S-free set would be maximal inclusion-wise, as it would generate a deeper cutting plane. However, maximality can be a challenging goal in general. In this work, we show how to construct maximal S-free sets when S is defined by a general quadratic inequality. Our maximal S-free sets are such that efficient separation of a vertex in LP-based approaches to quadratically constrained problems is guaranteed.},

In this model, each arc has an associated delay for traversing the arc, and a bound on the rate of flow entering the arc; flows are time-varying. We consider a setting which is very standard within the transportation economic literature, but has received little attention from an algorithmic perspective. The flow consists of users who are able to choose their route but also their departure time, and who desire to arrive at their destination at a particular time, incurring a scheduling cost if they arrive earlier or later. The total cost of a user is then a combination of the time they spend commuting, and the scheduling cost they incur. We present a combinatorial algorithm for the natural optimization problem, that of minimizing the average total cost of all users (i.e., maximizing the social welfare). Based on this, we also show how to set tolls so that this optimal flow is induced as an equilibrium of the underlying game.},

  abstract     = {The most important ingredient for solving mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs) to global $$\epsilon $$ -optimality with spatial branch and bound is a tight, computationally tractable relaxation. Due to both theoretical and practical considerations, relaxations of MINLPs are usually required to be convex. Nonetheless, current optimization solvers can often successfully handle a moderate presence of nonconvexities, which opens the door for the use of potentially tighter nonconvex relaxations. In this work, we exploit this fact and make use of a nonconvex relaxation obtained via aggregation of constraints: a surrogate relaxation. These relaxations were actively studied for linear integer programs in the 70s and 80s, but they have been scarcely considered since. We revisit these relaxations in an MINLP setting and show the computational benefits and challenges they can have. Additionally, we study a generalization of such relaxation that allows for multiple aggregations simultaneously and present the first algorithm that is capable of computing the best set of aggregations. We propose a multitude of computational enhancements for improving its practical performance and evaluate the algorithm’s ability to generate strong dual bounds through extensive computational experiments.},

Specifically, we give the convex hull description of the epigraph of the composition of a one-dimensional convex function and an affine function under arbitrary combinatorial constraints. As special cases of this result, we derive ideal convexifications for problems with hierarchy, multi-collinearity, and sparsity constraints. Moreover, we also give a short proof that for a separable objective function, the perspective reformulation is ideal independent from the constraints of the problem. Our computational experiments with sparse regression problems demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach in improving the relaxation quality without significant computational overhead.},

As further evidence for our conjecture, we also note that it follows from an unpublished conjecture of Seymour from 1975.

Two recently introduced variants of the k-Center problem in this spirit are Colorful k-Center, introduced by Bandyapadhyay, Inamdar, Pai, and Varadarajan, and lottery models, such as the Fair Robust k-Center problem introduced by Harris, Pensyl, Srinivasan, and Trinh. To address fairness aspects, these models, compared to traditional k-Center, include additional covering constraints. Prior approximation results for these models require to relax some of the normally hard constraints, like the number of centers to be opened or the involved covering constraints, and therefore, only obtain constant-factor pseudo-approximations. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to deal with such covering constraints that leads to (true) approximations, including a 4-approximation for Colorful k-Center with constantly many colors—settling an open question raised by Bandyapadhyay, Inamdar, Pai, and Varadarajan—and a 4-approximation for Fair Robust k-Center, for which the existence of a (true) constant-factor approximation was also open. We complement our results by showing that if one allows an unbounded number of colors, then Colorful k-Center admits no approximation algorithm with finite approximation guarantee, assuming that $$\mathtt {P}\ne \mathtt {NP}$$ . Moreover, under the Exponential Time Hypothesis, the problem is inapproximable if the number of colors grows faster than logarithmic in the size of the ground set.},

We first introduce our hybrid estimator and investigate its fundamental properties to form a foundational theory for algorithmic development. Next, we apply our new estimator to develop several variants of stochastic gradient method to solve both expectation and finite-sum composite optimization problems. Our first algorithm can be viewed as a variant of proximal stochastic gradient methods with a single loop and single sample, but can achieve the best-known oracle complexity bound as state-of-the-art double-loop algorithms in the literature. Then, we consider two different variants of our method: adaptive step-size and restarting schemes that have similar theoretical guarantees as in our first algorithm. We also study two mini-batch variants of the proposed methods. In all cases, we achieve the best-known complexity bounds under standard assumptions. We test our algorithms on several numerical examples with real datasets and compare them with many existing methods. Our numerical experiments show that the new algorithms are comparable and, in many cases, outperform their competitors.},

  abstract     = {While semidefinite programming (SDP) problems are polynomially solvable in theory, it is often difficult to solve large SDP instances in practice. One technique to address this issue is to relax the global positive-semidefiniteness (PSD) constraint and only enforce PSD-ness on smaller $$k\times k$$ principal submatrices—we call this the sparse SDP relaxation. Surprisingly, it has been observed empirically that in some cases this approach appears to produce bounds that are close to the optimal objective function value of the original SDP. In this paper, we formally attempt to compare the strength of the sparse SDP relaxation vis-à-vis the original SDP from a theoretical perspective. In order to simplify the question, we arrive at a data independent version of it, where we compare the sizes of SDP cone and the $$k$$ -PSD closure, which is the cone of matrices where PSD-ness is enforced on all $$k\times k$$ principal submatrices. In particular, we investigate the question of how far a matrix of unit Frobenius norm in the $$k$$ -PSD closure can be from the SDP cone. We provide two incomparable upper bounds on this farthest distance as a function of k and n. We also provide matching lower bounds, which show that the upper bounds are tight within a constant in different regimes of k and n. Other than linear algebra techniques, we extensively use probabilistic methods to arrive at these bounds. One of the lower bounds is obtained by observing a connection between matrices in the $$k$$ -PSD closure and matrices satisfying the restricted isometry property.},

  abstract     = {We propose a theoretical framework to capture incremental solutions to cardinality constrained maximization problems. The defining characteristic of our framework is that the cardinality/support of the solution is bounded by a value $$k\in {\mathbb {N}}$$ that grows over time, and we allow the solution to be extended one element at a time. We investigate the best-possible competitive ratio of such an incremental solution, i.e., the worst ratio over all k between the incremental solution after k steps and an optimum solution of cardinality k. We consider a large class of problems that contains many important cardinality constrained maximization problems like maximum matching, knapsack, and packing/covering problems. We provide a general 2.618-competitive incremental algorithm for this class of problems, and we show that no algorithm can have competitive ratio below 2.18 in general. In the second part of the paper, we focus on the inherently incremental greedy algorithm that increases the objective value as much as possible in each step. This algorithm is known to be 1.58-competitive for submodular objective functions, but it has unbounded competitive ratio for the class of incremental problems mentioned above. We define a relaxed submodularity condition for the objective function, capturing problems like maximum (weighted) d-dimensional matching, maximum (weighted) (b-)matching and a variant of the maximum flow problem. We show a general bound for the competitive ratio of the greedy algorithm on the class of problems that satisfy this relaxed submodularity condition. Our bound generalizes the (tight) bound of 1.58 slightly beyond sub-modular functions and yields a tight bound of 2.313 for maximum (weighted) (b-)matching. Our bound is also tight for a more general class of functions as the relevant parameter goes to infinity. Note that our upper bounds on the competitive ratios translate to approximation ratios for the underlying cardinality constrained problems, and our bounds for the greedy algorithm carry over both.},

We obtain, in particular, a nonpositive averaged Hamiltonian gradient condition associated with an adjoint vector being a function of bounded variation. As a well known challenge, theoretical and numerical difficulties may arise due to the possible pathological behavior of the adjoint vector (jumps and singular part lying on parts of the optimal trajectory in contact with the boundary of the restricted state space). However, in our case with sampled-data controls, we prove that, under certain general hypotheses, the optimal trajectory activates the running inequality state constraints at most at the sampling times. Due to this so-called bouncing trajectory phenomenon, the adjoint vector experiences jumps at most at the sampling times (and thus in a finite number and at precise instants) and its singular part vanishes. Taking advantage of these informations, we are able to implement an indirect numerical method which we use to solve three simple examples.},

  abstract     = {Relaxation and rounding approaches became a standard and extremely versatile tool for constrained submodular function maximization. One of the most common rounding techniques in this context are contention resolution schemes. Such schemes round a fractional point by first rounding each coordinate independently, and then dropping some elements to reach a feasible set. Also the second step, where elements are dropped, is typically randomized. This leads to an additional source of randomization within the procedure, which can complicate the analysis. We suggest a different, polyhedral viewpoint to design contention resolution schemes, which avoids to deal explicitly with the randomization in the second step. This is achieved by focusing on the marginals of a dropping procedure. Apart from avoiding one source of randomization, our viewpoint allows for employing polyhedral techniques. Both can significantly simplify the construction and analysis of contention resolution schemes. We show how, through our framework, one can obtain an optimal monotone contention resolution scheme for bipartite matchings, which has a balancedness of 0.4762. So far, only very few results are known about optimality of monotone contention resolution schemes. Our contention resolution scheme for the bipartite case also improves the lower bound on the correlation gap for bipartite matchings. Furthermore, we derive a monotone contention resolution scheme for matchings that significantly improves over the previously best one. More precisely, we obtain a balancedness of 0.4326, improving on a prior 0.1997-balanced scheme. At the same time, our scheme implies that the currently best lower bound on the correlation gap for matchings is not tight. Our results lead to improved approximation factors for various constrained submodular function maximization problems over a combination of matching constraints with further constraints.},

In spite of its popularity in practice, there does not exist any analysis on the convergence rates of this method. In this paper, we first establish the number of iterations, i.e., iteration complexity, required by a basic dual dynamic programming method for solving single-scenario multi-stage optimization problems, by introducing novel mathematical tools including the saturation of search points. We then refine these basic tools and establish the iteration complexity for an explorative dual dynamic programing method proposed herein and the classic stochastic dual dynamic programming method for solving more general multi-stage stochastic optimization problems under the standard stage-wise independence assumption. Our results indicate that the complexity of these methods mildly increases with the number of stages T, in fact linearly dependent on T for discounted problems. Therefore, they are efficient for strategic decision making which involves a large number of stages, but with a relatively small number of decision variables in each stage. Without explicitly discretizing the state and action spaces, these methods might also be pertinent to the related reinforcement learning and stochastic control areas.},

Such approaches rely on “negative momentum”, a technique for further variance reduction that is generally specific to the SVRG gradient estimator. In this work, we show for the first time that negative momentum is unnecessary for acceleration and develop a universal acceleration framework that allows all popular variance-reduced methods to achieve accelerated convergence rates. The constants appearing in these rates, including their dependence on the number of functions n, scale with the mean-squared-error and bias of the gradient estimator. In a series of numerical experiments, we demonstrate that versions of SAGA, SVRG, SARAH, and SARGE using our framework significantly outperform non-accelerated versions and compare favourably with algorithms using negative momentum.},

The resulting algorithms have the same kind of coordination procedure and can be implemented in the same block-iterative and highly flexible manner, but may perform backward steps on some operators and forward steps on others. Prior algorithms in the projective splitting family have used only backward steps. Forward steps can be used for any Lipschitz-continuous operators provided the stepsize is bounded by the inverse of the Lipschitz constant. If the Lipschitz constant is unknown, a simple backtracking linesearch procedure may be used. For affine operators, the stepsize can be chosen adaptively without knowledge of the Lipschitz constant and without any additional forward steps. We close the paper by empirically studying the performance of several kinds of splitting algorithms on a large-scale rare feature selection problem.},

This parameter has been used for decades for analyzing the complexity of various optimization problems and for obtaining tractable algorithms for problems where this parameter is bounded. The goal of this work is to contribute to the understanding of the limits of the treewidth-based tractability in optimization. Our results are as follows. First, we prove that, in a certain sense, the already known positive results on extension complexity based on low treewidth are the best possible. Secondly, under mild assumptions, we prove that treewidth is the only graph-theoretical parameter that yields tractability for a wide class of optimization problems, a fact well known in Graphical Models in Machine Learning and in Constraint Satisfaction Problems, which here we extend to an approximation setting in Optimization.},

  abstract     = {We consider the generalized trust region subproblem (GTRS) of minimizing a nonconvex quadratic objective over a nonconvex quadratic constraint. A lifting of this problem recasts the GTRS as minimizing a linear objective subject to two nonconvex quadratic constraints. Our first main contribution is structural: we give an explicit description of the convex hull of this nonconvex set in terms of the generalized eigenvalues of an associated matrix pencil. This result may be of interest in building relaxations for nonconvex quadratic programs. Moreover, this result allows us to reformulate the GTRS as the minimization of two convex quadratic functions in the original space. Our next set of contributions is algorithmic: we present an algorithm for solving the GTRS up to an $$\epsilon $$ additive error based on this reformulation. We carefully handle numerical issues that arise from inexact generalized eigenvalue and eigenvector computations and establish explicit running time guarantees for these algorithms. Notably, our algorithms run in linear (in the size of the input) time. Furthermore, our algorithm for computing an $$\epsilon $$ -optimal solution has a slightly-improved running time dependence on $$\epsilon $$ over the state-of-the-art algorithm. Our analysis shows that the dominant cost in solving the GTRS lies in solving a generalized eigenvalue problem—establishing a natural connection between these problems. Finally, generalizations of our convex hull results allow us to apply our algorithms and their theoretical guarantees directly to equality-, interval-, and hollow-constrained variants of the GTRS. This gives the first linear-time algorithm in the literature for these variants of the GTRS.},

  abstract     = {We present a Branch-and-Cut algorithm for a class of nonlinear chance-constrained mathematical optimization problems with a finite number of scenarios. Unsatisfied scenarios can enter a recovery mode. This class corresponds to problems that can be reformulated as deterministic convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems with indicator variables and continuous scenario variables, but the size of the reformulation is large and quickly becomes impractical as the number of scenarios grows. The Branch-and-Cut algorithm is based on an implicit Benders decomposition scheme, where we generate cutting planes as outer approximation cuts from the projection of the feasible region on suitable subspaces. The size of the master problem in our scheme is much smaller than the deterministic reformulation of the chance-constrained problem. We apply the Branch-and-Cut algorithm to the mid-term hydro scheduling problem, for which we propose a chance-constrained formulation. A computational study using data from ten hydroplants in Greece shows that the proposed methodology solves instances faster than applying a general-purpose solver for convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems to the deterministic reformulation, and scales much better with the number of scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Multi-stage stochastic linear programs (MSLPs) are notoriously hard to solve in general. Linear decision rules (LDRs) yield an approximation of an MSLP by restricting the decisions at each stage to be an affine function of the observed uncertain parameters. Finding an optimal LDR is a static optimization problem that provides an upper bound on the optimal value of the MSLP, and, under certain assumptions, can be formulated as an explicit linear program. Similarly, as proposed by Kuhn et al. (Math Program 130(1):177–209, 2011) a lower bound for an MSLP can be obtained by restricting decisions in the dual of the MSLP to follow an LDR. We propose a new approximation approach for MSLPs, two-stage LDRs. The idea is to require only the state variables in an MSLP to follow an LDR, which is sufficient to obtain an approximation of an MSLP that is a two-stage stochastic linear program (2SLP). We similarly propose to apply LDR only to a subset of the variables in the dual of the MSLP, which yields a 2SLP approximation of the dual that provides a lower bound on the optimal value of the MSLP. Although solving the corresponding 2SLP approximations exactly is intractable in general, we investigate how approximate solution approaches that have been developed for solving 2SLP can be applied to solve these approximation problems, and derive statistical upper and lower bounds on the optimal value of the MSLP. In addition to potentially yielding better policies and bounds, this approach requires many fewer assumptions than are required to obtain an explicit reformulation when using the standard static LDR approach. A computational study on two example problems demonstrates that using a two-stage LDR can yield significantly better primal policies and modestly better dual policies than using policies based on a static LDR.},

To be able to quantify these rates, we consider the law of the iterated logarithm in a Banach space setting and first establish under relatively mild assumptions almost sure convergence rates for the approximating objective functions, which can then be transferred to the estimators for optimal values and solutions of the approximated problem. By exploiting a characterisation of the law of the iterated logarithm in Banach spaces, we are further able to derive under the same assumptions that the estimators also converge in mean, at a rate which essentially coincides with the one in the almost sure sense. This, in turn, allows to quantify the asymptotic bias of optimal estimators as well as to draw conclusive insights on their mean squared error and on the estimators for the optimality gap. Finally, we address the notion of convergence in probability to derive rates in probability for the deviation of optimal estimators and (weak) rates of error probabilities without imposing strong conditions on exponential moments. We discuss the possibility to construct confidence sets for the optimal values and solutions from our obtained results and provide a numerical illustration of the most relevant findings.},

One collects previous cases, called “scenarios”, for the set-up in which optimization is being performed, and makes a decision that is optimal for the cases that have been collected. For convex optimization, a solid theory has been developed that provides guarantees of performance, and constraint satisfaction, of the scenario solution. In this paper, we open a new direction of investigation: the risk that a performance is not achieved, or that constraints are violated, is studied jointly with the complexity (as precisely defined in the paper) of the solution. It is shown that the joint probability distribution of risk and complexity is concentrated in such a way that the complexity carries fundamental information to tightly judge the risk. This result is obtained without requiring extra knowledge on the underlying optimization problem than that carried by the scenarios; in particular, no extra knowledge on the distribution by which scenarios are generated is assumed, so that the result is broadly applicable. This deep-seated result unveils a fundamental and general structure of data-driven optimization and suggests practical approaches for risk assessment.},

We show that the latter is convex if either right-hand sides or costs are random and can be transformed into a semi-infinite program in a number of cases.

  abstract     = {Scenario generation is the construction of a discrete random vector to represent parameters of uncertain values in a stochastic program. Most approaches to scenario generation are distribution-driven, that is, they attempt to construct a random vector which captures well in a probabilistic sense the uncertainty. On the other hand, a problem-driven approach may be able to exploit the structure of a problem to provide a more concise representation of the uncertainty. In this paper we propose an analytic approach to problem-driven scenario generation. This approach applies to stochastic programs where a tail risk measure, such as conditional value-at-risk, is applied to a loss function. Since tail risk measures only depend on the upper tail of a distribution, standard methods of scenario generation, which typically spread their scenarios evenly across the support of the random vector, struggle to adequately represent tail risk. Our scenario generation approach works by targeting the construction of scenarios in areas of the distribution corresponding to the tails of the loss distributions. We provide conditions under which our approach is consistent with sampling, and as proof-of-concept demonstrate how our approach could be applied to two classes of problem, namely network design and portfolio selection. Numerical tests on the portfolio selection problem demonstrate that our approach yields better and more stable solutions compared to standard Monte Carlo sampling.},

  abstract     = {A distributionally robust joint chance constraint involves a set of uncertain linear inequalities which can be violated up to a given probability threshold $$\epsilon $$ , over a given family of probability distributions of the uncertain parameters. A conservative approximation of a joint chance constraint, often referred to as a Bonferroni approximation, uses the union bound to approximate the joint chance constraint by a system of single chance constraints, one for each original uncertain constraint, for a fixed choice of violation probabilities of the single chance constraints such that their sum does not exceed $$\epsilon $$ . It has been shown that, under various settings, a distributionally robust single chance constraint admits a deterministic convex reformulation. Thus the Bonferroni approximation approach can be used to build convex approximations of distributionally robust joint chance constraints. In this paper we consider an optimized version of Bonferroni approximation where the violation probabilities of the individual single chance constraints are design variables rather than fixed a priori. We show that such an optimized Bonferroni approximation of a distributionally robust joint chance constraint is exact when the uncertainties are separable across the individual inequalities, i.e., each uncertain constraint involves a different set of uncertain parameters and corresponding distribution families. Unfortunately, the optimized Bonferroni approximation leads to NP-hard optimization problems even in settings where the usual Bonferroni approximation is tractable. When the distribution family is specified by moments or by marginal distributions, we derive various sufficient conditions under which the optimized Bonferroni approximation is convex and tractable. We also show that for moment based distribution families and binary decision variables, the optimized Bonferroni approximation can be reformulated as a mixed integer second-order conic set. Finally, we demonstrate how our results can be used to derive a convex reformulation of a distributionally robust joint chance constraint with a specific non-separable distribution family.},

In the case when the risk measure is risk neutral, the stability result is presented with the variation of the ambiguity set being measured by generic metrics of $$\zeta $$ -structure, which provides a unified framework for quantitative stability analysis under various metrics including total variation metric and Kantorovich metric. When the ambiguity set is structured by a $$\zeta $$ -ball, we find that the Hausdorff distance between two $$\zeta $$ -balls is bounded by the distance of their centers and difference of their radii. The findings allow us to strengthen some recent convergence results on distributionally robust optimization where the center of the Wasserstein ball is constructed by the empirical probability distribution.},
