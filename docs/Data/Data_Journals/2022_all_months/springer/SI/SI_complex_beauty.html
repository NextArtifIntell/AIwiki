  abstract     = {Emerging trends in algorithm design have shown that hybrid algorithms, which combine or merge multiple algorithms, can create synergies to overcome the inherent limitations of the underlying individual algorithms. There are two broad types of hybridization: collaborative—individual algorithms tackle an instance of the problem sequentially or in parallel and exchange information accordingly while solving the problem; integrative—individual algorithms are dedicated to tackling different aspect(s) of the problem-solving process. In this research, we propose a schema for an enhanced form of integrative hybridization that blends granular algorithmic components from multiple algorithms to derive a new singular clustering algorithm. As a case study, we examine the ant clustering algorithm (a swarm intelligence algorithm that is based on the natural phenomenon of brood sorting in some species of ants); highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithm; and present a blend of algorithmic components from Tabu search into the algorithm to improve its exploration strategy and solution quality. Empirical results from applying the blended algorithm to clustering benchmark datasets show improved clustering validation measures for the proposed blended hybrid algorithm compared to other hybridization of the same underlying individual algorithms. Besides, the quality of clusters uncovered by this hybrid algorithm competes favorably with those uncovered using popular clustering algorithms such as DBSCAN and mean shift.},

  abstract     = {In several real Multi-Agent Systems, it has been observed that only weaker forms of metastable consensus are achieved, in which a large majority of agents agree on some opinion while other opinions continue to be supported by a (small) minority of agents. In this work, we take a step towards the investigation of metastable consensus for complex (nonlinear) opinion dynamics by considering the popular Undecided-State dynamics in the binary setting, which is known to reach consensus exponentially faster than the Voter dynamics. We propose a simple form of uniform noise in which each message can change to another one with probability p and we prove that the persistence of a metastable consensus undergoes a phase transition for $$p=\frac{1}{6}$$ . In detail, below this threshold, we prove the system reaches with high probability a metastable regime where a large majority of agents keeps supporting the same opinion for polynomial time. Moreover, this opinion turns out to be the initial majority opinion, whenever the initial bias is slightly larger than its standard deviation. On the contrary, above the threshold, we show that the information about the initial majority opinion is “lost” within logarithmic time even when the initial bias is maximum. Interestingly, we show our results have explicit connections to two different concrete frameworks. The first one concerns a specific setting of a well-studied value-sensitive decision mechanism inspired by cross-inhibition in house-hunting honeybee swarms. The second framework consists of a consensus process where a subset of agents behave in a stubborn way.},

One of the main issues with those problems is the inherent NP-hardness of combinatorial optimisation. To handle this issue, this paper develops a decentralised task allocation algorithm by leveraging the submodularity concept and a sampling process of task sets. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm can provide an approximation guarantee of 1/2 of the optimal solution for the monotone submodular case and 1/4 for the non-monotone submodular case, both with polynomial time complexity. To examine the performance of the proposed algorithm and validate the theoretical analysis, we introduce two task allocation scenarios and perform numerical simulations. The simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm achieves a solution quality which is comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms in the monotone case and much better quality in the non-monotone case with significantly lower computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we investigate the emergence of naming conventions within a swarm of robots that collectively forage, that is, collect resources from multiple sources in the environment. While foraging, the swarm explores the environment and makes a collective decision on how to exploit the available resources, either by selecting a single source or concurrently exploiting more than one. At the same time, the robots locally exchange messages in order to agree on how to name each source. Here, we study the correlation between the task-induced interaction network and the emergent naming conventions. In particular, our goal is to determine whether the dynamics of the interaction network are sufficient to determine an emergent vocabulary that is potentially useful to the robot swarm. To be useful, linguistic conventions need to be compact and meaningful, that is, to be the minimal description of the relevant features of the environment and of the made collective decision. We show that, in order to obtain a useful vocabulary, the task-dependent interaction network alone is not sufficient, but it must be combined with a correlation between language and foraging dynamics. On the basis of these results, we propose a decentralised algorithm for collective categorisation which enables the swarm to achieve a useful—compact and meaningful—naming of all the available sources. Understanding how useful linguistic conventions emerge contributes to the design of robot swarms with potentially improved autonomy, flexibility, and self-awareness.},

We assume a group of robots flocking in an unknown environment, each of which has only incomplete knowledge of the geometry without a map, a shared coordinate, or the use of a centralized control scheme. Instead, the controller requires only local information about the area around individual robots. We devise a phase transition machine, which designs overall obstacle avoidance procedures in a fully distributed way. Robots in collision with an obstacle distributively measure the topology of the sensor network formed by the robots in order to estimate the shape of the obstacle, and choose a motion model, either obstacle-detouring or bouncing-off, each of which deforms the network to avoid an obstacle without knowledge of the geometry around the obstacle. The robots then sense the maximum tree angle, which detects the straightness of a configuration to ensure the completion of the obstacle avoidance procedure, and perform flocking with a modified heading consensus to reconstruct a volumed network with their original headings. We provide theoretical performance analyses of the controller. We also validate the theoretical results by multiple simulations with a swarm with various population sizes.},

The MGPSO is a multi-swarm approach developed for static multi-objective optimisation problems, where each subswarm optimises one of the objectives. It uses a bounded archive that is based on a crowding distance archive implementation. This paper adapts the MGPSO algorithm to solve DMOPs by proposing alternative archive update strategies to allow efficient tracking of the changing Pareto-optimal front. To evaluate the adapted MGPSO for DMOPs, a total of twenty-nine benchmark functions and six performance measures were implemented. The problem set consists of problems with only two or three objectives, and the exact time of the changes is assumed to be known beforehand. The experiments were run against five different environment types, where both the frequency of changes and the severity of changes parameters control how often and how severe the changes are during the optimisation of a DMOP. The best archive management approach was compared to the other state-of-the-art dynamic multi-objective optimisation algorithms (DMOAs). An extensive empirical analysis shows that MGPSO with a local search approach to the archive management achieves very competitive and oftentimes better performance when compared with the other DMOAs.},

This paper’s contribution is twofold. The first contribution is an exploration of the design space of computer-based interfaces for multi-human multi-robot operations. In particular, we focus on agent transparency and on the factors that affect inter-human communication in ideal conditions, i.e., without communication issues. Our second contribution concerns the same problem, but considering increasing degrees of information loss, defined as intermittent reception of data with noticeable gaps between individual receipts.

  abstract     = {The coordinated motion of large flocks of starlings is fascinating for both laymen and scientists. During their aerial displays, the darkness of flocks often changes, for instance dark bands propagate through the flock (so-called agitation waves) and small or large parts of the flock darken. The causes of dark bands in agitation waves have recently been shown to depend on changes in orientation of birds relative to the observer rather than changes in density of the flock, but what causes other changes in darkness need to be studied still and this is the aim of the present investigation. Because we cannot empirically relate changes in darkness in flocks to quantities, such as position and orientation of the flock and of its members relative to the observer, we study this in a computational model. We use StarDisplay, a model of collective motion of starlings, because its flocks resemble empirical data in many properties, such as their three-dimensional shape, their manner of turning, the correlation of heading of its group-members, and its internal structure regarding density and stability of neighbors. We show that the change in darkness in the flocks perceived by an observer on the ground mostly depends on the observer’s distance to the flock and on the degree of exposure of the wing surface of flock members to the observer, and that darkness appears to decrease when birds roll during sharp turns. Remarkably, the darkness of the flock perceived by the observer was neither affected by the orientation of the flock relative to the observer nor by the density of the flock. Further studies are needed to investigate changes in darkness for flocks under predation.},

  abstract     = {In swarm decision making, hand-crafting agents’ rules that use local information to achieve desirable swarm-level behaviours is a non-trivial design problem. Instead of relying entirely on swarm experts for designing these local rules, machine learning (ML) algorithms can be utilised for learning some of the local rules by mapping an agent’s perception to an appropriate action. To facilitate this process, we propose the use of Machine Education (ME) as a systematic approach for designing a curriculum for teaching the agents the required skills to autonomously select appropriate behaviours. We study the use of ME in the context of decision-making in best-of-n problems. The proposed approach draws on swarm robotics expertise for identifying agents’ capabilities and limitations, the skills required for generating the desirable behaviours, and the corresponding performance measures. In addition, ME utilises ML expertise for the selection and development of the ML algorithms suitable for each skill. The results of the experimental evaluations demonstrate the superior efficacy of the ME-based approach over the state-of-the-art approaches with respect to speed and accuracy. In addition, our approach shows considerable robustness to changes in swarm size and to changes in sensing and communication noise. Our findings promote the use of ME for teaching swarm members the required skills for achieving complex swarm tasks.},

We situate our approach within the reinforcement learning as a rehearsal (RLaR) framework, that we have recently introduced. We instantiate RLaR for the foraging problem and experimentally show that a key component of RLaR—a conditional probability distribution function—can be modeled as a uni-modal distribution (with a lower memory footprint) despite evidence that it is multi-modal.

  abstract     = {For decades, both empirical and theoretical models have been proposed to explain the patterns and mechanisms of collective decision-making (CDM). The most-studied CDM scenario is the best-of-n problem in a static environment. However, natural environments are typically dynamic. In dynamic environments, the visual occlusions produced by other members of a large-scale group are also common. Hence, some agents of a group are less informed than others, and their state uncertainties increase. This paper develops a new model referred to as the generalized Ising model with dynamic confidence (GIM-C) to reduce the state uncertainty induced by visual occlusions. The proposed model first estimates the expected rewards of possible actions with dynamic confidence weighting. It then gives the probability of choosing each action based on the generalized Ising model with an external field defined by the last stage’s results. Numerical simulations demonstrate that GIM-C shares the key feature of social cohesion with previous CDM models. Furthermore, in order to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed GIM-C, the collecting foraging task is considered, where a large-scale group of agents is required to obtain rewards with the presence of a dynamic predator and visual occlusions. The good performance of GIM-C in the collecting foraging task demonstrates that dynamic confidence weighting is efficient in reducing the state uncertainty introduced by visual occlusions. The proposed GIM-C also demonstrates the importance of enhancing the influence of informed agents in CDM problems in a dynamic environment with visual occlusions.},
