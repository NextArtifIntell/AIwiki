  abstract     = {At present, the multiobjective optimization algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) has become a typical algorithm for solving multiobjective problems. Following extensive experiments, researchers found that the choice of mutation operators in MOEA/D has a great influence on the quality of the solutions, and a suitable operator can largely improve the algorithm’s performance. This paper proposes a hybrid operator selection strategy based on feedback and support vector machine (SVM) classification, and applies it to the framework of MOEA/D. The algorithm divides the whole evolutionary process into several stages, and each stage is divided into two parts. In the first part, multiple mutation operators are given the same computing resources to generate offspring, then, we test the performance of each operator and elect the operator with the best performance. Meanwhile, an SVM classifier is trained by taking the truly evaluated offspring as the training set. Good operators do not always generate good offspring. Therefore, in the second part, we use the best performing operator selected in the first part to generate offspring, while using the trained classifier to filter all the newly generated solutions. The real evaluation should be carried out only when the offspring are identified as positive. Otherwise, it should be ignored to save the real evaluation computing resources. Additionally, the number of all positive individuals is recorded in the second part, which is when we decide whether to continue using this operator at the next stage or to reselect a more suitable operator. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of this strategy.},

By exchanging information between the population and the agent, the ERL algorithm can perfectly handle a range of challenging control tasks. However, for some complex reward structure problems, both deep reinforcement learning and ERL algorithms easily get stuck in local optima because of the deception of reward function. To address this problem, we integrate a novelty search in the framework of the ERL algorithm, and it guides the agent or population to visit state space where it has rarely or never visited. Five robot locomotion continuous optimization problems were employed as benchmarks. Simulation results show our proposed algorithm outperformed its competitors in most tested environments.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on a heuristic solution strategy with adaptive scalarization for linear semivectorial bilevel programming (LSVBLP) as well as its practical application. An adaptive scalarization approach is adopted to the lower level multiobjective optimization problem to make it become a single objective linear programming (LP). The linear bilevel formulation can be reformulated as single-level programming with complementary constraints using the duality theory of LP, such that it is now equivalent to a single-level mixed-integer LP. To solve this resulting mixed-integer LP, a specific variable grouping strategy is proposed to reduce the computational complexity, in which all variables are divided into two groups: one group includes mixed-integer variables, and the other group only contains real-valued variables. In each iteration, the mixed-integer variables in the first group only need to be obtained by the improved mixed-coding differential evolution, while the pure real-valued variables in the second group are obtained by an LP solver. Experimental results on some numerical instances indicate that the proposed hybrid heuristic algorithm is comparable to or better than other algorithms in the literature. To demonstrate its practicability, a customer-oriented production-distribution planning problem is modeled as an LSVBLP, and then the model is solved effectively.},

In this paper, a bi-level transformation based evolutionary algorithm (BiTEA) framework is proposed to transform the ECOP into a bi-level optimization problem. In the BiTEA framework, the original ECOP is solved by an EA as the upper level problem, and the equality constraints are handled by another EA as the lower level problem. To facilitate performance comparison, a set of scalable ECOP test instances with various composable complexities is constructed for experimental studies. The performance of an implementation of the proposed BiTEA on these constructed instances is verified by comparing its performance to that of three state-of-the-art constraints handling EA methods.},

  abstract     = {Market impact costs are important factors to portfolio management, which always lead to adverse price fluctuations in trading. As the practical trading volume becomes increasingly large, the Problem of Portfolio Optimization with Market Impact Costs (MICPOP) has become more important. Traditional MICPOPs involve seeking an optimal allocation of capital to a limited number of assets with respect to either additional constraints or a weighted sum of objectives (net return, investment risk). We suggest solving MICPOPs with Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). Specifically, we formulate MICPOPs as a bi-objective optimization problem. The advantages of MOEAs over state-of-the-art single objective approaches to MICPOPs will be shown through empirical studies. Our study has revealed that a well-known MOEA, namely Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), fails to provide satisfactory solution quality sometimes. Hence, a memetic MOEA for Portfolio Optimization with Market Impact costs (POMI-MOEA), which inherits the global search capability of NSGA-II while introducing a new local search operator, is proposed and evaluated in this paper. Comprehensive experimental studies on 11 portfolio cases have shown the superiority of POMI-MOEA over NSGA-II and other two MOEAs for MICPOPs.},

  abstract     = {The Linear Ordering Problem (LOP) is a very popular NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with many practical applications that may require the use of large instances. The Linear Ordering Library (LOLIB) gathers a set of standard benchmarks that are widely used in validating solvers for the LOP. Among them, xLOLIB2 collects some of the largest and most challenging instances in the current literature. In this work, we present new best-known solutions for each of the 200 complex instances that comprise xLOLIB2 and for the other 93 instances of the benchmarks with smaller sizes. This important advance in the field of LOP has been made possible due to the development of a novel memetic algorithm (MA) that was designed by taking into account some of the weaknesses of state-of-the-art LOP solvers. In particular, one of the keys to success is that the novel proposal allows for a gradual shift from exploration to exploitation. This is done using the novel Best Non-Penalized (BNP) replacement strategy. BNP selects the survivors by taking into account the quality, the Spearman’s footrule distance, the stopping criterion, and the elapsed period of execution simultaneously. The novel diversity-aware proposal is called the memetic algorithm with explicit diversity management (MA-EDM) and extensive comparisons against state-of-the-art techniques provide insights into the reasons for the superiority of MA-EDM.},

One way for solving this limitation is utilizing the concept of covariance-based learning to transform the original space into the new space in which the interactions among variables are revealed and operators perform in an appropriate coordinate system. In this paper, Monarch butterfly optimization (MBO), a new nature-inspired and rotation-variance algorithm, is studied. By focusing on making MBO more rotationally invariant, a covariance-based clustered MBO (CCMBO) is presented. In the CCMBO, two primary operators of MBO are modified. An eigenvector-based migration operator and a linearized adjusting operator are utilized to make MBO more rotationally invariant. CCMBO employs a re-initialization operator to improve its exploration ability. Also, to allow exploiting obtained information about the search space, CCMBO utilizes self-organizing map clustering. The CCMBO is evaluated on an extensive set of optimization benchmark functions. It is compared with MBO, two of its improvements, and six other state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms. The results illustrate that CCMBO obtains significantly better performance and would be a valuable and practical algorithm for optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {In supply chain literature, production coordination and vehicle routing have received a lot of attention. Even though all functions in the supply chain are interrelated, they are normally handled independently. This disconnected approach might lead to less-than-ideal outcomes. Increasing total efficiency by integrating manufacturing and delivery scheduling processes is popular. This study focuses on synchronic production–distribution scheduling difficulties, particularly permutation flow shop scheduling in production and sequence-dependent setup time (SDST) and vehicle routing alternatives in distribution. To create a cost-effective distribution among the placement of geographically separated clients and hence to minimize delivery costs, batch delivery to customers employing a succession of homogenized capacity limitation vehicles is examined here. However, this might result in the failure to complete multiple client orders before their deadlines, raising the cost of lateness. As a result, the goal of this study is to lower the overall cost of tardiness and batch distribution in the supply chain. To accomplish so, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is developed, and the model is solved using a suggested genetic algorithm (GA). Because there is no established benchmark for this issue, a set of genuine problem scenarios is created in order to assess the proposed GA in a viable and difficult environment. Ruiz&#39;s benchmark data, which is derived from Taillard&#39;s benchmark cases of permutation flow shops, was supplemented with SDSTs in the production of test examples. In comparison to an exact method, the results show that the proposed GA can rapidly seek solutions to optimality for most small-sized instances. Furthermore, for medium and large-scale cases, the proposed GA continues to work well and produces solutions in a fair amount of time in comparison to GA without the local search.},

Inspired by the biological brain architecture of living things, ANN has shown widespread success in pattern recognition, data analysis and classification tasks. Among the many models of neural networks conceptualized and developed over the years, the Spiking Neural Network (SNN) which was initiated in 1996 has shown great promise in the current push towards compact embedded AI. By combining both spatial and temporal information as features in the training and testing process, many inherent shortcomings of traditional ANNs can be overcome. With temporal features and event-driven updating of the network, SNNs hold the potential of improving computational and energy efficiency. In SNN, the most basic signal carrier element is the spike, bringing about a revolution in neural network weights updating compared to traditional methods that are widely applied in ANNs. In literature, there have been numerous SNN weights updating algorithms developed in recent years. With the active and dynamic research work on SNN, a consolidation of the state-of-the-art SNN research is beneficial. This paper is aimed at reviewing and surveying the current status of research pertaining to SNN, in particular highlighting the various novel SNN training techniques coupled with an objective comparison of the techniques. SNN applications and associated neuromorphic hardware systems are also covered in this survey, with some thoughts on the challenges in developing new SNN training algorithms and discussion on potential future research trends are presented in this survey.},

Several scenarios of increasing complexity with different fitness functions and initial probability distributions are analyzed.

Therefore, composing an algorithm portfolio which performs well for a given problem class is essential. In this paper, based on a problem set drawn from any unknown problem class according to an unknown probability distribution, we propose a general method to automatically accomplish portfolio construction. The problem set is used as training data for our method to learn an algorithm portfolio suitable for solving the underlying problem class. To construct the portfolio, algorithms are chosen and added one by one. We first find the best-performing algorithm based on its average rank of solving the training problem set. Its most complementary algorithm is then selected by applying the Pearson correlation coefficient of fitness values at the first hitting time. The method iterates to compose the portfolio with more and more algorithms until there is no more improvement. The experimental results indicate the effectiveness of this approach to select well-cooperated algorithms, and the composed portfolio is shown to have the best rank compared to individual algorithms, elite portfolios and comparison algorithms.},

Two well-known members of this class are the minimum ratio cut and the minimum normalized cut problems. Our focus is on developing metaheuristic-based approaches for ratio cut and normalized cut graph partitioning. We present three techniques in this category: multistart simulated annealing (MSA), iterated tabu search (ITS), and the memetic algorithm (MA). The latter two use a local search procedure. To speed up this procedure, we apply a technique that reduces the effort required for neighborhood examination. We carried out computational experiments on both random graphs and benchmark graphs from the literature. The numerical results indicate that the MA is a clear winner among the tested methods. Using rigorous statistical tests, we show that MA is unequivocally superior to MSA and ITS in terms of both the best and average solution values. Additionally, we compare the performances of MA and the variable neighborhood search (VNS) heuristic from the literature, which is the state-of-the-art algorithm for the normalized cut model. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MA over VNS, especially for structured graphs.},

  abstract     = {As a typical large-scale multiobjective optimization problem extracted from real-world applications, the voltage transformer ratio error estimation (TREE) problem is challenging for existing evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Due to the large number of decision variables in the problems, existing algorithms cannot solve TREE problems efficiently. Besides, most EAs may fail to balance the convergence enhancement and diversity maintenance, leading to the trap in local optima even at the early stage of the evolution. This work proposes an adaptive large-scale multiobjective EA (LSMOEA) to handle the TREE problems with thousands of decision variables. Generally, multiple efficient offspring generation and environmental selection strategies selected from some representative LSMOEAs are included. Then an adaptive selection strategy is used to determine which offspring generation and environmental selection operators are used in each generation of the evolution. Thus, the search behavior of the proposed algorithm evolves along with the evolution process, the balance between convergence and diversity is maintained, and the proposed algorithm is expected to solve TREE problems effectively and efficiently. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves significant performance improvement due to the adaptive selection of different operators, providing an effective and efficient approach for large-scale optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Grid-connected microgrids comprising renewable energy, energy storage systems and local load, play a vital role in decreasing the energy consumption of fossil diesel and greenhouse gas emissions. A distribution power network connecting several microgrids can promote more potent and reliable operations to enhance the security and privacy of the power system. However, the operation control for a multi-microgrid system is a big challenge. To design a multi-microgrid power system, an intelligent multi-microgrids energy management method is proposed based on the preference-based multi-objective reinforcement learning (PMORL) techniques. The power system model can be divided into three layers: the consumer layer, the independent system operator layer, and the power grid layer. Each layer intends to maximize its benefit. The PMORL is proposed to lead to a Pareto optimal set for each object to achieve these objectives. A non-dominated solution is decided to execute a balanced plan not to favor any particular participant. The preference-based results show that the proposed method can effectively learn different preferences. The simulation outcomes confirm the performance of the PMORL and verify the viability of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {With the deepening of economic globalization and the development of the manufacturing industry, distributed manufacturing patterns have become a popular topic in current production research. In the background of distributed shop scheduling, process planning problems in different factories are considered integrally with scheduling problems to utilize the heterogeneous machining resources of distributed factories. To address actual production problems more concretely, this paper investigates the multiobjective distributed integrated process planning and scheduling (MODIPPS) problem to minimize makespan, maximum machine load, and total machine load, and it establishes a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. In addition, by designing a new encoding method based on the OR-nodes of the process network graph, this paper proposes a multiobjective memetic algorithm (MOMA) to solve the problem. The proposed MOMA can guarantee the feasibility of individuals by several specially designed genetic operators so that the process precedence constraints in the network graph are satisfied in the whole algorithm period. Furthermore, the algorithm introduces a simulated annealing (SA) mechanism to avoid falling into a local optimum by accepting relatively poor individuals with a certain probability. Finally, through comparison experiments on benchmarks, the proposed method shows sufficient effectiveness and superiority in solving MODIPPS problems compared with existing classic multiobjective optimization algorithms.},

In this paper, we extend our previous work to propose a generic framework with a Pareto-based bi-indicator infill sampling criterion for expensive many-objective optimization. The proposed framework gives a general method for traditional MOEAs to solve the expensive optimization task.

  abstract     = {The characteristic of large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (LSMOPs) is optimizing multiple conflicting objectives while considering thousands of decision variables at the same time. An efficient optimization algorithm for LSMOPs should have the ability to search a large decision space and find the global optimum in the objective space. Maintaining the diversity of the population is one of the effective ways to locate the Pareto optimal set in a large search space. In this paper, we propose a large-scale multiobjective optimization algorithm based on the probabilistic prediction model, called LMOPPM, to establish a generating-filtering strategy and tackle the LSMOP. The proposed method improves the diversity of the population through importance sampling and enhances the convergence of the population via a trend prediction model. Furthermore, due to the adoption of the individual-based evolutionary mechanism, the computational costs of the proposed method are less relevant to the number of decision variables, thus avoiding high time complexity. We compared the proposed algorithm with several state-of-the-art algorithms on benchmark functions. The experimental results and complexity analysis demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides significant improvements in terms of performance and computational efficiency in large-scale multiobjective optimization.},

  abstract     = {Most real-world optimization problems consist of multiple objectives to be optimized and multiple constraints to be satisfied. Moreover, the performance assessment of the objective and constraints often requires running different software packages separately along with evaluating mathematically defined functions with significantly different (heterogeneous) computing times. A single software package may compute a functional group of objectives and constraints as a block, thereby creating a complicated computing pattern in evaluating a single population member. While much effort has been made to handle computationally expensive functions in the literature, little attention has been paid to handle heterogeneously expensive optimization problems. This paper focuses on efficient and adaptive ways to schedule an evaluation of different functional groups of objectives and constraints by utilizing the potential of offspring population members in terms of their multi-objective ranks, the accuracy of low-fidelity models to predict their function values, and their computing times. Results on a number of unconstrained and constrained two and three-objective optimization problems show significantly better convergence than non-heterogeneous methods. This proof-of-principle study must now be extended by taking full advantage of surrogate-assisted optimization methods to propose more comprehensive and practical optimization algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection, as one of the dimension reduction methods, is a crucial processing step in dealing with high-dimensional data. It tries to preserve feature subset representing the whole feature space, which aims to reduce redundancy and increase the classification accuracy. Since the two objectives are usually in conflict with each other, feature selection is modeled as a multi-objective problem. However, the high search space and discrete Pareto front makes it not easy for existing evolutionary multiobjective algorithms. Classic evolutionary computation method, which is often applied to feature selection problem straightforwardly, gradually exposes its inefficiency in searching process. Hence, a particle swarm optimization based multiobjective memetic algorithm for high-dimensional feature selection is designed in this paper to deal with above shortcomings. Its basic idea is to model feature selection as a multiobjective optimization problem by optimizing the number of features and the classification accuracy in supervised condition simultaneously, in which information entropy based initialization and adaptive local search are designed to improve the search efficiency. Moreover, a new particle velocity update rule considering both convergence and diversity of solutions is designed to update particles, and a fast discrete nondominated sorting strategy is designed to rank the Pareto solutions. These strategies enable the proposed algorithm to gain better performance on both the quality and size of feature subset. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the quality of Pareto fronts evolved by the state-of-the-art algorithms for feature selection.},

  abstract     = {The evolutionary algorithm is widely deployed in the feature selection task, but the complexity of the solution for the feature selection problem grows exponentially with the increase of feature dimensions. To handle this problem, this study proposes a novel feature selection operator for the Micro-Expression (ME) recognition task based on Genetic Programming, which can reduce the complexity caused by the high dimensional features. The One versus Rest (OVR) scheme is used to decompose the three-class problem of ME into three binary class problem, so as to reduce the difficulty of the recognition task. A feature selection operator is designed based on the characteristics of ME data, aiming to select class-relevant features from a set of redundant facial features. In our algorithm, the optical flow features are extracted for different ME apex frames firstly, and then these features are split into a set of segments by the sliding windows, which are set as the terminal set. The feature selection operator merges a set of segments to form a new feature subset, and it guides the individuals to evolve towards higher discriminative ability. We test the proposed method on three public data sets (CASME, SAMM, SMIC), and the experimental results show that our method can effectively solve the class imbalance problem and lead to better performance compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms. Further analysis reveals that the feature subsets selected by our algorithms for the three binary class problems contain only 0.57% duplicated features.},

  abstract     = {System-in-Package (SiP) is an advanced packaging technology and developing rapidly in semiconductor industry. Electronic modules of this package type are individual integrated systems for specific applications. Therefore, those modules are usually characterized by multiple encapsulated components and sophisticated internal structures. However, such complexity brings great challenges to package design. Traditional methods, like design of experiments, response surface analysis, are widely used in this field, but their effectiveness drops rapidly due to increasing complexity. In current scenarios, not only do the amount of design variables increases, but also the modules have diverse design tasks to satisfy. Thereby, package design for SiP modules is a multi-task optimization problem. To resolve this issue, we propose a multi-task memetic learning and optimization algorithm, in which multi-output Gaussian process model and multifactorial evolutionary algorithm are employed. In this work, knowledge transfer between different tasks is activated during both the surrogate modeling and model optimization procedures. Several variants of the proposed algorithm are tested, and their modeling accuracy and optimization efficiency were compared. This interdisciplinary study shows the benefits of the memetic knowledge transfer mechanism in improving modeling and optimizing efficacy in multi-task scenarios and presents a viable approach to achieve both automation and optimization for complicated packaging design.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a well-known NP-hard combinational optimization problem. In the literature, existing approaches can be generally classified into two categories: exact methods and metaheuristics methods. The former is only effective for small problem instances while the latter is more suitable for practical applications with larger scale. However, these methods perform evolutionary search only on a single problem form of VRP, while the efficient problem form of a given VRP is often unknown before hand. Keeping the above in mind, this paper proposes memetic search with evolutionary multitasking for solving vehicle routing problem on multiple problem forms. In particular, multiple simplified vehicle routing problems are firstly constructed and acted as the auxiliary tasks of original VRP. The memetic evolutionary search is thus simultaneously performed on simplified vehicle routing problems and original VRP. In this way, the useful routing traits can be shared by knowledge transfer among the tasks to enhance the evolutionary search. To verify the performance of the proposed method, comprehensive empirical experiments have been conducted on commonly used VRP benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Modelling other agents is a challenging topic in artificial intelligence research particularly when a subject agent needs to optimise its own decisions by predicting their behaviours under uncertainty. Existing research often leads to a monotonic set of behaviours for other agents so that a subject agent can not cope with unexpected decisions from the other agents. It requires creative ideas about developing diversity of behaviours so as to improve the subject agent’s decision quality. In this paper, we resort to evolutionary computation approaches to generate a new set of behaviours for other agents and solve the complicated agents’ behaviour search and evaluation issues. The new approach starts with the initial behaviours that are ascribed to the other agents and expands the behaviours by using a number of genetic operators in the behaviour evolution. This is the first time that evolutionary techniques are used to modelling other agents in a general multiagent decision framework. We examine the new methods in two well-studied problem domains and provide experimental results in support.},

  abstract     = {In transfer learning (TL) for multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL), most popular methods are based on action advising scheme, in which skilled agents directly transfer actions, i.e., explicit knowledge, to other agents. However, this scheme requires an inquiry-answer process, which quadratically increases the computational load as the number of agents increases. To enhance the scalability of TL for MARL when all the agents learn from scratch, we propose an experience sharing based memetic TL for MARL, called MeTL-ES. In the MeTL-ES, the agents actively share implicit memetic knowledge (experience), which avoids the inquiry-answer process and brings highly scalable and effective acceleration of learning. In particular, we firstly design an experience sharing scheme to share implicit meme based experience among the agents. Within this scheme, experience from the peers is collected and used to speed up the learning process. More importantly, this scheme frees the agents from actively asking for the states and policies of other agents, which enhances scalability. Secondly, an event-triggered scheme is designed to enable the agents to share the experiences at appropriate timings. Simulation studies show that, compared with the existing methods, the proposed MeTL-ES can more effectively enhance the learning speed of learning-from-scratch MARL systems. At the same time, we show that the communication cost and computational load of MeTL-ES increase linearly with the growth of the number of agents, indicating better scalability compared to the popular action advising based methods.},
