  abstract     = {Recently, matrix factorization-based data representation methods exhibit excellent performance in many real applications. However, traditional deep semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (DSNMF) models the relationship between samples by predefining a fixed graph, which is not optimal and thus cannot exploit the intrinsic local structure among data effectively. In this work, an adaptive graph regularized deep semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (AGRDSNMF) algorithm is proposed for data representation. This proposed AGRDSNMF method can construct an adaptive optimal graph in each layer, whose weights are automatically determined by the probabilities between neighborhood samples. Then the adaptive graph regularizer of each layer is adopted to constrain the corresponding coefficient matrix during decomposition. Therefore, AGRDSNMF can capture the geometric structure of the representation in each layer. Experiments are conducted on COIL20, PIE, and TDT2 datasets, and our AGRDNSMF algorithm can achieve encouraging clustering performance.},

ZS-SBIR inherits the main challenges of multiple computer vision tasks, including SBIR, zero-shot learning and domain adaptation. The domain gap between sketch and photo requires the model to extract meaningful semantic information. To eliminate the domain gap, current methods mainly target introducing additional word embeddings or designing synthetic-based sub-networks. From another perspective, we focus on feature extraction and propose a simple and plug-and-play feature fusion module to enrich and dig into the semantic information, where an energy function is introduced to guide the feature fusion so that we obtain features with better retrieve performance. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on two widely used ZS-SBIR datasets, even surpassing some methods that use additional word embeddings.},

This paper proposes a framework based on optimal deep neural network (ODNN) to detect the plant leaf disease using the leaf images of healthy and diseased plants. The proposed work uses Convolutional Neural Network for feature extraction and ODNN is used for detection. In ODNN, a two level of weight optimization is employed to boost the performance of the traditional Deep Neural Network. A two level of weight optimization is done by Improved Butterfly Optimization Algorithm. Here the traditional Butterfly Optimization Algorithm is improved using Genetic Algorithm; this double weight updation improves the convergence rate to a considerable amount. Sensitivity, Accuracy and Specificity metrics are used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method. Experimental evaluations were done with the help of MATLAB. The proposed disease detection methodology achieves an overall accuracy of 99 percent. The experimental results give an indication that the proposed method turned out to be a better technique when compared to the existing techniques.},

Although machine learning methods have been used in drug discovery for a long time with good efficacy, the use of deep learning has proven its superiority in most cases. In this paper, we present a virtual screening procedure based on deep learning that aims to classify a set of chemical compounds as regards their biological activity on a particular receptor. The molecules are described with 2D pharmacophore fingerprints, which use the coordinates of atoms in 2D space to calculate them. Two deep learning models are proposed, the first is a deep neural network that uses as input data the fingerprint represented as a 1D vector. The second model is a convolutional neural network that uses the same input data after reshaping it into a 2D vector. Our models were trained on a dataset of active and inactive chemical compounds on cyclin A kinase1 receptor a very important protein family. The results have proven that the proposed models are efficient and comparable with some widely used machine learning methods in drug discovery.},

In this paper, a novel hybrid model that integrates fuzzy c-means clustering based on isometric mapping feature extraction and Bayesian optimized mixed kernel relevance vector machine classifier is proposed and applied to improve the classification performance of coal and gas outbursts. First, the isometric mapping is used to extract the non-linear information, then the significant features are selected, in order to improve the classification performance of coal and gas outbursts, the fuzzy c-means is used to perform clustering analysis on the effective features obtained from isometric mapping, mining the structural information and internal regularity of the sample data and estimating classification labels of sample data. Second, A mixed kernel relevance vector machine classifier is proposed to classify coal and gas outbursts, improving the learning and generalization ability of outbursts classification, and the classifier parameters are optimized by Bayesian optimization with global and local search capability remarkably. Finally, the improved fuzzy c-means clustering is integrated into the mixed kernel relevance vector machine classifier model, and Bayesian optimization algorithm is used to help train a better classifier for outbursts classification. The obtained experimental results on the collected actual dataset of coal and gas outbursts show that proposed clustering method can improve the clustering effect and efficiency, decrease the feature vector size up to 50% and achieves the accuracy and running time of 100% and 5.26 s, respectively, which outperforms prior methods with 98% and 5.38 s,the proposed outbursts combined classification model based on classification and clustering model outperforms other methods by 4%-6% with respect to average accuracy.

  abstract     = {The multi-modality or multi-stream-based convolution neural network is the recent trend in saliency computation, which is receiving tremendous research interest. The previous models used modality-based independent fusion or cross-modality-based complementary fusion to find saliency that leads to incurring inconsistency or distribution loss of salient points and regions. Most existing models did not effectively utilize accurate localization of high-level semantic and contextual features. The proposed model collectively uses the above two methods and a precise deep localization model to target the abovementioned challenges. Specifically, CSA-Net comprises four essential features: non-complementarity, cross-complementary, intra-complementary, and deep localized improved high-level features. The designed $$2\times 3$$ encoder and decoder streams produce these essential features and assure modality-specific saliency preservation. The cross and intra- complementary fusion are deeply guided by proposed novel, cross-complementary self-attention to produce fused saliency. The attention map is computed by two-stage additive fusion based on a Non-Local network. A novel, Optimal Selective Saliency, has been proposed to find two similar saliencies among three steam-wise saliencies. The experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed $$2\times 3$$ stream network and attention map. The experimental results show better performance in comparison with fourteen closely related state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {The isolation switch is one of the most important pieces of electrical equipment in traction substation, and its state directly reflects the operation of the power system. However, the realization of automatic isolation switch monitoring based on computer vision still faces three problems, i.e., intra-class diversity, inter-class polymorphism of components, and complex backgrounds. To overcome the issues of isolation switch positioning and states recognition in railway traction substation, we propose a state recognition method of isolation switch in traction substation based on key components detection and geometric ranging. This method is divided into two parts, i.e., ISD-Net for isolation switch detection and geometric ranging for state recognition. Firstly, ISD-Net is proposed to realize isolation switch detection. Secondly, an algorithm based on geometric ranging is designed, which utilizes the coordinate information of key components to realize automatic recognition of isolation switch state. To train the model and evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we established a dataset of isolation switch (called IVIS2021). On IVIS2021, isolation switch detection and state recognition accuracy reach 90.88% and 91.12%, respectively. The experimental results indicated that the proposed method accurately realizes isolation switch detection and state recognition.},

Accordingly, a dark image enhancement method based on multi-scale features and dilated residual networks is proposed to solve the above problem. The input to the network is the V channel of the image HSV color space. The network uses a multiscale feature extractor to extract shallow features from the image, then a new dilated residual network constructed in this paper is used to extract deep features from the image, and finally the enhanced V-component is obtained by a single-channel convolutional layer. The final enhanced low-illumination image is obtained by component fusion in this paper. The experimental results show that compared with the existing mainstream algorithms, the algorithm in this paper has good subjective evaluation, natural image enhancement, no distortion in color, and high network robustness. In terms of objective metrics, the PSNR, SSIM, MSE, image mean value and image information entropy of the algorithms in this paper are significantly improved over other algorithms. Among them, in the dataset LOL with reference images, PSNR, SSIM and MSE are improved by about 61.55, 9.42 and 861.7% respectively.

  abstract     = {Twin support vector machine (TSVM) has attracted much attention in the field of machine learning with good generalization ability and computational performance. However, the conventional grid search method is very time-consuming to obtain the optimal regularization parameter. To address this problem, we develop a novel fast regularization parameter tuning algorithm for TSVM, named TSVMPath. After transforming the models of two sub-optimization problems, we divide the two classes of samples into different sets. Lagrangian multipliers are then proved to be piecewise linear concerning the corresponding regularization parameters, greatly extending the search space of the solution. By proving that the Lagrangian multipliers of two sub-optimization models are 1 when the regularization parameters approach infinity, we design a simple yet effective initialization. As a result, the entirely regularized solution path can be obtained without solving quadratic programming problems. Four types of events are finally defined to update the solution path. Experiments on 8 UCI datasets show that the prediction accuracy of TSVMPath is superior to the best competing methods, with up to four orders of magnitude speed-up for the computational overhead compared with the grid search method.},

Developing an automatic test case generation helps the software professionals to conserve more time. In recent years, with the aim of saving cost and time, majority of the software is delivered without sufficient testing resulting in revenue loss. Simultaneously, the testing cost minimizes with the diminution of testing time. To overcome the above-mentioned limitations, this paper proposes a shuffled shepherd flamingo search (S2FS) approach for an optimized and automatic test case generation with minimum execution time. The S2FS approach is an integration of two different metaheuristic algorithms namely the shuffled shepherd optimization algorithm and flamingo search optimization (FSO) algorithm. The significant intention of the proposed approach is to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness thereby enhancing the generation of test cases. In addition to this, this paper also determines the efficiency of the proposed technique based on ATM operation with respect to total number of test case generations. The test cases of ATM are provided as an input to the proposed S2FS approach to determine an optimal test case. Finally, the experimental evaluations and comparative analysis are performed to determine the effectiveness of the proposed technique.},

We use a bidirectional generative mechanism based on a multi-level generative adversarial network, where the images generated at each level are used to generate text, and the generated images are constrained by introducing a reconstruction loss.

  abstract     = {Compression artifacts cause negative visual perception and are tough to reduce because of the balance between compressibility and fidelity. Despite extensive research on traditional methods, they take insufficient effect on quality enhancement. Researches concerning the problem turn to concentrate on quality elevation of single frame using CNNs but ignore the continuity, which is called inter-frame correlation that is critical for video enhancement. There are some CNN-based approaches pursuing good effects, however, sacrificing efficiency. Considering the demand for video quality enhancement and the feature of consecutive frames, this paper proposes a bi-frame generative adversarial network. It takes advantage of inter-frame correlation for bi-frame motion compensation, producing accurate compensated frames. Then, a multi-scale convolutional layer with dilated filters, which constrains parameters and overcomes block effects, is proposed to promote efficiency. Subsequently, a multi-layer deep fusion section is employed to avoid gradients vanishing and realize deep compression artifacts reduction. The ability of discrimination is enhanced with the engagement of a devised relativistic average discriminator which optimizes the whole network. As experiment results demonstrated, bi-frame generative adversarial network shows its effectiveness in terms of various indices. It also presents satisfactory visual performance with comparative test speed compared to listed approaches.},

Although the emerging panoptic segmentation is the most desirable sensing technology, object detection and semantic segmentation are relatively more mature and have fewer requirements for data annotation. In this paper, a joint object detection and semantic segmentation perception method is proposed for both practicability and accuracy. The proposed method is based on the results of object detection and semantic segmentation. Firstly, the result of basic semantic segmentation is preprocessed according to the principle of entropy. Secondly, the candidate bounding boxes of pedestrians and vehicles are extracted by object detection. Thirdly, candidate bounding boxes are optimized by using a K-means based vertex clustering algorithm. Finally, the contours of scene elements are matched with the results of semantic segmentation. The experimental results on the Cityscapes dataset show that the final perception effect is more susceptible to semantic segmentation results. The theoretical upper limit of the actual perception effect is 95.4% of the ground-truth of panoptic segmentation. The proposed method can effectively combine object detection and semantic segmentation, and achieve perception results similar to panoptic segmentation without additional data annotation.},

In this paper, we mainly focus on these three problems. First, the GrabCut algorithm is adopted to unify the background of the experimental data and the real data to black, allowing the trained model to have the same good effect when applied in practice. Then, we propose a new coordinate attention block to improve the classification accuracy of convolutional neural networks and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with several state-of-the-art CNN models. Finally, channel pruning is applied to the trained model, which reduces the model size and computational effort by 85.19 $$\%$$ and 92.15 $$\%$$ respectively with little change in the model accuracy, making it better suited for agricultural platforms with lower memory and computational capacity.},

To deeply understand the mobile users, based on users’ application (app) text data in the smartphone, we propose a semi-supervised learning method to infer mobile user profiles or user demographic attributes. App text has the characteristics of short text length and no word order, which leads to the problems of sparse semantics and lack of context, etc. To address these problems, we build two heterogeneous graphs with different scale features for the corpus, using app name (word) and app installation text list (document) as the nodes of the graph, and using three rules to build edges. Thus, text classification is transformed into multi-graph node classification. Then, we propose a co-learning graph convolutional network (C-GCN) based on selective-scale attention (SS-Attention) to realize the extraction of spatial features of graphs. SS-Attention can enhance the representation learning of global important (word-level) nodes by splitting and fusing operations. Experimental results demonstrated that, without using pre-training embedding, C-GCN outperforms state-of-the-art models across real data.},

  abstract     = {Drowsy driving is a major cause of road accidents. Traffic accidents can be prevented by discriminating between driver states of alertness and drowsiness. This paper presents an efficient system for drowsiness detection based on EEG signals. The proposed system is efficient in providing consistent results regardless of the inherent characteristics of drivers. Our method is based on features extracted from well-defined sub-bands. These sub-bands obtained using a tunable Q-factor wavelet transform. The use of sub-bands solves the problem of interpersonal variability of EEG recordings, which is a major problem in detecting drowsiness. In addition, the use of kernel principal component analysis reduces the size of the features extracted from EEG signals without degrading the accuracy. Indeed, a single differential EEG channel with a minimal number of carefully selected features is sufficient to provide a fast, convenient, and accurate detection system. For drowsiness recognition, two different machine learning techniques, K-nearest neighbours and support vector machines, are proposed. The latter consists of a learning module for medical diagnosis based on EEG signals from a set of laboratory subjects. Laboratory conditions help identify characteristic and common features. These preparatory parameters make it possible to provide a real-time adaptive drowsiness diagnosis by assessing the driver&#39;s condition every second. By customizing the system, it can detect drowsiness with an accuracy of approximately 94%.},

  abstract     = {Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) occurs mostly in the elderly and often causes physical disability and limitation. Early detection and intervention are particularly important in reducing the deterioration of knee disease. Currently, early detection of KOA is mainly evaluated by a Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) Classification with five class. KL is an ordered classification problem. The cross-entropy loss (CEL) and fixed penalty loss (FPL) are commonly used in KL system. Both CEL and FPL do not take into account the ease of classification between samples, which results in that the obtained model has deficiency. In this paper, a novel focal ordinal loss (FOL) is proposed by combining FPL and focal loss (FL) for KL. In the training algorithm based on FOL, the difficult or easy example is first identified according to the predicted probability toward to the true label at each epoch. The sample with a high predicted probability is considered as an easy sample. On the contrary, it is considered as a difficult sample. The weights for easy samples in the loss are then adjusted down in the next epoch, which results in that the training process can focus on difficult samples. The performance of FOL is validated on an X-ray image dataset from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) with several classical CNN models, such as VGG, Resnet, Densenet and Googlenet. The experimental results show that FOL achieves significant improvements in many performance measures, especially in mean square error (MSE). In addition, the experimental results on the augmented dataset and the Resnet with the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) also show similar improvements from FOL. It indicates that FOL is effective and superior to CEL and FPL in the numerous models and two data types (original and augmented) for KL grading.},

  abstract     = {Breast tumors are the major malignancy in females and diagnostic systems using artificial intelligence algorithms for breast imaging have shown promising results. Among many algorithms, a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) using K-means clustering and a multiclass support vector machine model enhance the precision of categorizing breast tumors from mammogram images. Nonetheless, effective breast tumor identification is still difficult without partitioning the pectoral muscle (PM) boundary from the remaining breast area. Therefore, this article proposes an Ensemble-Net model by ensembling the transfer learning model with different pre-trained CNN structures for partitioning the PM boundary from the remaining breast area in the mammographic scans. The segmentation process has 2 phases. In the initial phase, different region-of-interests are generated that include the object according to the input images. In the secondary phase, the object class is predicted after the areas of bounding boxes are refined and a pixel-range mask is created for the entity. These 2 different phases are associated with the backbone structure which creates the pyramid hierarchy of DCNN to acquire the features from the raw images. Moreover, it employs global average pooling followed by the softmax classification to recognize the normal, benign and malignant cases. Finally, the experimental outcomes demonstrate that the Ensemble-Net achieves 96.72% accuracy than the other classical classifiers.},

  abstract     = {Weakly supervised object detection which reduces the need for strong supersivison during training has recently made significant achievements. However, it remains a challenging issue due to the time-consuming and labor-intensive problems in application. To further reduce the label cost, we introduce a new fusion method of weakly supervised learning and active learning in a unied framework for object detection. Weakly supervised learning based on min-entropy latent model is used to weaken the labels by image-label, while active learning is used to reduce the quantity of labeled images. The fusion method proposed can effectively reduce the dependency of object detection on manual annotation. In this paper, we introduce three strategies of active learning, including least confidence sampling, margining sampling and weighted classification sampling. To validate the effectiveness of each strategy and different sample compositions in weakly supervised learning object detection, we conducted lots of experiments. Extensive experiments show that the combination of image-level labeling and active learning can achieve comparable results with the previous state-of-the-art methods with much lower label cost.},

  abstract     = {With the emergence of big data era, the dimensions of data are enhanced exponentially and it becomes a difficult task to handle information of high dimensions in various sectors like text mining, machine learning and data analysis. Redundant and inappropriate feature enhances the complexities in dimensions that further results in poor performances. In the intrusion detection system, the feature selection is considered as one of the most significant processes to improve the performances of the system. Due to high dimensional data, there occurs a drop in accuracy and efficiency. To overcome such drawback, this paper proposes three major phases namely the data pre-processing, feature selection and classification phases. In data-pre processing phase, the input data comprising of various noise signals, high dimensional and redundant data, numerous irrelevant features etc. are extracted. The second phase involves the selection of features using cooperative and competitive (C2) search based learning algorithm. In the classification phase, the extracted features are classified optimally using Bonferroni based Hybrid k-nearest neighbour (B-HkNN) algorithm thereby obtaining an optimal intrusion detection system. Furthermore, the proposed approach based on intrusion detection system is evaluated by the standard CICIDS2017 and ADFA-LD datasets to determine the accuracy and efficiency of the system.},

  abstract     = {To generate a realistic person image for pose-guided person image generation, especially for local body parts, is challenging. Two reasons account for it: (1) the difficulty for long-range relation modeling, (2) a deficiency in precise local correspondence capturing. We propose a Precise Correspondence Enhanced Generative Adversarial Network (PCE-GAN) to address these problems. PCE-GAN includes a global branch and a local branch. The former maintains the global consistency of the generated person image and the latter captures the precise local correspondence. More specifically, the long-range relation is well established via the spatial-channel Multi-layer Perceptrons module in the transformation blocks within both branches. The precise local correspondence is captured effectively by the local branch’s local-pair building and local-guiding modules. Finally, the outputs of each branch are combined for mutually improved benefits based on the enhanced correspondences. Experimental results show that, compared to previous state-of-the-art methods using the Market-1501 dataset, PCE-GAN performs quantitatively better, with a $$5.53\%$$ and $$7.74\%$$ improvement in SSIM and IS scores, respectively. Qualitative results for both Market-1501 and DeepFashion datasets are also provided herein to further validate the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract     = {In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), failures are inevitable due to the dynamic environment and ubiquitous deployment. Node failure can lead to loss of network connectivity, which can lead to data loss between two nodes. When one or more nodes fail, the failed nodes cannot send data to the currently assigned sensor nodes. Additionally, node failures affect the efficiency of data transfer between nodes based on service quality (QoS) measurements. This requires a better fault tolerance system, which can maintain quality of data transfer in the event of faults. In this paper, we propose a multipath routing algorithm using hybrid optimal fault tolerant system for WSN (HOFT-MP). First, we introduce a modified teaching–learning-based optimization (MTLO) algorithm for efficient clustering which groups the sensor nodes to improve energy efficiency. Here, we combine teacher learning with the fish swarm optimization (FSO) to increase the searching range in network which effectively computes node location, position and movement direction of sensor nodes. Second, we develop a nonlinear regression based pigeon optimization (NR-PO) algorithm to compute the backup node for clusters to detect node faults which increase the fault tolerance. Then, a deep Kronecker neural network (DKNN) is used to compute optimal path among multipath which enhances quality of data transfer. Finally, the performance of proposed HOFT-MP routing algorithm compared with the existing state-of-art routing algorithms in terms of energy consumption, end-to-end delay, throughput, data loss and network lifetime.},

  abstract     = {Weakly-supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted many people&#39;s attention because it can reduce labor and time-consuming, and some bias or errors caused by the subjectivity of annotators. As a key step of WSOD, weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) refers to identify object class and localization via image-level labels in a given image for further training a detector. However, WSOL is a challenging task only using image-level labels and some existing methods often suffer from incomplete activation or background activation for object localization. In this paper, we propose a novel regional similarity module network (RSMNet) for weakly supervised object localization, in which we present a regional similarity module (RSM) to calculate a similarity matrix between any two local pixels in the feature maps, and then integrate this similarity matrix with CAM to generate a similar activation map (SAM) for the extension of activation regions. Meanwhile, we put forward a background regularization loss and a difference regularization loss to suppress the background activation. Finally, in the inference stage, we present a feature map accumulation (FMA) method to efficiently collect more semantic features so that complete activation regions can be achieved. Experimental results show that RSMNet can achieve competitive performance compare with state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {The most aggressive and malignant type of skin cancer is melanoma. When input data is in the form of images, image processing plays a vital role to detect and classifying cancer in the human body. Existing research discovered many weaknesses in complex data models, such as higher feature dimensionality, which required more data for training, resulting in lower detection accuracy, higher computational difficulties, portability, and processing time. Hence, we introduced fractal neural network-based galactic swarm optimization (FNN–GSO) algorithm for the detection of malignant melanoma such as superficial spreading, nodular, and lentigo malignant melanoma. The main aim of this work is to apply a deep learning technique to classify skin lesions for effective treatment and prognostication instead of the gold standard excision biopsy, which is currently used to diagnose this condition. Expert analysis, time consumption, and expensive processing associated with malignant melanoma classification and prediction are minimized in this manner. The proposed work involves four major components such as pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. The raw input images are pre-processed thereby the noise removal and contrast level enhancement are carried out. An adaptive watershed segmentation algorithm performs malignant melanoma segmentation. Following that, image features such as are extracted correctly using the DWT–GLCM feature extraction model. Finally, the malignant melanoma classifications are performed using the FNN–GSO algorithm. The proposed method&#39;s performance is evaluated using MATLAB software and different evaluation parameters. The proposed FNN–GSO algorithm demonstrates better classification results than other existing methods.},

People can accurately describe an image by constantly referring to the visual information and key text information of the image. Inspired by this idea, we no longer follow mainstream approach, and propose to adjust the pre-training language model processing by using high-low visual features as conditional inputs. Specifically, conditional embedding layer normalization (CELN) we proposed is an effective mechanism for embedding visual features into pre-training language models for feature selection. We apply CELN to transformers in the unified pre-training language model (UNILM). This model parameter adjustment mechanism is an innovative attempt in pre-training language model. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks (MSCOCO and Visual Genome datasets)demonstrate that this seminal work is effective.

The existing work mainly uses differential privacy technology and does not consider the distribution difference between data sources, or does not consider the conditional probability distribution of data, which causes negative transfer to harm the effect of algorithm. Therefore, this paper proposes multi-source selection transfer learning algorithm with privacy-preserving MultiSTLP, which is used in scenarios where target domain contains unlabeled data sets with only a small amount of group probability information and multiple source domains with a large number of labeled data sets. Group probability means that the class label of each sample in target data set is unknown, but the probability of each class in a given data group is available, and multiple source domains indicate that there are more than two source domains. The number of data set contains more than two data sets of source domain and one data set of target domain. The algorithm adapts to the marginal probability distribution and conditional probability distribution differences between domains, and can protect the privacy of target data and improve classification accuracy by fusing the idea of multi-source transfer learning and group probability into support vector machine. At the same time, it can select the representative dataset in source domains to improve efficiency relied on speeding up the training process of algorithm. Experimental results on several real datasets show the effectiveness of MultiSTLP, and it also has some advantages compared with the state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The performance of pedestrian multiple object tracking (MOT), which is based on the tracking-by-detection framework, is exceedingly susceptible to the quality of detection, especially suffering from detection missing or inaccuracy caused by occlusion. Several studies aimed at alleviating the problem continue to perform poorly in scenarios with frequent heavy occlusions. In this study, a novel online pedestrian MOT method is proposed for targets with severe occlusion. First, a regression network is employed to refine the predicted position of the target to obtain a precise bounding box and visibility score. Considering the visibility score and the overlap between these refined bounding boxes globally, the targets that are heavily occluded are categorised into the following two types: (1) targets occluded by a non-pedestrian object and (2) targets occluded by other pedestrians. Then, these occluded targets are handled in different ways, which reduces the number of false negatives (FNs) and false positives (FPs). Finally, to enhance the precision of the prediction, a motion model that combines the Kalman filter and camera motion compensation is developed. The tracking results applied to three widely used pedestrian MOT benchmark datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method.},

By choosing an appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF), applying Jensen inequality and reciprocally convex inequality to estimate the derivative of the LKF, several sufficient conditions, which guarantee the bipartite leader-following synchronization for the coupled INNs with time-varying delay, are newly obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). When the quantization is not considered in the pinning controller, the criterion of bipartite leader-following synchronization in terms of low-dimensional LMIs is established by using the properties of M-matrices. And the criterion of bipartite leaderless synchronization in terms of low-dimensional LMIs is also proposed by a matrix U.

Our study proposes a variant capsule network (CapsNets) premised on an optimized amplifier to compensate for the presence of deficiencies in the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), thus providing a richer representation of the same feature where the scalar outputs are also replaced with a vector output. Our proposed architecture classifies the blood cells images with good test accuracies against the baseline model of 92.8%, 75.42%, and 85.77% on complex images such as FMNIST, CIFAR-10, and blood Cells datasets respectively. The experimental results also present better performance than the other CNN-based classification models for blood cells image classification. Finally, the testing results of the proposed model show it can achieve good performance in blood cells detection and classification which can serve as an effective decision-making tool for medical diagnostics.},

In this method, meta-heuristic chimp optimization algorithm is used to adaptively select the parameter values of the incomplete Beta function, bilateral gamma correction is used to further enhance the image contrast. In order to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of this method, 12 color images with contrast distortion and 15 contrast methods were selected.

In this paper, we propose a novel joint model, the Graph Relation retrieval Reasoning Network (GRRN), to explicitly introduce the dynamic interaction among different keywords and generate informative features that contribute to representation updating. In addition, to pursue in-depth relations between different keywords, we develop an optimised Path Evidence Fusion in the GRRN to obtain evidence based on deep paths and implicit relations with comprehensive knowledge by making full use of the original paths in external knowledge graphs.

To solve such a “chicken-and-egg” problem, we propose COLAM framework that Co-Learns DNNs and soft labels through Alternating Minimization of two objectives—(a) the training loss subject to soft labels and (b) the objective to learn improved soft labels—in one end-to-end training procedure.

To address these issues, the current research work has focused on constructing a novel Recurrent Hybrid Ant Colony and African Buffalo Model (RHAC-ABM) for the QA classification and answer selection process. Initially, the specific QA dataset was trained to the system, then the trained datasets were tokenized, and training flaws are removed systematically. Moreover, the proposed model was designed by upgrading the hybrid Ant and African buffalo fitness to a dense layer. Also, the hybrid function in the recurrent classification layer can afford a high accuracy rate for query specification and answer selection process. Subsequently, the proficient measure of the designed approach was validated with other related existing models by comparing the chief metrics. Henceforth, the developed RHAC-ABM has gained 99.6% accuracy, F-measure, 99.51%, recall 98.5%, precision 98.5% and low error rate as 1.4% for question classification and answer selection process.

It is difficult to compute network parameters and avoid spurious patterns. This paper presents three sufficient conditions for network region attractivity under suitable external input. The external input can make network states converge to the desired saturation region. We let memory patterns correspond to saturation regions, i.e., memory patterns being stored as saturation regions. Then we give associative memory synthesis methods based on region attractive recurrent neural networks. Associative memory experiments show the validity of our method. At last, two illustrative examples are given for verifying region attractive criteria.},

In the proposed CWBPSO algorithm, a fast convergence strategy is employed to accelerate the particles toward the optimal value. Meanwhile, an improved strategy of the acceleration factor is designed to improve the local search ability of the particles and strengthen the global search ability. A new linear decreasing strategy of inertia weight factor is designed to avoid premature maturation and oscillation phenomenon, improve the overall optimization performance and reduce the time complexity. Four typical test functions in CEC2014 and CEC2017 and a real train delay scheduling problem are selected to verify the effectiveness of the proposed CWBPSO algorithm. The comparative analysis of experimental results shows that the CWBPSO algorithm improves the convergence speed and convergence accuracy, avoids premature convergence and oscillation phenomena. The CWBPSO algorithm can effectively schedule the delay trains, reduce train delay time and avoid delay propagation.},

  abstract     = {Aspect category detection is an essential task in aspect-based sentiment analysis. Most previous works use labeled data and apply a supervised learning approach to detect the aspect category. However, to avoid the dependency on labeled data, some researchers have also applied unsupervised learning approaches, wherein variants of topic models and neural network-based models have been built for this task. These unsupervised methods focus on co-occurrences of words and ignore the contextual meaning of the words in the given sentence. Thus, such models perform reasonably well in detecting the explicitly expressed aspect category but often fail in identifying the implicitly expressed aspect category in the sentence. This paper focuses on the contextual meaning of the word. It adopts a document clustering approach requiring minimal user guidance, i.e., only a small set of seed words for each aspect category to detect efficiently implicit and explicit aspect categories. A novel BERT-based Attentive Representation Learning with Adversarial Training (BARLAT) model is presented in this paper, which utilizes domain-based contextual word embedding (BERT) for generating the sentence representation and uses these representations for clustering the sentences through attentive representation learning. Further, the model parameters are generalized better by performing adversarial training, which adds perturbations to the cluster representations. BARLAT is the first nearly unsupervised method that uses the contextual meaning of the words for learning the aspect categories through an adversarial attentive learning approach. The performance of BARLAT is compared with various state-of-the-art models using F1-score on Laptop and Restaurant datasets. The experimental results show that BARLAT outperforms the best existing model by a margin of 1.1% and 2.3% on Restaurant and Laptop datasets, respectively.},

Ayurveda, the oldest Indian system of medicine is still practiced today as it widely promotes herbs as medicines for treating different health conditions and presents many advantages, such as low cost, availability in abundance, and minimal side effects. While many countries have accepted conventional medicine as the best alternative to synthetic drugs, the lack of knowledge and unsupported evidence has raised concerns and reduced its usage. Herein, an intelligent system is proposed using Raspberry Pi 3 Model B + (RPi) and the RPi camera to identify real-time images of Indian medicinal herbs and reveal their respective medicinal properties. Four ML models are developed in the work, of which one model is proposed to identify the details of a captured medicinal leaf on the RPi user interface. The proposed model predicts an accuracy (top-1) of 98.98% on a custom leaf dataset of 25 different medicinal species, containing 1500 leaf images, by combining two feature extraction techniques, namely scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) and histogram of oriented gradients. Bag of Visual Words is obtained by applying k-means clustering on SIFT descriptors as a feature selection and assessed using a support vector machine classifier. The suggested model integrated into RPi shows a real-time top-3 accuracy of 99%. The designed system has the advantages of being built solely for medicinal herbs, with reduced camera cost, and even works efficiently in remote areas.},

However, numerous low-resolution videos will be further compressed to adapt to the limited storage size and transmission bandwidth, leading to further video quality degradation. Significantly, the noise brought by compression often has a strong correlation with the content of the video frame itself. If we super-resolve compressed video frames directly, the noise may be amplified, leading to loss of important information or lower super-resolution performance. To ease those problems, we present an end-to-end deep feature fusion network with ordinary differential equation and dual attention mechanism for joint video compression artifacts reduction and super-resolution. The proposed network commendably enhances the spatial-temporal features fusion of different depths, improves the acquisition of meaningful information ability, and perfects reconstruction quality. In addition, we leverage several skip connections to fuse the captured in-depth feature information and the shallow to prevent information loss. The experimental results show that our proposed method is competent to reduce bit-rate and have excellent quality improvement effectively.},

By connecting the sifting stage with the classification stage through the feedback loop, the detection performance of the network was improved through alternate iteration training.

The automatic classification of fresh tea leaves is a necessity. Previous works used deep and wide architectures of CNNs to classify the tea leaves, which have a limitation on the model deployment. Despite the filter pruning achieve superior performance about network compression and acceleration, the pruning-based approaches have to trade accuracy for low computational cost and model size. we propose a novel joint-way model optimization strategy, named Filter Pruning and Grafting via Geometric Distance(P &amp;GGD), to solve the above problems. Specifically, we utilize the filter pruning method to compress models and uses the filter grafting method to boost accuracy. To graft pruned models effectively, we develop the grafting criteria based on the geometric distance to measure the information of layers. Extensive experiments validate our approach on the fresh-tea-leaves dataset and two image classification benchmarks. For example, with the fresh-tea-leaves dataset, we achieve 96.296 $$\%$$ top-1 accuracy, with more than 45 $$\%$$ FLOPs-reduction, even outperforms the non-compress MobileNetV2 by 2.395 $$\%$$ accuracy.

In this paper, an unsupervised monocular depth estimation method using stereo pairs for training is designed. We present a triaxial squeeze attention module and introduce it into our unsupervised framework to augment the representations of the depth map in detail. We also propose a novel training loss that enforces mutual-exclusion in image reconstruction to improve the performance and robustness in unsupervised learning. Experimental results on KITTI show that our method not only outperforms existing unsupervised methods but also achieves better results comparable with several supervised approaches trained with ground-truth data.

Most existing researches mainly focus on offloading the tasks to the MEC serves to reduce computing energy consumption, while the utilization of idle resources of MDs and the dynamic of users are often ignored. To address this issue, we propose a distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm (DMADRL) with a hybrid cognitive offloading strategy for dynamic MEC networks, in which MDs can use their idle resources to process tasks directly or act as relay nodes to forward tasks to the MEC servers. Taking channel gain and power allocation into account, DMADRL aims to solve an optimal task computation offloading policy in the dynamic MEC network where MDs are moving at a certain rate, and its objective is to maximize the system data transmission rate. Specifically, by modeling this optimal problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), DMADRL integrates two critical phases of centralized training and distributed implementation to overcome the problem that the traditional DRL algorithm cannot converge in multi-agent scenarios. Moreover, DMADRL also considers the experience-sharing mechanism and strategy integration optimization. Simulation results show that our algorithm has excellent convergence, and compared with the other three classical algorithms, our algorithm DMADRL performs better in the cognitive offloading decision.},

We use the Deep Boltzmann Machine and convolutional Deep Boltzmann Machine to learn the synchronous activity of 60 retinal ganglion cells and define a novel neural metric from the model by the Fisher score. The metric can be directly applied to the spike trains to distinguish the input stimuli.

The correctness of the designed scheme US-ANNs using the hybrid combination of GA-ASA is approved through the comparison of obtained and true solutions. Moreover, statistical analysis will also be performed to authenticate the reliability and competency of the proposed method for solving the singular model.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the problem of the preassigned-time synchronization is studied for a class of delayed fuzzy cellular neural networks with discontinuous activations via preassigned-time control. Above all, with the help of the existing classical fixed-time stability theory and via variable substitutions, a new fixed-time stability result is established, and the derived estimation of settling times are tighter than the existing ones. Subsequently, as applications of the new fixed-time stability results, a novel preassigned-time stability theorem is derived, and some novel and useful sufficient criteria are obtained to guarantee that the addressed neural networks achieve preassigned-time synchronization. The preassigned synchronization time is not only independent of the initial value, system and controller parameters, but also can be preassigned in advance based on the actual needs. Additionally, to suppress or eliminate the chattering phenomenon, a saturation function is designed to replace the sign function in the controller, and its effectiveness has been verified by numerical simulation. Especially, one of the power exponents of the two differently designed preassigned-time controllers can change smartly instead of being a fixed constant. Lastly, two numerical examples with simulations are given to present the effectiveness of the obtained results.},

However, most diversity measures only evaluate the diversity of classifiers from a single point of view and have a poor correlation with the generalization capability of the final model. As such, there is still a lack of an effective diversity measure to guide the integration of classifiers. In this paper, an updatable fusion measure is proposed to evaluate diversity in classifiers. It is based on the evidential reasoning rule by fusing various measures from multiple perspectives. Before the fusion, the correlation among various diversity measures is tested. Only those measures with weak correlation can be fused. In addition, whenever a new effective measure appears, it can be fused with the old fusion measure after the significance test. Through the experimental verification of multiple data sets, classifiers, and combination strategies, this measure can effectively reflect the diversity of classifier combinations and assist classifier integration.},

  abstract     = {Capsule network is a new network structure which can encode the properties and spatial relations of image features. It overcomes the shortcomings of CNN that requiring large number of training samples and parameters, and information loss during the pooling process. Capsule network can only extract shallow features, which makes it perform poorly on complex datasets. In this paper, a new residual capsule network model (Res-CapsNet) is proposed by fusing capsule network, residual network and deconvolution. The Res-CapsNet extracts deep features and sends them to capsule module using the dense connections of residual, which effectively strengthens the feature transfer and feature utilization. Capsule module converts scalar neurons to vector neurons through the main capsule layer, and uses dynamic routing algorithm to selectively activate the high-level capsule in the main capsule layer and the digital capsule layer, and obtains the recognition results. Deconvolution reconstruction module is the last part of Res-CapsNet, responsible for reconstructing recognition results by using 4-layer deconvolution. Res-CapsNet utilizes beta-mish activation function to reduce the &quot;death&quot; of neurons caused by ReLU, thus activating more neurons to further improve the classification accuracy. The experimental results show that Res-CapsNet has better performance on datasets, such as SVHN, FASH-MNIST and CIFAR-10. Compared with the baseline model CapsNet, the model parameters of Res-CapsNet on dataset CIFAR-10 are reduced by 65.73%, while the classification accuracy is significantly improved by 33.66%.},

The utilization of the saturation functions does make sense in limiting the control input of agents. Instead of using the homogeneity theory to construct a homogeneous system, which can not give an accurate settling-time bound, subtly-designed Lyapunov functions are utilized to prove the finite-time stability and to estimate the finite settling time.

Simultaneously, the context information will also get weak, which leads to the rough of segmentation results. Thus, this paper proposes a novel semantic segmentation model using encoder–decoder as the basic structure. The designed model consists of two parallel branches. The first branch is Laplacian Pyramid network. It can store residual features that will be fed into the second branch to restore the lost information effectively. The second branch is backbone segmentation network realized by encoder–decoder structure. In encoder stage, we use ResNet-50 to extract features, and we replace traditional convolution with deformable convolution, which can make the contour of objects clearer after segmentation. In decoder stage, we provide a spatial attention with filtering and centralization to obtain consistent spatial attention matrix. It can capture the correlation of pixels in images and acquire the context information. We also design weighted-sum module of the feature map. It is accomplished by performing element-weighted-wise sum between the decoder feature and corresponding residual feature from the Laplacian Pyramid. This module can recover the boundary and detail information further. Our proposed model can obtain dense feature prediction and promote segmentation accuracy. Experimental results show that the model can reach 91.2% average accuracy and 65.0% mIOU on Caimvid dataset, respectively, which proves the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed model.},

Existing machine-learning algorithms are accurate and perform well, but they struggle to reduce computational time and cope with the noisy and high-dimensional feature space of social media data. To resolve these concerns, this paper introduced a Centered Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CCRBM), a revolutionary deep learning technique for user behavioral sentimental analysis. The DBN architecture is mainly selected in this work due to its ability to extract in-depth sentimental features, dimensionality reduction, and higher classification accuracy. However, the improper parameter setting can lead to non-convergence, large randomness, and weak generalization capability. To tackle this issue, this work proposes a Hybrid Atom Search Arithmetic Optimization (HASAO) approach, which optimizes DBN parameters such as batch size and decay rate while minimizing DBN issues such as randomness and instability. The performance of the proposed model is analyzed by comparing it with different baseline models and the accuracy value above 90% for the nine datasets proves the efficiency of the proposed technique. When compared to the existing techniques, the proposed methodology offers improved accuracy and speedup capacity.},

In the proposed QOCHHO algorithm, quasi-opposition based learning (QOBL) and chaotic local search (CLS) approaches are integrated with the basic HHO for better quality of solution and faster convergence. The idea of QOBL assists to explore new regions of the search space and offers superior exploration. Again, CLS guides the search process nearby the most favorable regions of the search space yielding superior exploitation. Thus, a superior balance between the exploration and the exploitation holds in the case of QOCHHO making this newly projected algorithm more robust as correlated to the HHO algorithm. To demonstrate and validate effectiveness of the suggested QOCHHO algorithm, twenty-nine benchmark test functions of various categories, varied complexities (i.e., unimodal, multimodal, fixed dimension and composite functions) and different dimensions (i.e., 30 and 100) are used for simulation experiments. The simulation results attained by the projected QOCHHO algorithm are compared with the results obtained by recently surfaced HHO and other state-of-the-art algorithms (i.e., particle swarm optimization, moth-flame optimization algorithm, grey wolf optimizer, sine cosine algorithm, salp swarm algorithm, whale optimization algorithm and multi verse optimization algorithm). The outcomes of the benchmark test functions evidence that the anticipated QOCHHO algorithm is able to offers better outcomes in terms of improved exploration, local optima circumvention and faster convergence characteristics. The proposed QOCHHO algorithm is further employed to decipher real world engineering optimization problem (i.e., optimal siting and sizing of distributed generation (DG) in IEEE 33-bus and practical Brazil 136-bus radial distribution system (RDS) considering different types of load models at three load levels) and proffers a real application of the suggested algorithm in the field of electrical engineering. The simulation outcomes evidence that the obtained location and size of DGs in the RDS may be feasible one and the suggested QOCHHO algorithm may be a promising optimization algorithm for the chosen engineering optimization application.},

The proposed hybrid architecture with parallel features learning pipelines has demonstrated the ability to model the temporal relationship of the activity windows where the transition of activities is captured accurately. Besides that, the size of sliding windows is studied, and it has shown that the selection of window size is affecting the accuracy of the activity recognition.

The neighborhood relationship is one of the most important geometrical characteristics. The original dimensionality reduction algorithms usually set neighborhood parameters manually when defining neighborhood relationships. However, the methods based on collaborative representation select the neighbors automatically. A supervised dimensionality reduction method proposed in this paper is named Collaborative Representation based Discriminant Local Preserving Projection (CR-DLPP). First, it uses collaborative representation to select potential neighbors automatically for samples reconstruction. Then, a similarity matrix is built by calculating the Gaussian distance between the reconstructed samples. Finally, the Maximum Margin Criterion (MMC) is adopted to design an objective function, and the optimal projection matrix is obtained via eigenvalue decomposition. The results of extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that CR-DLPP can achieve better performance than several other typical linear dimensionality reduction methods.},

  abstract     = {Mobility of autonomous vehicles is a challenging task to implement. Under the given traffic circumstances, all agent vehicles’ behavior is to be understood and their paths for a short future needs to be predicted to decide upon the maneuver of the ego vehicle. We explore variational autoencoder networks to get multimodal predictions of agents. In our work, we condition the network on past trajectories of agents and traffic scenes as well. The latent space representation of traffic scenes is achieved by using another variational autoencoder network. The proposed networks are trained for varied prediction horizon. The performance of a network is compared with other networks trained on the dataset.},

  abstract     = {HRNet (High-Resolution Networks) as reported by Sun et al. (in: Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR), 2019) has been the state-of-the-art human pose estimation method, benefitting from its parallel high-resolution designed network structures. However, HRNet is still a typical CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) architecture, with local convolution operations. Recently, Transformers have been successfully applied in many computer vision areas. The main mechanism in Transformers is self-attention, which can learn global or long-range dependencies among different parts. In this paper, we propose a human pose estimation framework built upon High-Resolution Multi-scale Transformers, termed MTPose. We combine the two advantages of high-resolution and Transformers together to improve the performance. Specifically, we design a sub-network, MTNet (Multi-scale Transformers-based high-resolution Networks), which consists of two parallel branches. One is high-resolution with convolutional local operations, named as local branch. The other is the global branch utilizing multi-scale Transformer encoders to learn long-range dependencies of the whole body keypoints. At the end of the networks, the two branches are integrated together to predict the final keypoint heatmaps. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, the MSCOCO keypoint detection dataset and MPII human pose dataset, demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods.

One of the methods to unearth the interesting patterns from the databases is High Utility Itemset Mining (HUIM). Research in mining High Utility Itemsets (HUIs) is emerged because frequent itemset mining only focuses on statistical correlations between the items in an itemset. HUIM aims to extract relations between the items in an itemset based on the semantic significance. This article presents a Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (HGA) which combines quantum operators with classical genetic operators to mine interesting patterns from large databases for web service composition.

  abstract     = {Precedence retrieval is the process of retrieving similar prior case documents for the given current case document in the legal domain. Referencing the prior cases is important to ensure that an identical situation is treated similarly in all the cases. Concise representation of case documents using catch phrases facilitates the practitioners to avoid spending more time on reading the whole documents for finding the prior cases. The existing approaches for precedent retrieval in the legal domain use either statistical or semantic similarity features to find the prior cases. However, the substruction similarity features that consider the context of the statement helps to correctly identify the prior cases. Further, the existing approaches consider the whole document while extracting the similarity features, which is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose to use a combination of statistical, semantic, and substruction similarity features that are extracted from the catch phrases of the legal documents. The catch phrases from legal documents are extracted by utilizing Sequence-to-Sequence deep neural network with stacked encoder-decoder and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) as the recurrent unit. The substruction similarity features are obtained using a convolutional neural network. The IRLeD@FIRE-2017 dataset is used for evaluating our approach. The experimental results show that considering catch phrases reduces the retrieval time without reducing the retrieval performance. The k-paired t-test also shows that the improvement in performance of the model by using substruction similarity features that are extracted from the catch phrases is statistically significant when compared with other models. The PReLCaP outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with the MAP score of 0.632 on test data.},

The mining and effective utilization of information complementarity is core of multi-view clustering. In this paper, we propose a novel Auto-Weighted Graph Regularization and Residual Compensation for Multi-view Subspace Clustering (ARMSC) method, which adopts residual representation information to compensate the globally low rank consensus representation. The auto-weighted multi-view graph regularization term is constructed to preserve the local manifold structure of multiple features, which can automatically adjust the weights and the learned weights are adopt to measure the importance of each view’s residual representation for final representation. Specifically, we formulate the graph regularized consistent representation using nuclear norm and a set of group effect residual compensation using Frobenius norm. Finally, we introduce a convex relaxation and alternating direction method to optimize the problem. Comprehensive and ablation experiments on seven real-world data sets illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed ARMSC over several state-of-the-art multi-view clustering approaches.},

To handle the influence of input saturation, a novel auxiliary nonlinear dynamic system is constructed in which the system state is fixed-time stable. Radial basis function neural networks (RBF NNs) are used to approximate the system uncertainty. Instead of adjusting all weight vectors of RBF NNs, only one parameter is needed to be updated online. Then, based on performance function and auxiliary dynamic system, a fixed-time sliding mode controller with prescribed transient and steady-state performance is developed. Through theoretical analysis, it is concluded that the position tracking error can stabilize around the equilibrium point in fixed time and satisfy the prescribed requirements. Meanwhile, all signals in the closed-loop system are proved to be fixed-time stable by using the Lyapunov method. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Personality is generally expressed as the combination of behavior, emotion, motivation, and thoughts that aim to describe different aspects of human behavior based on a few stable and measurable characteristics. Considering the fact that our personality has a remarkable impact in our daily life, automatic recognition of a person&#39;s personality attributes can provide many essential practical applications in various aspects of cognitive science. Although various methods have been recently proposed for the task of personality recognition, most of them have mainly focused on human-designed statistical features and they did not make use of rich semantic information existing in users&#39; generated texts while not only these contents can specify its writer&#39;s internal thought and emotion but also can be assumed as the most direct way for people to state their feeling and opinion in an understandable form. In order to make use of contextualized information as well as overcoming the complexity and handcraft feature requirement of previous methods, a deep learning based method for the task of contextualized personality recognition is proposed in this paper. Among various deep neural networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have demonstrated profound efficiency in natural language processing and especially personality detection. Owing to the fact that various filter sizes in CNN may influence its performance, we decided to combine CNN with AdaBoost, a classical ensemble algorithm, to consider the possibility of using the contribution of various filter lengths and gasp their potential in the final classification via combining various classifiers with respective filter size using AdaBoost. Our proposed method was validated on the Essay and YouTube datasets by conducting a series of experiments and the empirical results demonstrated the superiority of our proposed method on both datasets compared to both machine learning and deep learning methods for the task of personality recognition.},

  abstract     = {Using the fine-grained entity typing method of distant supervision, when assigning type labels to entity mention, since the knowledge base contains all type labels of the entity, noisy labels will be introduced. This paper proposed a Fine-grained Entity Typing model combined with Features (FETF) to reduce the negative impact of noisy labels. It is different from the previous methods such as manual annotation and heuristic rule pruning. The model not only improves the classification efficiency, but also does not need to reduce the size of the training set, which can improve the overall performance of the classification model. FETF divides the training set into clean dataset and noisy dataset according to the type numbers of entity mention in candidate type set, and constructs different objective functions for them to achieve the purpose of reducing the impact of noisy labels. At the same time, FETF can use the feature generator to jointly learn the relational features of entity mention - type label, as well as the similarity and hierarchical features of type label - type label. The feature generator extracts semantic features other than context, so as to help the fine-grained entity typing model to assign type labels to entity mention. In addition, we introduce adversarial training in the context processor, which can effectively alleviate the model overfitting noisy labels, and improve the robustness and generalization ability of the model. Experimental results on the public datasets show that the method proposed in this paper can effectively alleviate the negative impact of noisy labels on the fine-grained entity typing model, and outperforms previous methods in accuracy, Macro F1 value and Micro F1 value.},

Medical imaging such as computed tomography (CT), X-ray, etc., plays a significant role in diagnosing the patients by presenting the visual representation of the functioning of the organs. However, for any radiologist analyzing such scans is a tedious and time-consuming task. The emerging deep learning technologies have displayed its strength in analyzing such scans to aid in the faster diagnosis of the diseases and viruses such as COVID-19. In the present article, an automated deep learning based model, COVID-19 hierarchical segmentation network (CHS-Net) is proposed that functions as a semantic hierarchical segmenter to identify the COVID-19 infected regions from lungs contour via CT medical imaging using two cascaded residual attention inception U-Net (RAIU-Net) models. RAIU-Net comprises of a residual inception U-Net model with spectral spatial and depth attention network (SSD) that is developed with the contraction and expansion phases of depthwise separable convolutions and hybrid pooling (max and spectral pooling) to efficiently encode and decode the semantic and varying resolution information. The CHS-Net is trained with the segmentation loss function that is the defined as the average of binary cross entropy loss and dice loss to penalize false negative and false positive predictions. The approach is compared with the recently proposed approaches and evaluated using the standard metrics like accuracy, precision, specificity, recall, dice coefficient and Jaccard similarity along with the visualized interpretation of the model prediction with GradCam++ and uncertainty maps. With extensive trials, it is observed that the proposed approach outperformed the recently proposed approaches and effectively segments the COVID-19 infected regions in the lungs.},

In most existing deep metric learning techniques, the embedding of an instance is given by a feature vector produced by a deep neural network and Euclidean distance or cosine similarity defines distances between these vectors. This paper studies deep distributional embeddings of sequences, where the embedding of a sequence is given by the distribution of learned deep features across the sequence. The motivation for this is to better capture statistical information about the distribution of patterns within the sequence in the embedding. When embeddings are distributions rather than vectors, measuring distances between embeddings involves comparing their respective distributions. The paper therefore proposes a distance metric based on Wasserstein distances between the distributions and a corresponding loss function for metric learning, which leads to a novel end-to-end trainable embedding model. We empirically observe that distributional embeddings outperform standard vector embeddings and that training with the proposed Wasserstein metric outperforms training with other distance functions.},

In order to further simplify the feature selection procedure and improve time series classification accuracy, an automatic feature selection of a time series classification method based on an image feature fusion strategy and a deep learning algorithm is proposed. First, a time series is transformed into images using different types of image transformation methods, i.e. the recurrence plot, Gramian angle difference field, Gramian angle summation field and Markov transition field. Second, the above four images are encoded into a new image type, that is the combined image, by a feature fusion strategy. Finally, a convolutional neural network is used for combined image classification and forecasting model selection. Time series from the M1 and M3 competition datasets are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the algorithm has a higher classification accuracy and smaller prediction error compared to the benchmark models. Moreover, the forecasting error MAPE of combined image method is reduced by 0.2020 and 1.7454 compared with the traditional image method and single forecasting methdd respectively.},

This work utilizes a Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) dataset, and it consists of 1038 abnormal and 641 normal images and naturally transformed technique is used to transfer the data using mathematical operation. We have designed a 22-layers customized CNN with parallel filter architecture to extract highly discriminative features (inter-class and intraclass) from the images to diagnose NFU with two different activation functions, namely Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU). The performance of the NFU-Net is compared with the State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) CNN&#39;s such as Alex Net, LeNet, DFU-Net, and DFU QUT-Net based on six performance measures (accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, Matthews&#39;s Correlation Coefficient (MCC) on both original and augmented datasets. The proposed NFU-Net reports an accuracy of nearly 2.5% to 6% higher than conventional CNN&#39;s in diagnosing NFU using the DFU dataset. Compared to the traditional CNN&#39;s, the proposed network requires lesser network parameters and is computationally efficient. The proposed network could benefit the clinicians for a second opinion about NFU diagnosis. The performance and robustness could be improved while testing the network with other open-source databases.},

  abstract     = {Single image based three-dimensional (3D) scene reconstruction has become an important research topic for computer vision and computer graphics fields to provide machine vision systems with near human visual perception. Previous approaches for 3D scene reconstruction and depth estimation from single images required many factors including motion parallax, stereoscopic parallels, and various monocular depth cues adopted from known geometric priors. Deep learning based depth estimation techniques have advanced single image based depth estimation by aggregating various complexity information from RGB depth image datasets for training images to drive the process. This paper proposes an effective 3D scene estimation methodology by automatically extracting vanishing point and semantic information including 3D geometric characteristics without prior assumptions. The vanishing point is extracted from line segments and minimum spanning tree clustering to remove spurious noisy edges. Retracting geometric and semantic information from a given image is achieved by a generative adversarial network trained on the created training set. We verified the proposed approach’s efficiency and effectiveness experimentally with a large database created by directly recovering 3D scenes from from an input image.},

  abstract     = {With the importance of forecasting with a high degree of accuracy, the increasing attention has been evolved to combine individual models, especially statistical and intelligent ones. The main aim of such that hybrid models is to extract unique modeling strengths in linear and nonlinear pattern recognition, respectively. Therefore, different hybridization methods are proposed in recent literature for time series forecasting. One of the most widely-used combination strategies applied for numerous forecasting problems to yield more accurate results is the series hybrid strategy. In this hybridization methodology, components of a time series are separated and then modeled sequentially by choosing appropriate single models. However, the most accurate series hybrid model developed by determining the proper arrangement of single models. Thus, one of the critical issues in constructing series hybrid models is how to choose the appropriate sequence of individual models in a sequential modeling procedure. Although it is critically affecting on obtaining more accurate forecasting results, it has not been appropriately discussed in the literature of time series forecasting. Thus, in this paper, the performance of two possible sequence modeling procedures, including linear–nonlinear and nonlinear–linear, are evaluated. For this purpose, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), support vector machines (SVM), and multilayer perceptrons (MLP) models are chosen due to the popularity of these approaches for developing statistical/intelligent series hybrid models. Five well-known real data sets, e.g., Wolf’s Sunspot, Canadian Lynx, British pound/US dollar exchange rate, Nikkei 225 stock price, and the Colorado wind speed, are considered to distinguish better sequences. In this way, the main objective of this paper is to response this unanswered question in the literature that which sequence of single models can lead to obtain much better accuracy in constructing bi-component series hybrid models. Empirical results indicate that choosing the nonlinear intelligent model as first component in sequential modeling procedure can lead to yield more accurate results. Both SVM–ARIMA and MLP–ARIMA models can improve the performance of the ARIMA–SVM and ARIMA–MLP, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the nonlinear–linear series hybrid models may produce more accurate results than linear–nonlinear hybrid models for time series forecasting.},

This paper is motivated to better explore the semantic relationship between each document and extreme labels by taking advantage of both document content and label correlation. Our objective is to establish an explicit label-aware representation for each document with a hybrid attention deep neural network model(LAHA). LAHA consists of three parts. The first part adopts a multi-label self-attention mechanism to detect the contribution of each word to labels. The second part exploits the label structure and document content to determine the semantic connection between words and labels in a same latent space. An adaptive fusion strategy is designed in the third part to obtain the final label-aware document representation so that the essence of previous two parts can be sufficiently integrated. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six benchmark datasets by comparing with the state-of-the-art methods. The results show the superiority of our proposed LAHA method, especially on the tail labels.},

There are many online learning systems that can recommend students suitable courses according to students’ learning performances. However, there are few universities using recommender system to recommend students suitable elective courses. It is generally known that students in higher grade take the courses earlier than those in lower grade. Therefore, the elective course scores of sophomores can be predicted by using the course score information from students of higher grades. However, the unbalanced distribution of course-enrollment data makes it hard to predict the score of the courses that are in a low selection rate. Therefore, we propose a model-bias matrix factorization algorithm to predict sophomores’ elective course scores, which takes into account the score prediction deviation caused by the course selection rate so as to make more accurate prediction than the traditional matrix factorization approaches. The experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the task of university students’ course score prediction.},

Shown by experimental results on several real benchmark datasets, DCW and DPN bring to us relative strengths in different aspects. While DCW and DPN can both improve the generalization ability of the reconstruction model on small-scale datasets and ease the gradient vanishing problem, DPN plays the main role. Meanwhile, DPN can form shortcut links from the encoder to the decoder to pass detailed information, so it can enhance the performance of image reconstruction and enables CLmser to outperform some recent state-of-the-art methods in image inpainting with irregularly and densely distributed point-shaped masks.},

In the proposed method, we divide the universe into two sets: the set of objects with non-missing values and the set of objects with missing values. Firstly, the objects with non-missing values are clustered by traditional clustering algorithm. For each object with missing values, we use the mean attribute’s value of each cluster to fill the missing attribute’s value based on the cluster results of the objects with non-missing values, respectively. Perturbation analysis of cluster centroid is applied to search the optimal imputation. The experimental clustering results on some UCI data sets are evaluated by several validity indexes, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

The filter banks approach has been mainly used for feature representation. The hybridization in filter banks is primarily generated by a fusion of principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) filters. Currently, the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) has taken a significant step for improving the classification compared to other learning, though the feature learning mechanism of DCNN is not definite. We have used the cascaded linear convolutional network for 3D face classification using a composite filter-based network named PICANet. The networks consist of different layers: convolutional layer, nonlinear processing layer, pooling layer, and classification layer. The main advantage of these networks over DCNN is that the network structure is simple and computationally efficient. We have tested the proposed system on three accessible 3D face databases: Frav3D, GavabDB, and Casia3D. Considering different faces in Frav3D, GavabDB, and Casia3D, the system acquired 96.93%, 87.7%, and 89.21% recognition rates using the proposed hybrid network.},

Criminal to commercial products, citizen confirmation and border control are few application areas. The research work is a deep learning based integrated model for accurate iris detection and recognition. Initially, eye images are considered from two datasets, the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Automation (CASIA) and the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi v1.0. Iris region is accurately segmented using Daugman’s algorithm and Circular Hough Transform (CHT). Feature extraction is hybrid that is performed using Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DTCWT), Gabor filter, Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) from the segmented iris regions. A Multiobjective Artificial Bee Colony (MABC) algorithm is proposed to eliminate noisy and redundant feature vectors by estimating consistent information. In MABC algorithm, two multi-objective functions are formulated as reduction in number of features and classification error rate. The selected active feature vectors are given as input to autoencoder classification for iris recognition. The experimental outcome shows that MABC-autoencoder model obtained 99.67% and 98.73% accuracy on CASIA-Iris, and IIT Delhi v1.0 iris datasets. Performance evaluation is based on accuracy, specificity, Critical Success Index (CSI), sensitivity, Fowlkes Mallows (FM) index, and Mathews Correlation Coefficient (MCC).},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks (DNN) can achieve high performance when applied to In-Distribution (ID) data which come from the same distribution as the training set. When presented with anomaly inputs not from the ID, the outputs of a DNN should be regarded as meaningless. However, modern DNN often predict anomaly inputs as an ID class with high confidence, which is dangerous and misleading. In this work, we consider three classes of anomaly inputs, (1) natural inputs from a different distribution than the DNN is trained for, known as Out-of-Distribution (OOD) samples, (2) crafted inputs generated from ID by attackers, often known as adversarial (AD) samples, and (3) noise (NS) samples generated from meaningless data. We propose a framework that aims to detect all these anomalies for a pre-trained DNN. Unlike some of the existing works, our method does not require preprocessing of input data, nor is it dependent to any known OOD set or adversarial attack algorithm. Through extensive experiments over a variety of DNN models for the detection of aforementioned anomalies, we show that in most cases our method outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods in identifying all three classes of anomalies.},

  abstract     = {Long time series forecasting is an important problem with applications in many fields, such as weather forecasting, stock prediction, petroleum production prediction and heating load forecasting. In recent years, the most popular methods for long time series forecasting pay attention to extract local information at a single scale based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Moreover, these methods utilize the basic attention mechanism to select the relevant information from previous time steps for generating the better outputs. However, long time series have rich information at different scales and basic attention mechanism is not appropriate for directly predicting a future sequence. In this paper, we propose a long time series forecasting method by utilizing Multi-scale feature extraction and Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) attention mechanism in the hidden state of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which is named MS-LSTM. Concretely, MS-LSTM is inspired by seq2seq attention mechanism to generate the output sequences by making the best of previous information. Multiscale feature extraction utilizes CNNs with different convolution kernels to extract short-term features at different scales. The comparison and ablation experiments on the exchange rate dataset show that the proposed method achieves significant improvements over that of several state-of-the-art methods. We also apply the proposed model on a time series dataset of industrial equipment indexes provided by Shanghai Zhoubang Information Technology Company, and achieve state-of-the-art results in all cases.},

  abstract     = {Due to the characteristics of the Chinese writing system, character-based Chinese named entity recognition models ignore the word information in sentences, which harms their performance. Recently, many works try to alleviate the problem by integrating lexicon information into character-based models. These models, however, either simply concatenate word embeddings, or have complex structures which lead to low efficiency. Furthermore, word information is viewed as the only resource from lexicon, thus the value of lexicon is not fully explored. In this work, we observe another neglected information, i.e., character position in a word, which is beneficial for identifying character meanings. To fuse character, word and character position information, we modify the key-value memory network and propose a triple fusion module, termed as TFM. TFM is not limited to simple concatenation or suffers from complicated computation, compatibly working with the general sequence labeling model. Experimental evaluations show that our model has performance superiority. The F1-scores on Resume, Weibo and MSRA are 96.19%, 71.12% and 95.63% respectively.},

  abstract     = {As technology advances, a large number of time series data have emerged in all walks of life. Clustering is a key technique for analysing time series data. However, most of the existing clustering methods calculate the distance of a single discrete data point, but cannot be applied to continuous time-series data with structural distortion (e.g., expansion, contraction, and drift) and noise (e.g., pseudo-event), resulting in low clustering accuracy. In this paper, a novel time series event clustering approach called CBR(Clustering Based on Representative sequences) is proposed. We first introduce a cross-correlation method to measure the distance between sequences with structural distortion, and propose an r-nearest neighbor evaluation system for sequences to construct candidate sets of R-Seqs(Representative sequences) and eliminate pseudo-event interference. Secondly, we formulate composite selection approaches for R-Seqs based on combinatorial optimization and diversifying top-k query to rapidly derive the R-Seqs optimal solution from the candidate sets. Finally, relying on the dynamically constructed distance matrix of R-Seqs and dataset, a matrix clustering method based on K-means is proposed to achieve an efficient division of event classes. Experimental results demonstrate that CBR is superior to the existing approaches in clustering accuracy, efficiency and denoising quality, especially the clustering accuracy is improved by more than 30% on average .},

However, the collected data can sometimes contain outliers, which can significantly affect the modeling. A classic technique widely used for this purpose is called Polynomial Regression and recently, the use of the Multilayer Perceptron Network (MLP) has been gaining prominence. More recently, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) was developed, and it has been validated as a plausible solution for global modeling. In this paper, in addition to the mentioned techniques, the following Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are also presented: the Self-Organizing Map with K winners (KSOM) and the Local Linear Mapping (LLM), which are based on local modeling. These models are implemented using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and M-estimator techniques to obtain the parameters used in the estimation and to verify the effect of the outliers on the input data. By employing qualitative and quantitative analysis, the obtained results prove that the proposed models based on local modeling are a realistic alternative to the conventional methods for estimating the power curve in wind turbines.},

Because of this reason in particular recent decades, various kinds of computational intelligence techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used for financial time series forecasting. However, in experiments reported so far, the number of applications of CNNs for the forecasting of financial time series seems quite a few and also in almost all-studies time sequence effect of time series is not preserved on forecasts because of image transformation. From this point of view, in this paper, by aiming to get better forecasting results and avoiding information loss which may occur the process of image transformation, we suggest a new CNN-based forecasting model that can be applied on some time series and, can successfully extract the features of them in the forecasting process. The proposed CNN forecasting model is composed of three convolutional layers and five full connected layers, also to be able to determine the nonlinear relation between input and output Relu and Elu activation functions have also been used. The suggested framework has been applied to some of the most evaluated financial time series, which are Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX) and Financial Time Stock Exchange for London stock market data (FTSE). The results have been evaluated on different aspects as an error criterion, a regression analyses and also a visual demonstration. It has been clearly observed that CNN structure has produced outstanding forecasts compared to some other state-of-the-art forecasting tools such as different kinds of ANN, LSTM, fuzzy-based approaches, and some traditional methods.},

  abstract     = {Few-shot learning (FSL), aiming to address the problem of data scarcity, is a hot topic of current researches. The most commonly used FSL framework is composed of two components: (1) Pre-train. Employing the base data to train a feature extraction model (FEM). (2) Meta-test. Utilizing the trained FEM to extract novel data’s feature embedding and then recognize them with the to-be-designed classifier. Due to the constraint of limited labeled samples, some researchers attempt to exploit the unlabeled samples to strengthen the classifier by introducing self-training strategy. However, a single classifier (based on scarce labeled samples) usually incorrectly identifies unlabeled sample classes as its insufficient discrimination, which is dubbed as Single-Classifier-Misclassify-Data (SCMD) problem. To address this fundamental problem, we design a Co-learning (CL) method for FSL. Typically, we find that different classifiers have different adaptability to the same feature distribution. Hence we try to exploit two basic classifiers to separately infer pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples, and crossly expand them to the labeled data. The two complementary classifiers make the predicted accuracy more reliable. We evaluate our CL on five benchmark datasets (e.g., mini-ImageNet, tiered-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS, FC100, CUB), and can exceed other state-of-the-arts 0.63–4.6%. The outstanding performance has demonstrated the efficiency of our method.},

  abstract     = {Graph-structured data exist in numerous applications in real life. As a state-of-the-art graph neural network, the graph convolutional network (GCN) plays an important role in processing graph structured data. However, a recent study reported that GCNs are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which means that they may suffer malicious attacks delivering unnoticeable modifications of the data. Among all possible adversarial attacks on GCNs, there is a special method called the universal adversarial attack that generates a perturbation that can be applied to any sample and causes GCN models to output incorrect results. Although universal adversarial attacks in computer vision have been extensively researched, there are few works on universal adversarial attacks on graph structured data. In this paper, we propose a targeted universal attack (TUA) against GCNs. Our method employs a few nodes as the attack nodes. The attack capability of the attack nodes is enhanced through a small number of fake nodes connected to the attack nodes. During an attack, any victim node will be misclassified by the GCN as a member of the attack node class as long as it is linked to the attack nodes. Experiments on three popular datasets show that the average attack success rate of the proposed attack on any victim node in the graph reaches 83% when using only 3 attack nodes and 6 fake nodes. A comparison between the TUA and established baselines further proves its attack capability. We hope that our work will raise community awareness of the threat from TUA and increase the attention given to its future defense.},

This paper proposes an accelerated CNN model for video compression application based on hardware-software architecture. We first accelerate the CNN layers to build an Intellectual Property (IP) cores using Vivado High Level Synthesis (HLS). Then, we create a hardware-software architecture based on a CNN’s IP cores designed and integrated in the programmable logic zone (PL) which is connected to the Xilinx Processing System (PS) that manage all processing tasks on the FPGA–SoC board. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed co-design achieves an on-chip power consumption of 1.69 W under a 142 MHz PL frequency and 525 MHz PS frequency.

The flooding in adjacent areas through which the Beki and Pagladia rivers in Assam flow has been a primary source of damage and destruction during the monsoon season. Traditional and data aided approaches are combined to study and predict the occurrence of flood involving these two rivers. Though traditional approaches have been extensively used, the recent trend is towards the use of learning aided methods. Primarily, a few deep learning approaches like Stacked Auto Encoder (SAE) connected with Tapped Delay Line (TDL) blocks are combined and integrated with layers of TDL-Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) units and bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) cells to form a configuration which has been extensively trained. This learning involves use of data sets with monthly, weekly, daily and hourly records of significant river flow parameters of Beki and Pagladia to predict these for subsequent periods of time and generate decision states of flooding caused during the rainy season. Data collected from secondary sources and historical records have been combined to train the above mentioned deep learning based approaches to estimate the probability of occurrences of flood. Also a look ahead predictor approach has been configured and used as a part of the system which uses the recorded data to forecast occurrence of flood within certain time intervals.},

For each relationship triplet in a given image, FOE-VRD not only considers the subject and object, but also uses one fixed-size vector to encoding all background objects of the image. In this way, we introduce more background knowledge to assist the relationship detector for better performance. We firstly use a regular convolution neural network as a feature extractor to generate high-level features of input images. Then, for each relationship triplet, we apply ROI-pooling as the feature generator on the bounding boxes of subject and object to get two corresponding feature vectors. Moreover, we propose a novel method to encode all background objects in each image by using one fixed-size vector (i.e., FBE vector). By concatenating the 3 generated feature vectors, we successfully encode the relationship using one fixed-size vector. The generated feature vector is then feed into a fully connected neural network to get the predicate classification result. Experimental results on VRD and Visual Genome databases show that the proposed method works well on both predicate classification and relationship detection tasks, especially on the situation of zero-shot detection.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the sharp increase in the number of residential motor vehicles and non-motorized vehicles has led to a huge challenge in the intelligent control of urban road traffic operation status. To address the problems of low accuracy of small target detection in complex traffic scenes and the difficulty of balancing the accuracy and detection speed of multiple targets, we propose a deep learning-based Semantic interpolation target detection network SI-SSD based on feature pyramid network FPN and feature graph fusion method, and transfer it to target detection in complex traffic scenes. Shallow feature maps have multi-edge information and deep feature maps have high semantic information. With this idea in mind, the high-resolution shallow feature layer Conv4_3 for the detection of small targets and the deep feature layer Conv7_2 with rich semantic information in SSD network are fused, so as to enhance the sensitivity of the network to the feature information of small targets and improve the network’s ability to detect small targets in complex traffic scenarios. The experimental results show that the improved SI-SSD network model has good robustness in the detection of relatively small targets, which can ensure the detection speed and improve the accuracy of detection and recognition significantly. Tests of the data sets UA-DETRAC and VOC2007 show that in the detection of relatively small targets such as Motorbike and Pedestrian, the accuracy is 89.3% and 86.7%, respectively, and the mean average precesion (mAP) is 89.05%. Compared with other target detection networks based on deep learning, the average accuracy of all types of target detection is improved by 4%, and the detection speed is maintained at about 32 fps.},

In order to ensure that the optimal power flow will not cause a serious impact to the stability of the power grid, voltage-var optimization engines which employ a multi-algorithm coordination are presented to optimize the losses of power grid and the bus voltage. The simulation of IEEE 30-bus shows that the proposed hybrid algorithm strategy can not only minimize the cost of active power generation, but also satisfy the load demand under the precondition that all the bus voltage is within the reference range. The percentages of power losses comparisons verify that the proposed hybrid algorithm strategy can decrease the transmission line losses of the power grid effectively, which will not bring a serious influence to the stability of the power grid.},

However, in the decoder stage, the input vector keep same and there is much uncorrelated with previously visual parts or generated words. In this paper, we propose an attentional LSTM (ALSTM) and show how to integrate it within state-of-the-art automatic image captioning framework. Instead of traditional LSTM in existing models, ALSTM learns to refine input vector from network hidden states and sequential context information. Thus ALSTM can attend more relevant features such as spatial attention, visual relations and pay more attention on the most relevant context words. Moreover, ALSTM is utilized as the decoder in some classical frameworks and shows how to get effective visual/context attention to update input vector. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on the Flickr30K and MSCOCO image datasets with modified network illustrate the superiority of ALSTM. ALSTM based methods can generate high quality descriptions by combining sequence context and relations.},

  abstract     = {Training translation systems with complex and compound sentences are generally considered computationally tough and such systems fail to process, the large syntactical information given out by these sentences. This issue subsequently, affects the overall quality of translations. On the other hand, simple sentences are shorter by nature and produce less syntactical information. Therefore, it would be safe to say that training translation systems using simple sentences only, would result in better translation output. However, training a translation system requires a large and quality parallel corpus involving two natural languages. While parallel corpus for various language pairs is abundant, such lexicons for low-resourced languages, consisting of only simple sentences are rare. In such a scenario, the development of such a parallel lexicon is the initial purpose of the present work. Building the same would require differentiating complex and/or compound sentences from the overall corpus and then converting them into simple sentences. Since, the work includes two languages, English and Bengali, different algorithms to accomplish the same, is documented in this paper. Converting complex and compound sentences to simple instances results in fragmenting sentences into two or more segments, which then needs to be aligned to make them semantically similar. Hence, a basic alignment technique has also been proposed to mitigate this problem. After developing the parallel corpus, we needed to check for its effectiveness in solving the quality issues of translation systems discussed earlier. For this, state-of-the-art translation modules like Statistical Machine Translation and Neural Machine Translation, have been trained using the developed corpus as well as with the raw parallel corpus consisting of sentences of mixed complexities. The performance of these translation models has been compared using automated as well as manual evaluation metrics. The results are promising and prove that translation systems do perform better when trained using simple sentence language pairs.},

This work proposes the direct use of these metrics as cost functions, which are often derived from the confusion matrix. Commonly used metrics are covered, namely AUC, G-mean, F1-score and AG-mean. The only implementation change for model training occurs in the backpropagation error term. The results were compared to the standard MLP using the Rprop learning algorithm, SMOTE, SMTTL, WWE and RAMOBoost. Sixteen classical benchmark datasets were used in the experiments. Based on average ranks, the proposed formulation outperformed Rprop and all sampling strategies, namely SMOTE, SMTTL and WWE, for all metrics. These results were statistically confirmed for AUC and G-mean in relation to Rprop. For F1-score and AG-mean, all algorithms were considered statistically equivalent. The proposal was also superior to RAMOBoost for G-mean given average ranks. However, it was statistically faster than RAMOBoost for all metrics. It was also faster than SMTTL and statistically equivalent to Rprop, SMOTE and WWE. More, the solutions obtained are generally non-dominated ones compared to all other techniques, for all metrics. The results showed that the direct use of performance metrics as cost functions for neural network training favors generalization capacity and also computation time in imbalanced classification problems. Its extension to other performance metrics derived directly from the confusion matrix is straightforward.},

  abstract     = {The uncertainty caused mainly by the deficiency of precision and data, artificial/human-made errors, information accessed from expert opinions or very miniature size of samples, etc., is the reason behind the ill-defined nature of most of the real-world problems. Type-I fuzzy set theory (FST) handles these kinds of uncertainties with a better perspective. However, type-I FST cannot always characterize uncertainty in all real-world problems. Examples may be had in the diagnosis of patients that has to be primarily dependent on the medical investigator’s (MI) buoyancy level, where owing to limited knowledge of the MI, results with a higher grade of accuracy cannot be expected. However, on the same note, interval-valued fuzzy set (IVFS) can prove to be a suitable apparatus while embodying vague linguistic expressions of the patients. Moreover, interval-valued fuzzy numbers (IVFNs) have the unique ability to incorporate the confidence degree of the opinions put forward by the MI to fit into a closed region (interval). Various researchers developed a few arithmetic methods for IVFNs with situation-based drawbacks. Furthermore, the ranking of IVFNs plays a crucial role in ordering IVFNs in decision making. Numerous ranking approaches can be encountered in literature with shortcomings. In this regard, this article attempts to devise a neo arithmetic technique along with an appropriate ranking method for trapezoidal generalized interval-valued fuzzy numbers (TrGIVFNs) and furnishes a maiden attempt to swot up decision making for MIs. The advantages of the present proposed methods have been showcased by comparing them with existing methods. It is praiseworthy of TrGIVFNs that their parameter heights can facilitate the buoyancy degree of the decision-maker&#39;s judgments in very specific comportment. Finally, a case study using live data has been performed so that the proposed technique could be tested to the core. It is observed that the proposed approach provides a way to perform MI in an explicit demeanor, and the followed consequences are acceptable in comparison to classical techniques. Furthermore, it provides more precision and efficiency to the decision of the medical investigators.},

The purpose of this research was to explore the factors that influence the propofol dosage needed to sedate patients. This paper estimates the drug dose to regulate the depth of anesthesia by administrating propofol. In this regard, two artificial intelligence approaches; a feedforward neural network and ANFIS are applied to predict the propofol dose. Introducing an estimator to control automatically might provide remarkable advantages for the patient in reducing the risk for under- and over-dosing. The suggested estimations are compared with results extracted from the classical model revised method and then evaluated patients undergoing surgery in a Mashhad’s hospital to identify a research innovation. The propofol doses are optimized using a genetic algorithm. Sensitivity analysis methods are used to test the estimator using a collection of patient models consisting of some populations. Finally, during anesthesia, an optimal dose estimator allows for a rapid period of induction with reasonable overshoot and adequate disturbance rejection results. The novelty of this study is in estimating without using Bi-spectral Index signal and also there is a significant reduction in anesthesia costs by optimizing the drug dose. The results of the optimization model show a 14.06% saving of propofol dose with MSE 5.3 × 10−6.},

  abstract     = {Rain attenuation events are one of the foremost drawbacks in satellite communications, impairing satellite link availability. For this reason, it is necessary to foresee rain events to avoid an outage of the satellite link. In this paper, we propose and develop a method based on Machine Learning to predict events of rain attenuation without appealing to complex mathematical models. To be specific, we implement a Long–short term memory architecture that is a Deep Learning algorithm based on an artificial recurrent neural network. Furthermore, supervised learning is the learning task for our algorithms. For this purpose, rain attenuation time-series feed the Long–short term memory network at the input to train it. However, the lack of a rainfall database hinders the development of a reliable prediction method. Therefore, we generate a synthetic rain attenuation database by using the recommendations of the International Telecommunication Union. Each model is trained and validated by computational experiments, employing statistical metrics to find the most accurate and reliable models. Thus, the accuracy metric compares the outcomes of the proposal with other related methods and models. As a result, our best model reaches an accuracy of $$91.88\%$$ versus $$87.99\%$$ from the external best model, demonstrating superiority over other models/methods. On average, our proposal accuracy reaches a value of $$88.08\%$$ . Finally, we find out that this proposal can contribute efficiently to improving the performance of satellite system networks by re-routing data traffic or increasing link availabilities, taking advantage of the prediction of rain attenuation events.},

By approximating the solutions of the coupled Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations, a local performance index is defined to solve the optimal synchronization problem for discrete-time nonlinear complex dynamic networks without knowing the node dynamics and the topology of the directed graph. Based on this, an off-policy iteration algorithm is designed to iteratively improve the target policy, and the convergence of the algorithm is proved theoretically. Actor-critic neural networks along with the gradient descent approach are employed to approximate optimal control policies and performance index functions using the data generated by applying prescribed behavior policies. Finally, two numerical simulation examples are given to show the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Part of Speech (POS) tagging is a sequential labelling task and one of the core applications of Natural Language Processing. It has been a challenging problem for the low resource languages. Sequential labelling algorithms aim to model relationships among the words of a sentence. Availability of annotated datasets in ample amounts is another challenge for low resource languages. Contrastive training has been tried as a robust approach that captures the essential features during model training and based on this, Contrastive Monotonic Chunk-wise attention with CNN-GRU-Softmax (CMCCGS) model architecture has been proposed for POS tagging. It learns optimal features in a low resource regime. It comprises three components: contrastive training, monotonic chunk-wise attention and CNN-GRU-Softmax, where Monotonic Chunk-wise attention exploits the discrete and chunk level dependencies. We experimented on the datasets of four domains, Article, Conversation, Disease and Tourism, of the Hindi treebank, Tweet domain from TweeBank, Newswire domain from Penn TreeBank (PTB) and Tweet domain from ARK and compared it with several state-of-the-art models. We have obtained $$96.63\%$$ , $$94.34\%$$ , $$91.24\%$$ , $$93.76\%$$ , $$92.30\%$$ , $$97.51\%$$ and $$93.55\%$$ accuracy on respective domains after CMCCGS has been applied. CMCCGS model has been further extended to domain adaptation by using single and multi-source domain adaptation to allow fine-tuning. It is analysed the effects on different layers. The extremely low resource domains such as Tourism, Disease and tweet domain of TweeBank and ARK have shown improvement in accuracy of $$+3.00\% (96.76\%)$$ by an Article domain, $$+4.14\% (95.38\%)$$ by Article and Tourism (multi-source), $$+2.93\% (95.23\%)$$ by PTB domain and $$+1.43\% (94.98\%)$$ by PTB and TweeBank (multi-source) as source domain, respectively.

In recent years, massive open online courses (MOOCs) have become the first choice of online learning for tens of millions of people around the world. However, the dropout rates for MOOCs are high. The goal of dropout prediction is to predict whether learners will exhibit learning behavior in several consecutive days in the future. Therefore, in this study, we consider the correlation information of learners’ learning behaviors for several consecutive days. Through the in-depth statistical analysis of learners’ learning behavior, it is found that learners’ learning behavior on the next day is similar to that of the previous day. Based on this characteristic, we propose a Lie group region covariance matrix to represent the local correlation information of learning behavior and construct a convolutional neural network model with a multidilation pooling module to extract the local correlation high-level features of learning behavior for dropout prediction. In addition, extensive experiments show that the local correlation of learners’ learning behavior cannot be ignored, which is fully considered in our model. Compared with the existing methods, our method achieves the best experimental results in accuracy, F-measure, precision, and recall, which is better than the current methods.},

  abstract     = {Smart Grid (SG) can be easily attacked by smart hackers who try to corrupt the data aggregated by the acquisition system and supervisory control. The hacker has the capability to cheat the Bad-Data Detector (BDD) and compromise the system by injecting malicious data into the meter measurement data. This can lead to wrong decision-making, economical loss, power outages, and so on. To address these issues, a bio inspired Salp Swarm Optimization (SSO) based cyber-attack detection technique is proposed. In the proposed salp neural model for cyber-attack detection, the State Estimation is initially done and the bad data is identified by a BDD. Then, the features are extracted by Discrete Wavelet Transform and the dimensionality reduction process takes place. Here, we use Kernel Principle Component Analysis for reducing the dimensionality. Once the data is decomposed to lower dimensions, the presence of attack in SG is detected by the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier. The SSO determines the most optimal weight values of ANN. This improves the classification accuracy. The performance of the proposed salp neural model is tested in standard IEEE 118- bus and 57-bus test systems. Based on the evaluation and comparison with the existing schemes, the proposed salp neural technique has observed to have better performance in terms of metrics accuracy, Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, and F1-score.},

In this system, key points of the human body used to express the spatial pose of traffic police are extracted by OpenPose, and these key points are used to generate a spatio-temporal map by motion representation. Then, the graph convolutional network and modified Transformer are respectively used to obtain the spatial features and temporal features from the spatio-temporal map. Finally, the above features are used to infer the intention of traffic police in continuous frame images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method had a higher accuracy than other state-of-the-art recognition algorithms in understanding traffic police intention.},

In this paper, a new topological design method is proposed by analyzing abstract edge information (called texture) in feature map based on the experimental and numerical analysis. Especially, the prior number of convolution kernels in the first layer and combinatorial optimization of all hidden layers are applied to initialize the entire network topology. The experiments based on the MNIST, Chest X-ray and CTs dataset indicate that (1) Traditional CNN layers with doubling nodes are not essential to optimize the hidden-layer topology because of the texture features that extracted from different datasets. (2) Improved hidden-layer topology of the CNN can outperform the better performance in classification-tasks and improvement up to 30% compared with the benchmark methods.},

Firstly, we introduce a multimodal corpus construction method that combines the precise classified semantic tags of images with symptom descriptions to search the patients in most similar conditions, so studies on treatment plans and results on this group of patients can be done. Since feature word extraction of symptom descriptions could be achieved by Natural Language Processing, the challenge of constructing a precise orthodontic corpus relies on the accuracy of classifying semantic tags of images. To cope with it, secondly, we propose a novel metric learning method named margin-balancing loss by fusing the global and local features in the deep architecture, which could enhance classifiers’ discriminative ability and provide precise results for constructing the multimodal orthodontic medicine corpus. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed algorithm achieves a higher accuracy which outperforms most classification methods.

Specifically, we employ dynamic convolution to flexibly fuse element-wise temporal information frame by frame. Before that, to handle large motion across frames, we propose a self-calibrated deformable (SCD) alignment module, in which motion offsets are predicted via self-calibrated convolution that explicitly expand receptive field of each convolutional layer through internal communications in a multi-resolution manner. The aligned features of each neighbouring frame are then fed to the DFM to make a temporal information fusion. Finally, the reference features containing spatial and temporal information are sent into SR reconstruction module for the high-resolution frame.

To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel privacy-preserving image similarity join method, called PPIS-JOIN. Different from the existing schemes, this approach aims to combine deep image hashing method and a novel affine transformation method to conceal sensitive information at feature level and generate high quality hash codes. Meanwhile, based on secure hash codes, a privacy-preserving similarity query model is proposed, which includes a secure image hash codes based inverted index, called ISH-Index, to support efficient and accuracy similarity search.

  abstract     = {Scale variation is one of the primary challenges in object detection. Recently, different strategies have been introduced to address this challenge, achieving promising performance. However, limitations still exist in these detectors. On the one hand, as for the large-scale deep layers, the localizing power of the features is relatively low. On the other hand, as for the small-scale shallow layers, the categorizing ability of the features is relatively weak. Actually, the limitations are self-solving, as the above two aspects can be mutually beneficial to each other. Therefore, we propose the Stacked Pyramid Attention Network (SPANet) to bridge the gap between different scales. In SPANet, two lightweight modules, i.e. top-down feature map attention module (TDFAM) and bottom-up feature map attention module (BUFAM), are designed. Via learning the channel attention and spatial attention, each module effectively builds connections between features from adjacent scales. By progressively integrating BUFAM and TDFAM into two encoder–decoder structures, two novel feature aggregating branches are built. In this way, the branches fully complement the localizing power from small-scale features and the categorizing power from large-scale features, therefore enhancing the detection accuracy while keeping lightweight. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks (PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets) demonstrate the effectiveness of our SPANet, showing that our model reaches a competitive trade-off between accuracy and speed.},

  abstract     = {Graph Convolutional Networks have been widely used for node classification. Since the original data usually contains nonlinear relationships that are difficult to capture and includes noise that leads to the poor performance of the constructed graph representation, the paper proposes a novel Nonlinear Graph Learning-Convolutional Network (NGLCN) based on the kernel method and graph representation learning. Specifically, NGLCN first uses a kernel method to map the original data into kernel space, making the original linearly separable to capture the nonlinear relationship between the data, and then uses a feature selection based on structure information to remove the noisy and redundant feature and constructs a high-quality graph representation, and finally employs a common graph convolutional network to conduct node classification tasks. Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets show that NGLCN outperforms the state-of-the-art traditional graph convolutional networks.},

  abstract     = {Semi-supervised learning techniques have been attracting increasing interests in many machine learning fields for its effectiveness in using labeled and unlabeled samples. however, the ultimate performance tend to be inaccurate or misleading due to the presence of heavy noise and outliers. This problem raises the need to develop the methods that can exploit data structure and also be robust to the noisy points. In this paper, a novel semi-supervised classification method, named adaptive graph learning for semi-supervised self-paced classification (AGLSSC in short), is proposed by integrating self-paced learning (SSL) regime and adaptive graph learning (AGL) strategy into a joint framework and experimentally evaluated. Specifically, AGLSSC automatically select import samples by adding a parameter that can measure the importance of samples in each iteration optimization process. In addition, in order to learn the internal relationship of samples from corrupt data, the proposed method adaptively learns an optimal sample similarity matrix while maintaining the local structure of the samples. In this case, the proposed model has strong robustness to noise points. Extensive experiments conducted on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that AGLSSC achieves the most outstanding performance compared to some state-of-the-art semi-supervised classification methods.},

As the number of convergent keys (CKs) in CE will increase dramatically with enlarging data, there is a critical issue that how to safely manage the CKs. Previous works usually introduce a fully-trusted key management server (KS) to ensure the CKs security, resulting in data leakage by KS in reality. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based secure deduplication scheme with reliable CK management, denoted as BDKM, which introduces different secret information to CE to enhance the data confidentiality in different level deduplications. To realize secure and reliable CK management, the CK will be divided into key segments by using secret sharing scheme and distributed on blockchain as transactions. Therefore, only the valid data owner can recover the CK from the blockchain and the original data will be protected even if the adversaries have colluded with cloud service provider. Security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that our proposed scheme can remain secure under the proposed security models with a limited overhead.},

Specifically, the sample weight for every data point is obtained by penalizing an $$\ell _{2,1}$$ -norm loss on its estimation error to reduce the influence of the sample-level noise, the class weight for each class is obtained by considering the misclassification cost as well as imbalance class to overcome the influence of class-level noise, and the view weight for each view is obtained by penalizing a squared root operator on the estimation error of each view to reduce the influence of view-level noise.

And several studies have been conducted to find a robust MTL method either in the supervised learning or unsupervised learning paradigm using a shallow or deep approach. This paper provides an analysis of supervised shallow-based multi-task learning methods. To begin, we present a rationale for MTL with a basic example that is easy to understand.

  abstract     = {DTW measures is an indication of dissimilarity, which has a wide range of applications in pattern recognition and machine learning. Nevertheless, it is difficult to directly calculate the distance between unequal-sized matrices, which can potentially be solved by using the proposed Non-Interlaced Dynamic Time Warping (Non-Interlaced DTW) algorithm in this paper. In the new algorithm, matrices are separated into row vectors, and DTW distance matrix is set up based on the distances between row vectors. By introducing dynamic programming, the minimum cumulative distance and shortest path of the DTW distance matrix can be achieved, as well as the optimal match and the rows-alignment between row vectors. Non-Interlaced DTW algorithm defines the normalized cumulative distance of DTW distance matrix as the final distance measure. The performance of the algorithm is tested and verified by experiments on MNIST database, FVC2004 dataset and Caltech database. The results illustrate that the Non-Interlaced DTW can get accurate similarity between unequal-sized matrixes. By directly obtaining the distance between matrices, Non-Interlaced DTW provides a new idea of similarity measure for unequal-sized matrices and has the promising application when dealing with high-dimensional data.},

  abstract     = {Neurophysiological signals are manifestations of the underlying brain activity, and they contain an abundance of neural information. The decoding and understanding of these signals is useful to develop robotic exoskeletons, benefitting device-aided motor rehabilitation. To this date, numerous efforts have been carried out to explore the relations between neurophysiological signals and locomotor capacity. Most of these studies focused on a single modality of neurophysiological signal and ignored its multiple modalities. In this study, the modalities from two kinds of biosensors were fused [electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG)], and a novel deep learning model was proposed (multi-scale learning, MSL) to classify four walking patterns. The EEG and EMG data were collected during a walking experiment, where different walking conditions with and without exoskeleton-aided assistance were implemented (i.e. free-walking and exoskeleton-aided walking at zero, low, and high assistive forces). The performance achieved by the MSL model was compared to that of existing models, and the results show that multimodal MSL achieved the highest performance in terms of classification accuracy (89.33%). Moreover, the comparisons in our study show that an improved classification performance was obtained when a full 62-channel EEG setting was used compared to using a subset of 20 channels located on the sensorimotor region. This work contributes to the improvement of neurophysiological signal decoding and promotes the development of rehabilitation technologies as well as exoskeleton-aided applications.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, deep learning has achieved great success in many natural language processing tasks, including named entity recognition. The shortcoming is that a large quantity of manually annotated data is usually required. Previous studies have demonstrated that active learning can considerably reduce the cost of data annotation, but there is still plenty of room for improvement. In real applications, we found that existing uncertainty-based active learning strategies have two shortcomings. First, these strategies prefer to choose long sequences explicitly or implicitly, which increases the annotation burden of annotators. Second, some strategies need to revise and modify the model to generate additional information for sample selection, which increases the workload of the developer and increases the training/prediction time of the model. In this paper, we first examine traditional active learning strategies in specific cases of Word2Vec-BiLSTM-CRF and Bert-CRF that have been widely used in named entity recognition on several typical datasets. Then, we propose an uncertainty-based active learning strategy called the lowest token probability (LTP), which combines the input and output of conditional random field (CRF) to select informative instances. LTP is a simple and powerful strategy that does not favor long sequences and does not need to revise the model. We test LTP on multiple real-world datasets, the experiment results show that compared with existing state-of-the-art selection strategies, LTP can reduce about 20% annotation tokens while maintaining competitive performance on both sentence-level accuracy and entity-level F1-score. Additionally, LTP significantly outperformed all other strategies in selecting valid samples, which dramatically reduced the invalid annotation times of the labelers.},

The research of TriHard loss has been verified to improve performance efficiently in the person re-identification task. However, TriHard loss considers the hardest positive sample and the hardest negative sample exclusively, which ignores the remaining samples. To stuff this gap, we propose an expansion-pool TriHard (TriEP) loss which can give attention to the hardest samples and other samples. Initially, the equal-label sample pools are expanded based on the labels of the hardest samples. Then, the statistics of the sample pool are calculated according to the distribution of samples. Finally, the dynamic penalty is imposed on TriHard loss to construct TriEP loss. Extensive experiments on Market-1501, DukeMTMC, and occluded datasets prove the superiority of the proposed TriEP loss. Compared with the baseline model, a noticeable performance improvement can be obtained after embedding the proposed TriEP loss.},

In this paper, we present a novel dissimilarity based learning model for similar structured but diverse chart classification, by improving the loss function. Our approach jointly learns the features of both dissimilar and similar regions using notion of homogeneity. The loss function of the model is improved, which is fused by a variation aware dissimilarity index and incorporated with regularization parameters, making model more prone towards dissimilar regions and similar structure charts. Extensive comparative evaluations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms other benchmark methods, including both traditional and deep learning models, over publicly available datasets.},

A novel framework for DR detection and classification was proposed in this study. The proposed work includes four stages: pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. Initially, the image pre-processing is performed and after that, the Multi threshold-based Remora Optimization (MTRO) algorithm performs the vessel segmentation. The feature extraction and classification process are done by using a Region-based Convolution Neural Network (R-CNN) with Wild Geese Algorithm (WGA). Finally, the proposed R-CNN with WGA effectively classifies the different stages of DR including Non-DR, Proliferative DR, Severe, Moderate DR, Mild DR. The experimental images were collected from the DRIVE database, and the proposed framework exhibited superior DR detection performance. Compared to other existing methods like fully convolutional deep neural network (FCDNN), genetic-search feature selection (GSFS), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and deep learning (DL) techniques, the proposed R-CNN with WGA provided 95.42% accuracy, 93.10% specificity, 93.20% sensitivity, and 98.28% F-score results.},

In this work, a series of weakly supervised segmentation losses based on graph cuts are proposed to solve this problem. Specifically, we take the objective function of the classical graph cut algorithm as the loss function of deep learning and integrate it into the back gradient propagation to update the parameters of network. Follow this route, typical region-based losses, such as IoU loss and Dice loss, could also be extended to weakly supervised versions in this work. Besides, considering the computational complexity of the pixel level graph cut algorithm, we use SLIC algorithm to extract superpixels as the vertices of the graph involved in our loss function. In the experiments, the network based on the proposed graph cut loss achieves good performance in VOC2012 dataset, which proves the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract     = {The complexity of real-world time series makes to hardly yield the desired prediction performance by the existing individual models. A series hybrid model that relies on decomposing time series and then sequentially modeling patterns have been frequently adopted in this domain. Nevertheless, a lack of capturing all existing patterns, including all mixed and pure ones, may lead to a decrease in the performance of series hybrid models. Thus, this study aims to propose a novel parallel hybrid model to achieve a comprehensive hybrid framework in which all pure and mixed linear and/or nonlinear patterns in real-world time series can be appropriately modeled. Based on the data generation process, four modeling procedures, including pure linear and nonlinear, linear-nonlinear, and nonlinear-linear modeling structures, can be considered in data. Therefore, this study proposed a hybrid system contains five main parts (1) linear modeling using ARIMA model, (2) nonlinear modeling using MLPNN model, (3) linear-nonlinear sequential modeling using series ARIMA-MLPNN hybrid model, (4) nonlinear-linear sequential modeling using series MLPNN- ARIMA hybrid model and (5) integrating the four obtained forecasts employing a parallel hybridization. Three real-world data sets from the international stock market namely closing of the DAX index, the closing of the Nikkei 225 index (N225), and the opening of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index are utilized to demonstrate the performance of the proposed hybrid model. The proposed hybrid model outperforms ARIMA, MLPNN, RBFNN, LSTM individual models as well as ARIMA-MLPNN, MLPNN-ARIMA series hybrid models, and parallel hybridization of ARIMA and MLP models.},

Given that these models have different architectures, it is difficult to comparatively evaluate the effectiveness of different similarity score functions. In this paper, we proposed a baseline model that captures the common components of recurrent neural network-based Question Answering (QA) systems found in the literature. By isolating the attention function, this baseline model allows us to study the effects of different similarity score functions on the performance of such systems. Experimental results show that a trilinear function produced the best results among the commonly used functions. Based on these insights, a new T-trilinear similarity function is proposed which achieved the higher predictive EM and F1 scores than these existing functions.

We used two feature extraction techniques to extract the features from data: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Bag-of-Words (BoW). In the study, we used six machine learning models to analyze whether these job ads are fraudulent or legitimate. Then, we compared all models with both BoW and TF-IDF features to analyze the classifier’s overall performance. One of the challenges in this study is our used dataset. The ratio of real and fake job posts samples is unequal, which caused the model over-fitting on majority class data. To overcome this limitation, we used the adaptive synthetic sampling approach (ADASYN), which help to balance the ratio between target classes by generating the number of sample for minority class artificially. We performed two experiments, one with the balanced dataset and the other with the imbalanced data. Through experimental analysis, ETC achieved 99.9% accuracy by using ADASYN as over-sampling ad TF-IDF as feature extraction. Further, this study also performs an in-depth comparative analysis of our proposed approach with state-of-the-art deep learning models and other re-sampling techniques.},

  abstract     = {The time-varying linear equations resolved by the Zeroing neural network (ZNN) models play very important roles in many areas. The traditional ZNN can only achieve the simple finite-time convergence problem, which makes ZNN very easy to be disturbed in the noisy environment. Since the initial state of ZNN is unknown, the finite time convergence depends on its initial state, so the ZNN models activated by the traditional nonlinear activations cannot deal with the different noise interference. To solve the above problems, a novel Power plus Sign activation function (PpSAF) is designed to activate the ZNN model. The predefined-time robust ZNN (PTR-ZNN) model activated by the simple and special nonlinear PpSAF is used to solve the time-variant linear system equations. Through theoretical analysis and simulation comparison of the system expected convergence time and noise tolerance performance, the numerical experiments present that the PTR-ZNN model possesses the predefined-time convergence and strong noise-tolerance performance, and also prove its superiority in solving time-varying linear system equations.},

They are always the basis for supporting location-based applications such as navigation systems, recommendation systems and so on. And these applications always rely on the accurate POIs classification. In this paper, a novel classification method based on weighted quadratic surface support vector machine (WQSSVM) is proposed to classify Chinese POIs from different websites. We first utilize the large number of Chinese POIs to build sparse feature vectors. Then, a weight function is designed to calculate the relative importance of each sample, which is the input to the WQSSVM model. Finally, the proposed WQSSVM model is trained to obtain a suitable classifier supporting by a small proportion of the high-quality samples, and classify the rest large portion of POIs automatically. The WQSSVM model avoids the disadvantages induced by the kernel functions used in classic support vector machine models with kernels. The numerical results on thirteen real-life Chinese POIs datasets indicate that the WQSSVM model not only outperforms the QSSVM model due to the designed weight function but also outperforms other state-of-the-art text classification models in terms of classification accuracy.},

We aimed to identify the best combination of machine learning algorithms and body regions to attach one wearable for real-time falls detection from a public dataset where volunteers performed daily activities and simulated falls. Accuracy and comfort of the combination of wearables and algorithms were assessed. Raw data from the accelerometer and gyroscope were used for both training and testing stages. We evaluated the confusion matrix between all wearables at each of the different body regions (Ankle, Right Pocket, Belt, Neck, and Wrist) for the following machine learning algorithms: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest, XGBoost, and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep neural network. The accuracy was compared by ANOVA two-way repeated measures statistical test. This work has two main technical contributions. First, our results demonstrated the highest accuracy in identifying falls when the sensors were positioned on the neck or ankle. Second, when the machine learning algorithms to detect fall was compared, LSTM deep neural network and Random Forest showed statistically higher accuracy than MLP and XGBoost. Besides, a comfort analysis based on the literature concluded that neck and wrist are the most comfortable regions to wear wearables.},

Therefore, there have been many studies on Bohr almost periodic, Stepanov almost periodic and Weyl almost periodic oscillations of neural networks. Besicovitch almost periodicity is a generalization of the above almost periodicity, but there is no research on Besicovitch almost periodicity of neural networks. In this paper, we study the Besicovitch almost periodic oscillation for a class of fractional-order quaternion-valued neural networks with time-varying delays. Firstly, we give a definition of almost periodic functions in the sense of Besicovitch, which we call $$B^{\mathcal {P}}$$ -almost periodic functions. Then we introduce and prove some properties of these functions. Since the space composed of these functions is incomplete, we construct a suitable Banach space, and use the contraction fixed point theorem to obtain the existence and uniqueness of $$B^{\mathcal {P}}$$ -almost periodic solutions of the considered neural network. Secondly, we use some inequality techniques to study the finite-time stability of the $$B^{\mathcal {P}}$$ -almost periodic solution. Even when the system we consider degenerates into a real-valued system, our results are new. Finally, we use a numerical example to illustrate the feasibility and validity of our results.},

In general, dental Panoramic images are examined by the dentists to detect the dental materials of the patients. Examining the dental Panoramic images is a time-consuming procedure and necessitates highly skilled dentists. Thus, computer imaging and decision support systems based on machine learning are in demand for dental applications. In this study, a semi-automatic, image processing and machine learning based approach is proposed for detection of dental materials in dental Panoramic images. More specifically, the dental materials namely dental filling, dental bridge and tooth crown are targeted by the proposed approach. Within the approach developed, the dental Panoramic images used as input are initially pre-processed for noise removal and tooth region is determined using a deep learning approach. To this end, a faster Regional Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) method is employed. A tooth region correction procedure is applied after application of faster RCNN to determine the exact location of the tooth region as faster RCNN may produce more tooth regions than one correct tooth region. Graph cut (GC) based image segmentation is applied to segment the tooth region into foreground and background regions. Shape based feature extraction and classification are applied to determine the tooth problem. A dataset has been established in dental faculty hospital of private dental clinics. The proposed approach is simple yet quite effective. In all classification methods, the average accuracy scores were around 90%.},

One of the most extensively used strategies for big data classification is MapReduce, which combines the map and reduce processes. For filtering and sorting, the mapping approach is employed, and the reduction technique is used to combine the final classification results. A novel Archerfish Hunter Spotted Hyena Optimization-based Improved Extreme Learning Machine (AHSHO-IELM) classifier-based MapReduce framework is proposed in this paper for big data classification. The IELM algorithm is formed by integrating the ELM technique with Principal Component Analysis to overcome the multicollinear problem and enhance the training and testing time. The AHSHO method combines the archerfish hunter optimization and Spotted Hyena Optimization algorithms to improve the optimal parameter selection of the IELM classifier, which increases classification accuracy and reduces the error rate. The performance of the proposed AHSHO-IELM classifier-based MapReduce framework is evaluated using different performance metrics such as Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Computational time, F1-Score, Mathews correlation coefficient, and scale-up factor. For the rotten tomatoes movie review dataset and the Dermatology dataset, the proposed approach yields accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity values of 99%, 99%, 98.3%, and 99.3%, 99%, 98%, respectively for a mapper value (X) of 5.

  abstract     = {Clinical diagnosis of keratitis highly depends on the observation of medical images. Since there are many classifications of keratitis, and the pathogenic factors are different, ophthalmologists will be more demanding. In this paper, a multi-task recognition method is proposed for the automatic diagnosis of keratitis. The diagnosis basis of keratitis is obtained, and the image of the anterior segment is interpreted. Under the guidance of ophthalmologists, all anterior segment images are labeled from five signs, consisting of opacity area in the cornea (turbid and clear), boundary of the focus (distinct and vague), epithelium of the focus area (intact and incomplete), hyperemia (congestive and healthy), and neovascularization (yes and no), which are important in the diagnosis of keratitis. A multi-label image dataset is constructed, and the images are enhanced by horizontal flipping according to the image characteristics. In this paper, an improved multi-attribute network based on ResNet50 is proposed, including a feature extraction module and a classification module. The feature extraction module is to extract image features, and the classification module is a multi-output network in which each channel corresponds to each attribute. In order to improve the overall recognition accuracy of multi-task, the loss function is optimized. In the loss function, the loss weights of different tasks are determined based on the classification difficulty. A joint training approach is used to train the multi-attribute network which can simultaneously recognize the five attributes and obtain the specific symptoms of keratitis. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of these five attributes can be achieved 84.89% in the multi-attribute network, among which the highest accuracy can be achieved 89.51%.},

  abstract     = {Multi-oriented objects widely appear in scene texts and optical remote sensing images, and thus rotation detection has received considerable attention. However, we observe that few arbitrary-oriented ship detection methods for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images have been proposed before. The main reasons are the essential difference between SAR images and optical remote sensing images and the lack of labeled data for training rotation detectors. In addition, there also exist these problems of arbitrary orientation, large aspect ratio, and dense arrangement in SAR ship detection task. To address these above issues, an arbitrary-oriented ship detection method named FSFADet based on feature separation and feature alignment is proposed. Considering the lack of labeled SAR images, we establish a new SAR ship rotation detection dataset named SSRDD dataset, which is an important task when using arbitrary-oriented ship detection approaches for SAR data. A feature separation module (FS-Module) is introduced to enhance the ship object feature and weaken the background noise. Meanwhile, a refined network (R-Network) and a feature alignment module (FA-Module) are introduced to boost the SAR ship detection performance. Finally, the IoU-smooth L1 loss is introduced to the loss function to address the boundary problem. The simulation experiments show that the proposed method is superior to other arbitrary-oriented object detection methods.},

Firstly, we build a fractional disease transmission network model based on the Caputo fractional derivative, and fix one type of time delay and use another one as the bifurcation parameter to get criterions of stability and Hopf bifurcation. Then, numerical fitting obtains clear stable region and bifurcation boundary curve, and Hopf bifurcation occurs at the equilibrium when select time delay parameter pairs are in the area through the bifurcation boundary curve. Finally, some numerical examples verify the effectiveness of theories. In addition, simulation examples of regular lattices show that the new model covers the extreme conditions of regula and random networks, and it presents more flexible internal nonlinear interactions than previous models.},

  abstract     = {The automatic segmentation of lesions from brain MR images is critical in diagnosing and treating diseases of the brain. Compared with laborious and time-consuming manual segmentation, computer-aided segmentation provides more efficient and reliable predictions. Recently, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks were proposed to show state-of-the-art performance. Training a Deep Convolutional Neural Network demands a large amount of labeled data from experts. However, limited by poor spatial resolution, low contrast, etc., identifying lesion boundaries is difficult with ambiguity, such difficult-to-segment regions pose difficulty and variation in training a segmentation model. In this paper, we present a novel teacher–student framework. A teacher model based on Bayesian Neural Network is used to identify these regions and quantify the degree of difficulty, and a dynamically weighted training loss is applied on the student model according to such difficulty. The experimental results on the BRATS 15 dataset and SPES 2015 dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.},

Multi-modal sentiment detection can more effectively predict the emotional tendencies expressed by users. Therefore, multi-modal sentiment detection has received extensive attention in recent years. Current works consider utterances from videos as independent modal, ignoring the effective interaction among diffence modalities of a video. To tackle these challenges, we propose transformer-based interactive multi-modal attention network to investigate multi-modal paired attention between multiple modalities and utterances for video sentiment detection. Specifically, we first take a series of utterances as input and use three separate transformer encoders to capture the utterances-level features of each modality. Subsequently, we introduced multimodal paired attention mechanisms to learn the cross-modality information between multiple modalities and utterances. Finally, we inject the cross-modality information into the multi-headed self-attention layer for making final emotion and sentiment classification. Our solutions outperform baseline models on three multi-modal datasets.},

At first, a new $$\mu $$ -stability is defined, then based on impulsive control theory, a criterion of $$\mu $$ -stability for impulsively controlled system is set up.

  abstract     = {We proposed a new multi-view gait recognition model based on the generative adversarial network (GAN). Gait recognition has great advantages in long-distance human body recognition, but it is also very challenging. The appearance-based recognition method performs gait recognition based on the outer contour of the human body, but the appearance may change due to factors such as clothing and carrying objects. The method based on view transformation is recognized by converting the gait image to a 90° normal state. However, with the increase of the gait viewing angle difference, a larger transformation error will be produced, which will result in the loss of gait features, and a good recognition effect will not be achieved. In this paper, a GAN was used to convert the gait image of any states and views to the normal state of 54°, 90°, 126°, and realized the gait recognition based on the extracted invariant features. In order to reduce the loss of characteristic information during the view transformation, this paper introduced a residual structure in the network, which could retain more identity information while realizing the view transformation. Finally, the fusion model was used to fuse the recognition results of the three views in the recognition and decision-making stage. In order to verify the effectiveness of the model in this paper, we used the CASIA-B gait dataset to evaluate the performance of the model. The experimental results showed that the model in this paper had achieved a good recognition effect in the sequence of bag and coat. Compared with advanced networks such as SPAE, GaitGANV1 and GaitGANv2, the performance of this model was better, and it was more robust to changes in viewing and clothing.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the proliferation of networked computing devices in the public, commercial, and private sectors. These devices often demand real-time computational resources, which are rather challenging to provide by the conventional cloud computing paradigm. In this regard, the emerging fog computing subtly solves this problem by providing more agile access to local storage and computational resources. Fog computing is a novel computational paradigm that provides resources in the proximity of IoT devices in such a way that all fog cells are located at the edge of the network. Although the theoretical foundations of fog computing have already been established, the problem of services placement for mapping IoT applications to fog cells aiming at maximizing the utilization of fog resources and improving Quality of Service (QoS) is still challenging. In order to fill this gap, we have developed a conceptual computing framework based on combination of cloud-fog by introducing the cloud-fog control middleware that manages service requests to meet some constraints. In this framework, the fog service placement problem is modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem that considers the heterogeneity of resources and applications based on QoS requirements. Finally, we propose an evolutionary algorithm based on the cuckoo search to solve the problem. The simulation results show that the proposed approach provides better performance compared to its counterparts in terms of various metrics such as fog utilization, energy consumption, number of performed services, response time, and service delay.},

Many applications have required a robust mechanism for segmentation, such as self-driving, augmentative reality, object recognition, etc. Due to the high applicability in the various domains, In this paper, we have introduced a two-step frame-work that parses the image into predefined labels by using a novel CNN architecture and improving the likelihood of labels. In step-1, nine-layer CNN architecture has been introduced, which trains on minimal training samples and results in the pixel-wise Soft-Max probabilities. These probabilities are the soft estimates derived from a hard classifier, i.e., MLP. Data in step-1 has been prepared in the form of a patch-label set. In step-2, we have introduced a Jacobian optimization-based label relaxation method that fuses the local extrema as an edge prior. The proposed frame-work has been denoted as CNN-EFF in this work. The CNN-EFF scheme has been evaluated two publicly available benchmark data-sets, which has arranged in the form of image and their pixel label ground-truth. The experimental results have been compared with the previously proposed state-of-the-art methods. The CNN-EFF has greatly improved semantic labeling accuracy up to a significant gain from the past techniques. The CNN-EFF process has reported 84.42%, 85.91%, 94.66%, 97.14%, and 98.27% accuracy for the Highway, House, sheep, Horse-rider, and Horse-keeper images, respectively.

Iteratively conducting back-translation can further improve the performance of the translation model. In back-translation where, pseudo sentence pairs are generated to train the translation systems with a reconstruction loss, but all the pseudo sentence pairs are not of good quality, which can severely impact the performance of neural machine translation systems. This paper proposes an approach to unsupervised learning for neural machine translation with weighted back translation as part of the training process, as it provides more weight to good pseudo-parallel sentence pairs. The weight is calculated as the round-trip semantic similarity score for each pseudo-parallel sentence. We overcome the limitation of earlier lexical metric-based approaches, especially in the case of morphologically rich languages. Experimental results show an improvement of up to around 0.7% BLEU score over the baseline paper for morphologically rich language (English–Hindi, English–Tamil, and English–Telugu) and 0.3% BLEU score for low resource Hindi-Kangri language.},

  abstract     = {Processing big data streams through machine learning algorithms has various challenges, such as little time to train the models, hardware memory constraints, and concept drift. In this paper, we show that prototype-based kernel classifiers designed by sparsification procedures, such as the approximate linear dependence (ALD) method, provides an adequate tradeoff between accuracy and size complexity of kernelized nearest neighbor classifiers. The proposed approach automatically selects relevant samples from the training data stream to form a sparse dictionary of prototypes, which are then used in kernelized distance metrics to classify arriving samples on the fly. Additionally, the proposed method is fully adaptive, in the sense that it updates and removes prototypes from the dictionary, enabling it to learn continuously in nonstationary environments. The results obtained from a comprehensive set of computer simulations involving artificial and real streaming data sets indicate that the proposed algorithm can build models with low complexity and competitive classification error rates compared to state of the art.},

  abstract     = {A classic method for human pose estimation is to generate a heatmap centered on each keypoint location as a kind of small-region representation for supervised learning. The networks of such a method need to learn multi-scale feature maps and global context information under different receptive fields. For human pose estimation, a larger receptive field could learn more human body structure information, which contains more global and higher semantic features, and learn more long-distance keypoint connection features. However, as a local operation, convolution has defects in capturing the global relationship, and it is difficult to consider the surrounding pixel information fully. Furthermore, the resolution of detected results for small-region representation is generally very low, which limits the accuracy of keypoint detection. In this paper, we propose a switchable convolution operation that can adaptively select a larger receptive field, and obtain richer global context information. In addition, we utilize a dual attention unit to reconstruct the feature map to enhance gainful features and further enhance the structural information between human body parts in the heatmap. Experiments on the COCO and MPII datasets prove that our method can effectively improve the performance for human pose estimation.},

A suitable Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional and a new bounding technique can derive delay-dependent results to achieve an extended dissipative performance index. Jensen’s inequality, reciprocally convex combination, and a novel integral inequality technique are utilized in this paper. The proposed criteria are reliable since many components are included in the unified neural network model, Markovian jumping, and time-varying delay with asynchronous modes. In this work, the systemic and time-varying delay modes are expressed asynchronously, which means that they depend on different jumping modes.

  abstract     = {Denial of Service (DoS) attack blocks the transmission of the power system measurements by the interference, which greatly degrades the performance of power system state estimation performance. In order to reduce the impact of DoS attacks on estimated performance, it is necessary to compensate for lost measurements. In this paper, a hybrid compensation model based on deep neural networks is proposed for power system state estimation under DoS attacks. In this compensation model, the advantages of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long-Short Term Memory Neural Networks (LSTM) are respectively utilized in the automatic feature extraction and long-term prediction of measurements. The spatio features of the measurements are fully figured out by squeeze-and-excitation blocks in the CNN, which enables the characteristic response of the input channel can be adaptively adjusted. Moreover, an autoregressive is applied for dealing with the problem of the scale insensitivity of neural network models. The proposed model is validated in a Cubature Kalman Filtering (CKF) state estimation algorithm on the IEEE-30 and IEEE-118 bus test systems. Simulation results illustrate that the CKF algorithm with the proposed model withstands the DoS attacks and performs a higher estimation accuracy than that with the LSTM, CNN, and the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).},

  abstract     = {Detecting human speech is foundational for a wide range of emerging intelligent applications. However, accurately detecting human speech is challenging, especially in the presence of unknown noise patterns. Generally, deep learning-based methods have shown to be more robust and accurate than statistical methods and other existing approaches. However, typically creating a noise-robust and more generalized deep learning-based voice activity detection system requires the collection of an enormous amount of annotated audio data. In this work, we develop a generalized model trained on limited types of human speeches with noisy backgrounds. Yet, it can detect human speech in the presence of various unseen noise types, which were not present in the training set. To achieve this, we propose a one-class residual connections-based variational autoencoder (ORVAE), which only requires a limited number of human speech data with noisy background for training, thereby eliminating the need for collecting data with diverse noise patterns. Evaluating ORVAE with three different datasets (synthesized TIMIT and NOISEX-92, synthesized LibriSpeech and NOISEX-92, and a Publicly Recorded dataset), our method outperforms other one-class baseline methods, achieving $$F_1$$ -scores of over $$90\%$$ for multiple signal-to-noise ratio levels.},

  abstract     = {Hysteresis phenomena have been observed in different branches of physics and engineering sciences. Therefore several models have been proposed for hysteresis simulation in different fields; however, almost neither can be utilized universally. This paper introduces a universal adaptive model by inspiring Preisach Neural Network, called the Extended Preisach Neural Network Model (EPNN). It enjoys two hidden layers. The first hidden layer incorporates Deteriorating Stop (DS) neurons, which their activation function follows the (DS) operator. (DS) operator can generate noncongruent hysteresis loops. The second hidden layer includes Sigmoidal neurons. Adding the second hidden layer helps the neural network learn non-Masing and asymmetric hysteresis loops very smoothly. At the input layer, besides x(t), which is input data, $${\dot{x}}(t)$$ , the rate at which x(t) changes, is included as well in order to give (EPNN) the capability of learning rate-dependent hysteresis loops. Hence, the proposed approach has the capability of simulation of both rate-independent and rate-dependent hysteresis with either congruent or noncongruent loops and symmetric and asymmetric loops. A new hybridized algorithm has been adopted for training the (EPNN), which is based on a combination of GA and the optimization method of sub-gradient with space dilatation. The generality of the proposed model has been evaluated by applying it to various hystereses from different areas of engineering with different characteristics. The results show that the model is successful in the identification of the considered hystereses. Furthermore, the proposed neural network shows excellent agreement with experimental data.},

Thus, finding a solution for the accurate recognition of objection for the autonomous system is motivated among researchers. In this sense, various techniques have been designed with the support of classifiers and machine learning techniques. But those techniques lack their performance in the case of Multiview object recognition. It is found that a single classifier or machine learning algorithm is not enough to recognize Multiview objects accurately. In this paper, a Wrap Convolutional Neural Network (Wrap-CNN) with a voting scheme is proposed to solve the Multiview object recognition problem and attain better recognition accuracy. The proposed model consists of three phases such as pre-processing, pre-training CNNs and voting schemes. The pre-processing phase is done to remove the unwanted noise. These pre-trained CNN models are used as feature extractors and classify the images into their respective classes. Here, the Wrap-CNN, nine pre-trained CNN are used in parallels, such as Alex Net, VGGNet, GoogLeNet, Inceptionv3, SqueezeNet, ResNet v2, Xception, MobileNetV2 and ShuffleNet. Finally, the output class from the nine predicted classes is chosen based voting scheme. The system was tested in two scenarios, such as images without rotation and with rotation. The overall accuracy is 99% and 93% for without rotation and with rotation recognition, respectively. Ultimately the system proves the effectiveness for the Multiview object recognition, which can be used for the industrial automation system.},

Existing VQA models focus on constructing a new attention mechanism, which makes the model increasingly complex.

Therefore, a Graph Attention Network Relational Reasoning (GAT2R) model is proposed in this paper, which mainly includes scene graph generation and scene graph answer prediction. The scene map generation module mainly extracts the regional and spatial features of objects through the object detection model, and uses the relation decoder to predict the relations between object pairs. The scene graph answer prediction dynamically updates the node representation through the question-guided graph attention network, then performs multi-modal fusion with the question features, the answer is obtained finally. The experimental result shows that the accuracy of the proposed model is 54.45% on the natural scene dataset GQA, which is mainly based on relational reasoning. The experimental result is 68.04% on the widely used VQA2.0 dataset. Compared with the benchmark model, the accuracy of the proposed model is increased by 4.71% and 2.37% on GQA and VQA2.0 respectively, which proves the effectiveness and generalization of the model.},

  abstract     = {As the vital operation information of unmanned surface vehicles, the positioning data are usually measured with GPS/INS (Global Position System/Inertial Navigation System) which faces measurement loss and calculation failure during GPS outages in a complex environment. A continuous positioning method is proposed based on an improved neural network with the available sensor data. Firstly, the continuous positioning framework is built to synthesize the traditional GPS/INS coupling mode with the novel estimation method of the improved neural network. Secondly, a reconstructed model of the recurrent auto-regressive neural network is proposed with dual-loop structures, which can excavate the time-series features and the nonlinear relation in multiple sensor measurements. Thirdly, the continuous inertial positioning algorithm is designed based on the novel network, in which the alignment of measurement data is studied to form the augmented inputs. Finally, different experiments are designed and conducted to verify the method, including the outage performance, estimation duration, and model comparison. The results show that positioning estimation precision is relatively high, and the estimation duration reaches an acceptable degree. The proposed method is feasible and effective for positioning in GPS outages.},

However, unsupervised methods rely on the assumption that there are no outliers within the dataset or that the outliers are sporadically distributed, thus leading to unsatisfactory detection accuracy within large-scale, high-dimensional datasets, especially image datasets. In view of this, the present study proposes a novel outlier detection method, called Active Autoencoder (AAE), which can be used to break through the bottleneck of unsupervised learning. AAE improves the performance of autoencoder through use of influence-based active learning in combination with a novel way to change sample weights by expansion-shrinkage operator.

  abstract     = {Large scale labeled samples are expensive and difficult to obtain, hence few-shot learning (FSL), only needing a small number of labeled samples, is a dedicated technology. Recently, the graph-based FSL approaches have attracted lots of attention. It is helpful to model pair-wise relations among samples according to the similarity of features. However, the data in the reality usually have high-order relations, which can not be modeled by the traditional graph-based methods. To address this challenge, we introduce hypergraph structure and propose the Dual-Modal Hypergraph Few-Shot Learning (DMH-FSL) method to model the relations from different perspectives to model the high-order relations between samples. Specifically, we construct a dual-modal (e.g., feature-modal and label-modal) hypergraph, the feature-modal hypergraph construct incidence matrix with samples’ features and the label-modal hypergraph construct incidence matrix with samples’ labels. In addition, we employ two hypergraph convolution methods to perform flexible aggregation of samples from different modals. The proposed DMH-FSL method is easy to extend to other graph-based methods. We demonstrate the efficiency of our DMH-FSL method on three benchmark datasets. Our algorithm has at least an increase of 2.62% in Stanford40(from 72.20 to 74.82%), 0.85% in mini-ImageNet(from 50.33 to 51.18%) and 1.61% in USE-PPMI(from 78.77 to 80.38%) in few-shot learning experiments. What’s more, the cross-domain experimental results evaluate our method’s adaptability in real-world applications to some extent.},

  abstract     = {We recently proposed the S4NN algorithm, essentially an adaptation of backpropagation to multilayer spiking neural networks that use simple non-leaky integrate-and-fire neurons and a form of temporal coding known as time-to-first-spike coding. With this coding scheme, neurons fire at most once per stimulus, but the firing order carries information. Here, we introduce BS4NN, a modification of S4NN in which the synaptic weights are constrained to be binary ( $$+$$ 1 or − 1), in order to decrease memory (ideally, one bit per synapse) and computation footprints. This was done using two sets of weights: firstly, real-valued weights, updated by gradient descent, and used in the backward pass of backpropagation, and secondly, their signs, used in the forward pass. Similar strategies have been used to train (non-spiking) binarized neural networks. The main difference is that BS4NN operates in the time domain: spikes are propagated sequentially, and different neurons may reach their threshold at different times, which increases computational power. We validated BS4NN on two popular benchmarks, MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, and obtained reasonable accuracies for this sort of network (97.0% and 87.3% respectively) with a negligible accuracy drop with respect to real-valued weights (0.4% and 0.7%, respectively). We also demonstrated that BS4NN outperforms a simple BNN with the same architectures on those two datasets (by 0.2% and 0.9% respectively), presumably because it leverages the temporal dimension.},

The semi-global fixed-time stability of the resulting closed-loop system is theoretically proved.

The developed DSRNN includes learnable skip-connections across a specified number of time-steps, which allows for a state-space representation of the network’s hidden-state trajectory, and a regularization term is introduced in the loss function in the setting of Lyapunov stability theory. The regularizer enables the placement of eigenvalues of the (linearized) transfer function matrix to desired locations in the complex plane, thereby acting as an internal controller for the hidden-state trajectories. In this way, the DSRNN adjusts the weights of temporal skip-connections to achieve recurrent hidden-state stability, which mitigates the problems of vanishing and exploding gradients. The efficacy of the DSRNN is demonstrated on a forecasting task of a recorded double-pendulum experimental model. The results show that the DSRNN outperforms both the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and vanilla recurrent neural networks, and the relative mean-squared error of the LSTM is reduced by up to $$\sim $$ 99.64%. The DSRNN also showed comparable results to the LSTM on a classification task of two Lorenz oscillator systems.},

  abstract     = {An effective financial distress prediction model is essential, as financial distress of listed companies will cause big problems for listed company owners, shareholders, banks, and regulators. Due to the special circumstances of China, Chinese listed companies that received the ‘special treatment’ label are considered to be in financial distress in this paper. We construct a relatively new and complete financial distress data set of Chinese listed companies from 2014 to 2019. Their 14 financial indicators of year $$t-2$$ are used to predict whether they will receive the ST label in year t. When building the prediction model, we first propose GA-MLP algorithm in which the Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) is optimized using Genetic Algorithm (GA) which could automatically determine the parameter values and the number of neurons in each hidden layer at the same time, and then a novel diversity-considered GA-MLP ensemble algorithm (DGAMLPE) is proposed to improve the performance. We objectively test the proposed algorithms on the constructed financial distress data set and five other datasets, and compare them with other 7 algorithms in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and AUC. Experimental results show that DGAMLPE performs very well on the financial distress data set, and it outperform other tested algorithms for the data set tested.},

  abstract     = {Scene flow estimation is one of the most crucial components of many scene understanding tasks, which represents the complete 3D motion of objects in dynamic scene. Most of existing scene flow estimation approaches are usually based on joint learning framework, which cast the problem of scene flow estimation to dense prediction of optical flow and stereo matching. However, these approaches need to reconstruct 3D motion from optical flow and disparity using 2D stereo image pairs, which leads the estimation process to be indirect. Recently, FlowNet3D attempts to learn scene flow from 3D point clouds, which adopts element-wise max-pooling to aggregate features from different points. Nevertheless, max-pooling operation only can obtain the strongest activation on features across a local or global region, which may increase the loss of some useful detailed and contextual. Specifically, for dense estimation task, the ability to transfer information gradually from coarse to fine layers is important. To address this problem, we investigate a new deep architecture, 3D point convolutional network, to learn scene flow from 3D point clouds. This specific architecture uses multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to approximate the weight function and applies a density scale to re-weight the learned weight functions for each convolutional filter, which can make the network permutation-invariant and translation invariant on 3D space which is beneficial for feature aggregation. Extensive experimental results are conducted on FlyingThings3D and KITTI scene flow datasets and show the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Our algorithm can achieve state-of-the-art performance on FlyingThings3D and KITTI datasets.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, emotional neural networks (ENNs) have been extensively used in the field of time series prediction. As a variant of ENN, the radial basis emotional neural network (RBENN) is chosen as the prediction model of time series in this paper, because it has a special type of structure that can preprocess the interference in the data. However, it is difficult for many existing methods to determine network structure automatically while adjusting network parameters. To solve this problem, an RBENN based on adaptive inertia weight comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization algorithm (ADw-CLPSO-RBENN) is designed. Firstly, an adaptive inertia weight adjustment strategy based on the CLPSO algorithm (ADw-CLPSO) is exploited to balance the global and local search ability of particles. Secondly, a particle-variable dimensional learning mechanism (PVDLM) is developed based on the ADw-CLPSO algorithm, which enables particles to find the appropriate network structure while searching for the optimal parameter solution. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated in two time series and a real wastewater treatment system. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ADw-CLPSO-RBENN can automatically adjust to a suitable network structure, and the prediction accuracy is also better than other methods. Therefore, the proposed method has higher superiority in time series prediction.},

  abstract     = {Usually the real-world (RW) datasets are imbalanced in nature, i.e., there is a significant difference between the number of negative and positive class samples in the datasets. Because of this, most of the conventional classifiers do not perform well on RW data classification problems. To handle the class imbalanced problems in RW datasets, this paper presents a novel density-weighted twin support vector machine (DWTWSVM) for binary class imbalance learning (CIL). Further, to boost the computational speed of DWTWSVM, a density-weighted least squares twin support vector machine (DWLSTSVM) is also proposed for solving the CIL problem, where, the optimization problem is solved by simply considering the equality constraints and by considering the 2-norm of slack variables. The key ideas behind the models are that during the model training phase, the training data points are given weights based on their importance, i.e., the majority class samples are given more importance compared to the minority class samples. Simulations are carried on a synthetic imbalanced and some real-world imbalanced datasets. The model performance in terms of F1-score, G-mean, recall and precision of the proposed DWTWSVM and DWLSTSVM are compared with support vector machine (SVM), twin SVM (TWSVM), least squares TWSVM (LSTWSVM), fuzzy TWSVM (FTWSVM), improved fuzzy least squares TWSVM (IFLSTWSVM) and density-weighted SVM for binary CIL. Finally, a statistical study is carried out based on F1-score and G-mean on RW datasets to verify the efficacy and usability of the suggested models.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural network (CNN) have been widely used in speech recognition, object detection and image recognition. In the process of inference, data access operations consume more energy than calculations. Therefore, optimizing the dataflow from external storage to the on-chip processing unit is an effective method to reduce the power consumption. The state-of-the-art row stationary dataflow maximizes the data reusing to reduce the number of data movement and thus reducing the power consumption of the system. However, it has the problems of low processing unit utilization and poor scalability. In this letter, we propose an enhance row stationary (ERS) dataflow. ERS dataflow maps the data of each channel of the three-dimensional filter and input feature map (ifmap) into a column of processing units by changing the mapping of data. The processing array operates multiple filters in parallel, which effectively improves the utilization of computing resources. Within each processing unit, one row of filter data and one row of ifmap data are processed at a time, and the filter row data and ifmap row data are reused in multiple convolution operations. In addition, a configurable sliding window model is proposed to solve the problem that the existing dataflow cannot handle the calculation array width smaller than the filter width. Simulation results show that for AlexNet and VGG16, the execution speed of ERS dataflow is improved by about 60% compared with row stationary dataflow, and the hardware resource utilization is improved by about 30%. For the MobileNet V1, the execution speed of ERS dataflow is improved by about 4% compared with the row stationary dataflow.},

  abstract     = {Spiking neural network (SNN) is one of the most successful methods to imitate biological brain behavior and learning potential. The information processing mechanism of SNN combines the concepts of time and space. To address the performance dropping problem during the conversion process from the artificial neural network (ANN) to SNN, this paper proposes a proportional attenuation leaky integrate-and-fire (RA-LIF) neuron model to solve the problem of membrane potential loss caused by leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons. The accuracy of the SNN network based on RA-LIF neurons on MNIST is 98.76%. This paper also proposes a weight normalization method to help adjust the network spiking rate to reduce the loss. We evaluate and analyze the performance of SNN networks based on LIF, RA-LIF, and AD-LIF. By analyzing the spike firing rate and convergence rate, the effects of spike frequency and neuron threshold on the performance of the network are discussed. So far, the SNN transformed by ANN can only achieve worse or similar performance compared with the original network. For the first time, the performance of the SNN transformed by the proposed RA-LIF neuron model and weight normalization method is better than the original network, which shows the test accuracy of 98.88% on MNIST. The SNN obtained by converting the LeNet network using the above method achieves a test accuracy of 98.91% on MNIST. In conclusion, the RA-LIF neuron model and normalization method proposed in this paper have promising applicability. Moreover, this method has the characteristics of high precision and fast calculation speed, which can provide a reference for the research of the SNN framework.},

  abstract     = {Redundancy manipulators need favorable redundancy resolution to obtain suitable control actions to guarantee accurate kinematic control. Among numerous kinematic control applications, some specific tasks such as minimally invasive manipulation/surgery require the distal link of a manipulator to translate along such fixed point. Such a point is known as remote center of motion (RCM) to constrain motion planning and kinematic control of manipulators. Recurrent neural network (RNN) which possesses parallel processing ability, is a powerful alternative and has achieved success in conventional redundancy resolution and kinematic control with physical constraints of joint limits. However, up to now, there still is few related works on the RNNs for redundancy resolution and kinematic control of manipulators with RCM constraints considered yet. In this paper, for the first time, an RNN-based approach with a simplified neural network architecture is proposed to solve the redundancy resolution issue with RCM constraints, with a new and general dynamic optimization formulation containing the RCM constraints investigated. Theoretical results analyze and convergence properties of the proposed simplified RNN for redundancy resolution of manipulators with RCM constraints. Simulation results further demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in end-effector path tracking control under RCM constraints based on a redundant manipulator.},

  abstract     = {Despite recent advances in Machine Learning (ML)-based applications for clinical decision making, there is no objective method that can assist physicians in discriminating clinically significant features for predicting the prognosis of hepatitis. To this purpose, an expert-based objective feature engineering (FE) method is required to complement the physician’s subjective multi-criteria decision making and ML-based feature sets. Thus, this study proposes a novel feature selection (FS) method, which blends neighbourhood component analysis (NCA) and ReliefF by averaging their outcomes, coupled with a Lagrangian Support Vector Machine (LSVM) leveraged as an ML-based classifier for decision support to aid a binary classification of prognosis (survival or death) in patients with chronic hepatitis. Using this syncretic FS technique, which integrates the best performing FS methods tested, averaged feature ranks are obtained. Clinical data on 320 patients with hepatitis were obtained from two benchmark datasets from the University of California-Irvine database. The performance of the hybrid algorithms resulting from using statistical- and ML-based FE, both individually and in a syncretic manner, i.e., via a multi-expert ML system, was evaluated and compared. The proposed hybrid classifier NCA-ReliefF-LSVM, using an ML-based syncretic FS, led to the highest classification performance (AUC = 0.97/F1-score = 97.51, and AUC = 0.94/F1-score = 94.57) and the lowest computational cost (1 and 2 epochs, 13 and 11.67 s respectively) amongst all algorithms tested on both benchmark datasets. Thus, this study strongly supports the use of ML-based syncretic FS for predicting survival in individuals affected by hepatitis.},

  abstract     = {Multi-modal semantic trajectory prediction is of great importance for location-based applications. However, predicting trajectory is not trivial facing three challenges: (1) It is difficult to integrate useful information from multi-modal and heterogeneous data in different granularity for effective feature fusion; (2) All kinds of dependencies existing in multi-modal semantic trajectories are closely coupled and dynamically evolved, forming complex dependencies for which are difficult to quantify; (3) During the model training, the distribution of each modal feature shifts in different directions, resulting in the distortion of dependencies, which is accompanied by slow convergence and inaccurate predictions. In this paper, the Complex Dependencies Auto-learning Prediction Model (CDAPM) is proposed to solve these problems. First, the effective and robust representation of each points is obtained by jointly embedding multi-modal information. Then, the dependencies attention module is proposed to calculate the dependencies weight matrix and auto-learn the contribution of each point. Also, it solves the problem of long-term dependency effectively. Position Encoding and LSTM are used to enhance the time relationship of trajectory. Finally, Mode Normalization is designed to maintain prediction accuracy by preventing the distortion of dependencies and significantly accelerate the convergence speed. Experiments on two real data sets show that CDAPM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {With the development of remote sensing technology, hyperspectral sensors can record reflectance of ground objects in hundreds of bands, which undoubtedly brings great benefits for hyperspectral remote sensing image that contains abundant information of the land covers. At present, some hyperspectral images are contaminated by the noise and a lack of spatial information, this phenomenon hinders the improvement of classification accuracy. To further mine the spatial features of hyperspectral image, we propose an effective feature extraction method based on Spectral-Gabor space discriminant analysis (SGDA). The framework of SGDA is roughly divided into four steps: firstly, we obtain $$p_i$$ $$\{p_i|1\le i&lt;d\}$$ principal components by PCA, where d denotes the number of features; secondly, we filter the $$p_i$$ principal components with Gabor filter on five different scales and eight different orientations and obtain Gabor spatial features; thirdly, incorporating the spectral features of original hyperspectral data into the Gabor spatial features to form the Spectral-Gabor space features F; finally, we project the fusion features to a low-dimensional subspace, and then maximize the Spectral-Gabor space between-class scatter matrix ( $$S_b^{SG}$$ ) and minimize the Spectral-Gabor space within-class scatter matrix ( $$S_w^{SG}$$ ) at the same time inspired by the idea of Fisher line discriminant analysis. Also, in the above fusion process, the proportion of spectral and spatial information can be controlled by using a penalty factor $$\alpha $$ . Experimental results on three hyperspectral datasets show the better classification performance of the SGDA method than the state-of-art methods on the condition of small sample size by Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC).},

  abstract     = {Machine Learning (ML) has gained much importance in recent years as many of its effective applications are involved in different fields, healthcare, banking, trading, gaming, etc. Similarly, Combinatorial Optimisation (CO) keeps challenging researchers by new problems with more complex constraints. Merging both fields opens new horizons for development in many areas. This study investigates how effective is to solve CO problems by ML methods. The work considers the Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP) as a study case, which is an np-hard CO problem well-known for its multiple applications. The proposed approach suggests to use solutions of small-size MKP to build models with different ML methods; then, to apply the obtained models on large-size MKP to predict their solutions. The features consist of scores calculated based on information about items while the labels consist of decision variables of optimal solutions calculated from applying CPLEX Solver on small-size MKP. Supervised ML methods build models that help to predict structures of large-size MKP solutions and build them accordingly. A comparison of five ML methods is conducted on standard data set. The experiments showed that the tested methods were able to reach encouraging results. In addition, the study proposes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) that exploits ML outputs essentially in initialisation operator and to repair unfeasible solutions. The algorithm denoted GaPR explores the ML solution neighbourhood as a way of intensification to approach optimal solutions. The carried out experiments indicated that the approach was effective and competitive.},

  abstract     = {Digital steganography, the modern version of the ancient art of data hiding is a prevalent tool for covert communication. Steganalysis, at least as old as steganography comes handy to unearth such hidden channels. The illegal act of information hiding through steganography of digital images can be overcome effectively only by using intelligent steganalytic techniques. In this paper, a novel MixNet framework comprising of six Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is proposed as feature extractors for accomplishing generic steganalysis of spatial content-adaptive algorithms with better detection accuracy. Since the spatial content-adaptive algorithms embed secret bits in the hard to model components of the image like edges or textures, inputs to the CNNs are initially filtered using high pass filters to obtain the embedded content in the form of noise residual. Hierarchical features extracted from these networks are then concatenated and used to train Support Vector Machine classifier. Experimentation is performed using the benchmark BOSSbase v1.01 cover images and stego images are created with three state-of-the-art algorithms HUGO-BD, S-UNIWARD and WOW at five relative payloads 0.1–0.5 bits per pixel (bpp). The experimental results show that the proposed MixNet outperforms the compared related works in literature and proves the robustness of MixNet in detecting content-adaptive steganography.},

For saving bitrates, multiple audio objects are compressed into a mono downmix signal and side information parameters. However, side information parameter frequency resolution is too low to cause aliasing distortion. To overcome this issue, a new encoding scheme based on high parameter frequency resolution (224 sub-bands in a frame) is proposed in this paper. The side information parameters with high frequency resolution are compressed and reconstructed via SSAE (stacked sparse autoencoder) neural network and further used for recovering the audio objects. The performance of the proposed method is compared against existing SAOC (spatial audio object coding) methods at the same overall bitrate, judged by both objective and subjective results. The evaluation shows that our approach can facilitate the high quality of spatial audio objects.},

  abstract     = {SIGNSGD is able to dramatically improve the performance of training large neural networks by transmitting the sign of each minibatch stochastic gradient, which achieves gradient communication compression and keeps standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) level convergence rate. Meanwhile, the learning rate plays a vital role in training neural networks, but existing learning rate optimization strategies mainly face the following problems: (1) for learning rate decay method, small learning rates produced lead to converge slowly, and extra hyper-parameters are required except for the initial learning rate, causing more human participation. (2) Adaptive gradient algorithms have poor generalization performance and also utilize other hyper-parameters. (3) Generating learning rates via two-level optimization models is difficult and time-consuming in training. To this end, we propose a novel adaptive learning rate schedule for neural network training via SIGNSGD optimizer for the first time. In our method, based on the theoretical inspiration that the convergence rate’s upper bound has minimization with the current learning rate in each iteration, the current learning rate can be expressed by a mathematical expression that is merely related to historical learning rates. Then, given an initial value, learning rates in different training stages can be adaptively obtained. Our proposed method has following advantages: (1) it is a novel automatic method without additional hyper-parameters except for one initial value, thus reducing the manual participation. (2) It has faster convergence rate and outperforms the standard SGD. (3) It makes neural networks achieve better performance with fewer gradient communication bits. Three numerical simulations are conducted on different neural networks with three public datasets: MNIST, Cifar-10 and Cifar-100 datasets, and several numerical results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {In recent years the death rate from skin cancer (SC) disease tends to grow enormously. Various studies demonstrated that skin malignancy may rank third as a reason for death for each age gathering, after breast and lung cancer. It becomes necessary to diagnose this skin malignancy at an early stage. The objective of this study was to combine machine learning and soft computing techniques to achieve higher accuracy in the prediction of SC. To play out the exploration work we utilized two datasets, one from “111 Save Life hospital”, Jamshedpur, India, and the other is the UCI repository skin cancer dataset. In this paper, a hybrid technique was utilized that combined the advantages of the fuzzy logic system (FLS) and the genetic algorithm (GA). Classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) were implemented. The modified genetic algorithm (Modified_GA) is used to select the best features which will participate in the fuzzy rules generation process. The modified GA selects the best features along with the calculation of the accuracy of the system based on the selected features. A new rule reduction algorithm (RR_algorithm) is then utilized to reduce the certain number of rules to decrease the complexity of the rule base of the fuzzy system. For the SCC_dataset, the Modified_GA algorithm selects four features with an increased accuracy value of 89.6552%. The RR_algorithm reduces 20 rules from the rule base of the FLS with a constant accuracy value of 98% compared with the FLS with a larger number of rules. For the UCI_dataset, the Modified_GA algorithm selects 19 features with an increased accuracy value of 97.3684%. The selected features were further reduced with the help of sequentialfs() function. Now, the total selected features were 15 with an increased accuracy value of 97.3684% (obtained by the SVM classifier) and 98.6842% (obtained by the NB classifier). Experimental results on the two datasets show that the proposed strategies strikingly improves the forecast precision of skin malignancy.},

To further explore the creative potential of natural language generation systems in Japanese poetry creation, we propose a novel Waka generation model, WakaVT, which automatically produces Waka poems given user-specified keywords. Firstly, an additive mask-based approach is presented to satisfy the form constraint. Secondly, the structures of Transformer and variational autoencoder are integrated to enhance the quality of generated content. Specifically, to obtain novelty and diversity, WakaVT employs a sequence of latent variables, which effectively captures word-level variability in Waka data. To improve linguistic quality in terms of fluency, coherence, and meaningfulness, we further propose the fused multilevel self-attention mechanism, which properly models the hierarchical linguistic structure of Waka. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate Waka generation with models based on Transformer and/or variational autoencoder. Both objective and subjective evaluation results demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines significantly.},

In this paper, we have proposed a VQA model that uses image features which are effective enough to answer questions related to foreground object and background region. Also, we have used graph neural network to encode the relationship between the image regions and objects in an image. Further, we have generated image captions based on these visual relationship based image representation. Thus, the proposed model uses two attention modules to take advantage of each other’s knowledge, to generate more influential attention modules together with the captions based image representation to extract the features which are capable enough to answer questions related to the foreground object and background region. Finally, the performance of proposed architecture is improved by combining the hybrid simulated annealing-Mantaray Foraging Optimization (SA-MRFO) algorithm, which selects the optimal weight parameter for the proposed model. To estimate the performance of the proposed model, two benchmark datasets are used: VQA 2.0 and VQA-CP v2.},

  abstract     = {Raman spectroscopy is often used for the composition determination and rapid classification of materials because it can reflect the molecular information of materials. Its accuracy mainly depends on the performance of the classification algorithm. In addition to classic machine learning classifiers such as support vector machines and k-nearest neighbor, 1D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have also been applied to recognize Raman spectra. However, most of the research on 1D CNNs is still in the shallow, simple structure of the network model, and its application scope is only for the classification of a few classes. Therefore, this paper proposes a spectral data classification model based on a 1D deep CNN for classifying and recognizing hundreds of classes. We used the RRUFF Raman spectrum database containing many mineral samples to construct two sub-datasets, which were used to evaluate the classification effect of the model from different perspectives without data enhancement. The experimental results show that the model has a high recognition accuracy for data sets with hundreds of classes and sufficient samples. Compared with the classic machine learning classification algorithm and the 1D CNN models proposed by other scholars, our model has higher recognition accuracy and better performance and has better applicability to datasets with thousands of classes and imbalanced class distribution.},

Second, NRC is not robust to occluded training samples. To address the above two problems, we propose a competitive NRC with image gradient orientations (IGO-CNRC) for face recognition. Concretely, first we introduce a competitive regularization term into the formulation of NRC and thereby present a competitive NRC (CNRC) method. To further increase the robustness to occluded training samples, we extract multiple-order image gradient orientations (IGOs) of samples and obtain the residuals under the framework of CNRC. Then these residuals are fused by the sum rule and the test sample is classified into the class that yields the least residual. Experimental results on standard face databases document the effectiveness of IGO-CNRC. The MATLAB code of IGO-CNRC is available at https://github.com/yinhefeng/IGO-CNRC},

  abstract     = {Machine learning classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial perturbation, and their presence raises security concerns, especially in recommendation systems. While attacks and defense mechanisms in recommendation systems have received significant attention, Basic Iterative Method (BIM), which has been shown in Computer Vision to increase attack effectiveness by more than 60%, has received little attention in ownership recommendation. As a result, ownership recommender systems may be more sensitive to iterative perturbations, resulting in significant generalization errors. Adversarial Training, a regularization strategy that can withstand worst-case iterative perturbations, could be a viable option for improving model robustness and generalization. In this paper, we implement BIM for ownership recommendations. Through adversarial training, we propose the Adversarial Consumer and Producer Recommendation (ACPR) approach that integrates ownership features into a multi-objective pairwise ranking to capture the user’s preferences. The ACPR method learns a core embedding for each user and two transformation matrices that project the user’s core embedding into two role embeddings (i.e., a producer and consumer role) using an extension of matrix factorization.

The stochastic variable with Bernoulli distribution gives the information of probabilistic time-varying delay and it is transformed into one with deterministic time-varying delay in the stochastic manner. Further, by constructing a novel Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional and utilizing Ito’s and Dynkin’s formula with stochastic analysis theory, the sufficient criterion is derived for the input-to-state stability of stochastic CGBAM neural networks.

For object detection task, one key challenge is that object scale usually varies in a large range, which may make the existing detectors fail in real applications. To address this problem, we propose a novel end-to-end Attention Feature Pyramid Transformer Network framework to learn the object detectors with multi-scale feature maps via a transformer encoder-decoder fashion. AFPN learns to aggregate pyramid feature maps with attention mechanisms. Specifically, transformer-based attention blocks are used to scan through each spatial location of feature maps in the same pyramid layers and update it by aggregating information from deep to shadow layers. Furthermore, inter-level feature aggregation and intra-level information attention are repeated to encode multi-scale and self-attention feature representation. The extensive experiments on challenging MS COCO object detection dataset demonstrate that the proposed AFPN outperforms its baseline methods, i.e., DETR and Faster R-CNN methods, and achieves the state-of-the-art results.},

  abstract     = {Sperm morphology analysis is an important step in the clinical diagnosis of male infertility, which means that the shape of sperm head is an important indicator in sperm morphology analysis. Therefore the accurate and efficient segmentation of human sperm head is essential for accurate and objective analysis of sperm morphology. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient deep learning algorithm for fully automatic segmentation of human sperm head based on the U-Net network structure. First of all, we performed sperm cell image collection and built a new dataset that is suitable for segmentation of human sperm heads in deep learning algorithms. Our dataset consists of 1207 sperm cell images from more than 20 male infertility patients. Then we improved the U-Net architecture by integrating the dilated convolution into it and replaced the long skip layer in the original network with the block we designed, which finally formed our final deep convolutional neural network. We use our dataset to train our proposed network so that we can segment the sperm head. Our algorithm is one of the few methods for segmentation of sperm head using deep learning algorithms. And compared with previous methods, our model not only achieve good results in unstained and low-resolution images containing only individual sperm cells, but also shows excellent performance in complex images containing multiple sperm cells. Our experimental results have confirmed that the HDC (Hybrid Dilated Convolution) module and our designed Block have a noticeable improvement on segmentation results. Meanwhile, we have achieved a high Dice coefficient of 95.14 $$\%$$ . The segmentation results we tested on the prostate dataset prove that our model has good generalization ability and robustness. It is worth noting that our algorithm processed the images showing the original true morphology of the sperm cells and achieved high segmentation accuracy. It’s is very important for doctors to diagnose whether the sperm morphology is abnormal in the clinic.},

In addition, the potential correlation of the user information in different groups and their tweets will also affect the effect of retweet prediction. Considering the above problems, in this article, we propose a novel deep multitask learning-based method, CH-Transformer, for retweet prediction. First, we extract numerical features to represent tweet information features and social features. Then, the numerical features are concatenated with textual features. After feature extraction, we obtain the feature embeddings and feed them into our model to achieve propagation prediction.

To overcome above difficulties, the DHP method is carried out by reinforcement learning utilizing online collected data rather than the accurate system dynamics. First, the performance index and corresponding Bellman equation are acquired. Each agent’s value function has quadratic form. Then, a model network is employed to approximate the accurate system dynamics. The Q-function Bellman equation is obtained next. By taking the derivative of Q-function, the DHP method is applied to construct the update formula. Convergence and stability analysis of proposed algorithm are presented.

First, we formulate semi-supervised ELM as a ratio form, and reformulate it as a generalized eigenvalue problem (called Laplacian generalized eigenvalue extreme learning machine, LapGELM) to solve simply. Then we replace the form of ratio with a form of difference so that the optimization problems can be transformed into a standard eigenvalue problem (called Laplacian standard eigenvalue ELM, LapSELM) to control overfit and solve quickly. Furthermore, the proposed algorithms are implemented on various datasets with different sizes and structures.

Then, two types of centralities are utilized to obtain the significance of DMs, and these centralities are used to derive the group evaluation. Then, a consensus measure is employed to quantify the degree of agreement within the group. To promote further consensus, a novel feedback mechanism that combines the Identification and Direction Rule-based method with an optimization-based approach is developed to achieve maximum consensus improvement in each round of modification.

Neurons at the end of layer have weak connections to the next layer and can be excluded for further application of the network. On the examples of fully-connected and convolutional neural networks with one and multiple hidden layers we show, that proposed method allow us to obtain dependence of network accuracy on the number of neurons in layer after one cycle of training and also performs some regularization.

Finding an efficient VM mapping method is vital in dealing with these challenges. Server consolidation is a well-known NP-hard problem. Moreover, efficient resource mapping and VM migration should consider multiple factors synthetically, including quality of service, energy consumption, resource utilisation, and migration overheads, which are multi-objective optimisation problems. This letter aims to address these issues using a novel bio-inspired mapping algorithm. Also, this letter revisits the existing locust-inspired resource scheduling algorithm employed in cloud data centres with a real workload as well as an analogy and model and presents a novel algorithm. Critical analysis of the locust approach has shown that it opens new opportunities for future research, suggestions for which have been offered. Such analysis ensures the hardware reliability of an algorithm and the algorithm’s quality of performance. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art bio-inspired algorithms. We compared our algorithm with heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms. The experimental results show that compared with these algorithms, our algorithm efficiently reduces performance degradation due to migration (PDM), energy consumption, and the number of migrations along with improving server utilisation.},

  abstract     = {Facial expression is an important aspect to recognize emotions between humans. However, this task remains difficult for machines. Several approaches have been developed aiming at strengthening the machine and endowing it, with the ability to decipher and read people’s emotions from their faces in order to interact more intelligently. In this context, many deep learning (DL) approaches have been applied due to their outstanding recognition Accuracy. Aiming to gain better performance for facial expression recognition (FER) systems, we propose a hybrid DL architecture based on convolutional neural network and Stacked AutoEncoder. The main idea of this work is to combine the two feature vectors generated by each of these architectures and feed the resulting vector to a meaningful neural network. The architecture of the latter leads to learn each feature by dedicating a set of neurons for each component of the vector before combining them all together in the last layer. The publicly available four facial expression Datasets: Japanse Female Facial Expression (JAFFE), Extended Chon-Kanade (CK+), Facial Expression Recognition 2013 (FER2013) and AffectNet, were used during this research for both training and testing. The experimental results of our proposed architecture are comparable to or better than the relevant state-of-the-art methods in term of Accuracy, Recall, Precision and F-measure. We noted that our proposed approach obtains the best accuracy of 98.65% on the CK+, 95.78% on the JAFFE, 63.14% on the AffectNet and 80.02% on the FER2013 Datasets.},

  abstract     = {The pooling layer has achieved good results in reducing the feature dimension and parameters of convolution neural network (CNN), but it will cause different degrees of information loss. In order to retain as much feature information as possible, we design a pooling method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-PCAPool. Firstly, all feature maps are traversed with the pooling window in which the data is extracted and stretched into row vectors. With the sliding of the pooling window, all row vectors are arranged in the matrix to form the sample matrix. Then all eigenvectors are extracted from the sample matrix by PCA algorithm to form the eigenvector matrix, which right multiplies the sample matrix to get the principal component matrix. Thirdly, each column of the principal component matrix is weighted with information coefficient which is determined by training to get the pooling vector. Finally, PCAPool result is obtained by blocks arrangement of pooling vector. PCAPool is tested with CNN-Quick, NIN, WRN-SAM, GP-CNN on datasets MNIST, CIFAR10/100 and SVHN. We also used AlexNet on Imagenet2012 to test PCAPool. The experiment results show that compared with traditional pooling methods, PCAPool could retain information in the pooling window better and improve the image classification accuracy.},

The additive time delay plays an independence and the variation of the delay components with general type of lyapunov functional. The concerned results are dependent on the leakage time varying delay and upper bound of time-varying delays with derivatives. Our aim is to design a distributed state estimator which approximates the genetic states through the measurements of the sensors that is the estimation error system is asymptotically stable. In addition, the key role of this paper is derived by the second-order reciprocally convex approach. Then a genetic state estimator is designed in terms of the solution to a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which can be solved by using available software. Finally, a numerical example is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed genetic state estimation approach.},

Accurate segmentation is crucial in this process that is mostly operated by experts. However, it is time-consuming and labor-intense to segment chromosomes and their overlapping regions. In this research, we look into the automatic segmentation of overlapping pairs of chromosomes. Different from standard semantic segmentation applications that mostly detect object regions or boundaries, this study attempts to predict not only non-overlapping regions but also the order of superposition and opaque regions of the underlying chromosomes. We propose a novel convolutional neural network called Compact Seg-UNet with enhanced deep feature learning capability and training efficacy. To address the issue of unrealistic images in use characterized by overlapping regions of higher color intensities, we propose a novel method to generate more realistic images with opaque overlapping regions. On the segmentation performance of overlapping chromosomes for this new dataset, our Compact Seg-UNet model achieves an average IOU score of 93.44% ± 0.26 which is significantly higher than the result of a simplified U-Net reported by literature by around 6.08%. The corresponding F1 score also increases from $$0.9262\pm 0.1188$$ to $$0.9596 \pm 0.0814$$ .},

  abstract     = {The multi-view algorithm based on graph learning pays attention to the manifold structure of data and shows good performance in clustering task. However, multi-view data usually contains noise, which reduces the robustness of the multi-view clustering algorithm. Besides, any single local information cannot adequately express the whole frame perfectly. Graph learning method often ignores the global structure of data, resulting in suboptimal clustering effect. In order to address the above problems, we propose a novel multi-view clustering model, namely multi-view clustering based on low-rank representation and adaptive graph learning (LRAGL). The noise and outliers in the original data are considered when constructing the graph and the adaptive learning graphs are employed to describe the relationship between samples. Specifically, LRAGL enjoys the following advantages: (1) The graph constructed on the low-rank representation coefficients after filtering out the noise can more accurately reveal the relationship between the samples; (2) Both the global structure (low-rank constraints) and the local structure (adaptive neighbors learning) in the multi-view data are captured; (3) The filtering of noise and the construction of the similarity graph of each view data are integrated into a framework to obtain the overall optimal solution; LRAGL model can be optimized efficiently by utilizing the augmented Lagrangian multiplier with Alternating Direction Minimization Method (ADMM). Extensive experimental results on six benchmark datasets verify the superiority of the proposed method in clustering.},

However, recent neural network-based models neglect to sufficiently perverse both sequential comprehensive meanings as well as syntactical co-referencing relationships between words in the sentences. In this paper, we proposed a novel integration of GCN-based textual syntactical encoder and pre-trained BERT sequential embedding with event-aware masked language mechanism, called SynSeq4ED. In our SynSeq4ED model, we formally present a joint text embedding framework which enable to effectively learn the deep semantic representations of event triggers and arguments by introducing a combination of integrated pre-trained BERT with event-aware masked language strategy and GCN-based syntactical co-referencing text encoding mechanism. The achieved text representations by SynSeq4ED model are then used to improve the performance of multiple tasks in ED, including multiple event detection (MED), few-shot learning event detection (FSLED). Extensive experiments in benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SynSeq4ED model in comparing with recent state-of-the-art baselines.},

Video-based action detection has obtained promising performance in computer vision community. However, in complex factory environment, how to detect workflow of both machines and workers in production process is not well resolved. To solve this issue, we propose a generic proposal based Graph Attention Networks for workflow detection. Specifically, an efficient and effective action proposal method is firstly employed to generate workflow proposals. Then, these proposals and their relations are exploited for proposal graph construction. Here, two types of relationships are considered for identifying the workflow phases, which are contextual and surrounding relations to capture context information and characterize the correlations between different workflow instances. To improve the recognition accuracy, within-category and between-category attention are incorporated to learn long-range and dynamic dependencies respectively. Thus, the capability of feature representation for workflow detection can be greatly enhanced. Experimental results verify that the proposed approach is considerably improved upon the state-of-the-arts on THUMOS’14 and a practical workflow dataset, achieving 6.7% and 3.9% absolute improvement compared to the advanced GTAN detector at tIoU threshold 0.4, respectively. Moreover, augmentation experiments are carried out on ActivityNet1.3 to prove the effectiveness of performance improvement by modeling workflow proposal relationships.},

In this paper, a deep learning CNN model is developed using multi-scale input with multiple stages of convolutional layers. These layers are divided into two blocks i.e. encode and decoder. In encoder block, extracted feature maps from convolutional layers of multiple stages are combined and down sampled. Similarly, in decoder block extracted feature maps are combined and up sampled. A sigmoid activation function is used to classify pixels into forged or non-forged using the final feature map. To validate the model two different publicly available datasets are used. The performance of the proposed model is compared with state-of-the-art methods which show that the presented data-driven approach is better.},

  abstract     = {In this manuscript, we are concerned with mixed (discrete and distributed) time-delayed both stability and non-fragile synchronization of nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs). We shall find stability criteria for the unknown parameter value of nonlinear multi-agent systems using the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functions, Lemma, the analytical techniques, the Kronecker product, and the general specifications for asymptotic stability of selected MASs are obtained. Moreover, criteria for the synchronization of leader–follower unknown parameter value of nonlinear MASs with non-fragile controllers are discussed. At last, we provide two numerical calculations along with the computational simulations to check the validity of the theoretical findings reported in this manuscript.},

  abstract     = {Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (TEOAE) are a class of oto-acoustic emissions that are generated by the cochlea in response to an external stimulus. The TEOAE signals exhibit characteristics unique to an individual, and are therefore considered as a potential biometric modality. Unlike conventional modalities, TEOAE is immune to replay and falsification attacks due to its implicit liveliness detection feature. In this paper, we propose an efficient deep neural network architecture, EarNet, to learn the appropriate filters for non-stationary (TEOAE) signals, which can reveal individual uniqueness and long- term reproducibility. EarNet is inspired by Google’s FaceNet. Furthermore, the embeddings generated by EarNet, in the Euclidean space, are such that they reduce intra-subject variability while capturing inter-subject variability, as visualized using t-SNE. The embeddings from EarNet are used for identification and verification tasks. The K-Nearest Neighbour classifier gives identification accuracies of 99.21% and 99.42% for the left and right ear, respectively, which are highest among the machine learning algorithms explored in this work. The verification using Pearson correlation on the embeddings performs with an EER of 0.581% and 0.057% for the left and right ear, respectively, scoring better than all other techniques. Fusion strategy yields an improved identification accuracy of 99.92%. The embeddings generalize well on subjects that are not part of the training, and hence EarNet is scalable on any new larger dataset.},

  abstract     = {Improving time series forecasting accuracy is an important work for decision makers. A single model applied on a data series may not obtain satisfactory prediction accuracy. Both theoretical and empirical findings have indicated that integration of linear model and nonlinear model may provide more accurate prediction than an individual linear or nonlinear model. This paper presents a hybrid modeling approach that combines a linear autoregressive (AR) model and a nonlinear deep belief network-based autoregressive (DBN-AR) model for time series forecasting. The proposed modeling approach first applies an AR model to fit time series data, and the error between the original date and the AR model forecast data as a nonlinear component is considered, and then the error is modeled by a DBN-AR model. DBaN-AR model is a modeling method for nonlinear time series, which uses a set of deep belief networks to approximate the state-dependent functional coefficients of state dependent auto-regressive model. The proposed hybrid model can overcome limitation of an individual model and obtain more general and more accurate forecasting result than some existing hybrid models. The experiment results demonstrate that the MSE of modeling residuals using the proposed hybrid model is largely reduced compared with the results of some single prediction models and some hybrid models for one-step-ahead and multistep-ahead forecast.},
