  abstract     = {Software fault prediction (SFP) plays a vital role into fostering high quality throughout the software development process. It allows to identify the fault-prone modules in early development phases and facilitates the focused and effective testing over the fault-prone modules. Machine learning (ML)-based classifiers are prominently being used for fault prediction in the software industry. The accuracy of the ML models depends upon the training data and its quality. The curse of high dimensionality adversely impacts the classification power of a ML model. The presence of inter-correlated, insignificant and/or redundant features (or attributes) in the training data hinders the performance of ML classifiers. Feature preprocessing (or feature selection (FS)) is the solution to this issue. Meta-heuristics is the key method to find out the most significant feature subset. In this paper, a novel feature selection method is devised using mathematical diversification for genetic evolution. It avoids the local optimums by utilizing arithmetic diversification among the candidate solutions (or populations). The survival of fittest is the working principle of evolving populations with crossover and mutation operations. The selected feature subset is fed to five classification algorithms, namely artificial neural network, support vector machine, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor and naïve Bayes. The proposed model is trained and tested over five datasets from NASA corpus, namely CM1, JM1, KC1, KC2 and PC1. In total, 100 SFP models are implemented (4 feature selection methods $$\times $$ 5 datasets $$\times $$ 5 classification algorithms). From the experiments, it is observed that the SFP models with proposed feature selection technique of evolving populations with mathematical diversification (FS-EPwMD) are better than other models. It can be concluded that the proposed SFP model built using proposed FS-EPwMD with artificial neural networks performs statistically best among all the competing 100 SFP models irrespective of the datasets used.},

However, the present study introduces a new algorithm that, as a standard format, can be used in cyberspace. The substitution box (S-box) is one of the most successful examples of these strategies. However, most S-box design schemes contain a fixed point, which may cause a security issue for cryptographic primitives. A dynamic S-box is constructed based on a piecewise map to achieve a low automatic correlation. The introduced piecewise map has an attractive behavior by displaying the ergodic behavior and fractal features in its chaotic domain. The ergodic property is of great interest in diffusion and confusion processes for encryption. We have examined the performance of the introduced S-box. The applied attacks (nonlinearity, SAC, BIC, LP, and DP) results are close to the optimal value. Then, an image encryption algorithm based on a designated S-box is proposed, and the ability of the encrypted image to resist the attacks has been examined with statistical analysis. The proposed S-box based on the piecewise map has a large and safe keyspace for encryption.},

  abstract     = {Soft computing (SC) methods have increasingly been used to solve complex hydraulic engineering problems, especially those characterized by high uncertainty. SC approaches have previously proved to be an accurate tool for predicting the aeration efficiency coefficient (E20) in hydraulic structures such as weirs and flumes. In this study, the performance of the standalone support vector regression (SVR) algorithm and three of its hybrid versions, support vector regression–firefly algorithm (SVR-FA), support vector regression–grasshopper optimization algorithm (SVR-GOA), and support vector regression–artificial bee colony (SVR-ABC), is assessed for the prediction of E20 in stepped cascades. Mutual information theory is used to construct input variable combinations for prediction, including the parameters unit discharge (q), the total number of steps (N), step height (h), chute overall length (L), and chute inclination ( $$\alpha $$ ). Entropy indicators, such as maximum likelihood, Jeffrey, Laplace, Schurmann–Grassberger, and minimax, are computed to quantify the epistemic uncertainty associated with the models. Four indices—correlation coefficient (R), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE)—are employed for evaluating the models’ prediction performance. The models’ outputs reveal that the SVR-FA model (with $$R = 0.947, {\text{NSE}} = 0.888, {\text{RMSE}} = 0.048\;{\text{and}}\;{\text{MAE}} = 0.027$$ in testing phase) has the best performance among all the models considered. The input variable combination, including q, N, h, and L, provides the best predictions with the SVR, SVR-FA, and SVR-GOA models. From the uncertainty analysis, the SVR-FA model shows the closest entropy values to the observed ones (3.630 vs. 3.628 for the “classic” entropy method and 3.647 vs. 3.643 on average for the Bayesian entropy method). This study proves that SC algorithms can be highly accurate in simulating aeration efficiency in stepped cascades and provide a valid alternative to the traditional empirical equation.},

  abstract     = {In today’s competitive business environment, the need for continuous production, quality improvement, and fast delivery necessitates highly reliable production and delivery processes. A more reliable system can be ensured by performing routine maintenance on the equipment. Maintenance, on the other hand, causes a temporary reduction in production capacity. To ensure a high level of system performance, it is essential to coordinate maintenance and production. The study integrates maintenance and production decisions in order to maximise efficiency by ensuring high-quality output and efficient resource utilisation; however, limited studies have been carried out addressing this type of scheduling problem with the objective function of total absolute deviation of completion times (TADC). Thus, this study aims to investigate the scheduling problem on a parallel machine under periodic maintenance in order to minimise the TADC of the jobs. Due to the complexity of the problem, a metaheuristic method called the lion optimization algorithm (LOA) is presented to solve the problem. This study performs a comprehensive comparative analysis to demonstrate the proposed algorithm’s reliability. The dragonfly algorithm, the grasshopper optimization algorithm, the multi-verse optimization algorithm, the sine cosine algorithm, the salp swarm algorithm, and the whale optimization algorithm are presented and their performance is compared to the LOA in this study The results demonstrate that the LOA consistently outperforms the other presented algorithms across all size ranges. The study’s findings contribute new theoretical and practical insights to the growing body of knowledge about manufacturing environments and have implications for planners and managers, particularly in businesses where unplanned production wastes financial resources.},

However, the learned model may not improve the performance on each individual query because the distributions of relevant documents among queries are diversified in document feature space. The performance of learned ranking models may be largely affected by the usefulness of document features. To generate high-quality document ranking features, we capture the local context information of individual queries from the top-ranked documents of an initial retrieval using pseudo-relevance feedback. Based on the top-ranked feedback documents, we propose an attentive semi-supervised autoencoder to refine the ranked results using an optimized ranking-oriented reconstruction loss. Furthermore, we devise the hybrid listwise query constraints to capture the characteristics of relevant documents for different queries. We evaluate the proposed ranking model on LETOR collections including OHSUMED, MQ2007 and MQ2008. Our model produces better experimental results and consistent improvements of ranking performance over baseline methods.},

Preference obtained only depends on the explicit rating without considering the implicit content feature, which is the root cause of preference bias. In this paper, the content feature of items described by fuzzy sets is integrated into the similarity computation, which helps to improve the accuracy of user preference modeling. The importance of a user is then defined according to preferences, which serves as a baseline standards of the core users selection. Furthermore, core users based matrix factorization model (CU-FHR) is established, then genetic algorithm is used to predict the missing rating on items.

Such problems are classified as nonlinear optimization problems; the aim of which is to minimize the active power loss through tuning of several control variables. Firstly, the performance of CFA optimizer in solving high-dimensional problems is investigated using standard benchmark problems. Moreover, we apply the CFA optimizer for solving large-scale ORPD problems based on different constraints in three IEEE standard power systems. According to the results, the proposed optimizer offers a more accurate solution when compared with other methods found in the literature.

However, their combination has not been studied yet. In this paper, we introduce the three-way conversational recommendation problem and design the hybrid conversational recommendation (HTCR) algorithm to address it. First, a new recommendation problem is defined by considering the man–machine interaction as well as the misclassification and promotion costs. The optimization objective of the problem is to minimize the total cost. Second, a popularity-based technique is designed for user cold-start recommendation, where the user maturity is responsible for deciding when HTCR turns to the second technique. Third, an incremental matrix factorization technique is designed for regular recommendation. It is efficient since only a few rounds of training are needed for newly acquired user feedback. Experiments were carried out on four well-known datasets, including Jester, MovieLens 100K, MovieLens 1M and Yelp. Results demonstrated that our algorithm outperformed state-of-the-art ones in terms of average cost.},

Intelligent parking management systems offer an optimal solution for finding empty parking spaces so that drivers can quickly find their car parking spaces. To solve these issues, it is necessary to design an intelligent parking system, besides providing comfort to drivers, which is also economically viable. In this paper, an intelligent multi-storey car parking management system called MODM-RPCP is proposed with the help of RFID technology and user preferences review, which effectively solves car parking issues. The MODM-RPCP approach is a multi-objective decision-making method that reduces the problem of average booking time and response time of the central parking management server. The simulation results show that the MODM-RPCP reduces the average booking time by more than 19.2 and 27.1\%, and decreases the response time of the central parking management server more than 20.1 and 29.78\% compared to MOGWOLA and ODPP approaches.},

  abstract     = {High-level synthesis of data paths in digital filters and model identification tasks are a most complicated optimization problem. Generally, the use of infinite impulse response (IIR) models for identification is chosen over their equivalent finite impulse response (FIR) models, because the former yield more perfect models of physical plants for real-world optimization problems. Additionally, infinite impulse response (IIR) model structures tend to make various multimodal error surfaces whose objective cost of the problems is significantly more difficult to minimize. For the solution of these types of issues, we needed more powerful methods that could resolve it perfectly. In this study, a novel hybrid variant of chimp and cuckoo search method has been developed for IIR related large-scale optimization issues, and it is known as chimp–cuckoo search algorithm (ChCS). The strength of the proposed method has been tested on the 23 standard functions and three types of infinite impulse response (IIR) models. Meanwhile, the numerical and statistical tabulated solutions of the ChCS method are also presented, showing the advantages of the proposed method over the competitors.},

The proposed model consists of two major steps such as segmentation and classification of peripheral blood cells. The modified local-information weighted intuitionistic Fuzzy C-means clustering (MLWIFCM)-based golden eagle optimization algorithm performs the nucleus segmentation. Finally, the peripheral blood cell classes such as Basophil, Lymphocyte, Neutrophil, Monocyte, and Eosinophil are effectively classified using hybrid-parameter RNN-based remora optimization algorithm. The MATLAB R2019b is used as the implementation platform. To analyze the performances of our proposed method, we have taken two datasets; they are BCCD and LISC datasets.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a causality extraction model based on a two-stage GCN to improve the extraction accuracy. To obtain rich features of entities, this work combines sentiment polarity and knowledge base to get the causality candidate entity library. Firstly, the BERT model is pre-trained using context information and relevant entity information extracted from the entity library to obtain the final entity nodes. Secondly, using the semantic dependency graph, each possible edge between any two entity nodes can be obtained, which are input into the first stage GCN to get a preliminary directed graph of causality. Finally, the directed graph of causality is input into the second stage GCN to achieve deep causality multi-hop inference. Thus, the cascade causality is inferred and extracted by the two-stage GCN model. Experiments show that the extraction accuracy of cascade causality has been further improved.},

  abstract     = {With the improvement of people&#39;s requirements for the accuracy of disease detection, increasing researchers apply image recognition to the detection and diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases. In addition, the evaluation of detection and diagnostic accuracy is also an important factor in the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. Referring to the QoS and QoE evaluation scheme in 5G network communication, this paper proposes a secondary quality experience evaluation model for gastrointestinal diseases. Firstly, three mandatory detection implementation nodes of 5G network communication are created in the image recognition model, and the first node detects the detected points (images of intestinal diseases) in 5G network communication in the form of interactive information. Then, take the above detection results as the first level to obtain the quality detection strategy results, and the second node uses the policy detection server to evaluate the measurement results as the results of the second level quality evaluation strategy. Finally, the third node is used to evaluate the results of the secondary quality evaluation, and the evaluation results of gastrointestinal disease detection are returned to the output of the whole model. In this paper, 200 CT images of the gastrointestinal tract in the CT colonography dataset were used to evaluate the performance of the model. The study shows that after 200 gastrointestinal CT images are imported into the model, 173 samples have a score of more than 85\% for the output of other nodes at the end of the enforcement node, accounting for 86.5\% of the sample size. After 24 samples were evaluated by the second level, the output result was the first level scoring error, accounting for 12\% of the sample size. Three samples were judged as abnormal images by the first level enforcement node, accounting for 1.5\% of the sample size. From the results, the secondary quality experience evaluation model can improve the image recognition accuracy of gastrointestinal disease detection and diagnosis from 86.5\% to 98.5\%, which greatly improves the accuracy of image recognition.},

  abstract     = {Software fault prediction (SFP) refers to the early prediction of fault-prone modules in software development which are susceptible to faults and can incur high development cost. Machine learning (ML)-based classifiers are extensively being used for SFP. Machine learning models utilize handcrafted metrics (or features), i.e., static code metrics for classification of software modules into one of the two categories, i.e., {buggy, clean}. It involves overhead of selecting the most significant features due to the presence of some correlated or non-significant features. With the shifting paradigm of machine learning to deep learning, it is desirable to improve the performance of SFP classifiers to keep pace up with the changing industrial needs. This study proposes a novel model (SCM-DLA-SFP) based on deep learning architecture (DLA) to predict the defects utilizing the static code metrics (SCMs). The defect dataset with SCMs is fed to the input layer of specially designed deep learning model, where the input is automatically conditioned using normalization. Then, the conditioned data pass through dense layers of deep neural network architecture to predict the faulty modules. The study utilizes five datasets from PROMISE repository namely camel, jedit, lucene, synapse and xalan. The proposed model SCM-DLA-SFP exhibits the performance of the average values of 88.01\%, 79.83\%, and 73.3\% for AUC measure, accuracy criteria and F-measure, respectively. The comparison shows that proposed model is better on average than the state-of-the-art DL-based SFP methods by 16.28\%, 19.61\%, and 18.45\% over AUC, accuracy and F-measure, respectively.},

An efficient use of surrogates can bring considerable savings in computational resources and time. Since literature on surrogate modelling encompasses a large variety of approaches, the appropriate choice of a surrogate remains a challenging task. This review discusses significant publications where surrogate modelling for finite element method-based computations was utilized. We familiarize the reader with the subject, explain the function of surrogate modelling, sampling and model validation procedures, and give a description of the different surrogate types. We then discuss main categories where surrogate models are used: prediction, sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification, and surrogate-assisted optimization, and give detailed account of recent advances and applications. We review the most widely used and recently developed software tools that are used to apply the discussed techniques with ease. Based on a literature review of 180 papers related to surrogate modelling, we discuss major research trends, gaps, and practical recommendations. As the utilization of surrogate models grows in popularity, this review can function as a guide that makes surrogate modelling more accessible.},

In this paper, we evaluate different versions of a genetic algorithm (GA) published previously by the authors with several relevant adjustments for the lift dispatching problem to minimize passenger waiting time and/or energy consumption. To the raw GA with adjustments (that works under the assumption one call-one passenger), we incorporated several elements: a passenger-counting module using origin–destination matrices, and the activation of certain policies (zoning and/or parking) under different detected traffic profiles (up-peak, interfloor or down-peak profiles). Besides, we added a proportional integral controller (PI) to assign different weights to passenger waiting time and energy consumption to evaluate the performance of our GA. Different versions of this GA, minimizing passenger waiting time and/or energy consumption, were compared among them and to a conventional control algorithm using three different types of simulated profiles: a mixed one, three well-known full day office profiles and three different step profiles. The results showed that the bi-objective GA version with the estimation of the number of passengers behind a call, i.e. the passenger forecasting, together with the parking policy for up-peak or down-peak conditions significantly improved performance of passenger waiting time, and in some cases in energy consumption as well. The addition of the PI controller to the GA proved to be especially useful when the system was under a high intensity traffic demand. The advantages of all these elements to forecast the passenger flow and detect the traffic profile to help the controller show unquestionable benefits to minimize passenger waiting time and energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {Software systems are frequently affected by a few defects. In general, the developers make use of the data present in the file, while reporting a bug; thus, they can help to fix the bug by localizing the source code fragments that are required to be improved. This paper intends to implement the bug localization model using the improved deep learning algorithm, which helps to localize the buggy files to enhance the productivity and efficiency of the software quality assurance teams. The datasets such as “Aspect J and SWT” were utilized for assessing the proposed bug localization model. The proposed model involves a few fundamental steps like data pre-processing, word embedding, CNN-based feature detection, and CNN-based classification. Initially, the source files from which the bug has to be localized are given as input. Here, the pre-processing of files is performed by erasing punctuation followed by splitting. Here, the relevant information or features are gathered from the source files using Word2Vec, a bag of n-grams, and the term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) technique in the word embedding process. Further, final feature vector extraction is performed by the convolution neural network (CNN). The extracted features are subjected to optimized CNN-based classification to localize the bugs. Here, the number of hidden neurons of CNN is optimized using hybridized cuckoo search-based sea lion optimization (CS-SLnO). The main objective of this work is to introduce a new optimized CNN-based classification of bug localization with hidden neurons optimization using a hybridized optimization algorithm termed CS-SLnO for improving the localization accurateness. Finally, the bug fixing ability of the proposed model is proved and certified through valuable performance analysis. The experimental results shows that the accuracy@1 of the suggested CS-SLnO-CNN is attaining the best performance when compared to other algorithms. It is 85.1\% better than DeepLoc, 51.9\% better than DeepLocator, 54.3\% better than HyLoc, 65.1\% better than LR + WE, and 73.5\% better than BugLocator. Thus, it can be confirmed that the developed CS-SLnO-CNN is acquiring better bug localization performance when compared to the other deep learning models.},

However, because of its characteristic irregularity, nonlinearity, non-stationarity, randomness, and intermittency, previous studies have only focused on stability or accuracy, and the forecast performances of their models were poor. Moreover, in previous research, the selection of sub-models used for the combined model was not considered, which weakened the generalisability. Therefore, to further improve the forecast accuracy and stability of the wind speed forecasting model, and to solve the problem of sub-model selection in the combined model, this study developed a wind speed forecasting model using data pre-processing, a multi-objective optimisation algorithm, and sub-model selection for the combined model. Simulation experiments showed that our combined model not only improved the forecasting accuracy and stability but also chose different sub-models and different weights of the combined model for different data; this improved the model generalisability. Specifically, the MAPEs of our model are less than 4.96\%, 4.60\%, and 5.25\% in one-, two-, and three-step forecast.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development and continual expansion of the 3D printing market and the scale of 3D printing devices, the limitations of traditional matching processing methods are becoming increasingly obvious. As a novel business paradigm, cloud 3D printing (C3DP) can effectively integrate and manage 3D printing resources. Based on this, this paper studies a dynamic and static data-based supply–demand matching method for C3DP service capability and designs a modeling framework to describe two models of a network node-matching method based on a Barabási-Albert (BA) scale-free network and a concept-matching method based on semantic similarity by model-based systems engineering. A wide array of 3D printing resource data are collected, and a task-service network based on multiobjective optimization in a dynamic hyper-network environment is used for comprehensive analysis and evaluation. The model can better extract the feature information of the multiobjective optimization by using the scheme of the real-time configuration service as well as the matching algorithm for the dynamic evolution of a manufacturing capability network and hyper-network algorithm. The results show that the supply–demand matching method for cloud 3D printing services based on complex networks has the advantages of high feasibility, high data accuracy, and high response speed, which can enhance the processing efficiency of mapping the relationships of the C3DP manufacturing capability and can improve the utilization of dynamic and static data-based supply–demand matching methods.},

  abstract     = {Gene selection is an important technique to remove irrelevant genes and handle the problem of curse-of-dimensionality issue. In other words the objective of the gene selection problem is to find (a small number of) cancer responsible genes (called biomarkers) from large number of genes, which have highest class discernable property. Traditional gene selection techniques are often not scalable on large number of genes and they are not able to handle the problem of vagueness, indiscerniblity, ambiguity, overlappiness complex cancer subtypes classes as usually present in the microarray gene expression data. In this context, a novel greedy fuzzy vaguely quantified rough approach for feature (gene) selection (GFVQRFS) is proposed that handles curse-of-dimensionality issue, vagueness, indiscerniblity, ambiguity, overlapping and complex cancer subtypes classes. The proposed method is evaluated on eight publicly available microarray gene expression datasets and the results are compared with four other state-of-the-art methods namely, CFS-GA, CON-GA, CON-GS and FRFS-GA using three classifiers (viz., KNN, SVM and NB). Six different validity measures (viz., accuracy, precision, recall, macro average $$F_1$$ -measures, micro average $$F_1$$ -measures and kappa) are used to access the performance of the proposed GFVQRFS method with respect to the compared methods. The proposed method selects very less number of genes compared to those selected by the other counterpart methods. The experimental results reveal the edge of the proposed method over other counterpart methods for most of the datasets.},

  abstract     = {In group decision-making problems, experts often form multiple subgroups depending upon their backgrounds or attitudes. To explore the effect of different types of subgroups’ formation on the final decision and to make the decision process more conforming to human custom, we propose a comprehensive study on the effect of “multi-subgroup background” on a basis of weights optimization and Granular Computing techniques. Firstly, a comparison of different types of clustering strategies is realized to find the most suitable method for clustering experts. Since Analytical Hierarchy Process is selected as the fundamental model, it becomes a reciprocal matrices’ or eigenvectors’ clustering task. Secondly, allocation strategies of information granularity to each expert along with weight to each subgroup are carefully designed and optimized. Information granularity is viewed as a design asset to provide experts with some flexibility to adjust their evaluation results, whereas weights reflect the importance degrees of different subgroups and further help to increase the consensus. A granulation-degranulation process is developed to evaluate the performance of a set of weights and granularities under a multi-criteria objective’s guidance. Thirdly, a proper evolutionary optimization method like particle swarm optimization is redesigned to iteratively generate the best set of information granularities and weights under an equality constraint condition. A series of numerical studies on synthetic data and real-world data are executed to verify the effectiveness of our method. The results show same trend present across experts.},

Optimal supplier selection meets the competitiveness of industries and satisfaction of customers in the supply chain management. However, considering sustainable factors including environmental and social parameters, alongside customers’ expectations are the main challenge of supplier selection. Moreover, incomplete and hesitation among experts’ judgment result in uncertainty that leads the more complex assessment of criteria. In this paper, an innovative multi-criteria decision-making method was developed to address supplier selection process and supplier order allocation based on customers’ expectations with respect to the sustainable primers. The proposed method was based on fuzzy combinative distance-based assessment (CODAS) extended with interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) for multi-criteria sustainable supplier selection. The proposed model was combined with hesitation linguistic set to provide two goals including a: dealing with experts’ hesitation as well as imprecise and vague of decision makers’ knowledge in order to express assessment values. b: coping with missing or nonexistence of attribute assessment values. The proposed method was performed on a steel mill as a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of decision process on four suppliers in detail. The results showed that the presented model could consider conflicting parameters and enhance high-order imprecision and uncertainty.},

Since different niching techniques possess different diversity preserving properties, employing a fixed niching technique during DE evolution may have limited performance. In this paper, we propose an adaptive niching selection-based DE for global optimization problems. In the proposed method, instead of employing a certain fixed niching technique, an adaptive niching selection scheme has been devised. In this scheme, multiple niching techniques are employed and adaptively used during the DE evolution, thus properly preserving the population diversity. Further, to appropriately facilitate the adaptive niching selection, both the fitness improvement and entropy of population resulting from niching techniques have been considered to measure their effectiveness. The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated on multi-modal and hybrid composition test functions and compared with related methods. The results show that our proposed method can deliver a satisfying performance and is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms.},

In order to optimize the design of FIR filter, a FIR digital filter design method based on improved bee colony (ABC) algorithm is proposed. This improved ABC algorithm can adaptively adjust the step size of the selected neighborhood of nectar source location. At the same time, the information of the global optimal solution is used to guide the search of candidate solution, which improves the global search ability of the algorithm. The improved ABC algorithm can balance the conflict between local search ability and global search ability, so it can achieve better optimization effect. The time and space complexity of the algorithm is analyzed in detail. Then, the improved ABC algorithm is used to design three typical FIR digital filters, namely low-pass, band-pass and band-stop filter. The performance of the designed filter is tested by simulation experiments. The experimental results show that compared with other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, the proposed FIR filter design method has achieved better effect and performance. Meanwhile, the proposed design method has shorter optimization time. The superiority of the proposed method is verified.},

  abstract     = {A ball mill is a heavy mechanical device and its safe operation affects the entire grinding process. Mill load is a key index in the optimum operation of the grinding process, but it cannot be measured directly. In industrial practice, operational experts normally estimate its value based on their experiences and the mechanical signals produced by the ball mill. In this paper, we proposed a heterogeneous selective ensemble method by using a multiscale mechanical frequency spectrum. The multicomponent adaptive decomposition algorithm is first used to decompose the original shell vibration and acoustic signals into sub-signals with different timescales. Then, selective ensemble (SEN) kernel projection to latent structure algorithm is used to model the spectral data of these sub-signals. Furthermore, the latent features of multiscale spectra are extracted to construct SEN models based on fuzzy inference. Finally, the two types of heterogeneous SEN models are fused by using information entropy. The main contribution of this study is that the proposed soft-sensing model has a dual-layer ensemble structure that can fuse multi-source information in different mechanical sub-signals with physical meaning. Moreover, the proposed model can simulate the fuzzy cognitive behavior of domain experts in the mineral grinding process. The effectiveness of the method is verified by the shell vibration and acoustical data of a laboratory-scale ball mill.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of deep learning, no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) based on convolutional neural network (CNN) plays an important role in image processing. Currently, most CNN-based NR-IQA methods focus primarily on the global features of images while ignoring detail-rich local features and channel dependencies. In fact, there are subtle differences in detail between distorted and reference images, as well as differences in the contribution of different channels to IQA. Furthermore, multi-scale feature extraction can be used to fuse the detailed information from images with different resolutions, and the combination of global and local features is critical in extracting image features. As a result, in this paper, a multi-scale residual CNN with an attention mechanism (MsRCANet) is proposed for NR-IQA. Specifically, a multi-scale residual block is first used to extract features from distorted images. Then, the residual learning with active weighted mapping strategy and channel attention mechanism is used to further process image features to obtain more abundant information. Finally, the fusion strategy and full connection layer are used to evaluate image quality. The experimental results on four synthetic databases and three in-the-wild IQA databases, as well as cross-database validation results, show that the proposed method has good generalization ability and can be compared with the most advanced methods.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection and instance selection are two data preprocessing methods widely used in data mining and pattern recognition. The main goal is to reduce the computational cost of many learning tasks. Recently, joint feature and instance selection has been approached by solving some global optimization problems using meta-heuristics. This approach is not only computationally expensive, but also does not exploit the fact that the data usually have a structured manifold implicitly hidden in the data and its labels. In this paper, we address joint feature and instance selection using scores derived from discriminant analysis theory. We present three approaches for joint feature and instance selection. The first scheme is a wrapper technique, while the other two schemes are filtering techniques. In the filtering approaches, the search process uses a genetic algorithm where the evaluation criterion is mainly given by the discriminant analysis score. This score depends simultaneously on the feature subset candidate and the best corresponding subset of instances. Thus, the best feature subset and the best instances are determined by finding the best score. The performance of the proposed approaches is quantified and studied using image classification with Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine Classifiers. Experiments are conducted on five public image datasets. We compare the performance of our proposed methods with several state-of-the-art methods. The experiments performed show the superiority of the proposed methods over several baseline methods.},

This paper will propose an evaluation for the performance of different deep learning models associated with the raw lung auscultation sounds in detecting respiratory pathologies to help in providing diagnostic of respiratory pathologies in digital recorded respiratory sounds. Also, we will find out the best deep learning model for this task. In this paper, three different deep learning models have been evaluated on non-augmented and augmented datasets, where two different datasets have been utilized to generate four different sub-datasets. The results show that all the proposed deep learning methods were successful and achieved high performance in classifying the raw lung sounds, the methods were applied on different datasets and used either augmentation or non-augmentation. Among all proposed deep learning models, the CNN–LSTM model was the best model in all datasets for both augmentation and non-augmentation cases. The accuracy of CNN–LSTM model using non-augmentation was 99.6\%, 99.8\%, 82.4\%, and 99.4\% for datasets 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, and using augmentation was 100\%, 99.8\%, 98.0\%, and 99.5\% for datasets 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. While the augmentation process successfully helps the deep learning models in enhancing their performance on the testing datasets with a notable value. Moreover, the hybrid model that combines both CNN and LSTM techniques performed better than models that are based only on one of these techniques, this mainly refers to the use of CNN for automatic deep features extraction from lung sound while LSTM is used for classification.},

  abstract     = {Encrypted traffic classification plays a critical role in network management, providing appropriate Quality-of-Service and Network Intrusion Detection. Conventional port-based and deep packet inspection approaches cannot classify encrypted traffic effectively. Methods based on machine learning can classify encrypted traffic by extracting statistical features of the flow. However, they require manual extraction of features. Recent studies show that the approaches based on deep learning are compelling for the task. They can automatically learn raw traffic features without manual feature extraction. However, these studies still take the payload of encrypted traffic as the model input, which may cause privacy risks. Besides, a massive encrypted payload causes great storage pressure on traffic classification. In this paper, we propose a reliable encrypted traffic classification framework by only using the flow header called Only Header, which avoids privacy risks and achieves lightweight storage. Firstly, we introduce a twice segmentation mechanism to dilute the interference traffic and increase the weight of effective traffic. Then, we use capsule neural networks (CapsNet) to learn spatial and byte features of the flow header. The Only Header’s effectiveness is compared with other methods using two public datasets, including ISCX VPN-nonVPN and ISCX Tor-nonTor datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the Only Header outperforms the state-of-the-art encrypted traffic classification methods.},

In particular, as one of the areas of concern in uncertain finance, a large number of currency models have been proposed to describe the foreign exchange rate. However, the existing currency models mainly describe the foreign exchange rate by linear uncertain differential equation. As a supplement, this paper proposes a new currency model called uncertain exponential currency model to describe the foreign exchange rates by nonlinear uncertain differential equation. After that some option pricing formulas are derived, and then some numerical examples are provided to illustrate the formulas.

Considering the characteristics of bounded rationality and difference of risk perception in government and enterprises in the carbon emission regulation process, we construct an evolutionary game model based on prospect theory. Using this model, we analyze the evolutionary stability strategies of government and enterprises under the low, medium, and high risk of air quality deterioration. The results show that the cost-benefit ratio of government and enterprise is the threshold to distinguish the grade of air quality deterioration risk. When the risk of air quality deterioration is low, the government tends to be passive regulation and enterprises tend to traditional production. In the situation of medium risk, the strategy choice of government and enterprise is in a circular state. In the situation of high risk, the government tends to be passive supervision, while enterprises tend to choose low-carbon production. At the same time, there is an incentive paradox in the process of regulation of carbon emissions, but in the long run, it is more effective to strengthen the punishment of local governments’ passive regulation than to increase the punishment of enterprises.},

This paper considers a kind of multi-attribute decision-making problems under the information environment of Z-numbers and proposes a new multi-attribute decision-making method based on Z-number grey relational degree (ZNGRD-MADM). Specifically, in ZNGRD-MADM, some comparative relations of Z-numbers and a new definition of generalized distance of Z-numbers are proposed firstly. Then, a new concept of Z-number grey relational degree (ZNGRD) is proposed based on the generalized distance of Z-numbers and its properties are proved. Thirdly, a new alternative ranking method is proposed based on the Z-numbers comparative relations and ZNGRD. Finally, the proposed ZNGRD-MADM method is applied to the problem of Web service selection, and its feasibility and effectiveness are verified through sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a boxing match algorithm (BMA) as a new efficient meta-heuristic method to solve numerical optimization and NP-hard problems, such as knapsack. The proposed algorithm finds the best position (i.e., best solution) in the ring during the match (i.e., feasible solutions) through a simulation of the boxer’s behavior, who can attract good support from his coach and fans to defeat his rival. The proposed algorithm is seeking good solutions by dividing the solution space into different sections and generating new solutions in each section through a semi-zigzag search. This division causes a proper and targeted search in the solution space to reach an efficient solution. Also, the unique boxer’s movement in the ring (generating new solutions) enables the proposed BMA to give an acceptable level of performance in exploring the problem space. Several unconstrained mathematical, knapsack, and engineering benchmark problems undergo a standard test designed to confirm the powerful performance of the proposed BMA. A wide variety of complex numerical problems are solved and analyzed by a comparison between the results obtained from the test and the other well-known optimization methods. Quantitative data also indicate the proper performance of the proposed algorithm compared to the other ones. The results show that this algorithm can achieve 95\% and 100\% optimal solutions in 20 mathematical benchmark functions and eight examples of the knapsack problem, respectively.},

To address these problems, this paper proposed an advanced rule-based modeling method-based DBSCAN-inspired granular descriptors. First, to understand the essential characteristics of data and enhance rules’ representation ability, data structures are obtained by DBSCAN clustering algorithm, which has high flexibility at coping with diverse geometry. Second, numerous granular descriptors are constructed in the refined representation of data structures and used for fuzzy rule formation. This granular computing process could effectively reduce computation overhead of big data analysis. Finally, the proposed rule-based model consists of fuzzy rules and interval outputs, which are resulted from structural granular descriptors and justifiable granulating respectively. Experimental studies concerning synthetic data and publicly available data illustrated that the proposed method can achieve prior performance on both modeling and time consuming than conventional rule-based modeling via FCM. Therefore, it is verified the developed approach is feasible and useful to be applied in modeling real complex engineering systems.},

In recent years, color image segmentation has received considerable attention from the researchers. However, it is still a highly complicated task due to the presence of more attributes or components as compared to monochrome images. Numerous meta-heuristics algorithms are developed to determine the optimal threshold value for segmenting color images efficiently. This paper presents an enhanced sine cosine algorithm (ESCA) to seek threshold for segmenting color images. Sine cosine algorithm (SCA) is a population-based optimization algorithm which has the ability of preventing local minima problem. First an input image is transformed to CIE L*a*b* color reduced space. ESCA is applied to determine the optimal threshold values for segmentation. The performance of the proposed method is tested on color images from Berkeley database, and segmentation results are compared with two metaheuristic algorithms, namely particle swarm optimization (PSO) and standard SCA. Experimental results are validated by measuring peak signal–noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index and computation time for all the images investigated. Results revealed that the proposed method outperforms the other methods like PSO and SCA by achieving PSNR of 23 dB and SSIM of 0.93 and also require less time for finding optimal threshold values than PSO and SCA.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, under the guidance and the emerging advancement of information technology, microelectronics and other technologies, the new generation of avionics system is developing toward information and data integration. The general parallel data signal processing platform with high real-time performance, strong processing ability, high communication rate and reconfigurable has become the mainstream development direction. Microwave photonics is a new subject integrating optical communication technology and microwave technology. It mainly studies the use of optoelectronics to process microwave signals, so as to break through the bottleneck of current microwave system. Microwave photon technology, which combines microwave and light wave, can realize high-speed processing and broadband transmission of microwave signals. The emergence of multi-core DSP makes it possible for multi-core multi-task parallel. Multi-core DSP can process all kinds of digital signals quickly. Parallel processing technology can realize multi-task parallel, and reconfigurable technology can realize the multi-task dynamic switching, which provides technical support for multi-standard parallel of radio station and its scalability and compatibility. Hence, the paper designs the novel deep learning-based communication model with soft computing for DSP; the performance is validated.},

  abstract     = {The recent advancements of unsupervised deep generative models have produced incredible results in image and video generation tasks. However, existing approaches still pose huge challenges in the high-quality video generation process. The generated videos consist of blurred effects and poor video quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel generative framework named dynamic generative adversarial networks (dynamic GAN) model for regulating the adversarial training and generating photo-realistic high-quality sign language videos. The proposed model uses skeletal poses information and person images as input and produces high-quality videos. In generator phase, the proposed model uses U-Net-like network to generate target frames from skeletal poses. Further, the generated samples are classified using the VGG-19 framework to identify its word class. The discriminator network classifies the real and fake samples as well as concatenates the resultant frames and generates the high-quality video output. Unlike, existing approaches the proposed novel framework produces photo-realistic video quality results without employing any animation or avatar approaches. To evaluate the model performance qualitatively and quantitatively, the proposed model has been evaluated using three benchmark datasets that yield plausible results. The datasets are RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset, and our self-created dataset for Indian Sign Language (ISL-CSLTR), and the UCF-101 Action Recognition dataset. The proposed model achieves average 28.7167 PSNR score, 0.921 average SSIM score, 14 average FID score and 8.73 ± 0.23 average inception score which are relatively higher than existing approaches.},

Hybrid cloud is a solution to address these requirements of security and privacy. Hybrid cloud uses a mix of public, private, and managed cloud with a single access interface to the users. Security and privacy are addressed in hybrid cloud through data partitioning and data distribution depending on the sensitivity of the data and reliability of the cloud. Many solutions have been proposed for partitioning structured data, but there are very few works addressing the partitioning and distribution of unstructured data. With unstructured data, gaining importance in various applications like sentiment prediction, recommendation based on reviews, emails, etc. ensuring security and privacy of unstructured through partitioning and distribution has become highly relevant.

This paper considers a wide range of neural network topologies, followed by an examination of how to optimize and analyze neural networks using agriculture data. A back-propagation model was proposed here to create a predictive inference model, with five hidden layers and activation function as sigmoid. Four Kaggle datasets are used here to assess the ability of the proposed neural network approach regarding prediction, and three datasets are gathered from Kerala Agriculture University in real time. Finally, as an optimization strategy, adaptive momentum estimation was utilized, and the applied findings demonstrate that Adam optimizer achieves good prediction accuracy, and F1 score with the help of neuro-fuzzy system and therefore better convergence rate. The proposed method enables more precise control of the direction and step size for updating weight vectors, leading to significantly improved generalization performance. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method shows an accuracy of 97\% in average. The suggested approach outperforms other benchmark algorithms such as C4.5, ID3, CART, Naïve Bayes, fuzzy, MLP and hence it can be concluded that the proposed hybridization of back-propagation neural networks with adaptive optimization method clearly verifies the efficiency of Adam optimizer with back propagation for text data.},

With the development of cloud computing and its widespread use, as well as its dispersed and decentralized character, a unique security measure is required to safeguard this architecture. By monitoring, validating, and managing settings, records, internet traffic, usage data, as well as the operations of specific activities, firewalls can distinguish between normal and unexpected behaviours, thus adding additional network security to cloud computing systems. The location of network security mechanisms in cloud computing environment and also the methods employed in such methods are the two primary aspects where many studies have concentrated their efforts. The objective of such studies is to reveal as many incursions as feasible and to improve the pace and correctness of sensing while minimizing false alarms. Nevertheless, these methods have a large computing burden, a poor degree of precision, and a large time consumption. We propose an accurate and complete approach for detecting and preventing assaults in cloud computing environment via the use of a machine learning techniques both supervised and un-supervised. The operational findings demonstrate that the suggested approach substantially increases attack detection, network security correctness, dependability, and accessibility in cloud computing environment, while drastically reducing false alarms.},

However, owing to high demand and volume of requests, cloud struggles to allocate resources. Task schedulers are employed in cloud computing to address these issues. Various task scheduling methods have been presented in several research publications, and the quest for a better scheduling model continues. In this paper, a task scheduling method based on a hybrid optimization algorithm is presented, which effectively schedules jobs with the least amount of waiting time. In addition to these, other parameters, such as the overall production time, execution time, waiting time, efficiency, and utilization are included in this study.

Network intrusion detection systems provide such services to the network and it becomes inevitable for any communication network. Machine learning (ML) techniques are widely used in intrusion detection systems; however, the performance of ML techniques is not satisfactory while handling imbalanced attacks. To solve this and to improve the performance, this research work proposed an intrusion detection system based on deep neural network (DNN). Cross-correlation process is used to select the optimal features from the dataset and the selected parameters are used as building blocks for deep neural network structure to find intrusions.

Dataset consists of 76 features and all those seventy-six features have not contributed equal information during the time of classification. In the entire attributes, some of the attributes will contribute a large amount of information at the time of classification task and some of the attributes will contribute only a small amount of information during the classification task. In this paper, a modified bee algorithm is used to identify the best subset of attributes from the entire features in the dataset; i.e., the training phase of classification only retains those features that are contributing more information during classification task and it will reduce the training time of classifiers. The experiment is analyzed with an obtained reduced subset of attributes by using the following classifiers such as support vector machine, Naïve Bayes and KNN. The experimental result shows that the support vector machine classifier will provide a good classification accuracy, true positive rate, true negative rate, false positive rate and false negative rate compared to Naïve Bayes and KNN.},

Denoising is performed in the frequency domain and converted back to the time domain to analyze performance metrics such as speech quality and speech intelligibility. The speech quality is analyzed based on the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ). Speech intelligibility is analyzed by short-time objective intelligibility (STOI). Both the methods evaluated the denoised speech, and the analysis made on the results shows that the SNR of the conventional Wiener filtering method is much improved when compared with Deep CNN. However, the PESQ and STOI of Deep CNN-based enhanced speech outperform the Wiener filtering method.

Earlier, researchers have dealt with datasets considering it would contain only one record for an individual [1:1 dataset], which is uncompromising in various applications. Later, many researchers concentrate on the dataset, where an individual has multiple records [1:M dataset]. In the paper, a model f-slip was proposed that can address the various attacks such as Background Knowledge (bk) attack, Multiple Sensitive attribute correlation attack (MSAcorr), Quasi-identifier correlation attack(QIcorr), Non-membership correlation attack(NMcorr) and Membership correlation attack(Mcorr) in 1:M dataset and the solutions for the attacks. In f-slip, the anatomization was performed to divide the raw table into two sub-tables (1) quasi-identifier and (2) sensitive attributes. The correlation of sensitive attributes is computed to anonymize the sensitive attributes without breaking the linking relationship. Further, the quasi-identifier table was divided and k-anonymity was implemented on it. An efficient anonymization technique, frequency-slicing, was also developed to anonymize the sensitive attributes. The novel approach in the f-slip model is the slicing of records according to the frequency of occurrences of sensitive attribute values in each sub-table. The workload experiment proves that the f-slip model is consistent as the number of records increases. Extensive experiments were performed on a real-world dataset Informs and proved that the f-slip model outstrips the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of utility loss, efficiency and also acquires an optimal balance between privacy and utility.},

  abstract     = {With the development of recent economic globalization, international exchanges and cooperation are increasingly frequent and in-depth. In this process, there is a serious obstacle, that is, language differences. Therefore, the development of high-quality and practical machine translation system is of great significance. Japan has a close relationship with China, so it is necessary to acquire and process Japanese information. Japanese translation is the basis of Japanese information processing, which plays an important role in cross language information retrieval, machine translation, information extraction and other practical applications. In recent years, machine translation has made remarkable progress, but there is still much room for improvement in the quality of translation. Multimedia assisted instruction is an important application of computer technology. Therefore, this paper realizes the feature recognition and hardware structure of Japanese machine translation; for the efficient implementation of the model, the edge-driven model is combined. The proposed model is implemented through the edge devices and the performance of the model is validated through the testing. The recognition accuracy is much higher than the traditional models and the robustness is higher.},

It reflects the general characteristics of arts and crafts, but also shows the distinctive personality of national culture. The folk printing and dyeing process of Miao Nationality in Xiangxi and Southeast Guizhou has this characteristic, which once brought a lot of convenience to people&#39;s life and became an important part of people&#39;s life at that time. Traditional art carries a lot of spiritual things in its material form, so it has high esthetic value, cultural value and profound spiritual connotation. Therefore, the optimization design of traditional printing and dyeing process framework in Xiangxi is worth studying. In this paper, through using big data pattern mining algorithm and scene understanding algorithm, a framework optimization system of traditional printing and dyeing process in Xiangxi is constructed, for the optimization of the traditional model, the edge-driven scene model is applied for the systematic study.

  abstract     = {Cloud services gain more attention due to its accessibility, performance, and cost factors. Cloud offers a wide range of services and completes the task without any delay due to its scheduling policies. Task scheduling is an important factor in cloud computing applications. The performance of applications increases due to an effective scheduling strategy. The cloud resources are allocated to the tasks through task scheduling. Factors like customer satisfaction, resource utilization, better performance make task scheduling crucial for service providers. Depending on the scheduling schemes support in clouds, scheduling is categorized into single cloud or multi-cloud scheduling. Multi-cloud environment provides diverse resources and significantly reduces the cost and commercial limitations. However, reducing the cost functions and makespan are the major factors considered to avoid customer dissatisfaction. But it is essential to concentrate on other factors, such as throughput, delay, Makespan, waiting time, response time, utilization, and efficiency to improve the quality of services. This research work presents a Multi-Swarm Optimization model for Multi-Cloud Scheduling for Enhanced Quality of Services for a multi-cloud environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs better in all aspects compared to existing techniques, such as Adaptive energy-efficient scheduling, single objective particle swarm optimization scheduling, and improves the quality of services.},

  abstract     = {Public health experts and healthcare professionals are gradually identifying sedentary activity as a population-wide, pervasive health risk. The purpose of this paper is to propose a method to identify the changes in posture during sedentary work and to give feedback by analysing the identified posture of the upper body, i.e. hands, shoulder, and head positioning. After capturing the image of the human pose, pre-processing of the image takes place with a bandpass filter, which helps to reduce the noise and morphological operation, which is used to carry out the process of dilation, erosion and opening of an image. To predict the results easily with the use of texture feature extraction, it helps to extract the image’s feature. Then, accuracy is predicted by using the deep neural network techniques, to predict the result accurately. After prediction and analysis, the feedback system is developed to alert individuals through the alarm system. The proposed method is formulated by using DNN for prediction in the MATLAB software tool. The results show accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the prediction using a deep neural network are 97.2\%, 88.7\% and 99.1\%. The proposed method is compared with the existing methods SVM, Random Forest and KNN algorithms. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the existing algorithms are SVM with 77.6\%, 57.4 and 97.8\%; Random Forest with 80.6\%, 63.7\% and 97.5\%; and KNN with 65.8\%, 61.2\%, and 95.1\%.

  abstract     = {The fusion of visible and infrared (IR) images is considered as one of the most efficient image fusion methods so far, as more valuable information can be obtained from the fused images overcoming the sensor limitations. Even in poor lighting conditions, by utilizing the thermal (IR) radiation information, the details can be obtained from the IR sensors. Visual images provide better spectral, spatial, and texture details. Thus, integrating the IR and visual images will provide more information about an object in a scene, thus enhancing the decision-making process in surveillance applications. The proposed work is aimed to be an object detection framework that utilizes this image fusion technique to identify an object. However, when the query image has more features, the computational complexity for extraction and processing of those features for identification of an object increases. This reduces the detection accuracy of the system. Hence, an optimal set of features ought to be identified before proceeding into the classification and detection processes. To achieve this, the research work has proposed a nature-inspired optimal feature selection methodology using ant colony optimization. Finding the optimal features to reduce the computational complexity and thereby increase the accuracy of detection is the research objective. The fusion of IR and visible images is progressed using pulse-coupled neural network. The rest of the processes such as classification and detection are performed using the convolutional neural network model. Experimental results have been compared with conventional techniques in terms of accuracy and computation time.},

Instead of conventional manual video assessment, the prediction accuracy can be improved if the person&#39;s gait model is analyzed. Various gait analysis models are evolved in the recent era that uses support vector machine, artificial neural network, and backpropagation neural network for analysis. However, analyzing gait energy images for fall prediction is addressed in limited research works. Considering this research gap this research work proposed a gait-based fall prediction model using a deep learning approach and identifies the early fall of persons with walking disabilities. Gait energy image is used as input for the proposed deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to predict the early fall. The proposed DCNN model attains a classification accuracy of 99.1\% and prediction ratio of 98.64\% which is much better than conventional ResNet 50 and CNN method-based gait analysis. Few other parameters, such as specificity, sensitivity, and detection accuracy, are also analyzed to validate the proposed model performance.},

  abstract     = {Class imbalance is the potential problem that has been existent in machine learning, which hinders the performance of the classification algorithm when applied in real-world applications such as electricity pilferage, fraudulent transactions, anomaly detection, and prediction of rare diseases. Class imbalance refers to the problem where the distribution of the sample is skewed or biased toward one particular class. Due to its intrinsic nature the software fault prediction dataset falls into the same category where the software modules contain fewer defective modules compared to the non-defective modules. The majority of the oversampling techniques that has been proposed is to address the issue by generating synthetic samples of minority class to balance the dataset. But the synthetic samples generated are near duplicates that also results in over-generalization issue. We thus propose a novel oversampling approach to introduce synthetic samples using genetic algorithm (GA). GA is a form of evolutionary algorithm that employs biologically inspired techniques such as inheritance, mutation, selection, and crossover. The proposed algorithm generates synthetic sample of minority class based on the distribution measure and ensures that the samples are diverse within the class and are efficient. The proposed oversampling algorithm has been compared with SMOTE, BSMOTE, ADASYN, random oversampling, MAHAKIL, and no sampling approach with 20 defect prediction datasets from the promise repository and five prediction models. The results indicate that the genetic algorithm oversampling approach improves the fault prediction performance and reduced false alarm rate.},

This might result in the degradation of the network which could be recognized. Due to the jamming signals, the packet transmission might not be proper. These kinds of attacks are destructive in low power and lossy wireless network due to the attributes such as disruption in communication and rapid trench in the batteries. To detect the attack and to perform the secure data transmission, the illegitimate nodes have to be eradicated. Machine learning and deep learning methods are used for network analysis of intrusion detection and security. Hence, the deep learning model is proposed to identify the attacks which result in secured data transmission. Also, the logistic regression is applied to classify the behaviour of the node so that the deviation could be determined. Deep learning is applied so it can adaptively learn the attacks and classify with higher accuracy. It is efficient as it is adaptive in learning and has improved precision. The performance of the model could be proved with simulations by varying the nodes. The secured data transmission could be proved by analysing several metrics such as packet drop rate, normalized routing overhead, and jitter. The packet drop is decreased to 50\%, jitter is decreased to 6\% and throughput shows a significant increase by 6\% when compared with the Dodge-Jam, a lightweight Mitigating Stealthy Jamming Attacks (MJSA) technique.},

In this work, we have implemented a novel method to learn discriminative features from tweets content, Facebook posts and followed their non-sequential propagation structure, and generated more powerful representations for identifying fake news and its propagation by constructing a social network graph. We proposed level order traversal up to three levels based on top-down tree structured networks for fake propagation learning and detected the neighbors of the fake news source and removed them from the network which naturally confirms the reduction of their propagation. We have considered the benchmark data set LIAR and used PolitiFact user data for our research work. The main objective of our work is to identify the propagation path of the fake news content by collecting news and verifying its authenticity using fact-checking websites, namely “ www.politifact.com ”, and creating a network among the users who have high similarity in their contents posted. Now it will be easier to trace the path if the source identified has fake content, then its neighbors can be tracked and moving forward the same idea can be iterated up to bottom levels.},

  abstract     = {Reconstruction of cross-cut shredded text documents (RCCSTD) has important applications for information security and judicial evidence collection. The traditional method of manual construction is a very time-consuming task, so the use of computer-assisted efficient reconstruction is a crucial research topic. Fragment consensus information extraction and fragment pair compatibility measurement are two fundamental processes in RCCSTD. Due to the limitations of the existing classical methods of these two steps, only documents with specific structures or characteristics can be spliced, and pairing error is larger when the cutting is more fine-grained. In order to reconstruct the fragments more effectively, this paper improves the extraction method for consensus information and constructs a new global pairwise compatibility measurement model based on the extreme learning machine algorithm. The purpose of the algorithm’s design is to exploit all available information and computationally suggest matches to increase the algorithm’s ability to discriminate between data in various complex situations, then find the best neighbor of each fragment for splicing according to pairwise compatibility. The overall performance of our approach in several practical experiments is illustrated. The results indicate that the matching accuracy of the proposed algorithm is better than that of the previously published classical algorithms and still ensures a higher matching accuracy in the noisy datasets, which can provide a feasible method for RCCSTD intelligent systems in real scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the rapid development of electric vehicles has increased the load power system and brought new challenges to the safe and stable operation of the gird. Although the vehicle-to-grid technology can reduce the load that electric vehicles put on the grid, without any incentives, electric vehicle owners are more inclined not to use vehicle-to-grid services. In this paper, therefore, a new dynamic economic emission model based on electric vehicles (DEED_EV) is proposed to maximize the electric vehicle user’s revenue, as well as minimize the fuel cost and emission of the thermal power unit. In the DEED_EV model, the stochastic of electric vehicles user’s travel and wear of the battery, as well as some constraints such as electric vehicles charging/discharging rate and status, electric vehicles remain power, electric vehicles travel power capacity, ramp limits, up and down reserves, and the system balance are considered. To solve the DEED_EV model, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition with a step-by-step constraint handling strategy is developed. Different test cases based on the 10-unit are simulated to verify the proposed model and method. The results show that the DEED_EV model not only encourages more electric vehicles to plug into the grid but also reduces the fuel cost and emission of the thermal power unit. Besides, the electric vehicles in the DEED_EV completely realizes the peak shaving and valley filling of the load.},

It is a problem with an initial layer in the neighborhood of the initial nodal point whose width is of the order of the small parameter $$\epsilon $$ . Explicit order three classical methods are modified, and a new scheme is designed for singular perturbation problems. It is a fitted operator method and it is explicit with a variable fitting factor (VFF) evaluated at all nodal points. To reduce the calculation time of the scheme with VFF, the VFF is replaced by a fixed constant fitting factor (CFF). It is implicit with a CFF which is evaluated only one time at the initial nodal point. These two schemes are both optimal concerning the small parameter $$\epsilon $$ and uniform of order three. The three order methods presented in this article are superior to the three order methods available in the literature. To view the initial layer when the mesh size is larger than the parameter in the problem, these two fitted operator methods are extended to fitted mesh methods since fitted mesh methods are layer rescaling. The construction of the fitted mesh method is also provided. That is, the uniform mesh is extended to non-uniform mesh. Experimental results are presented to show the optimal and higher-order performance of the two numerical methods using three test problems.},

People are encouraged to wear masks to protect themselves from the outside world and thus from infection with COVID-19. The presence of masks raised serious concerns about the accuracy of existing facial recognition systems since most of the facial features are obscured by the mask. To address these challenges, a new method for masked face recognition is proposed that combines a cropping-based approach (upper half of the face) with an improved VGG-16 architecture. The finest features from the un-occluded facial region are extracted using a transfer learned VGG-16 model (Forehead and eyes). The optimal cropping ratio is investigated to give an enhanced feature representation for recognition. To avoid the overhead of bias, the obtained feature vector is mapped into a lower-dimensional feature representation using a Random Fourier Feature extraction module. Comprehensive experiments on the Georgia Tech Face Dataset, Head Pose Image Dataset, and Face Dataset by Robotics Lab show that the proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches for masked face recognition.},

And, reflect the asymptotic behavior of the solution of the stiff problem since it is L-stable. The classical explicit Runge–Kutta methods of order two are not suitable for stiff problems since the numerical solution will not overcome the effects of stiffness and will not reflect the asymptotic behavior of the solution of the stiff problem (for example, Dahlquist problem). And, they are not both A-stable and L-stable. On applying Euler’s implicit method, the numerical solution will overcome the effects of stiffness and will reflect the asymptotic behavior of the solution of the stiff problem. And hence, it is both A-stable and L-stable. But it is of order one method. A new numerical method which is both A-stable and L-stable and of order two for the numerical solution of a stiff differential equation is presented in this article. It will overcome the effects of stiffness and reflects the asymptotic behavior of the solution. The new method works well for large values of step size and works well in large domain. The new method is a modified form of the mid-point rule for the stiff problems. The rate of order of convergence is proved to be two both theoretically and numerically. Experimental results show the performance of the method based on the metrics such as stability function, stability region, order star fingers, the rate of order of theoretical and numerical convergence, absolute and relative errors, percentage of numerical solution accuracy and local and global truncation errors both numerically and graphically.},

In this paper, a binary version of the GPC algorithm for solving the 0-1 knapsack problem is proposed. For this purpose, this study uses both accumulative and multiplicative penalty functions as the objective function to determine infeasible solutions. To compare the performance, thirty different datasets have been created and the proposed algorithm has been compared with four popular and state-of-the-art algorithms. Statistical analysis has been used to find a significant difference in the performance of algorithms. The results and statistical analysis show that the proposed algorithm performs better than other metaheuristic algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer is the ultimate severity that escalates as the second root cause for death in the world among women. Several methodologies are adopted in recent times for the analysis and diagnosis of the disease through imaging techniques. The paper aims to propose a computer-assisted approach for the effective classification of severity in breast cancer. The approach makes use of digital mammograms taken from the Mammogram Image Analysis Society database. The features are extracted from the digital mammograms using wavelet families, and the severity of the disease is classified with Ensemble-based algorithms like Random forest (RF), Extra Tree (ET) and AdaBoost (AB), and with a two-level classifier. The proposed two-level classifier comprises of linear discriminant analysis at the first level and nonlinear regression at the second level of classification. The novelty of the paper lies in the successful implementation of the two-level cascaded classifier. The effectiveness of these classifiers is examined using standard classification metrics like accuracy, precision, F1 score, Youden’s index, Matthews correlation coefficient, Jaccard coefficient, and Classification Success Index. For validating the classifier results, analysis using the kappa coefficient is done to compute the agreement amongst binary classifiers. The obtained results indicate that the two-level classifier provides a higher accuracy of 98.75\% that outperforms the classification performance of RF (86.25\%), ET (90\%), and AB (92.5\%) Ensemble classifiers.},

In the literature, fuzzy set and its extension-based clustering methods are utilized to address vagueness for the image segmentation problem. In this work, picture fuzzy set theoretic clustering method has been proposed to enhance MRI image segmentation that is robust to the vague boundary structure, nonlinearity and spatially distributed noise. Most of the related work for handling noise in segmentation process is majorly based on smoothing the image, which results in the loss of fine structure. Moreover, the nonlinearity present in the data leads to inaccurate segmentation result. In this work, we have defined the optimization problem for clustering the pixel intensity values for image segmentation using the picture fuzzy set theoretic approach, which handle the vagueness. Also, we have included a spatial neighborhood information term in the optimization problem of the proposed method that avoids smoothing and preserves fine details in the segmentation process. Further, kernel distance measure is utilized to capture the nonlinear structure present in image in the proposed optimization problem. The experiments are carried out on a synthetic image dataset and two publicly available brain MRI datasets. The comparison with the state-of-the-art methods shows that the proposed picture fuzzy clustering method provides better segmentation performance in terms of average segmentation accuracy and Dice score.},

  abstract     = {One of the most popular structured approaches in risk assessment is Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) that helps in discovering potential failures existing within the design of a product or process. But numerous inadequacies are conjoined with it, for example, Risk Priority Number (RPN) used in FMEA fails to consider the individual effects of the risk factors, thereby neglecting the priority importance of each potential failure modes (PFMs). In this paper, a novel approach, namely, REV method is proposed, where subjective weights of risk factors are determined by using Interval number based Best Worst Method (BWM) to evaluate the weights of risk factors and determine their importance. REV is proposed as an alternative to RPN and aims to improve FMEA that could efficiently handle the vagueness and uncertainty of real-life situations. It is benefitted from decisions of both probability of risk of failure, for assessing the individual influence of the risk factors, as well as priority weights of PFMs from the preference decisions making ability of the MCDM methods with conflicting criteria. It is a user-friendly, flexible approach where suitable MCDM method of choice can be used for obtaining REVs. Here, MCDM techniques of TOPSIS, VIKOR, PROMETHEE and EDAS are used for reviewing individual impacts of PFMs. Furthermore, the proposed approach is endorsed with a case study involving failures in components of submersible pumps used in a power plant. The model is validated using Kendall Tau coefficient computed for different REVs and results are found to be satisfactory (0.849 for TOPSIS-VIKOR, 0.832 for PROMETHEE-EDAS, 0.851 for VIKOR- EDAS and 0.934 for TOPSIS- EDAS).},

  abstract     = {As environmental concerns have grown, the combined economic emission dispatch (CEED) problem has gotten a lot of attention. Both the cost of fuel and the emission pollution caused by it must be kept to a minimum. As a result, this paper presents an innovative hybrid approach (ihPSODE) for solving CEED problems. This hybrid technique incorporated novel differential evolution (nDE) and particle swarm optimization (nPSO). Where nDE introduces an improved mutation and crossover approach (to prevent untimely convergence) as well as nPSO introduces a new acceleration coefficient, inertia weight and position improve equation (to alleviate the stagnation). So as to balance among local and global search ability, after ihPSODE population evaluation, the best half individuals are determined and the rest individuals are discarded. Then, nPSO is used in the current population (to sustain exploration and exploitation) and nDE is employed in the nPSO generated population (to improve convergence accuracy). The competence of the proposed algorithms (ihPSODE, nPSO and nDE) is inspected on 23 unconstrained benchmark function and then solved 3 test system (3-, 6- and 40-unit) of economic load dispatch (ELD) and 3 test system (3-, 10- and 40-unit) of CEED problem.

  abstract     = {Determination of the parameters of metaheuristic methods, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a vital issue. Determining the optimal values of these parameters is a very difficult task and sometimes impossible so we focus on identifying the most important PSO parameters. For this purpose, statistical analysis of the relationship between the performance of the PSO algorithm with the proper selection of the PSO parameters should be done. Thus, unlike the earlier studies, here the most important PSO parameters are statistically determined. In the related literature, PSO parameters are traditionally determined by using trial and error method or specified intuitively. In this study, a new approach for identifying the most important PSO parameters for any optimization problem is proposed by using the factorial design which is one of the most popular and widely used statistical technique in experimental studies. Here, the parameters of the Weibull distribution which has a wide usage in the engineering and statistics literature are estimated just for illustration. It is obvious that identifying the most important PSO parameters via the proposed approach is very important to reduce the dimension of the search space for the PSO parameters. Statistical results obtained from the Monte Carlo simulation study are given and discussed at the end of the paper.},

  abstract     = {In recent times, sentiment analysis research has gained wide popularity. That situation causes the importance of online applications that allow users to express their opinions on events, services, or products through social media applications such as Twitter, Facebook, and Amazon. This paper proposes a novel sentiment classification method according to the fuzzy rule-based system (FRBS) with the crow search algorithm (CSA). FRBS is used to classify the polarity of sentences or documents, and the CSA is employed to optimize the best output from the fuzzy logic algorithm. The FRBS is applied to extract the sentiment and classify its polarity into negative, neutral, and positive. Sometimes, the outputs of the FRBS must be enhanced, especially since many variables are present and the rules between them overlap. For such cases, the CSA is used to solve this limitation faced by FRBS to optimize the outputs of FRBS and achieve the best result. This study compares the performance of the proposed model with different machine learning algorithms, such as SVM, maximum entropy, boosting, and SWESA. It tests the model on three famous data sets collected from Amazon, Yelp, and IMDB. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and achieve competitive performance in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, and the F–score.},

  abstract     = {The trajectory planning for Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the dynamic environments is a challenging task. Many restrictions should be taken into consideration, including dynamic terrain collision, no-fly zone criteria, power and fuel criteria and so on. However, some methods treat dynamic restrictions as static in order to reduce cost and obtain efficient and acceptable paths. To achieve optimal, efficient and acceptable paths, we first use a high-dimension matrix, extended hierarchical graph, to model the unexplored dynamic grid environment and to convert weather conditions to passable coefficient. The original shortest path planning task is then translated to plan the safest path. Therefore, we propose a new forward exploration and backward navigation algorithm, matrix alignment Dijkstra (MAD), to pilot UAVs. We use matrix alignment operation to simulate the parallel exploration process of all cells from time t to $$t+1$$ . This exploration process can be accelerated on a GPU. Finally, we recall the optimal path according to the navigator matrix. In addition, we can achieve UAV path planning from one source cell to multiple target cells within one single run. We validate our method on a real dynamic weather dataset and get competitive results in both efficiency and accuracy. We analyse the performance of MAD on a grid-based benchmark dataset and artificial maze data. Simulated results show MAD is especially helpful when the grid-based environment is large-scale and dynamic.},

This paper presents a systematic and comprehensive effectiveness evaluation method for a constellation satellite communication system under a probabilistic hesitant intuitionistic fuzzy preference relationship (PHIFPR), aiming to address the fuzziness and uncertainty in effectiveness evaluation. First, a proposed definition of PHIFPR describes the hesitancy of evaluators, provides hesitancy distribution information, and depicts the worst negative information and risk preferences in effectiveness evaluation. Then, we deduce the approximate consistency index of PHIFPR and establish a mathematical programming model to increase individual consistency when the approximate consistency index does not reach a predetermined level. In the sequel, a proposed group consensus index uses the PHIFPR-based Hausdorff distance to measure the closeness between evaluators’ judgments. Afterwards, a consistency and consensus improvement model is designed to retain the original opinions of evaluators to make the consistency and consensus of PHIFPRs acceptable. Moreover, a goal programming model is established to gain the approximate priority weights of schemes regarding the approximate consistency condition of a PHIFPR as a fuzzy constraint. Finally, an experimental example is offered to highlight the practicability and feasibility of the proposed method, and some comparative analyses with other methods offer insights into the designed method.},

Such circumstances lead to the propagation and production of an inaccurate news article. Also, misinformation and fake news are increased by the user without proper verification. Hence, it is necessary to restrict the spreading of fake information on mass media and to promote confidence all over the world. For this purpose, this paper recognizes the detection of fake news in an effective manner. The proposed methodology in detecting fake news consists of four different phases namely the data pre-processing phase, feature reduction phase, feature extraction phase as well as the classification phase. During data pre-processing, the input data are pre-processed by employing tokenization, stop-words deletion as well as stemming. In the second phase, the features are reduced by employing PPCA to enhance accuracy. Then the extracted feature is provided to the classification phase where LSTM-LF algorithm is utilized to classify the news as fake or real optimally. Furthermore, this paper utilizes four different datasets namely the Buzzfeed dataset, GossipCop dataset, ISOT dataset as well as Politifact dataset for evaluation. The performance evaluation and the comparative analysis are conducted and the analysis reveals that the proposed approach provides better performances when compared to other fake detection-based approaches.},

Results imply that (1) among the 5 candidate tunneling methods, the shield tunnel boring machine (TBM) is determined as the optimal method to excavate the tunnel section in the case; (2) the inconsistency in results occurs during the simulation in the presence of uncertainty, where there is 13\% probability that soft-rock TBM will rank first in the case study; (3) with the increase of Entropy in cloud models, the degree of inconsistency will grow significantly.

  abstract     = {Farm tourism is an emerging agenda within the rural tourism literature due to its potential in diversifying income on farms. Despite such potential, issues associated with sustainability became a direct consequence of its growth. However, developing an overarching sustainability evaluation framework is scarce in the domain literature, with an exemption from a recently reported work proposing fuzzy multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods to generate a composite performance score. This work augments the previous computational framework by reducing the mental workload of stakeholders and decision-makers in eliciting judgments required in the evaluation process. It integrates the fuzzy full consistency method (FUCOM) and fuzzy weighted sum method (WSM) into a holistic platform that assigns an aggregate sustainability performance of farm tourism sites. The fuzzy FUCOM assigns the priority weights of sustainable tourism indicators, while the fuzzy WSM generates the composite score. Integrating fuzzy set theory in the evaluation platform addresses the vagueness and uncertainty in the decision-making process. Five farm tourism sites in the Philippines are evaluated to demonstrate the proposed methodology. Findings show that the indicators associated with capability training of local tourism personnel, employment opportunities for the locals, development of an integrated tourism and development plan, and curbing waste generation are deemed the most crucial sustainability indicators. The application of the proposed framework generates the composite sustainability indices for all sites, which can be used for comparing various sites’ performance, identifying hotspots, and benchmarking for best practices. Policy insights for these findings are discussed. Finally, a comparative analysis shows that the proposed method is comparable to other time-consuming MCDM methods.},

The interdependency of heat and power outputs of CHP units and valve point loading effects of power-only units make this problem very nonlinear and non-convex. So far, a wide variety of optimization algorithms based on simulation of various natural phenomena have been proposed and applied to solve this complex problem, claiming that the proposed algorithm is better than the similar optimization algorithms in terms of accuracy and run-time. In this paper, the CHPED problem is investigated in different case studies by using the imperialist competitive Harris hawks optimization (ICHHO) algorithm, as a combination of the imperialist competitive algorithm and Harris hawks optimization. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is first evaluated by testing it on the standard cases of 5, and 7 units as small-scale systems and 48-unit as the large-scale test system, considering the electrical losses. Also for the first time, the multi-zone CHPED (MZCHPED) problem is solved by a metaheuristic algorithm. The obtained results show that ICHHO algorithm reduces the operating costs in the range of 0.02–1.1\%, compared to the best-reported results, in different single-zone CHPED (SZCHPED) problems. Also, the MZCHPED results, prove the effective performance of the algorithm compared to the similar SZCHPED problem.},

Previous studies in organizational stress management have mainly focused on identifying job stressors and their effects on organizations. Contrary to the previous studies, this paper aims to propose a comprehensive decision-support system that includes identifying stressors, assessing organizational stress levels, and providing solutions to improve the performance of the organization. A questionnaire is designed and distributed among 170 senior managers of a major project-based organization in the field of the energy industry in Iran to determine organizational stressors. Based on the questionnaire results and considering the best worst method (BWM) as an approach to determine the weighting vector, the importance degree of each stressor is calculated. In the next stage, a decision-support model is developed to assess the stress level of a PBO through fuzzy inference systems (FIS). Some main advantages of the proposed hybrid decision-support model include (i) achieving high-reliable results by not-so-time-consuming computational volume and (ii) maintaining flexibility in adding new criteria to assess the occupational stress levels in PBOs. Based on the obtained results, six organizational stressors, including job incongruity, poor organizational structure, poor project environment, work overload, poor job promotion, and type A behavior, are identified. It is also found that the level of organizational stress is not ideal. Finally, some main recommendations are proposed to manage occupational stresses at the optimum level in the considered sector.},

The success of FNN is primarily attributed to its architecture, the optimization technique used, and the tuning of hyper-parameters to identify different patterns in data. This study tries to find an optimization technique that will play a vital role in an FNN to get better results. Whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is one of the popular nature-inspired optimization techniques used to solve real-time sciences and engineering problems. A new optimization approach namely chaotic oppositional-based whale optimization algorithm (COWOA) is developed in this paper, for the first time, to discuss the FNN problems of four different dataset by integrating chaotic function and oppositional-based learning with WOA. Simulation results are presented to validate the success of the suggested COWOA approach and demonstrate its dominance over basic WOA, chaotic WOA (CWOA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), Adam optimization algorithm (AOA), and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for both unimodal and multimodal dataset problems. The comparative analysis with other optimization techniques validates its superiority and robustness on four standard dataset of FNN problem. Furthermore, to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, a statistical analysis is performed.

  abstract     = {Regression testing is essential for continuous integration and continuous development. It is needed to ensure that the modifications have not produced any errors or faults, thereby maintaining the quality and reliability of the software. The testers usually avoid exhaustive retesting because it requires lots of effort and time. The test case prioritization and minimization solve the issue by scheduling the critical test cases and removing redundant ones. Optimization techniques help by improving the efficiency of these techniques while utilizing limited resources. This paper proposed an enhanced discrete novel bat algorithm for the test case prioritization. The algorithm is modified in two ways. First, we have proposed a fix-up mechanism for the discrete combinatorial problem, which conducts the perturbation in the population using the asexual reproduction algorithm. Second, the novel bat algorithm is improved, where the bats hunt in different habitats with quantum behavior using Gaussian distribution and search in the limited habitat with Doppler effect. In addition, we have embedded the test case minimization procedure in the algorithm for redundancy reduction. The experimental results are empirically analyzed using different testing criteria, i.e., fault and statement coverage on three subject programs from the software infrastructure repository. Consequently, test selection percentage, coverage loss, fault detection loss, and cost reduction percentages are deduced for the test case minimization at program and version levels. Empirical results and statistical comparisons with the random search, bat algorithm, novel bat algorithm, birds swarm algorithm, whale optimization algorithm, and genetic algorithm show the outperformance of the proposed algorithm.},

The quality of routing has a direct impact on the network quality of FANETs, and the design of routing protocols becomes a very challenging topic. In this paper, we study the characteristics of dynamic routing, combine the characteristics of FANETs themselves, and use the energy of nodes, bandwidth, link stability, etc., as the metric of routing and use a Boltzmann machine for routing search to form an optimized dynamic routing protocol. The NS3 simulator is used to compare and study the traditional MANET dynamic routing methods AODV and DSR, and the simulation results show that the routes obtained by using the Boltzmann machine search are better than those of AODV and DSR in many aspects, such as end-to-end average delay, average route survival time and control overhead.},

Prior studies are limited on solving mixed integer model, which are not efficient for large-scale scenario. However, this is not practical in real cases as the computation time to obtain the solution is longer due to number of combinations of packages and participants anticipated in the last-mile delivery platform. Four multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) with the decomposed winner determination problem model are experimented. This study is able to yield Pareto optimal solutions from multiple runs of mixed linear integer programming (MILP) using different objectives weights in the model. Unmanned aerial vehicle, or drone, has potential to reduce cost and save time for last-mile logistic operations. The result positively shows MOEAs are more efficient than MILP in yielding a set of feasible solutions for undertaking complex winner determination problem models. The percentage of improvement in terms of time spent identifying the best option is almost 100\%. This is likely an unprecedented research in drone where combinatorial double auction is applied to complex drone delivery services and MOEAs are used to solve the associated winner determination problem model.},

  abstract     = {Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in proteins are the regions that lack a stable two-dimensional or three-dimensional structure. Due to their high degree of flexibility, these regions are required for a variety of cellular functions. The IDRs are determined experimentally using X-ray crystallography and NMR. Numerous computational techniques for IDR prediction have been developed, but due to the certain unknown amino acid properties and interactions, these techniques have a low predictive rate. IDR-amino acid enrichment analyses on protein chains with varying structural and physicochemical properties have shed light on a variety of features of IDRs. Additionally, repetitions of certain specific amino acids that appear to be preferentially present in the IDRs were observed. Following that, a deep neural network model inspired by natural language processing techniques was trained to learn amino acid features for the classification of IDRs and non-IDRs. We portrayed amino acids as single letters that comprise the proteome&#39;s language. Our method outperformed other IDR prediction tools currently available. This study can assist researchers in comprehending IDR constituents and utilizing NLP techniques for processing genomic or proteomic language in order to gain additional insight from them.

In this paper, a novel hybridized navigational controller is proposed using the logic of both statistical technique and computational intelligence method for path planning of bipeds. The proposed path controller is a hybridization of regression analysis with adaptive particle swarm optimization. The inputs given to the regression controller are in the forms of obstacle distances, and the output of the regression controller is interim turning angle. The output interim turning angle is again fed to the adaptive particle swarm optimization controller along with other inputs. The output of the adaptive particle swarm optimization controller termed as final turning angle acts as the directing factor for smooth navigation of bipeds in a cluttered environment. The proposed navigational controller is experimented for a bipedal robot in simulation and experimental environments. The outputs from various simulations and experimental results are compared and good agreement between navigational parameters like path length and path time is observed. Again a better efficacy has been observed by comparing the designed hybridization technique with an existing approach which validates the novel approach.},

However, extending the existing algorithms without further changes to the algorithms themselves would not be efficient since there are the different characteristics between the kNN queries and top-k queries. For example, the kNN queries are more distance-sensitive rather than the position of data points. Second, it is necessary to add some novel parallel heuristics and pruning policies for the kNN queries. Third, there are still many redundant random accesses among FA, TA, and BPA. In this paper, we address aforementioned these problems and take these algorithms to answer parallel kNN (PkNN) queries in spatial databases. We integrate the advantages of the B + -tree and Open MP programming and propose three efficient parallel kNN query algorithms, namely distance priority-based PkNN, optimized PkNN, and partition-based PkNN. Our performance evaluation shows that our proposed algorithms achieve significant improvement in comparison with existing algorithms, i.e., BPA and BPA2. In addition, our approaches are also capable of returning kNN results incrementally which greatly shorten the query response time and enhance user experience.},

Nevertheless, due to the increased geometric complexity of labyrinth weirs, determination of accurate discharge coefficients and accordingly, head-discharge ratings are quite essential issues in practical application. Hence, as a first step the present study proposes the following eight standalone algorithms: decision table (DT), Kstar, least median square (LMS), M5 prime (M5P), M5 rule (M5R), pace regression (PR), random forest (RF) and sequential minimal optimization (SMO). Then, applying the stacking (ST) algorithm, these standalone models were hybridized to predict the discharge coefficient (Cd) for sharp-crested labyrinth weirs. Potential/effective variables were constructed in the form of several independent dimensionless parameters (i.e., θ, h/W, L/B, L/h, Froude number (Fr), B/W and L/W) to predict Cd as an output. The accuracy of the developed models was examined in terms of different statistical visually based and quantitative-based error measurement criteria. The results illustrate that h/W and B/W parameters have the highest and lowest effect on the Cd prediction, respectively. According to NSE, all developed algorithms provided accurate performances, while ST-Kstar had the highest prediction power.},

The initial statistical and convergence profile assessment showed better performance of the proposed algorithm. The comparative analyses for transient and frequency responses were performed for the PID-controlled FES system using the original AOA, sine–cosine and particle swarm optimization algorithms and the traditional Ziegler-Nichols tuning scheme.

The quality of a facility&#39;s location has a direct impact on the company&#39;s output and operations. As a result, businesses need to develop scientific and effective methodologies for assessing facility location issues and making informed decisions.

This research focuses on the current state of the location problem, with an emphasis on the mathematical model and a genetic algorithm in the analysis and analytical approach of the location problem. In this regard, a sustainable supply chain network model has been developed. A real-coded genetic algorithm-based solution approach has been developed for optimizing the sustainable supply chain network design for Srinagar city. Using the input data as a search space for the solving procedure, the resulting solution will provide us with the ideal site selection points. A model for a long-term supply chain network has been established in this regard. For optimizing the sustainable supply chain network architecture for Srinagar city, a real-coded genetic algorithm-based solution strategy has been created.

Planning problems with small search space can be solved by exhaustive exploration of the search space, whereas the big search space of some problems exposes the search space explosion due to computational limitations. This subject motivates us to propose an approach using DL techniques for solving such planning problems. The proposed approach tries to learn the knowledge about the application order of actions, before solving the given (main) planning problem. Actually, it reduces the size of the given planning problem such that it can be solved by exhaustive exploration of the search space. After solving the reduced problem successfully, a DNN is learned from the explored search space. The proposed approach then employs the learned DNN to solve the given planning problem. The proposed approach deals with the planning problems specified through graph transformations language because of its superiorities compared to planning domain definition languages. The main contribution of the proposed approach is that it uses DL techniques, for the first time, to solve planning problems specified through graph transformations.

Then, it is combined with support vector regression (SVR) to predict the discharge coefficient parameter of triangular labyrinth weirs. The proposed Walnut-SVR method takes a set of observations as inputs specified by five non-dimensional features and attempts to find the discharge coefficient of unseen records. Walnut algorithm is proposed for feature selection, and optimum values of SVR parameters are found. The proposed method is evaluated using the Kumar dataset and compared with several counterpart methods. The results show the superiority of the Walnut-SVR method compared to other counterparts with $$R^2 =0.986$$ , $$RMSE= 0.004$$ , $$SI=0.006$$ , $$\sigma =0.858$$ , and $$NSE=0.981$$ on test dataset.

  abstract     = {We study the optimal decisions of a supplier in terms of channel structure selection and marketing effort strategy when facing a competitor offering substitutable products. By employing game theoretic models for different retail competition scenarios, we show that equilibrium channel structures are primarily determined by the intensity of retail competition along with the marketing effort level. Channel structure selection and marketing effort strategy are interdependent and interactive. Our results show that the supplier has an incentive to make marketing effort and sell products directly to consumers in most cases. When the retail competition becomes fiercer, the supplier can benefit from selecting a distribution strategy based on customers’ sensitivity to the supplier’s marketing effort. In contrast, the supplier selling products through the downstream retailer will not make marketing effort under certain market conditions (e.g., low competition and high customer sensitivity to the supplier’s effort performance), while the competitor adopts the direct-sales strategy. Generally, the supplier will prefer making marketing effort relative to undertaking product distribution. Finally, we also examine the strategic effects of channel structure selection and marketing effort decisions on the competitor’s profit in the retail competition market.},

  abstract     = {The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is a widely accepted and applied tool among all multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. Conventionally, TOPSIS finds the relative closeness weight to the ideal solution according to the preference of a single decision-maker. In other words, it fails to integrate the preferences obtained from a group of decision-makers in a decision-making problem. Since the first TOPSIS was proposed, many aggregation preference procedures such as geometric or arithmetic mean using multiple decision-makers have been developed. It is clear that the most previously applied methods are overwhelmingly sensitive to the data outliers that subsequently limit information regarding overall preferences obtained from all decision-makers. This study proposes an innovative methodology by developing a Bayesian TOPSIS (B-TOPSIS) model to aggregate the final weight of alternatives for a group of decision-makers. For this purpose, the TOPSIS framework is modified by considering a probabilistic perspective. The hierarchical Bayesian model is presented to obtain the vector weight for the availability of multiple decision-makers. To illustrate the efficiency and feasibility of the introduced B-TOPSIS, selecting a proper corrosion treatment plan in an oil and gas industrial sector as a real case study has been applied. The results obtained from B-TOPSIS were compared with the conventional TOPSIS results. The priority of alternatives is Biocide treatment, Pigging, Combination Biocide treatment and Pigging, and Monitoring and control parameter over time. The outcomes confirm that the proposed model has a significant advantage because it uses much more information than the original form of TOPSIS.},

Although the LSTM can handle uncertain, sequential, and nonlinear data, the biggest challenge in it is optimizing its weights and bias. The back-propagation through time algorithm has a drawback to overfit the data and being stuck in local minima. Thus, we proposed PSO-based hybrid deep learning model for evolving the initial weights of LSTM and fully connected layer (FCL). Furthermore, we introduced an adaptive approach for improving the inertia coefficient of PSO using the velocity of particles. The proposed method is an aggregation of adaptive PSO and Adam optimizer for training the LSTM. The adaptive PSO attempts to evolve the initial weights in different layers of the LSTM network and FCL. This research also compares the forecasting efficacy of the proposed method to the genetic algorithm (GA)-based hybrid LSTM model, the Elman neural network (ENN), and standard LSTM. Experimental findings demonstrate that the suggested model is successful in achieving the optimum initial weights and bias of the LSTM and FC layers, as well as superior forecasting accuracy.},

  abstract     = {In this research work, a modified fuzzy approach referred to as modified fuzzy logic method (MFLM) is proposed to more conveniently solve intricate decision-making problems under uncertainty and data deficiency. The method resolves major drawbacks like inaccuracy, complexity, and a high volume of computational efforts with the existing approaches for the mentioned problems. Here, MFLM is applied to materials selection for a cryogenic storage tank and a gas turbine blade, which are standard engineering problems used for verification by researchers, and the ranking results are compared with the state-of-the-art techniques in the literature, such as the conventional fuzzy logic method. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient is used to measure the similarity between the offered rankings. The results show that MFLM, despite its simplicity, provides comparable outputs to the novel existing approaches. The average correlation between MFLM and considered techniques is about 90\%, demonstrating a high level of agreement between rankings. MFLM offers SS 301-FH and CMSX-4 materials as the best alternatives for cryogenic storage tank and gas turbine blade examples, respectively. The mentioned materials are confirmed by both industry and other studied techniques and obtained by solving the problem in the fuzzy domain to incorporate uncertainties. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the robustness of the proposed method. MFLM indicates to be relatively insensitive to variations in criteria weightings.},

  abstract     = {Two goals of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are effectively improving their convergence and diversity and making the Pareto set evenly distributed and close to the real Pareto front. At present, the challenges to be solved by the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm are to improve the convergence and diversity of the algorithm, and how to better solve functions with complex PF and/or PS shapes. Therefore, this paper proposes a gray wolf optimization-based self-organizing fuzzy multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Gray wolf optimization algorithm is used to optimize the initial weights of the self-organizing map network. New neighborhood relationships for individuals are built by self-organizing map, which can maintain the invariance of feature distribution and map the structural information of the current population into Pareto sets. Based on this neighborhood relationship, this paper uses the fuzzy differential evolution operator, which constructs a fuzzy inference system to dynamically adjust the weighting parameter in the differential operator, to generate a new initial solution, and the polynomial mutation operator to refine them. Boundary processing is then conducted. Experiments on 15 problems of GLT1-6 and WFG1-9 and the algorithm proposed in this paper achieve the best on 18 values. And the result shows that the convergence and diversity of the proposed algorithm are better than several state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.},

The main purpose is to jointly determine the manufacturer’s production and delivery strategies and the retailers’ replenishment strategies to maximize the integrated total profit. First, the individual total profit functions of the manufacturer and multiple retailers are established and are integrated to form the total profit function of the supply chain system. Then, to address the model complexity, an algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal solution. Several practical numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the solution procedure, and a sensitivity analysis is performed on the major parameters. From the numerical results, several findings that differ from those in the previous literature were observed. First, retailers with larger market scale, better cost control, and/or inspection capabilities guarantee higher individual and integrated total profits. Second, increasing the deterioration rates of raw materials and finished products has different effects on the order quantity of raw materials. Third, the manufacturer’s shipping strategy is rigid and not easily changed except for significant changes (increase or decrease by 20\%) to the production rate or selling price. The performance of the proposed model has several meaningful management implications.},

Furthermore, after a 10/15-year period their situation tends to worse, resulting in what is considered the second phase of multiple sclerosis. While treatments are now available to reduce the symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease, the administration of drugs must be adapted to the course of the disease, and predicting relapsing periods and the worsening of the symptoms can greatly improve the outcome of the treatment. For this reason, indicators such as the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) have been largely used to support early diagnosis and prediction of future relapsing periods in patients affected by multiple sclerosis. However, such indicators are insufficient, as the prediction they provide is often not accurate enough. In this paper, machine learning techniques have been applied to data obtained from clinical trial, in order to improve the prediction capabilities and provide doctors with an additional instrument to evaluate the clinical situation of patients. After the application of correlation indicators and the use of principal component analysis for the reduction of the dimensionality of the feature space, classification algorithms have been applied and compared, in order to identify the best suiting one for our purposes. After the application of re-balance algorithms, the accuracy of the machine learning-based prediction system reaches 79\%, demonstrating the capability of the framework to correctly predict future progression of disability.},

As the mobile internet develops, the issue of human body reconstruction toward virtual try-on needs to be tackled. This paper proposes a rapid human body reconstruction method for virtual try-on based on multidimensional dense net (MDD-Net) on mobile terminal. MDD-Net takes fusion features as input and predicts 3D human body model. The acquisition of fusion features and the display of 3D human body are implemented on mobile toward virtual try-on. In the learning fuzzy anthropometric feature module, the example-guided fuzzy anthropometric feature matrix is acquired and default coding elements are interpolated. In the learning multi-perspective silhouette feature module, the fine human body shape features are learned based on DenseNet201. A related fusion feature data set is generated for the training and testing of MDD-Net. Compared to shape pose estimation models, the shape representation spaces of HMR and SMPLify are only 20.34\% and 7.59\% of our method, and their prediction accuracies are approximately 50\% of our method. Compared to accurate shape estimation models, our method is more robust against the pose and perspective noise. The prediction accuracies of our method are improved by 13.34\%, 55.77\%, 34.6\%, and 43.4\%, 37.2\% 9.0\% on four test sets. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority of our method for human body shape estimation toward virtual try-on.},

Cq-ROFSs provide more freedom for people handling uncertainty and vagueness by the truth and falsity grades on the condition that the sum of the q-powers of the real part and imaginary part is within the unit interval. Further, Frank operational laws are an extended form of Archimedes&#39; T mode and Archimedes&#39; S mode and Frank aggregation operators have a certain parameter which makes them more flexible and more generalized than many other aggregation operators in the process of information fusion. The objectives of this paper are to extend the Frank operations to the complex q-rung orthopair fuzzy environment and to introduce their score function and accuracy function. Meanwhile, some complex q-rung fuzzy Frank aggregation operators are developed, such as the complex q-rung orthopair fuzzy Frank weighted averaging (Cq-ROFFWA) operator, the complex q-rung orthopair fuzzy Frank weighted geometric (Cq-ROFFWG) operator, and the complex q-rung orthopair fuzzy Frank ordered weighted averaging (Cq-ROFFOWA) operator, and their special cases are discussed. In addition, an innovative MADM method is introduced according to the propounded operators to deal with multi-attribute decision-making problems under the complex q-rung orthopair fuzzy environment.

In this paper, we use topological methods to study attribute reduction problems in relation systems. In the past studies, the topological reduction algorithm applied to arbitrary binary relations had not been proposed. To fill the gap, we propose the concept of topological reduction of relation systems based on binary relations without any other additional constraints. To identify all reductions, we define a discernibility matrix for this kind of reduction and develop its corresponding reduction algorithm. Finally, we conducted several experiments on five UCI datasets using six classification algorithms and two clustering algorithms to check our theoretical results.

In response to this problem, we proposed a new BPA visualization method based on the vector representation of the BPA to illustrate the image of BPA directly. First, the basic point and the uncertain vectors could be obtained by the given BPA, and then we connected these components to construct the image of BPA. Through the image of BPA, we can effectively analyze the interaction effect of focal elements in BPA and observe the potential characteristics of BPA directly. For example, the uncertainty of focal elements can be expressed by geometric area. Moreover, the geometric meanings of parameters in the vector representation of the BPA can be explained.

The advantage of this method is the use of a single current sensor. Indeed, we can detect online, the fault and the number of broken bars with a variable load. The obtained results are very satisfactory. Some results were verified by simulations under MATLAB/Simulink and validated experimentally via dSPACE 1104 card.},

  abstract     = {Over the last decade, popularity and fascination for social networks have exponentially increased. This rapid growth has triggered cybercriminals to utilize social networks for their malicious activities like social network spam. This risk and danger in social networking sites urge the need for an accurate and efficient spam detection model. Traditionally, supervised and unsupervised classification algorithms are used to identify social network spam. But spammers often change their behavior to evade spam filtering techniques. This results in huge data volatility. Traditional techniques are, therefore, sometimes ineffective in filtering spam in the social network. Hence, this work proposes to use a feed-forward neural network that can use the hidden relationship in this complex data for spam detection model. To improve the model’s accuracy and to speed up the training process, important hyperparameters such as learning rate, momentum term, architecture of neural network, activation function, training algorithm, initial weights ranges, and initial tuning of weights are necessary. As there is no general and predefined method available for this process, a reinforcement learning and k-Norm factor-based shuffled frog leaping algorithm to find the optimum set of neural network parameters is proposed in this paper. In the first stage, learning rate and momentum parameters in the continuous variable range are tuned using reinforcement learning. In the second stage, the best possible combinations of remaining parameter values are chosen using the proposed modified shuffled frog leaping algorithm that uses k-Norm to improve the exploitation. Experiments were carried out for the Tip spam dataset and Twitter dataset on a feed-forward neural network with tuned parameters. The results prove that the proposed algorithm achieves higher accuracy and lower false positive rate when compared to other existing techniques.},

In metaheuristic methods, some search directions are randomly selected and the resulting information gradually progresses toward the optimal solution. Since along the gradient direction usually yields the largest decrease in the desired function, it is added to the GSA and PSO process to allow for faster and more accurate convergence. By integrating the metaheuristic methods with the gradient directions, a powerful method for optimizing functions has been made possible. A novel approach is introduced by merging two metaheuristic methods with the randomly generated steepest decent directions. Numerous examples of unconstrained problems of mathematical functions of CEC2005 and CEC2017 together with some constrained examples of stress and displacement structural design problems have been chosen to demonstrate the reliability and capability of the presented method. Comparison of the numerical results with some methods indicates that the average rank of the proposed technique is better.},

The confinement provided by spiral stirrups let concrete under the triaxial compression state and improved the compressive strength of concrete. However, the relationships between concrete and stirrups were complex and the existing prediction models for evaluating the compressive strength of confined concrete were various. In this paper, an adaptive neural-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model was developed to evaluate the compressive strength of concrete confined with stirrups. A set of 231 experimental results of concrete confined with spiral stirrups were collected from the previous studies to establish a reliable database. The investigated parameters included the aspect ratio of specimens, the diameter, spacing, yield strength, and volumetric ratio of stirrups, the ratio of longitudinal reinforcement, and the compressive strength of concrete. The results showed that the ANFIS model predicted the compressive strength of confined concrete accurately. By comparing with existing models, the proposed ANFIS model had high applicable and reliability. The effects of the investigated parameters on the compressive strength of concrete were analyzed based on the proposed ANFIS model.},

This model integrates and associates the hesitant environment with information regarding the existence of grades or star ratings. In this research article, we introduce a multi-attribute decision-making technique known as hesitant fuzzy N-soft ELECTRE-I, which computes the decision-maker assessments in an adjustable and formative manner. The proposed method also improves the robustness and accuracy of the decisions relying on grades or star ratings. Thus it lays a bedrock for subsequent analysis and applications.

Available data are often nonlinear and real-valued, but samples are often derived from uncertain assessments, without adhering to any statistical assumptions. Furthermore, to provide the degree of variation associated with forecasts, it is preferable to estimate an interval consisting of the upper and lower bounds, rather than a single predicted value at each time period. Although non-statistical grey prediction is appropriate in such situations, previous interval grey prediction models were bounded. This study thus develops a neural-network-based interval grey prediction model and focus on the evaluation of the reliability of estimated intervals. In light of the importance of printed circuit boards (PCBs) to the manufacture of electrical and electronic products, the performance of the proposed model was verified by forecasting PCB product values.

The key concept of SLDE is to allow a DE population to learn the capabilities of different search strategies and automatically adjust itself to potential search strategies. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated on a set of generated data based on a real-case scenario of a medical product distribution centre; subsequently, the performance results are compared with results obtained from other metaheuristics.

Therefore, the accurate prediction of DDADRs is beneficial to human health and pharmaceutical researches. Currently, existing machine learning-based methods focus on a single feature. In this paper, we propose a novel method, MS-ADR, to extract multi-source features and predict DDADRs. First, we obtain four biomedical views by using four drug signed networks, respectively, namely enzyme view, indication view, side effect view, and transporter view. Then, different biomedical views are fed into graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) to extract multi-source features. Second, we propose an attention block to merge multi-source features from different biomedical views. Finally, a reconstructed drug–drug adverse reaction network is embedded to predict DDADR. The experiment shows that MS-ADR achieves better performance compared with other start-of-the-art baselines.},

According to the Most Economic Advantageous Tender criterion, in order to analyze a number of tenders, a group of experts has to consider different criteria, both of qualitative and quantitative nature. Selecting the best tender involves the solution of a multi-criteria choice problem. Indeed, in Italy, the National Anti-Corruption Authority suggested the use of traditional multiple criteria methods to evaluate the qualitative component and provided details on how aggregate the evaluations related to single criteria to derive the ranking of tenders. However, they are rarely used in practice and may have some application drawbacks. This paper aims at proposing the use of ELECTRE (ELimination Et Choix Traduisant the Realité) III and P-AHP (parsimonious analytic hierarchy process) as the more effective methods for analyzing public tenders when a great number of alternatives and/or the heterogeneity of scales are involved. The use of the proposed methodologies is completely innovative in the practice, in the Italian context. Furthermore, we carry out a comparative study among these multi-criteria methods and analyze the strengths and the weaknesses of each method in order to help the DMs to identify the more appropriate method. Moreover, we aim to develop easier and user-friendly models that sound practical in the public tender context. The potential advantages of the proposed approach are validated by a real-life contractor-selection case. The results show that the rankings obtained by ELECTRE III and P-AHP are almost the same.},

To answer the question, we construct a four-party evolutionary game model, considering the citizens&#39; two participation ways consisted of true evaluation and false evaluation, and the new media&#39;s two participation ways consisted of report after verification and report without verification. This is of more practical significance than simply studying whether citizens and new media participate in emergency management or not because citizen and new media participation does not represent the completely positive behavior. Then, we conduct the evolutionary stability analysis, solve the stable equilibrium points using the Lyapunov first method and conduct the simulation analysis with MATLAB 2020b. The results show that, firstly, the greater the probability of citizens making true evaluation, the more inclined the government department is to strictly implement the emergency management system; secondly, when the probability of citizens making true evaluation decreases, new media are more inclined to report after verification, and when new media lose more pageview value or should be punished more for reporting without verification, the probability that they report without verification is smaller; thirdly, the greater the probability of citizens making false evaluation, the less enthusiasm of pharmaceutical enterprises to participate in emergency management, which indicates that false evaluation is detrimental to prompt pharmaceutical enterprises to participate; what&#39;s more, the greater the probability of new media reporting after verification, the greater the probability of pharmaceutical enterprises actively participating, which shows that new media&#39;s verification to citizens&#39; evaluation is beneficial to emergency management.},

Research results show that website reputation and website trust have a significant positive impact on privacy disclosure; users’ online privacy concerns will play a mediating role in website reputation, website trust, and privacy disclosure; when users with online privacy concerns are doing privacy calculations of perceived risks and perceived benefits are carried out during privacy disclosure. However, privacy calculations are contextual. On the premise of website trust, the benefits of information disclosure can reduce users’ online privacy concerns and increase users’ privacy disclosure behaviors. This article exposes that users will adopt privacy disclosure decisions with different levels of cognitive effort based on the degree of online privacy concerns, enriches research on privacy disclosure behavior, and exposes the contextual nature of privacy calculus, which further enriches and expands the theory of privacy calculus. Promote online websites to obtain user data and provide relevant countermeasures and suggestions.},

  abstract     = {Considering that converting linear ordinal ranking (LOR) information into interval utility values can not only improve the computability of LOR information but also explore the degree of preference for different alternatives for decision-makers hidden behind LOR information, this paper proposes a conversion-based LOR aggregation method to aggregate LOR information under risk. Given that the behaviours of decision-makers are influenced by risk, this paper adopts prospect theory to depict the decision-makers’ behaviours under risk in the conversion-based aggregation process. To achieve this, the information energy for LOR is constructed firstly, and its features are analysed, which makes a basis for the conversion process. After that, the details about how to integrate the prospect theory with variable reference points into the conversion-based aggregation framework are presented. Finally, an example (exploring the financial product preferences of a group of respondents) evidences the practicality of the proposed method. Further, some analyses and discussions are conducted to verify the rationality and stability of the method.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new hybrid genetic-particle swarm optimization (GPSO) algorithm for solving multi-constrained optimization problems. This algorithm is different from the traditional GPSO algorithm, which adopts genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) in series, and it combines PSO and GA through parallel architecture, so as to make full use of the high efficiency of PSO and the global optimization ability of GA. The algorithm takes PSO as the main body and runs PSO at the initial stage of optimization, while GA does not participate in operation. When the global best value (gbest) does not change for successive generations, it is assumed that it falls into local optimum. At this time, GA is used to replace PSO for particle selection, crossover and mutation operations to update particles and help particles jump out of local optimum. In addition, the GPSO adopts adaptive inertia weight, adaptive mutation parameters and multi-point crossover operation between particles and personal best value (pbest) to improve the optimization ability of the algorithm. Finally, this paper uses a nonlinear constraint problem (Himmelblau’s nonlinear optimization problem) and three structural optimization problems (pressure vessel design problem, the welded beam design problem and the gear train design problem) as test functions and compares the proposed GPSO with the traditional GPSO, dingo optimization algorithm, whale optimization algorithm and grey wolf optimizer. The performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm is carried out by using the evaluation indexes such as best value, mean value, median value, worst value, standard deviation, operation time and convergence speed. The comparison results show that the proposed GPSO has obvious advantages in finding the optimal value, convergence speed and time overhead.},

However, MVO suffers from a lack of diversity which may trapping of local minima, and premature convergence. This paper introduces two steps of improving the basic MVO algorithm. The first step is using opposition-based learning (OBL) in MVO, called OMVO. The OBL aids to speed up the searching and improving the learning technique for selecting a better generation of candidate solutions of basic MVO. The second stage, called OMVOD, combines the disturbance operator (DO) and OMVO to improve the consistency of the chosen solution by providing a chance to solve the given problem with a high fitness value and increase diversity. To test the performance of the proposed models, fifteen CEC 2015 benchmark functions problems, thirty CEC 2017 benchmark functions problems and seven CEC 2011 real-world problems were used in both phases of the enhancement. The second step, known as OMVOD, incorporates the disruption operator (DO) and OMVO to improve the accuracy of the chosen solution by giving a chance to solve the given problem with a high fitness value while also increasing variety.

These algorithms are frequently preferred for these real-world problems as they need less information, are reliable and robust, and have a structure that can easily be applied to discrete problems. Too many algorithms result in difficulty choosing the correct technique for the problem, and selecting an unwise method affects the solution quality. In addition, some algorithms cannot be reliable for some specific real-world problems but very successful for others. In order to guide and give insight into the practitioners and researchers about this problem, studies involving the comparison and evaluation of the performance of algorithms are needed. In this study, the performances of six nature-inspired methods, which included five new implementations of differential evolutionary algorithms (DE), scatter search (SS), equilibrium optimizer (EO), marine predators algorithm (MPA), and honey badger algorithm (HBA) applied to land redistribution problem and genetic algorithms (GA), were compared. In order to compare the algorithms in detail, various performance indicators were used as problem based and algorithm based. Experimental results showed that DE and SS algorithms have a more successful performance than the other methods by solution quality, robustness, and many problem-based indicators.},

  abstract     = {This paper is to integrate among solid transportation problem, budget constraints and carbon emission with probable maximum profit. The range of air pollution and climate change are effected by $${\text {CO}_2}$$ gas emission and other greenhouse gases from myriad transportation systems. Henceforth, our target is to minimize carbon emission for pollution-free environment. Transportation system with single objective is hardly applicable to the situation with more than one criterion. Therefore multi-objective decision making is incorporated for designing real-life transportation problem. Due to time pressure, data limitation, lack of information or measurement errors in practical problems, there exist some hesitations. Based on the fact, decision maker considers indeterminacy in the designed problems. To overcome such hesitancy of occurrence and non-occurrence in fuzzy and intuitionistic fuzzy, neutrosophic set is very important and suitable to accommodate such general structure of problems. Therefore neutrosophic environment with neutrosophic linear programming, fuzzy programming and global criterion method is utilized here to find the compromise solution of the multi-objective transportation problem. Thereafter, the performance of the considered model is useful by evaluating a numerical example, and then the derived results are compared. Finally sensitivity analysis and conclusions with upcoming works of this research are stated hereafter.},

  abstract     = {The efficiency of a photovoltaic system may be increased with the use of effective solar PV cell modelling. Solar cell characteristics with flaws, on the other hand, have an unfavorable impact on PV cell modelling. In most cases, manufacturers do not provide all of the information required for accurate PV cell modelling. As a result, it is vital to accurately anticipate the characteristics of the PV cell. Although the literature describes different optimization techniques, most of them provide unsatisfactory results owing to their convergence toward local minima. This research presents a new stochastic optimization approach for estimating the parameters of solar PV cells. As a result, this work introduces the Chaotic Dragonfly Algorithm, a new chaotic algorithm for evaluating solar cells. The suggested technique has the major benefit of employing chaotic maps to calculate and automatically change the internal parameters of the optimization algorithm. This circumstance is advantageous in difficult situations since the suggested method enhances their ability to seek for the optimal solution throughout the iterative phase. Complex and multimodal objective functions can be optimised using the modified technique. In order to show the potential of the proposed algorithm in the solar cell architecture, it is contrasted with other methods of optimization over two different datasets. The chaotic variants for R.T.C France model (CDA1 1.1543, CDA2 2.1896, CDA3 2.1994, CDA4 2.2011, and CDA5 2.2015) have a faster computation time than the other compared algorithms (particle swarm optimization (PSO) 10.1458, Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA) 7.9980, Multi Verse optimization (MVO) 4.8450, Grey Wolf optimizer (GWO) 3.9042, and Dragonfly Algorithm (DA) .8056). Similarly, the chaotic variants for Photo-Watt model (CDA1-1.1441, CDA2-1.1864, CTSA3-2.1989, CTSA4-2.2014, and CTSA5-2.2022) had a faster calculation time than the other examined algorithms for the triple-diode model (PSO-10.2045, SCA-7.9999, MVO-4.8544, GWO-3.9057, and DA-3.8110). Nonparametric test, statistical error analysis, and sensitivity temperature variation are all used to prove the suggested algorithm’s superiority.},

To accurately describe trajectory features, a novel trajectory feature extraction method based on statistical theory is proposed in this paper. This method maps trajectories onto a high-dimensional space, which can account for both the spatiotemporal features and motion features of the trajectories. With the proposed feature extraction method, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm is employed to recognize vessel traffic patterns by simultaneously considering the spatiotemporal and motion features. Then, an improved SVM is designed by employing a weighted hybrid kernel function and differential operator to detect anomalous behaviours from recognized vessel traffic patterns that include the spatiotemporal and motion characteristics. Compared with standard SVM, it can adaptively determine the optimal kernel function according to sample set. Finally, a numerical example based on automatic identification system data from the waters off Chengshan Jiao is fulfilled to verify the proposed algorithm effectiveness and accuracy.},

However, the paramount challenge in BOA is that it is prone to stagnation in local optima. The purpose of this study is to balance the exploration and exploitation abilities of BOA when two new strategies are introduced. The dynamic inertia weight based on Logistic model as the first strategy is introduced to modify the position updating equation. Another strategy is the opposition-based learning. A new variant of BOA called BBOA based on these two strategies is proposed. Ten widely used benchmark test functions and 30 complex benchmarks from CEC 2014 are selected to verify the effectiveness of BBOA. The used benchmark problems are composed of unimodal, multimodal, rotated, shifted, hybrid and composite functions. The experimental results and analysis show that the proposed BBOA has better exploration ability than the conventional BOA when solving different characteristics functions. Finally, BBOA is applied to solve three real-world engineering applications and sixteen feature selection problems. The results demonstrate that BBOA can outperform other competitors in terms of the accuracy of solution on constrained engineering design and feature selection problems.},

An example of an unbalanced classification issue is one in which the distribution of instances across the known classes is biased or distorted. The distribution can range from a little bias to a severe imbalance, with one example in the minority class for hundreds, thousands, or millions in the dominant class or classes. This work proposes the OKC classifier, which is a hybrid of the One-Class SVM, k-Nearest Neighbours, and CART algorithms. The success of most classification algorithms is heavily influenced by certain qualities of the datasets on which they are trained, such as imbalances in class distribution, class overlapping, and lack of density. On imbalanced datasets, the proposed method may accomplish classification without resampling. This method is compared against a few well-known classification algorithms, as well as datasets with varying degrees of class imbalance and overlap.

  abstract     = {Social relationships play an important role in improving the quality of recommender systems (RSs). A large number of experimental results show that social relationship-based recommendation methods alleviate the problems of data sparseness and cold start in RSs to some extent. However, existing recommendation methods have difficulty in accurately obtaining user features and item features, which seriously affects recommendation system performance. To accurately model social relationships and improve recommendation quality, we use both explicit (e.g. user-item ratings, trust relationships) and implicit (e.g. social tags) social relationships to mine users’ potential interest preferences; thus, we propose a social recommendation method incorporating trust relationships and social tags. The method maps user features and item features to a shared feature space using the above social relationship, obtains user similarity and item similarity through potential feature vectors of users and items, and continuously trains them to obtain accurate similarity relationships to improve recommendation performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves superior performance over the other social recommendation approaches.},

  abstract     = {Forensics still faces a serious challenge with image copy-move forgery, in which the copied source and pasted target regions exist in the same image, also known as a homogeneous forgery. In the past decade, numerous copy-move forgery detection (CMFD) methods have attempted to resolve this issue. However, the traditional keypoint-based and block-based methods have certain insurmountable deficiencies, such as the inability to smooth out regions and the lack of scaling invariance. Since the introduction of deep neural networks (DNNs) in the CMFD scheme, researchers have been able to overcome the defects of the traditional hand-crafted methods and obtain promising results. Using DNNs as a reference, this paper proposes a coarse-to-fine spatial-channel-boundary attention network (SCBAN) which is more suited to CMFD. SCBAN consists of three sub-networks, namely, feature extraction, coarse forgery identification, and fine forgery identification modules. First, CondenseNet will serve as SCBAN&#39;s backbone for feature extraction. Next, we present a dual-correlation-attention module for parallel fusion, as well as a nearest-correlation matching module for coarse forgery identification. In addition, we propose a boundary refinement attention module for fine forgery identification. We have conducted numerous experiments on IMD, CoMoFoD, and CMHD benchmarks to show that our SCBAN can achieve the best performance and robustness, compared to the existing DNN CMFD. In addition, unlike the well-designed hand-crafted methods which achieve good performance in a specific dataset, our SCBAN can maintain its scalability to achieve good performance on multiple benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the pregnancy complications that endangers both mothers and babies. GDM is usually diagnosed at 22–26 weeks of gestation. However, early prediction is preferable because it may decrease the risk. The continuous monitoring of the mother’s vital signs helps in predicting any deterioration during pregnancy. The originality of this research is to provide a comprehensive framework for pregnancy women monitoring. The proposed Data Replacement and Prediction Framework consists of three layers, which are: (i) Internet of things (IoT) Layer, (ii) Fog Layer, and (iii) Cloud Layer. The first layer used IoT sensors to aggregate vital signs from pregnancies using invasive and non-invasive sensors. The vital signs are then transmitted to fog nodes to be processed and finally stored in the cloud layer. The main contribution in this research is located in the fog layer producing the GDM module to implement two influential tasks which are as follows: (i) Data Finding Methodology (DFM), and (ii) Explainable Prediction Algorithm (EPM) using DNN. First, the DFM is used to replace the unused data to free up the cache space for new incoming data items. The cache replacement is very important in the case of the healthcare system as the incoming vital signs are frequent and must be replaced continuously. Second, the EPM is used to predict the occurrence of GDM in the second trimester of the pregnancy. To evaluate our model, we extracted data from 16,354 pregnant women from the medical information mart for intensive care (MIMIC III) benchmark dataset. For each woman, vital signs, demographic data, and laboratory tests were aggregated. The results of the prediction model are superior to the state-of-the-art (ACC = 0.957, AUC = 0.942). Regarding explainability, we used Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) framework to provide local and global explanations for the developed models. Overall, the proposed framework is medically intuitive and allows the early prediction of GDM with a cost-effective solution.},

  abstract     = {In the face of interval sensitive data, aiming at the disadvantages of rationality and adaptability of linear dimensionless method, as well as the complexity of constructing polyline and curve dimensionless method, this paper proposes an Interval-based Non-dimensionalization Method (IBNM). Assuming that the data can be divided into n levels within its domain, IBNM divides n intervals based on these n grades. N + 1 connection points were set by taking the critical points between the intervals as abscissa and the sequence values corresponding to the n grades of the critical points as ordinate. Then, the dimensionless transformation function IBNM is constructed by connecting adjacent connection points according to fuzzy mathematics theory. If the connection mode of IBNM is simple piecewise linear function, then called it polyline IBNM. Accordingly, if the connection mode adopts exponential function, logarithmic function and other curve functions, it is called curve IBNM. IBNM is scientific, reasonable, simple and practical. This paper takes PM2.5 air quality grade prediction as an example and constructs four kinds of air quality grade prediction models. A variety of traditional dimensionless methods, polyline IBNM and curve IBNM were used to process the data, respectively, and were applied to these prediction models. The results show that the effect of polyline IBNM and curve IBNM is better than that of traditional non-dimensionalization methods.},

To resolve this problem, an incremental algorithm for concept lattice on image structure similarity (SsimAddExten) was presented. The proposed method mapped each knowledge class on the conceptlattice into a graphic, when a new object was added or deleted in a knowledge class, the boundary profile of graphic will be changed, the graphic edge structure similarity was introduced as the calculation index of the change degree before and after the knowledge, and the concept lattice will be updated on the basis of the index. We performed experiments to test SsimAddExtent, whose computational efficiency obtains obvious advantages over mainstream methods on almost all test points, especially on the data set with a large number of attributes. But, its complexity is not reduced compared with mainstream methods. Both theoretical analysis and performance test show SsimAddExtent algorithm is better choice when we apply the FCA to large scale data or non-sparse data.},

In order to handle such cases we generalize the operational law of Zhou et al. in both the monotonicity of function and fuzzy variables in this paper and then apply the extensive operational law to the cases with monotone (but not necessarily strictly monotone) functions with regard to regular LR fuzzy intervals (LR-FIs) (of which regular LR fuzzy numbers are special cases). Specifically, we derive the computational formulae for expected values (EVs) of LR-FIs and monotone functions with regard to regular LR-FIs, respectively. On the other hand, we develop a solution scheme to dispose of fuzzy optimization problems with regular LR-FIs, in which a fuzzy programming is converted to a deterministic equivalent one and a newly devised solution algorithm is utilized to get the deterministic programming solved. The numerical experiments are conducted using our proposed solution scheme and the traditional fuzzy simulation-based genetic algorithm in the context of a purchasing planning problem. Computational results show that our method is much more efficient, yielding high-quality solutions.},

Several complex robotic systems performed a number of industrial works named spray painting, welding, assembly, pick and place action, etc. The end-effector’s position and the joint angles play a vital role since any task is activated inside the pre-defined robotic manipulator’s work space. Also, the problem of trajectory planning is a very challenging task in the robotic fields. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a kinematics analysis and trajectory planning of an Industrial robotic manipulators (IRMs) based on the hybrid optimization algorithms. Here, three IRMs such as PUMA 560 (6 DOF), KUKA LBR iiwa 14 R820 (7DOF) and ABB IRB 140 (6DOF) are considered. For each robot, the forward and the inverse kinematics (IK) are analysed and also the trajectory planning of each robot is discussed using the hybrid optimization algorithms. In this work, 18 optimization algorithms such as PSO (particle swarm optimization), SSO (social spider optimization), DFO (dragonfly optimization), BOA (butterfly optimization), CSA (crow search algorithm), BSA (bird swarm algorithm), SHO (selfish herd optimization), KHO (krill herd optimization), ALO (antlion optimization), ACO (ant colony optimization), GWO (Grey wolf optimization), GOA (grasshopper optimization), SBO (satin bowerbird optimizer), WCO (world cup optimization), COA (cuckoo optimization algorithm), CFA (cuttlefish algorithm), SOA (seagull optimization algorithm), and TSA (tunicate swarm algorithm) are utilized for both forward and inverse kinematic analysis and the trajectory planning problem. For the PUMA 560, KUKA LBR iiwa 14 R820, and ABB IRB 140 IRMs, forward kinematics (FK) are solved by the hybrid combination of PSO-SSO, SHO-KHO, and SBO-WCO individually. Also, the IK are solved by the DFO-BOA, ALO-ACO and COA-CFA for each IRMs. The trajectory planning problem is solved by the CSA-BSA, GWO-GOA and SOA-TSA for each robot individually. These optimization techniques give number of solution for kinematics and trajectory problem but it converses the best solution for the minimum multi-objective function value. Each robot obtained the minimum travelling time for without and with an obstacle which is 0.0118 and 0.0313 s for PUMA and 0.0117 and 0.0310 s for KUKA, and 0.0114 and 0.0120 s for ABB IRB 140 robot. The advantages of these hybrid algorithm are shorter computation time, and fewer iterations. The kinematics and trajectory analysis of each IRM is simulated using robotic tool box in MATLAB with GUI interface. For each IRM, optimized position values of the end effector, joint angles and the best optimal path are computed with minimum objective function. Finally, the performance of each robot is compared to the existing robotic works.},

To address this issue, this paper presents the maximum entropy of RPS. The analytical solution of maximum RPS entropy and its PMF condition are proven and discussed. Besides, numerical examples are used to illustrate the maximum RPS entropy. The results show that the maximum RPS entropy is compatible with the maximum Deng entropy and the maximum Shannon entropy.

Handling an HISI is conducive to generalize applications of rough set theory. This paper studies entropy measurement for a hybrid information system with images and considers an application for attribute reduction. We first give the distance between information values on each attribute in an HISI. Then, we present tolerance relations on the object set of an HISI based on this distance. Next, we define the rough approximations in an HISI by means of the presented tolerance relations. Furthermore, we study entropy measurement for an HISI by using $$\theta $$ -information entropy, $$\theta $$ -conditional information entropy and $$\theta $$ -joint information entropy. Based on Kryszkiewicz’s ideal, we introduce the concepts of $$\theta $$ -generalized decision and $$\theta $$ -consistent in an HISI. Finally, we apply entropy measurement to perform attribute reduction in a $$\theta $$ -consistent HISI. It is worth mentioning that attribute reduction based on generalized decision and common attribute reduction in a $$\theta $$ -consistent HISI are the same.},

  abstract     = {Ranking of fuzzy numbers is an inevitable task in solving multi-criteria decision-making problems modelling under a fuzzy environment. Generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are used in the literature for modelling real-life problems involving incomplete information. Many researchers worldwide are looking for a standard method that can be used to discriminate arbitrary GTrFNs. However, most of them do not define a total ordering on the class of generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Recently, Marimuthu and Mahapatra (2020) defined various ranking functions on the class of GTrFNs and tried to define a complete ranking principle on the set of GTrFNs. But their method also has some drawbacks in comparing arbitrary GTrFNs. The main aim of this paper is to discuss some issues of the complete ranking principle introduced in Marimuthu and Mahapatra (2020). Also, we discuss the limitations of a few theorems and give the correct version of them. Further, we improve a complete ranking principle by discussing a membership score of a GTrFN. Finally, we prove that the proposed (improved) ranking principle defines a complete ranking in the class of GTrFNs.},

The properties of PRS are demonstrated by theorems, and its capabilities are shown by means of an original instance selection algorithm to determine which instances are relevant and which are not to improve decision-making. The numerical experiments conducted allow asseverating that the proposed algorithm is competitive and lead to highly accurate decision-making for nearest neighbor, voting algorithm, and Naïve Associative Classifier.

Calibration is a method of adjusting sample weights to improve estimation. In this article, under a stratified adaptive cluster sampling, we propose new variance estimators with the appearance of extreme values through the use of calibration constraints along with linear and trimmed linear moments based on variance and coefficient of variation of the auxiliary variable. The percentage relative efficiency of the proposed estimators in comparison with the traditional ones is calculated. The proposed estimators’ performance is assessed using real-life and artificial data. Based on numerical comparisons, the proposed estimators outperform the traditional variance estimator. Thus, the proposed estimators can be considered very resistant estimators and they surely boost the chances of obtaining more accurate estimates of population variance with the presence of extreme values.},

There are various diagnostic techniques for oral cancer, but they are limited to accurately detecting cancer cells. As a result, deep transfer learning algorithms such as ResNet50, MobileNetV2, VGG19, VGG16, and DenseNet were applied to non-malignant and oral cancerous photographs acquired from histopathologic and real-time datasets in this study. The images were first preprocessed with techniques like Gaussian blur to eliminate noise signals. Then, features were extracted with morphological operations to produce extreme points on the images, subsequently cropped. The retrieved pictures were fed into deep transfer learning models along with optimization techniques as ADAM, SGD, and RMSprop optimizers to obtain optimal results. Accuracy, loss, RMSE, precision, and AUC were used to analyze the findings. During the validation phase, the hybrid optimization techniques using ADAM, RMSprop, and SGD on DenseNet produced effective results, with accuracy of 92.41\%, loss of 0.70, and RMSE of 0.29 for the real-time dataset, accuracy of 95.41\%, loss of 0.10, and RMSE of 0.03 for oral cancer images, and accuracy of 92.41\%, loss of 0.30, and RMSE of 0.09 for non-cancerous images taken from the histopathologic dataset.},

Moreover, the traditional PEKS schemes have an inherent security issue: They cannot resist the keywords guessing attack (KGA) which can cause devastating damage to the encrypted database. To address these problems, this paper proposes a KGA-resistance encrypted search scheme on lattice that is post-quantum secure. Furthermore, to achieve rich queries, our scheme is also designed to support the conjunctive query. Finally, the security analysis and performance evaluation are presented, which demonstrates that our scheme realizes a good balance between security and efficiency compared with related works.},

First, this paper proposes construction ideas and principles for the state-owned enterprise’ performance evaluation index system and then examines its efficiency.

The BP neural network is used to construct a non-financial indicator model for a state-owned enterprise performance evaluation portfolio model based on fuzzy neural networks. Both these networks use a decision support system during the process of building the model. Finally, a comparison is made between the results from Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy neural network and those from the BP neural network performance evaluation model after sample data have been selected, standardization processing has been applied, and a simulation of the network model has been trained.

In the modern era of technology, huge amounts of data are being generated swiftly on a daily basis which needs to be instantly analyzed for making successful business decisions. Keeping this in mind, a famous algorithm called CACHEJOIN (Cache Join) was proposed. The limitation of the CACHEJOIN algorithm is that it does not deal with the frequently changing trends in a stream data efficiently. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose a TinyLFU-CACHEJOIN algorithm, a modified version of the original CACHEJOIN algorithm, which is designed to enhance the performance of a CACHEJOIN algorithm. TinyLFU-CACHEJOIN employs an intelligent strategy which keeps only those records of R in the cache that have a high hit rate in S. This mechanism of TinyLFU-CACHEJOIN allows it to deal with the sudden and abrupt trend changes in S. We developed a cost model for our TinyLFU-CACHEJOIN algorithm and proved it empirically. We also assessed the performance of our proposed TinyLFU-CACHEJOIN algorithm with the existing CACHEJOIN algorithm on a skewed synthetic dataset. The experiments proved that TinyLFU-CACHEJOIN algorithm significantly outperforms the CACHEJOIN algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 infection, which began in December 2019, has claimed many lives and impacted all aspects of human life. With time, COVID-19 was identified as a pandemic outbreak by the World Health Organization (WHO), putting massive pressure on global health. During this ongoing pandemic, the exponential growth of social media platforms has provided valuable resources for distributing information, as well as a source for self-reported disease symptoms in public discourse. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective approaches to detect self-reported symptoms or cases in social media content. In this study, we scrapped public discourse on COVID-19 symptoms in Twitter content. For this, we developed a huge dataset of COVID-19 self-reported symptoms and gold-annotated the tweets into four categories: confirmed, death, suspected, and recovered. Then, we use a machine and deep machine learning models, each with its own set of features, such as feature representation. Furthermore, the experimentations were achieved with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) variants and compared their performance with traditional machine learning algorithms. Experimental results report that optimizing the area under the curve (AUC) enhances model performance, and the long short-term memory (LSTM) has the highest accuracy in detecting COVID-19 symptoms in real-time public messaging. Thus, the LSTM classifier in the proposed pipeline achieves a classification accuracy of 90.7\%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art algorithms for multi-class classification.},

Innovative and sophisticated approaches based on AI and machine learning are being used to improve music teaching. Furthermore, by employing these methods, the sounds in games can be made more efficient and effective. Evaluation of the role of AI and ML in music education is one of the most difficult and challenging areas for teaching and learning researchers due to the use of these approaches. The Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy AHP) approach was used to assess the role of AI and machine learning in music instruction. Fuzzy AHP is a basic and straightforward way of making better decisions based on criteria and options. In the proposed study, we used Fuzzy AHP to determine the weightages of seven criteria and five alternatives.

In this paper, using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, Landsat remote sensing images in the summer (June–September) of 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 were selected to remove clouds and mask water body information. The median value is taken to synthesize the remote sensing images of each year and extract multiple indices of greenness, wetness, heatness, and dryness. Then integrate the population density data by principal component analysis to quickly construct an improved composite remote sensing ecological index (CRSEI). The results showed that the average contribution of the six indicators of greenness (NDVI and FVC), wetness (NDMI), heatness (LST), dryness (NDBSI), and population density (Pop) to the first principal component (PC1) was above 79\%, and the construction of an improved comprehensive remote sensing ecological index (CRSEI) based on PC1 was feasible in the Yellow River Delta. In the past 20 years, the ecological and environmental quality of the Yellow River Delta has shown a continuous trend of improvement. The ecological environment quality has improved by 3570.95 square kilometers, accounting for 48.0\% of the total area, while the ecological environment quality has degraded by 712.99 square kilometers, accounting for only 9.6\% of the total area. The improved area is 38.4\% more than the degraded area, which shows that the ecological environment quality has improved in general. The ecological environment quality in Kenli County has improved the most. The ecological projects have been implemented in this area with the most obvious effect, and the investment in ecological environmental protection in this area should be continued or increased. The use of the GEE platform can obtain timely and accurate spatial and temporal patterns and evolution of ecological environmental quality in the Yellow River Delta, which is of great significance for ecological environmental protection and construction.},

The existing studies have deficiencies in explaining the complex interaction among multiple land-based influence factors on MEE. This study puts forward an integrated analysis framework to understand the differences in MEE among different coastal areas based on the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework and combined with the characteristics of government behavior under the background of the Chinese system. Taking 11 coastal areas in China as cases, the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) method is used for configuration analysis, and the findings are as follows: (1) Conditions based on technology, organization, and environment cannot, by themselves, explain why MEE is high or low. This means that a single condition can&#39;t explain much about MEE. (2) There are three configuration paths for high MEE: a path of development based on innovation, a path of ecological industry based on unique geographical location, and a path of development based on political pressure. Among them, the path of development based on innovation plays a more important role in improving MEE and has more value in making effective policy. (3) There are two ways to have a low MEE: one with a lot of innovation and one with a lot of environmental regulation and political pressure on the technology. These two paths imply that the lack of green technology capability is an important conditional variable for low MEE. The findings of this study will help people understand MEE&#39;s long-term development path in a more rational way and give them useful practical advice.},

  abstract     = {Despite experimental efforts to map out the human interactome, the continued high data complexity, heterogeneity, and combined explosion limit our ability to understand the molecular roots of human disease. Computational tools provide a promising alternative when identifying biologically significant, yet unmapped associations between PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) and diseases. However, few predictors for large-scale prediction of potential disease-associated piRNAs have been proposed to provide effective candidates for future biomedical research now. In this study, we proposed a new computational model based on multi-source information and stacked autoencoder, called MSRDA, to predict potential piRNA–disease associations on a large scale. In particular, we introduce stacked autoencoders into the field of piRNA–disease association prediction for the first time. In the fivefold cross-validation, the MSRDA achieves the average area under the curve of 0.9184 ± 0.0015. To further evaluate the performance of MSRDA, we compared models without feature denoising and models with different types of feature representations. Moreover, the proposed method is optimal compared to related works. In conclusion, MSRDA is an effective tool that provides new impetus for uncovering the root causes of human disease.},

Collaboration, addressing changing requirements with workable software, and simple design are just a few aspects of typical techniques. By employing the aforementioned approaches, these methods handle the issue of variable requirements. As a result, these methods lower the cost of changes at a later point in the software development process. Due to the unpredictability of requirements, such methodologies do not hold up well for an early estimate of size, cost, and timeframe. Agile techniques, it has been noticed, rely on expert analysis and prior project information to estimate cost, complexity, and time. Such approaches, it has been discovered, do not take into account the critical aspects affecting the project&#39;s cost, complexity, and timeframe when estimating. Based on predefined estimation methods including analogy and planning, poker becomes unexpected in the lack of historical data and professionals. As a result, there is a pressing need to develop a simple computational solution that takes into account the factors that influence the project budget, complexity, and timeframe. It also serves as a foundation for unskilled practitioners to make better estimates. The research of both traditional and agile estimation techniques with a comparability of concepts and variations is presented in this work. We looked into a few key elements that influence the estimation of an agile project with lower, moderate, and higher scalability factors.

However, due to the diversity of conditions, i.e., football venues, clothing colors, etc., there is no universal tracker that can perfectly adapt to all scenarios. Due to its excellent feature extraction capabilities, deep learning technology has been widely used in the field of computer vision in recent years. The main objective of this article is the extraction of player’s trajectory in a football game, i.e., the path tracking of the player’s goal. To achieve this objective, deep learning technology is used for automatic extraction of the characteristic features of the player’s target in the context of target detection and tracking. The target detection method employed in this study is based on deep learning by forming new multi-scale features and modifying the generation rules of anchor points of the captured videos, making it more suitable for small target detection tasks in football match scenes. The generation rules are based on a complex decision support system for target tracking. This decision support system uses the method of constructing a similarity matrix to transform the multi-target tracking problem into a data association problem that can be solved by the Hungarian algorithm. The proposed approach is compared against state-of-the-art techniques in terms of area under the curve (AUC) value, track set scene distribution, number of frames, and other parameters. Based on the experimental results, the proposed approach outperforms these existing techniques with much better results.},

  abstract     = {Virtual reality (VR) is a computer-simulated three-dimensional environment whose goal is to achieve a strong sense of being there, called immersion. This requires a variety of technologies: the most essential being input devices. At present, the non-contact Kinect somatosensory interaction approach has been widely studied. Somatosensory interactive games take body movements as input instructions, instead of the simple push-button operation mode. Hence, the operational behavior is more intuitive and the reaction of players is highly accurate and brings a better game experience to players. In terms of man–machine interaction in somatosensory interactive games, gesture interaction brings the primary operation medium into the virtual environment. This paper analyzes the problems of somatosensory games interaction in immersive virtual reality, focusing on gesture-based immersive virtual reality technology. The main work includes: First, aiming at the problem that the gesture recognition method cannot adapt to the real-time continuous gesture flow in practical application scenarios, a naive Bayes gesture recognition algorithm based on joint vector is proposed. The algorithm uses a decision support system for feature representation of bone and motion along with the joint vector. It introduces the adaptive naive Bayes algorithm, which can complete the training with fewer samples. Experimental results show that the algorithm has a high recognition rate and recognition speed, can effectively adapt to continuous data flow, has good compatibility with virtual reality applications, and significantly increases the user&#39;s sense of immersion in virtual scenes. Secondly, in view of the lack of complete visual feedback solutions for gesture interaction, a 3D user interface and interaction method combining bone animation and collision detection technology is proposed. The process interacts with the virtual environment through gesture feedback from 3DUI elements. Experimental results show that the design can effectively enhance the immersive experience through the visual feedback of gestures.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development in information and communication technologies, the relationship among the disciplines in various fields has become closer, resulting in many new technologies based on interdisciplinary research. This article considers robot soccer training as a research topic by involving related fields, i.e., interdisciplinary research. Compared with the physical robot, its simulation has the advantages of less cost, shorter experimental period, and is beneficial to the real-life studies in this context. This article discusses the practical application and optimization techniques used for robot soccer matches and training evaluation. The main tasks are as follows. First, we analyze and build a simulation platform for robot soccer matches. The basic principles of this platform are learning, and designing a novel optimized SARSA algorithm, built using the state-of-the-art state–action–reward–state–action (SARSA) algorithm. The optimized SARSA is a reinforcement learning algorithm that uses Q-value for making critical decisions about various parameters involved in the football training. Second, this paper simulates and analyzes the proposed optimized SARSA algorithm in a single-entity environment of robot football training. We compare the two algorithms before and after the improvement in a multi-entity environment. Among the simulation results, it is found that the optimized SARSA has a more powerful performance. The simulation results prove that the robot football training evaluation based on machine learning (optimized SARSA) can better formulate the robot football training strategy after applying the reinforcement learning strategy.},

Furthermore, real-time segmentation and identification algorithms for wires in mobile terminals are extensively used and be useful and efficient in this process. In this study, we employed the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) to evaluate real-time segmentation and identification methods. FAHP is a simple and intuitive method for calculating the weights of alternatives, criteria, and ranking them to identify the most efficient and effective solution. In this research, we have used the FAHP approach with fuzzy geometric mean values to rank six criteria and three alternatives. The FAHP approach is generally used in multi-decision-making situations where ambiguity and uncertainty are involved. It was tried to increase the context for the creative growth of real-time segmentation and identification algorithms for wires by evaluating these possibilities.},

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a fast expanding network of numerous “connected things’’. In academics, the usage of IoT is like a fresh wave of change that has given a new dimension and possibilities for improving the teaching–learning process and the infrastructure of educational institutions. In this context, the impact of English instruction can be enhanced by using research on an English interactive teaching approach using IoT. This paper aims to establish an interactive education paradigm using the preliminary results obtained via the use of IoT. To improve English education, IoT technology is being used to study the interactive teaching model of English. For this purpose, numerous sensors were used to improve the English language rectification of learners’ diction and speech by comparing them to the software’s standard diction and voice. These sensors include video sensors for diction acquisition and computer analysis in English learners, and voice sensors for speech acquisition and computer analysis. The decision made using the reading of these sensors allow the students to make active judgments more quickly and automatically by just browsing a web page. Besides, it can help teachers by allowing them to select resources that are suited for students of various levels.

This paper proposes an improved LSTM model based on the web and multimedia environment, which improves the prediction effect of neural networks by adding an attention mechanism to the LSTM layer. The attention mechanism is based on a decision support system that automates the availability of various teaching resources to ensure an interactive teaching and learning environment in the colleges and universities. The decision support system of attention mechanism enhances the model&#39;s generalization ability by tuning the model parameters with the genetic algorithm (GA). Finally, this paper proposes some suggestions on improving the effectiveness of teaching English as a foreign language in the online and multimedia environment, taking into account the popular MU teaching format and English APP.

Based on this problem, this paper proposes a remote sensing image object detection method based on the YOLOv5 network. By improving the backbone extraction network, the network structure can be deepened to get more information about large objects, and the detection effect can be improved by adding an attention mechanism and adding an output layer to enhance feature extraction and feature fusion. The pre-training weight is obtained by transfer learning and used as the training weight of the improved YOLOv5 to speed up the network convergence. The experiment is carried out on the DIOR dataset, the results show that the improved YOLOv5 network can significantly improve the accuracy of large object recognition compared with the YOLO series network and the EfficientDet model on DIOR dataset, and the mAP of the improved YOLOv5 network is 80.5\%, which is 2\% higher than the original YOLOv5 network.},

In order to improve the scoring rate of basketball shooting, the teaching objective program and method program are combined to form an efficient teaching algorithm with comprehensive characteristics, which can improve the effect of basketball shooting training. In this paper, we design reasonable auxiliary teaching methods for basketball shooting, so that students can improve their scoring rate in daily basketball training and reduce injury when improving shooting skills. Our evaluation suggests that increasing the emphasis on the training of core muscle group is beneficial to enhance the control of core muscle group of athletes and promote the improvement of their shooting percentage. For people, without the basis of foundation and has a certain movement intermittent time, longer training time while shorter core training time were observed. Moreover, for physical quality, excellent and experienced player should be aimed at training projects, which strictly controls the intermittent time, while fully stimulates the core muscles, in order to achieve the training targets and complete the training results. We conclude that it is feasible and effective to design an auxiliary teaching algorithm for basketball shooting on the basis of object decomposition program. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is approximately 11.23\% better than the other methods in terms of higher scores.},

The prediction is constructed using MIMO-D2D system, increases the signal transmission dimension, improves the system throughput, and effectively allocates resources, which solves the problem of interference coordination between device-to-device (D2D) and cellular users in the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. A set of equipment pieces for in situ thawing tests of coarse-grained and giant-grain frozen soil is designed. Field tests are carried out to obtain the thawing coefficient of the frozen soil and calculate the thawing compression index, which can evaluate the influence of frozen soil thawing settlement on railway engineering. The experimental results of the research show that the elastic properties of frozen soil are weak, the unloading rebound is only 10\% of the compression amount, and the rebound is concentrated in a short time. The experimental results show that the thaw settlement coefficient of frozen soil is 0.67\%, which is classified as Class I according to thaw settlement, non-thaw settlement, and weak thaw settlement. The maximum thaw settlement at the slope of the tunnel entrance section is about 6.7 cm, which allows settlement after construction.},

Initially, a thorough analysis is performed to recognize the main failure forms of the plunger through investigation and analysis of the development of international plunger. Later, the two bionic plungers with the performance of friction and wear reduction are designed using the non-smooth theory. In addition, the standard prototype is developed and the three-dimensional design of the two different plunger is carried out for validation purpose. The results are compared with the standard prototype. The stress environment on the surface of the plunger is improved, and the wear of the plunger is reduced.

  abstract     = {Agriculture is an important field for most of the countries, as it is the primary source of food production, and has a great role in growing the economy of a country. The world’s population is increasing with a faster speed, and as a result, the need for food is rapidly increasing. Farmers’ traditional techniques are insufficient to meet the rising demand of food. The agriculture sector faces various challenges such as producing more and better products while enhancing the sustainability through the smart use of natural resources, minimizing environmental harm, and adapting to the climate change. Agricultural informatization is the inevitable trend of modern agricultural development. The purpose of introducing information technology into agriculture is to save production costs, improve production efficiency, and accelerate the development of productivity. Agricultural informatization is an intelligent, digital, and a networked-based system. Geographic information system technology is widely used in agriculture, such as precision agriculture, land resource management, crop yield estimation and monitoring, and soil and water conservation. The characteristic of expert decision-making system is the logical reasoning of knowledge, and the advantage of neural network is the acquisition of knowledge. Therefore, the study of the organic combination of neural network and expert decision-making system technology is of a great significance to the research of integrated system righteousness. In this paper, the agricultural data obtained from the expert database are displayed in the form of a tree list and are used in the process of system design. The geospatial data can be uploaded through the map loading function, find the map path, and easily uploaded by modifying the expert database. In order to realize the scalability of the platform, we transplanted the analysis objects to other provinces and cities. Further, the grey decision-making system and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) prediction models are used to predict the future indicators of agricultural data. Based on the historical data of agricultural economic indicators, the effect of predicting the future value of agricultural indicators by using grey decision-making system and neural network models is repeatedly tested. The experimental result shows that the BPNN model performed really well in terms of prediction accuracy and relative error rate as compared to the grey decision-making system.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the ideological and political (IAP) training of the college and university students is of a great interest for everyone due to the rapid change in the political issues and the race of super power. By analyzing the present states and research on the system of evaluating the IAP training of college students, it is obvious that the current evaluation systems are not satisfactory and have different deficiencies such as openness, transparency, and lack of supervision. The existing systems are pretty straightforward, and the assessment process is not open enough. The evaluation systems are not solid, and there are still many challenges for the evaluation system of IAP training of college students. Students can only accomplish a comparably fair and scientific assessment result by building an efficient and innovative decision-making system with the help of analyzing the evaluation system of the IAP education of the students. This allows the students to get to know each other more closely and better promote their overall growth. In this research work, we examined the present assessment systems of IAP education and presented a paper in order to emphasize its shortcomings and flaws such as openness, transparency, the lack of a distinct evaluation system, and supervision. Further, we examined the values of big data analytics in assessing college students’ IAP education and present a new evaluation method based on big data analytics. The new approach assures the results transparency and openness, and hence, the evaluation system is assessed more accurately. Based on the experimental and evaluation results, it is recommended that the college teachers should understand the value of big data, and a separate platform needs to be developed through which different institutions may exchange data about the assessment system.},

The gaming industry is more beneficial than any other industry, like the film industry using music in-game. The evolution of music in games started a few decades ago and brought a lot of enhancement in gaming. Nowadays, a player likes music-based games more than any other game because while playing music-based games, it releases stress and keeps comfortable of player’s mind. The music in games changes the previous gaming style and advances, which help the young generation, learn something new from different games. Music is used to attract user attitudes and ultimately involve users in gaming during playing games. Music is utilized in-game to develop a more attractive and memorable game to enhance users’ interest in playing games. In addition, the usage of background music in games is also a primary part of successful games because, at a similar time, game developers and those who play games hope that video games can be more persuasive. After studying the previous paper, it identified that music in games positively impacts players’ performance and achievement, improves the player’s skills, and keeps players relaxed during playing games. The current research has considered the decision support system (DSS) for evaluating the role of music in games for sustained effectiveness.

Machine learning approaches based on Internet technology are increasingly being introduced into classrooms and implemented across colleges and universities around the globe. To address the limitations of existing approaches of physical education in colleges and universities, this research employs the classical multivariate statistical technique of factor analysis along with an iterative random forest algorithm. To evaluate the characteristics of machine learning for physical education curriculum, a comprehensive evaluation is performed, and an optimized development strategy is proposed to promote the machine learning-based physical education. Numerous tests were carried out using machine learning classifiers and random forest’s decision tree. The experimental findings reveal that the suggested approach performs better than current models in terms of evaluation’s weight accuracy and calculation time. As a consequence, the suggested model may better match the standards of physical education teaching quality evaluation, i.e., the study&#39;s findings are precise and substantial, demonstrating the study&#39;s effectiveness.},

The analysis and forecasting of such a huge quantities of data is a great task that cannot be solved using standard methods. To handle this issue, we designed and developed an intelligent deep learning (DL) model based on the concept of stacked self-coding network, which uses a DL framework for decision making at the backend. The proposed model can learn and select the embedding of original features in the high dimensional, sparse, and noisy big data environment of the sports industry. The dataset used for the analysis and implementation purpose consists of a total of 2,053,500 samples, which is further divided into six sample sets by introducing random noise of different intensities to the test sample set. The performance of the proposed model in risk assessment and feature embedding learning is also described from a visual analysis perspective. Up to a point, the interpretability of DL technology in the sports business is also investigated and examined. The experimental results of credit risk assessment attained via the proposed model are compared with the traditional method, which verifies the effectiveness and significance of the proposed model.

The objective is to meet the demands of information integration of the underlying CNC equipment. First, we explain the power line carrier, alarm information, servo currents, fault diagnosis, remote control, online management of processing operations, and maintenance of machine tools information for the suggested system. This explanation helps us to understand the real-time processing and parameters of CNC machine tools. The proposed system reduces the power consumption of wireless sensor nodes used for monitoring the CNC machines. In addition, the IoT protocol used in this research allows for real-time communication between the CNC operating platform and the wireless sensor nodes.

Numerous communication mechanisms have been reported in the literature to address these issues in traditional and resource constraint networks. In this paper, a networking parametric ensemble-based wireless communication approach is presented to ensure reliable transmission of the packets from source to destination in the IoT networks. The proposed approach bounds every member device to collect valuable data from the neighboring devices, preferably those with minimum hop count value, to find the most optimal neighboring device and enforce an optimal path for onward communication in the IoT networks. Additionally, a reliable and efficient DSS is presented preferably for servers to refine the captured data before processing which enhances the accuracy. Simulation results have verified the exceptional performance of the proposed DSS on real-time and benchmark datasets in terms of various evaluation metrics in the IoT networks, with the accuracy of the proposed DSS being around 95\%.},

It also suggests that a scientific evaluation of teaching in colleges provides a better feedback, incentives, and guidance, respectively. A model for the quality evaluation of physical education in colleges is established using artificial neural network. This model quantifies the concept of teaching evaluation index into actual data as its input, and teaching effect as output. The use of artificial neural network framework maps the input with output using an internally configured decision support system. Furthermore, it uses relevant software to conduct empirical research. The results show that this model enhances the quality of teaching evaluation, which not only overcomes the subjective factors of experts in the evaluation process but also produces satisfactory evaluation result.},

  abstract     = {Mental stress is an issue that creates functional limitations in the workplace. Chronic stress leads to a number of psychophysiological sicknesses. For instance, it raises the risk of depression, heart attack, and stroke. According to the most recent findings in neuroscience, the human brain is the primary focus of mental stress. Perception of biological motion in the human brain determines the risky and stressful situations. Neural signaling of the human brain is used as an objective measure for determining the stress level of a subject. The oscillations of electroencephalography (EEG) signals are utilized for classifying human stress. EEG signals have a higher temporal resolution and are rapidly distorted with unwanted noise, resulting in a variety of artifacts. This study utilizes Extended Independent Component Analysis based approach for artifacts removal. A Multiclass Common Spatial Pattern-based moving window technique is proposed here to obtain the most distinguishable time segment of EEG trials. BiLSTM is used to improve classification results. In order to validate the model performance, two publically available datasets (i.e., DEAP and SEED) are utilized. Employing these datasets, the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results (93.1, 96.84\%) for EEG signal classification to identify stress.},

  abstract     = {The management and development of human resources (HR) have become one of the core contents of enterprise management. Enterprises pay more attention to the importance of information technology which results in the development of many labor dispatch enterprises. The rapid development and limited market share of labor dispatch enterprises lead to more fierce competition among the enterprises. With the rapid development of machine learning techniques, more enterprises begin to pay attention to managing the completion of various decision-making activities in operation with the help of computer information systems to save human costs. The labor dispatch model is a valuable addition to China&#39;s core contractual employment paradigms. Based on the improved genetic algorithm, this paper studies the human resource labor dispatch model which is used to optimize the number of people required by the dispatch project and optimize its labor cost. The HR recruitment model is used to calculate the number of people to be recruited for the dispatch project to meet the needs of the project and optimize its project dispatch scheme. The experimental results show that the benefit of dispatching through the artificial selection method (1127) is less than the result calculated by the HR dispatching plan model (1162), which proves the effectiveness of this model. The experimental results of the study depict the usefulness of the research.},

  abstract     = {One of the key problems for researchers and network managers is anomaly detection in network traffic. Anomalies in network traffic might signal a network intrusion, requiring the use of a quick and dependable network intrusion detection system. Intrusion detection systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are gaining the interest of the research community as AI techniques have evolved in recent years. This research proposes a novel method for anomaly detection using artificial neural networks (ANNs) optimized using cuckoo search algorithm. For simulation purposes, the NSL-KDD dataset has been utilized with a 70:30 ratio where 70\% of data is used for training and the remaining 30\% is used for testing. The proposed model is then evaluated in terms of mean absolute error, mean square error, root-mean-square error, and accuracy. The results of the proposed work are compared with standard methods available in the literature including fuzzy clustering artificial neural network (FC-ANN), intrusion detection with artificial bee colony, neural network intrusion detection system, and selection of relevant feature. The results clearly show that the proposed method outperforms the listed standard methods.},

This time hole has the ability to hide IoT information from outside hackers/attackers. At certain phases of the control fields and complex coefficients of the superposition states, a temporal time gap of about 13 μs is generated, which is modified to 30 μs with intensities of control fields and their detuning’s.

With applications in diverse areas, medical field is one of the most important application of DL in which has been applied extensively. Heart disease is one of the most hazardous lethal diseases, and it must be recognized as early as possible in order to limit the damage caused by this disease. Based on Long short-term memory (LSTM) network and DL technology, a medical diagnosis model is established to carry out heart disease diagnosis. One of the traditional diagnosis methods of heart disease is to obtain the patient&#39;s heart structure image by echocardiography. The doctor then gets the information from the image for diagnosis purposes. The main limitation associated with this approach is that it is not time-effective. This study uses LSTM and DL technology to learn data features to diagnose heart disease. The integration of LSTM and DL technology is used to establish a diagnosis model that uses a decision support system for heart disease and to improve the accuracy of disease diagnosis. Further, another goal of this study is to promote the development of DL technology in disease diagnosis frameworks. The results obtained from the experiments revealed that the proposed approach is practical and better than the other approaches for the efficient identification of cardiac disease.},

  abstract     = {A short-term wind power prediction model based on BiLSTM–CNN–WGAN-GP (LCWGAN-GP) is proposed in this paper, aiming at the problems of instability and low prediction accuracy of short-term wind power prediction. Firstly, the original wind energy data are decomposed into subsequences of natural mode functions with different frequencies by using the variational mode decomposition (VMD) algorithm. The VMD algorithm relies on a decision support system for the decomposition of the data into natural mode functions. Once the decomposition is performed, the nonlinear and dynamic behavior are extracted from each natural mode function. Next, the BiLSTM network is chosen as the generation model of the generative adversarial network (WGAN-GP) to obtain the data distribution characteristics of wind power’s output. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is chosen as the discrimination model, and the semi-supervised regression layer is utilized to design the discrimination model to predict wind power. The minimum–maximum game is formed by the BiLSTM and CNN network models to improve the quality of sample generation and further improve the prediction accuracy. Finally, the actual data of a wind farm in Jiuquan City, Gansu Province, China is taken as an example to prove that the proposed method has superior performance compared with other prediction algorithms.},

Decision support system is any system or tool which has the potential or ability to support decision making activities. In this paper, a network security posture assessment model for decision making based on binary semantic analysis is proposed to address the problems of traditional network security. By semantic analysis of pre-compiled script files, the behavioral features of script files are obtained based on abstract syntax trees and the supervised learning of samples is performed using BP neural networks to obtain a detection model that can be used for unknown samples. Different from the existing detection methods based on semantic analysis, the network security posture assessment index system is first established, the weights of the indexes are determined by using the sequential relationship analysis method, and finally the binary semantic analysis method is introduced into the decision matrix to realize the network security posture assessment model. The simulation results of the study show that the introduction of binary semantic analysis and sequential relational analysis significantly improves the accuracy of network security posture assessment, and the proposed WebShell detection method has much high accuracy and recall rate.},

However, there has been no efficient solution to the cold start of recommendation systems and the sparse nature of scoring matrices. There is a dire need for an intelligent and efficient algorithm that can support the students in teaching music in an effective way. Deep belief neural network (DBN-DNN) is a deep learning model nested by many restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) to deal with sparse matrices and immediacy. At the same time, it can generate better initialization parameters and significantly improve the training speed of the model. This paper utilizes a decision support system that decides the matrix decomposition of user ratings by using a hidden semantic model to extract user preference features for hidden factors and the weights of music pieces on these k hidden factors. The proposed approach extracts the audio feature values from music clips by considering that music itself has classifiable information. This method is intelligent in terms of efficiency for effective music teaching and helps students learn. The experiments show that the personalized recommendation algorithm combined with a deep belief neural network has good recommendation performance. The recommendation coefficient predicted by the model is lower than the real rating for the samples with ratings. The recommendation is no longer limited to the original user group and song library and has better recommendation accuracy and scalability.},

  abstract     = {In high-throughput phenotyping, recognizing individual plant categories is a vital support process for plant breeding. However, different plant categories have different fine-grained characteristics, i.e., intra-class variation and inter-class similarity, making the process challenging. Existing deep learning-based recognition methods fail to effectively address this recognition task under challenging requirements, leading to technical difficulties such as low accuracy and lack of generalization robustness. To address these requirements, this paper proposes PlantNet, a fine-grained network for plant recognition based on transfer learning and a bilinear convolutional neural network, which achieves high recognition accuracy in high-throughput phenotyping requirements. The network operates as follows. First, two deep feature extractors are constructed using transfer learning. The outer product of the different spatial locations corresponding to the two features is then calculated, and the bilinear convergence is computed for the different spatial locations. Finally, the fused bilinear vectors are normalized via maximum expectation to generate the network output. Experiments on a publicly available Arabidopsis dataset show that the proposed bilinear model performed better than related state-of-the-art methods. The interclass recognition accuracy of the four different species of Arabidopsis Sf-2, Cvi, Landsberg and Columbia are found to be 98.48\%, 96.53\%, 96.79\% and 97.33\%, respectively, with an average accuracy of 97.25\%. Thus, the network has good generalization ability and robust performance, satisfying the needs of fine-grained plant recognition in agricultural production.},

In recent years, deep neural networks have gained popularity and have inspired new ideas for emotion recognition based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Recently, widespread use of transformer-based architectures has been observed, providing state-of-the-art results in several domains, from natural language processing to computer vision, and object detection. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness and accuracy of a novel transformer-based architecture, called perceiver, which claims to be able to handle inputs from any modality, be it an image, audio, or video. We utilize the perceiver architecture on raw EEG signals taken from one of the most widely used publicly available EEG-based emotion recognition datasets, i.e., DEAP, and compare its results with some of the best performing models in the domain.},

  abstract     = {Globally, 80\% of the world population use electricity as a prime energy source. Government and private organizations face many challenges in providing efficient power facilities to their customers due to over-population and exponential increase in electricity demands. Furthermore, the abrupt damages in transmission lines pose another big barrier in the form of reliable and safer power transmissions. These line damages become more severe when the transmission infrastructure spans thousands of kilometers. Mostly, it results in life loss (humans and cattle), destruction of homes and crops, over-costing, etc. To address these problems, a hybrid deep learning mechanism is proposed in this research work that can accurately identify the damages in the transmission lines. This model consists of convolution neural network (CNN) and support vector machine (SVM) where CNN is used for the classification damaged power-line images, while SVM for the identification and calculating the severity of damaged power-lines using statistical information. Applicability of the model is validated using UAVs and other performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, F-score, error-rate, simulation time, area under curve values, and True–False values. The proposed model outperformed by generating a high recognition rate of 95.57\% for the identification of damaged power-lines. The implications of this research work include no humans and cattle life loss, no extra transmission lines management and checkup costs, no destruction of homes crops, etc.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a framework for time-efficiently finding multiple answers that meet multiple logical constraints and are Pareto-optimal for multiple objective functions. The proposed framework determines a set of optimal answers by iteratively replacing a set of definite clauses. Clause replacement is performed using a SAT solver consisting of equivalent transformation rules (ETRs). An ETR replaces a definite clause with one or more clauses while preserving the declarative meaning of the union of the original clause and problem clauses. To efficiently find optimal answers, in this paper, we define a new class of ETRs that are generated based on the evaluation results of a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) and propose a method for generating ETRs that belong to the new class. ETRs belonging to the new class help to replace definite clauses according to user objectives such as cost–benefit performance, reliability, and financial constraints. Thus, a SAT solver that uses the new ETR class in addition to extant ETR classes can preferentially replace definite clauses that produce the optimal answer for user objectives. Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework can significantly reduce the computation time and memory usage necessary to determine a set of optimal answers for user objectives.},

  abstract     = {Skin diseases are the most important worrying problems in societies because it affects the patients both physically and psychologically. Skin disease is one of the highly prone to risk with an association of climatic factors around the world. Predicting the skin disease cases associated with influencing factors is the most crucial task. It is very difficult task to identify the appropriate and optimal features for skin disease from the large volume of health sector data available in the world. Previous researchers applied different types of ensemble features selection techniques for the appropriate selection of features which gives highest accuracy with minimum computation time. Classification rate of any algorithm depends on feature extraction techniques and classifier used for classification purpose. Data availability is one of the most significant drawbacks in the health sector if data are available that might be in raw format. Filling missing value and type conversion almost takes 70\% of the time. The missing value can be addressed by statistical parameters such as mean, average and median with stand mechanism in machine learning. The objective of this paper is the selection of significant attributes and removes irrelevant features that affect model performance. The performance of skin disease data can be experimented through K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine and random forest classifier. The entire research is carried out on the real-time dataset. The efficiency of the proposed approach is measured through confusion matrix, accuracy, F-measure, precision and recall.},

Random beamforming deployment facilitates low latency transmission besides the reliable communication in the systems with massive connectivity.

We also introduce an optimum low complexity PSO-based algorithm to further improve the outage probability. The simulation and analysis results demonstrate 50\% reduction in the outage probability in average by performing the PSO-based optimization algorithms. A comparison between the performance of PSO-based algorithm and some metaheuristic algorithms is performed.

Unfortunately, control valves tend to suffer from many issues, and stiction is one of the long-standing faults that results in oscillations in important process variables which are highly undesirable. In the present work, unthresholded recurrence plots and texture analysis previously developed for mining industry (Kok et al. in IFAC-PapersOnLine 52:36-41, 2019) is applied to diagnose stiction in process control loops. Texture features are extracted from distance matrices derived from typical control-loop OP-PV data generated from a valve stiction model. A neural network model is then trained based on the extracted features. The optimised classification model is then applied in industrial control loops to identify the presence of stiction. The results from 78 benchmark industrial loops with varying faulty issues show a comparable performance with the recent methods reported in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Stability analysis of interval time-varying delay is of great significance to ensure the reliable control of industrial processes. Aim to improve the robust stability analysis performance for a class of linear systems with norm-bounded uncertainty and interval time-varying delay. In this paper, less conservative robust stability criterion is proposed based on augmented Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) method and reciprocally convex combination. Firstly, the delay interval is divided into multiple non-equidistant subintervals by two-stage segmenting strategies and a new LKF comprising quadruple integral term is introduced for each subinterval. Secondly, a novel delay-dependent stability criterion in terms of linear matrix inequalities is proved by less conservative Wirtinger-based integral inequality approach. Two numerical comparative examples and an IEEE four-generator 11-bus power system are selected to verify the superiority of the proposed method. For the two numerical examples about closed-loop control systems and uncertain system with interval time-varying delays, the proposed robust stability criterion can enlarge the maximum allowable delay bound (MADB) about 28.4\% and 67.4\% than the best results in the previous literatures, respectively, and for the power system with four-generator 11-bus, The MADB in this paper is about 4.4\% better than the best result in the previous literatures.

  abstract     = {Human facial analysis (HFA) has recently become an attractive topic for computer vision research due to technological progress and mobile applications. HFA explores several issues as gender recognition (GR), facial expression, age, and race recognition for automatically understanding social life. This study explores HFA from the angle of recognizing a person’s gender from their face. Several hard challenges are provoked, such as illumination, occlusion, facial emotions, quality, and angle of capture by cameras, making gender recognition more difficult for machines. The Archimedes optimization algorithm (AOA) was recently designed as a metaheuristic-based population optimization method, inspired by the Archimedes theory’s physical notion. Compared to other swarm algorithms in the realm of optimization, this method promotes a good balance between exploration and exploitation. The convergence area is increased By incorporating extra data into the solution, such as volume and density. Because of the preceding benefits of AOA and the fact that it has not been used to choose the best area of the face, we propose utilizing a wrapper feature selection technique, which is a real motivation in the field of computer vision and machine learning. The paper’s primary purpose is to automatically determine the optimal face area using AOA to recognize the gender of a human person categorized by two classes (Men and women). In this paper, the facial image is divided into several subregions (blocks), where each area provides a vector of characteristics using one method from handcrafted techniques as the local binary pattern (LBP), histogram-oriented gradient (HOG), or gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). Two experiments assess the proposed method (AOA): The first employs two benchmarking datasets: the Georgia Tech Face dataset (GT) and the Brazilian FEI dataset. The second experiment represents a more challenging large dataset that uses Gallagher’s uncontrolled dataset. The experimental results show the good performance of AOA compared to other recent and competitive optimizers for all datasets. In terms of accuracy, the AOA-based LBP outperforms the state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with 96.08\% for the Gallagher’s dataset.},

  abstract     = {Image segmentation is an important step in image processing application, especially for medical images. It is also a very important task in breast cancer detection. There are various stages for breast cancer detection. The first stage is extraction/segmentation of region of interest followed by detection and classification. In this paper, a new clustering procedure is proposed to extract/segment the region of interest/lesion in mammogram images using neutrosophic set (NS). A variety of image segmentation algorithms are in the literature, but accuracy is still a crucial problem. NS has an ability to handle indeterminant information thus reducing the uncertainty in the images. The image is initially converted to an NS domain, which is described using three membership sets: degree of truth (T), degree of indeterminacy (I), and degree of false (F). In our work, indeterminate degree is computed using a novel technique that uses Shannon entropy and standard deviation. Then, a neutrosophic similarity-based image is formed using neutrosophic similarity function, which is then clustered to detect lesion/tumor. In the clustering algorithm, three image features and also a second criterion function, which is an exponential entropy, are used. The proposed algorithm has been tested on different types of mammogram images along with a comparative study with existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can segment the mammogram images more effectively and accurately.},

Among these approaches, interval approach is more realistic. This work deals with a green production model in interval environment. Due to consideration of interval-valued demand and defective rates, the corresponding differential equations of inventory levels of the proposed model are represented in interval form. With the help of parametric representation of interval, these differential equations are solved. The corresponding profit maximization problem is obtained in the interval form. To transform the said maximization problem into crisp form, interval order relations and centre-radius optimization technique are used and, the transformed problem is solved with the help of different metaheuristic algorithms.

  abstract     = {Beetle Antennae Search algorithm is a kind of intelligent optimization algorithms, which has the advantages of few parameters and simplicity. However, due to its inherent limitations, BAS has poor performance in complex optimization problems. The existing improvements of BAS are mainly based on the utilization of multiple beetles or combining BAS with other algorithms. The present study improves BAS from its origin and keeps the simplicity of the algorithm. First, an adaptive step size reduction method is used to increase the usability of the algorithm, which is based on an accurate factor and curvilinearly reduces the step size; second, the calculated information of fitness functions during each iteration are fully utilized with a contemporary optimal update strategy to promote the optimization processes; third, the theoretical analysis of the multi-directional sensing method is conducted and utilized to further improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Finally, the proposed Enhanced Beetle Antennae Search algorithm is compared with many other algorithms based on unbiased test functions. The test functions are unbiased when their solution space does not contain simple patterns, which may be used to facilitate the searching processes. As a result, EBAS outperformed BAS with at least 1 orders of magnitude difference. The performance of EBAS was even better than several state-of-the-art swarm-based algorithms, such as Slime Mold Algorithm and Grey Wolf Optimization, with similar running times. In addition, a WSN coverage optimization problem is tested to demonstrate the applicability of EBAS on real-world optimizations.},

  abstract     = {The objective of a fixed-cost transportation problem (FCTP) is to minimize the total transportation cost (or to maximize the total profit). FCTPs become more complex due to the presence of uncertain factors like suppliers’ capacity, customers’ demand, fixed cost and amount of goods transported. In order to deal with its complexity, three mathematical models, namely the expected value, chance-constrained and measure chance models, are basically available in the literature. This paper aims to solve the crisp equivalent models of an uncertain two-echelon FCTP by employing a robust hybrid evolutionary algorithm. The framework of the designed algorithm comprises of parameter-free Jaya algorithm and the efficient quadratic approximation operator. Initially, its efficiency is validated on the 24 constrained benchmark functions from CEC 2006 (Liang et al. in Problem definitions and evaluation criteria for the CEC 2006 special session on constrained real-parameter optimization, 2006) and 30 unconstrained benchmark functions (Rao in Int J Ind Eng Comput 7:19–34, 2016). Friedman rank test and Iman–Davenport test are conducted for both constrained and unconstrained test instances. Additionally, five real-life engineering design problems are solved to further analyze the flexibility of the proposed algorithm. The computational results and convergence graphs justify the robustness of the designed algorithm over state-of-the-art algorithms. Finally, its application is demonstrated on chance-constrained and measure chance two-echelon FCTP models. Near-optimal results are contradicted by genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization in solving both these models. Further, a few large-scale instances of FCTP are solved by the proposed algorithm.},

Further, we develop the required gH-subdifferential calculus for convex IVFs. Thereafter, by using the proposed gH-subdifferential calculus, we provide dual characterizations for the set of WSM of objective IVFs of convex constrained and unconstrained IOPs. Two applications of the proposed theory are presented. The first one determines the set of WSM of a minimum risk portfolio interval optimization problem.

Many existing scheduling schemes based on tasks on virtual machine (VM), pursued either load balancing or migration cost under certain response time or energy efficiency, which cannot meet the true balance of the supply and demand between users and cloud providers. The paper focuses on the following multi-objective optimization problem: how to pay little migration cost as much as possible to keep system load balancing under meeting certain quality of service (QoS) via dynamic VM scheduling between limited physical nodes in a heterogeneous cloud cluster. To make these conflicting objectives coexist, a joint optimization function is designed for an overall evaluation on the basis of a load balancing estimation method, a migration cost estimation method and a QoS estimation method. To optimize the consolidation score, an array mapping and a tree crossover model are introduced, and an improved genetic algorithm (GA) based on them is proposed. Finally, empirical results based on Eucalyptus platform demonstrate the proposed scheme outperforms exiting VM scheduling models.},

In this context, particular attention is now devoted to urban mobility, mainly from a smart city perspective. The present work focuses on sustainable urban freight distribution and proposes a variant of the VRP, which presents some innovative aspects. The goal is to minimize the routes’ cost components, including traveling and external costs due to environmental issues, depending on the chosen vehicles and the different urban streets to cross. In addition, restrictions on the maximum duration of each route to ensure frequent sanitation of vehicles used for deliveries, as required from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, are imposed. The distribution network is modeled by a weighted digraph for which some properties are proved. To face the problem, we present a mixed-integer linear programming model, a math-heuristic associated with it, and a memetic algorithm approach. The results of the reported computational experimentation with random instances specifically tailored for the problem show the efficiency of the proposed methods. Further, test cases based on data of the distribution network of two B2C companies operating in the city of Genoa, Italy, proved the effective application of the proposed methods in the direction of sustainable urban distribution plans.},

  abstract     = {Complex system optimization is an emerging research topic in the field of evolutionary computation, whose goal is to handle complex systems with multiple coupled subsystems, each including multiple objectives and multiple constraints in real-world applications. This paper proposes a multi-system genetic algorithm (MSGA), stemming from implicit parallelism in population-based search algorithms, to solve multiple coupled subsystems simultaneously in a complex system. The proposed MSGA is composed of within-subsystem evolution and cross-subsystem migration operators. The objective of the former is to optimize each subsystem by appropriate search strategies, and the objective of the latter is to exchange information between multiple subsystems by migration, which is based on the similarity probability of objectives and constraints, and the intersection probability of solutions in different subsystems. During migration across subsystems, three statistical approaches of measuring similarity and three metrics of solution intersection in information theory are used to calculate these probabilities. Performance is tested on a set of multi-subsystem benchmark functions, and the simulation results show that cross-subsystem migration plays the key role for the performance of MSGA. Furthermore, the proposed MSGA is compared with other competitive algorithms, and results show that it is a promising multi-system optimization algorithm. In summary, the contribution of this paper is the introduction of multi-system optimization to the EA community.},

This paper reports an improved TLBO, namely competitive teaching–learning-based optimization, for solving multimodal optimization problems. In CTLBO, population is first divided into outstanding group and common group by the designed competitive mechanism. Then outstanding group is updated by the learning strategies of TLBO and common group is guided by outstanding group. In addition, a mutation operator for the optimal individual is introduced to increase the ability of CTLBO to escape from the local optima. The performance of CTLBO is investigated by 45 benchmark test functions from CEC 2014 and CEC 2015 test suites and three challenging real-world engineering problems. Experimental results show that CTLBO is more reliable and efficient on most test cases than TLBO and the other compared algorithms.

  abstract     = {One-class classification (OCC) is a machine learning problem where training data has only one class. Recently, self-supervised OCC algorithms have been increasing attention. These algorithms train the model for pretext tasks and use the model error for OCC. However, these tasks are specialized for images, and applying them to feature data is not practical or appropriate for such a purpose. The motivation of this study is to apply self-supervised OCC to feature data. For this purpose, this paper proposes an OCC approach using feature-slide prediction (FSP) subtask for feature data (OCFSP). The main originality is the FSP subtask, which is the first classification subtask for feature data. In particular, the proposed method creates a self-labeled dataset by generating additional feature vectors with the feature slide of original vectors and self-annotating these vectors as the number of the slides. Such a dataset is applied to train a multi-class classifier to predict the number of feature slides. Since this classification model learns data from only one class, the FSP accuracy for a seen class is higher relative to unseen classes. Accordingly, OCC could be made using the accuracy of FSP. The proposed methods are experimented with using the imbalanced-learn, covtype, and kddcup datasets. OCFSP shows fair accuracy where few training data is given. In addition, classification subtask for feature data shows a relatively fast testing speed, unlike image data. Therefore, the bottleneck of the self-supervised approach is considered the memory size, which is the main difference between image and feature data.

Besides the difficulty of gathering data from the human brain via different channel probs, preprocessing of data is another different and important task that must be solved in order to get better achievement. Selection of the most active channels is an important problem to achieve high classification accuracy. Metaheuristics are good solutions for selecting the optimal subset from the original set, as they have the ability to obtain an acceptable solution in a reasonable time. At the same time, it is necessary to use the correct feature extraction method so that the data can be properly represented. In addition, traditional deep learning methods used for emotion recognition ignore the spatial properties of EEG signals. This reduces the classification accuracy. In this study, we used artificial bee colony optimization algorithm on the seed dataset to increase the classification accuracy. We implemented and tested four different variations of this algorithm. Then, we extracted the features of the obtained channels with the Welch PSD method. We used enhanced capsule network as a machine learning algorithm and showed the best configuration to solve the problem. At the end of the process, 99.98\% training and 99.83\% test accuracy rates were obtained.},

With the wide application of convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks in image processing, this paper proposes a BFPN-RCNN algorithm for detecting and recognizing curved text in architectural images. A comparison with other image detection algorithms on different datasets proves that the algorithm can effectively identify curved text at different angles in natural scene images.},

  abstract     = {Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the major cause of visual impairment among diabetic patients. Significant works have been done to hybrid a modified CNN architecture such as AlexNet with some of classifiers such as support vector machines (SVMs) or fuzzy C-Means (FCM) to improve the DR screening. This new hybrid innovative structure uses more efficient extracting features of a retinal images in both spatial and spectral domains. In spite the advantages of this innovative architecture, the different kernel functions affect the performance of the proposed algorithm. Using the appropriate transformed data into two- or three-dimensional feature maps and using an improved support vector domain description (ISVDD) can obtain more flexible and more accurate image description. To this end, the optimal degree values of different kernel functions can be extracted by using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Also, we compared the performance of our approach (modified-AlexNet-ISVDD) with the results obtained by hybrid modified AlexNet and some of classifiers such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and FCM clustering. We achieve the proposed CNN architecture using ISVDD on the DIARETDB1 and MESSIDOR datasets, with more than 99\% sensitivity.},

  abstract     = {Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is responsible for the ongoing global pandemic. Stringent measures have been adopted to face the pandemic, such as complete lockdown, shutting down businesses and trade, as well as travel restrictions. Nevertheless, such solutions have had a tremendous economic impact. Although the use of recent vaccines seems to reduce the scale of the problem, the pandemic does not appear to finish soon. Therefore, having a forecasting model about the COVID-19 spread is of paramount importance to plan interventions and, then, to limit the economic and social damage. In this paper, we use Genetic Programming to evidence dependences of the SARS-CoV-2 spread from past data in a given Country. Namely, we analyze real data of the Campania Region, in Italy. The resulting models prove their effectiveness in forecasting the number of new positives 10/15 days before, with quite a high accuracy. The developed models have been integrated into the context of SVIMAC-19, an analytical-forecasting system for the containment, contrast, and monitoring of Covid-19 within the Campania Region.},

  abstract     = {Ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is a cancer with a high mortality rate. Among the main reasons for this baleful prognosis is that, in most patients, this neoplasm is diagnosed at a too advanced stage. Clinical oncology research is now particularly focused on decoding the cancer molecular onset by understanding the complex biological architecture of tumor cell proliferation. In this direction, machine learning has proved to be a valid solution in many sectors of the biomedical field, thanks to its ability to mine useful knowledge by biological and genetic data. Since the major risk factor is represented by genetic predisposition, the aim of this study is to find a mathematical model describing the complex relationship existing between genetic mutations of the involved genes and the onset of the disease. To this end, an approach based on evolutionary algorithms is proposed. In particular, genetic programming is used, which allows solving a symbolic regression problem through the use of genetic algorithms. The identification of these correlations is a typical objective of the diagnostic approach and is one of the most critical and complex activities in the presence of large amounts of data that are difficult to correlate through traditional statistical techniques. The mathematical model obtained highlights the importance of the complex relationship existing between the different gene’s mutations present in the tumor tissue of the group of patients considered.},

  abstract     = {Pattern recognition and data mining using support vector machine (SVM) have been the focus of widespread researches in recent decades. In SVM, a hyper-plane is designed to classify the training data. A challenge in SVM is that the parameters of hyper-planes are constants. As a result, there may be some critical points that will be classified into a wrong set. It should be mentioned that finding this hyper-plane is very similar to solving a regression problem using parametric or semi-parametric models in statistics. This is the main motivation of this paper. The contribution of this paper is combining SVM classifier and semi-parametric models (SP-SVM) to solve the aforementioned challenge. In fact, using semi-parametric linear model results in some serial linear decision boundaries with several slopes and intercepts. In other words, there are two types of kernels in the proposed SP-SVM: the kernels that perform nonlinear transformation of the input features and the kernels needed in the semi-parametric model. The validations have been done on Iris data set and also some other linearly non-separable classification problems. The accuracy of the proposed SP-SVM outperforms some related algorithms such as K-nearest neighbor (KNN)-based weighted multi-class twin support vector machines (KWMTSVM), support vector classification–regression machine for K-class classification (K-SVCR), twin multi-class classification support vector machines (twin-KSVC), intelligent particle swarm classifier (IPS-classifier) and random forest. The accuracy of SP-SVM is 97.33\%. Thus, SP-SVM can play an important role in increasing the accuracy of industrial machines that perform classifications, for example, agricultural products.},

  abstract     = {In order to handle simultaneously the cardinal and ordinal information in decision-making process, QUALIFLEX (QUALItative FLEXible multiple criteria method) is a very well-known decision-making approach. In this work, we extend the classical QUALIFLEX method to neutrosophic environment and develop a neutrosophic QUALIFLEX (N-QUALIFLEX) method that uses the newly defined distance-based comparison approach. It is highly effective in solving multi-criteria decision problems in which both ratings of alternatives on criteria and weights of criteria are single-valued neutrosophic numbers (SVNNs), and their aggregated values are single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy numbers (SVNHFNs). A neutrosophic hesitancy index (NHI) of a SVNHN is introduced based on degrees of the truth-membership, indeterminacy-membership and falsity-membership, which is used to measure the degree of hesitancy of SVNHN. Considering the NHIS of SVNHFNs, we propose a distance-based comparison approach to determine the magnitude of the SVNHFNs. Then, we apply the comparison approach to define the concordance/discordance index, the weighted concordance/discordance index and the comprehensive concordance/discordance index that are steps of the developed N-QUALIFLEX. By taking all possible permutations of alternatives with respect to the level of concordance/discordance into account, we determine the order of alternatives in final decision. Finally, a practical example on antivirus mask selection over the COVID-19 pandemic is provided to present the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method, and a comparative study is conducted to show the advantages of the proposed method over other existing methods.},

The BCM requires fewer pairwise comparisons and leads to obtaining the fully consistent results compared to similar methods, such as the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and best worst method (BWM). The BCM requires crisp values for pairwise comparisons to obtain the criteria weights in a decision problem, while many real-world decision problems are associated with uncertain and ambiguous environments. The main aim of this paper is to extend BCM using spherical fuzzy sets (SFSs) in applications involving decision problems in ambiguous and complex environments. The SFSs are one of the latest developments in fuzzy sets and define an independent hesitance degree in addition to membership and non-membership degrees. Extending BCM using SFSs increases the preferences range of the decision-makers under uncertain conditions and consequently improves the accuracy of the obtained weights. To show the capability of the spherical fuzzy BCM (SF-BCM), a real-world decision problem was implemented to evaluate the effective criteria in the choice of a location for waste disposal in the city of Tabriz. The obtained results indicate that SF-BCM can produce more accurate results under uncertain conditions.},

  abstract     = {Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) is an effective approach for handling uncertainty in practical applications, whereas how to measure the uncertainty degree of PFS is still an open issue. In this paper, we propose a novel entropy measure of PFS by taking into account both Pythagorean fuzziness entropy in terms of the membership and non-membership degrees, and Pythagorean hesitation entropy in terms of hesitation degree. To be specific, we firstly propose a new cross-entropy measure of PFS to assess the difference of uncertainty between PFSs. By measuring the cross-entropy with the crisp set, we then propose a new entropy measure of PFS, which mathematically proves the satisfaction requirements of the axioms defined for the entropy of PFS. Based on that, we propose weighted cross-entropy and entropy measures which can be used for different applications. Furthermore, we illustrate the superiority of the proposed entropy measures of PFS by the comparisons with existing entropy measures of PFS. In addition, we propose an entropy-based multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method, which intends to minimize the total uncertainty amount of decision matrix to make the deciding result more convincing. As a result, we conduct a sensitivity analysis of the proposed weighted entropy measure in the MCDM method, and a company investment case study is attached to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed MCDM method. The experimental result shows that the MCDM method based on the newly defined weighted entropy measure is stable, even in the setting of the variation of parameter.},

The deep learning (DL) technology is applied to the analysis of enterprise financing capacity. Firstly, the problems of enterprise development are introduced against the background of big-intelligence mobile cloud along with the current situation of innovative enterprise financing and DL neural network (NN), as well as the performance advantages of DL algorithms. Secondly, the financing capability of innovative enterprises is evaluated based on the backpropagation (BP) NN algorithm. Finally, the performance of the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) algorithm is empirically analyzed, and the weight of the evaluation index of innovative enterprise financing capability is calculated. The experimental results show that the algorithm of the deep neural network (DNN) contains more hidden layers and abundant features than a shallow NN, and the feature extraction performance is better. Under the analysis of enterprise financing capability, the evaluation index of innovative enterprise financing capability is established, and the enterprise data are normalized by the maximum and minimum method, thereby facilitating the calculation of the BPNN algorithm. BPNN algorithm shows excellent performance in the training process, and the actual output value is very close to the expected value. Meanwhile, the error of the sample test is analyzed, finding that the evaluation error of the BPNN algorithm is less than 1.8\%, which has high accuracy. Therefore, the BPNN algorithm can effectively evaluate the financing capability of innovative enterprises and can adapt to the financing capability evaluation of an enterprise&#39;s actual business under the background of big-intelligence mobile cloud.

  abstract     = {The problem of designing a T–S fuzzy passive controller for fuzzy fractional-order neural networks (FOFNNs) with additive time-varying delays is taken up in this work. The novelty of this work lies in the aspect that it addresses all the challenges faced in deriving an order and delay-dependent LMI criterion for incommensurate FONNs. Based on indirect Lyapunov approach, sufficient conditions which ensure passivity of the considered FOFNNs are found. Distinct to the works already done, the results proposed include both fractional-order of the system and delay bounds. Further, the derived results are extended to incommensurate FOFNNs, thereby giving an order and delay-dependent LMI-based passivity conditions for incommensurate FOFNNs for the first time in the literature. Also a result on existence of passive controller for the considered NNs is derived. Finally, the proposed theory is verified by three numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {The modularity between aggregation functions is an important property which has close links with both distributivity condition requisite in fuzzy connectives and associative law that is rather useful within fuzzy set theory. Moreover, overlap function and grouping function as two special aggregation functions which need not be associative or have the neutral element are applied to many realms such as image processing, classification. In Zong et al. (Inf Sci 477:506–527, 2018), authors discussed most general classes of 2-uninorms, some of whose structures are not indefinite. And we note that until now all studies on 2-uninorm such as Drygaś and Rak (Fuzy Sets Syst 29:82–97, 2016), Yager and Rybalov (Fuzzy Sets Syst 80:111–120, 1996) were only confined to quite special classes of 2-uninorms mentioned in Akella (Fuzzy Sts Syst 158:1631–1651, 2007), but there are not any relevant research on the general 2-uninorm. The present paper makes an attempt to explore the modularity properties of overlap (grouping) function and all general classes of 2-uninorms. During the process, we get the equivalent conditions and full structures of related aggregation operators on modularity equation, which generalize and extend the existing relevant results.},

It is made with precisions, and the expenses are relatively high and should work with better productivity. The selection of the best conveyor is a crucial task, and the designers need to recognize different attributes that will influence the functionalities of the conveyor system to limit bottlenecks in the system. Researchers have worked on strategies for finding the best optimum solution for various selection problems, but conveyor selection using selected methods is not reported. Therefore, the present work aims to the selection process of the best option for conveyor by using four selected decision-making methods such as analytical hierarchy process, technique of order preference by similarity to ideal solution, compromise ranking method and Deng’s similarity-based method. The selection is done among four alternatives based on six attributes, viz. fixed cost each hour, variable cost each hour, conveyor speed, product width, product weight and flexibility. The analytical hierarchy process is used to determine weights of the attributes based on relative importance of each attribute. It is observed that A3 conveyor is best suitable conveyor. Hence, the proposed strategies help manufacturers to examine and choose the best conveyor.},

  abstract     = {The modern era robots are designed to realize many different tasks, and there are many types of them for different purposes. As robotic technology develops, new features are added to the robots, increasing their importance in human life. Being social is one of the preferred features of the new generation of robots. The socialness of the robots indicates the relationship between the robots and the humans. Thus, the robot evaluation process has great importance, including many different perspectives. Since the process contains a set of criteria and robot alternatives, it can be considered a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. The evaluation process includes uncertainty and vagueness because of the humans’ subjective evaluations. Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs) can be effectively utilized as an extension of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) to cope with uncertainty and vagueness in the decision-making processes. This study proposes an integrated fuzzy MCDM methodology based on interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy sets (IVPFSs) for the social robot evaluation problem (REP). By assigning IVPFSs, it is aimed to represent uncertainty and hesitancy in an effective and flexible way by using both membership and non-membership functions. For this aim, a novel integrated methodology consisting of IVPF-based forms of DEMATEL, ANP, and TOPSIS methods is suggested. While DEMATEL and ANP methods based on IVPFSs have been, respectively, utilized to consider internal and external dependencies of criteria and calculate importance degrees of criteria, the social robot alternatives have been ranked via the IVPF-TOPSIS technique. These methods have been adopted with respect to decision makers’ evaluations based on both linguistic variables and cardinal information. Since the high amount of data is in linguistic form, we also present a new way of fuzzifying the cardinal information for applicability. During a case study, five social robot alternatives have been evaluated in terms of five main and twenty-one sub-criteria. In order to present the effectiveness and the applicability of the proposed methodology, sensitivity and comparative analyses have also been conducted. A sensitivity analysis has been also applied to observe the shifts of the alternative ranks based on the changes of the criteria weights. Moreover, for verification of the obtained results IVPF-ARAS (Additive Ratio Assessment) method has been applied in the scope of comparative analysis.},

It needs the basic, or say definable, knowledge to approximate the undefinable knowledge in a knowledge space using the pair of approximation operators. Many existed approximation operators are expressed with unary form. How to mine the knowledge which is asked by binary form with rough set has received less research attention, though there are strong needs to reveal the answer for this challenging problem. There exist many information with matroid constraints since matroid provides a platform for combinatorial algorithms especially greedy algorithm. Hence, it is necessary to consider a matroidal structure on two sets no matter the two sets are the same or not. In this paper, we investigate the construction of approximation operators expressed by binary form with matroid theory, and the constructions of matroidal structure aided by a pair of approximation operators expressed by binary form.},

Comparing with other existing fuzzy rough set models, in syntax, the new one generalizes the existing ones. And most importantly, in semantics, the new one firstly considering the inconsistent bipolarity information, which is important in practice.

These encryption/decryption units can be processed in parallel, such that the speed for information encryption/decryption can be greatly improved. The drive network is used for encryption, and the response network is used for decryption. The encryption/decryption process mainly includes two steps: time-domain scrambling and encryption function operation. The chaotic sequences generated by multiple different chaotic systems are used as the keys, and the symmetric encryption method based on the synchronization of complex networks is used, which can make the key space be larger and the security be higher. Moreover, the fixed-time strategy is introduced such that the encryption/decryption time is controllable and predictable, this is a very important indicator in practical applications. The feasibility and effectiveness of the given audio encryption scheme are verified by the theoretical analysis and numerical simulation results.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a novel version of flower pollination algorithm (FPA) and it is called as quick flower pollination algorithm (QFPA). Two important changes are carried out to improve local and global search capability in QFPA. Firstly, switch probability is determined according to number of generations adaptively, unlike standard FPA. Secondly, solution generation mechanism used in local pollination is updated by arithmetic crossover. Two different problem groups are utilized to evaluate the performance of QFPA: solution of global optimization problems and training of artificial neural network. Firstly, 56 benchmark test functions are used for analysis of global optimization problems. Secondly, artificial neural network is trained by QFPA to identify nonlinear dynamic systems and four different nonlinear dynamic systems are utilized. Root-mean-square error (RMSE) is choosen as the performance metric. In the identification of nonlinear systems based on neural network, QFPA provides up to 60\% performance improvement compared to standard FPA. The results obtained for both problem types are compared with bee algorithm, harmonic search, artificial bee colony algorithm, standard FPA and some variants of FPA. The Wilcoxon signed rank test is used to determine significance of the results belonging to neural network training. The results show that QFPA is generally more effective than related meta-heuristic algorithms in both problem types.},

  abstract     = {The detection of watermarks can be achieved by statistical approaches. How to select robust modeling object, appropriate statistical model, and decision rules is one of the major issues in statistical image watermark detection. In this paper, we propose a new image watermark detector in robust fast radial harmonic Fourier moments (FRHFMs) magnitudes domain, wherein the Beta-exponential distribution model and locally most powerful (LMP) decision rule are used. We first investigate the statistical modeling of the robust FRHFMs magnitudes by the Beta-exponential distribution. It is shown that the Beta-exponential distribution model fits the empirical data more accurately than the formerly employed statistical distributions, such as the Cauchy, Weibull, BKF, and Exponential, do. Motivated by the statistical modeling results, we design a blind image watermark detector in FRHFMs magnitudes domain by using Beta-exponential distribution and LMP test. Also, we utilize the Beta-exponential model to derive the closed-form expressions for the watermark detector. We provide comparative experimental results to alternative approaches to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed image watermark detector.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection is an important data preprocessing method in data mining and machine learning, yet it faces the challenge of “curse of dimensionality” when dealing with high-dimensional data. In this paper, a self-adaptive level-based learning artificial bee colony (SLLABC) algorithm is proposed for high-dimensional feature selection problem. The SLLABC algorithm includes three new mechanisms: (1) A novel level-based learning mechanism is introduced to accelerate the convergence of the basic artificial bee colony algorithm, which divides the population into several levels and the individuals on each level learn from the individuals on higher levels, especially, the individuals on the highest level learn from each other. (2) A self-adaptive method is proposed to keep the balance between exploration and exploitation abilities, which takes the diversity of population into account to determine the number of levels. The lower the diversity is, the fewer the levels are divided. (3) A new update mechanism is proposed to reduce the number of selected features. In this mechanism, if the error rate of an offspring is higher than or is equal to that of its parent but selects more features, then the offspring is discarded and the parent is retained, otherwise, the offspring replaces its parent. Further, we discuss and analyze the contribution of these novelties to the diversity of population and the performance of classification. Finally, the results, compared with 8 state-of-the-art algorithms on 12 high-dimensional datasets, confirm the competitive performance of the proposed SLLABC on both classification accuracy and the size of the feature subset.},

  abstract     = {Today, model checking is one of the essential techniques in the verification of software systems. This technique can verify some properties such as reachability in which the entire state space is searched to find the desired state. However, model checking may lead to the state space explosion problem in which all states cannot be generated due to the exponential resource usage. Although the results of recent model checking approaches are promising, there is still room for improvement in terms of accuracy and the number of explored states. In this paper, using deep reinforcement learning and two neural networks, we propose an approach to increase the accuracy of the generated witnesses and reduce the use of hardware resources. In this approach, at first, an agent starts to explore the state space without any knowledge and gradually identifies the proper and improper actions by receiving different rewards/penalties from the environment to achieve the goal. Once the dataset is fulfilled with the agent&#39;s experiences, two neural networks evaluate the quality of each operation in each state, and afterwards, the best action is selected. The significant difficulties and challenges in the implementation are encoding the states, feature engineering, feature selection, reward engineering, handling invalid actions, and configuring the neural network. Finally, the proposed approach has been implemented in the Groove toolset, and as a result, in most of the case studies, it overcame the problem of state space explosion. Also, this approach outperforms the existing solutions in terms of generating shorter witnesses and exploring fewer states. On average, the proposed approach is nearly 400\% better than other approaches in exploring fewer states and 300\% better than the others in generating shorter witnesses. Also, on average, the proposed approach is 37\% more accurate than the others in terms of finding the goals state.},

  abstract     = {Aspect-level sentiment classification aims to integrating the context to predict the sentiment polarity of aspect-specific in a text, which has been quite useful and popular, e.g., opinion survey and products’ recommending in e-commerce. Many recent studies exploit a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to perform aspect-level sentiment classification, but the limitation of long-term dependencies is not solved well, so that the semantic correlations between each two words of the text are ignored. In addition, traditional classification model adopts SoftMax function based on probability statistics as classifier, but ignores the words’ features in the semantic space. Support Vector Machine (SVM) can fully use the information of characteristics, and it is appropriate to make classification in the high-dimensional space, however, which just considers the maximum distance between different classes and ignores the similarities between different features of the same classes. To address these defects, we propose the two-stage novel architecture named Self Attention Networks and Adaptive SVM (SAN-ASVM) for aspect-level sentiment classification. In the first stage, in order to overcome the long-term dependencies, Multi-Heads Self Attention (MHSA) mechanism is applied to extract the semantic relationships between each two words; furthermore, 1-hop attention mechanism is designed to pay more attention on some important words related to aspect-specific. In the second stage, ASVM is designed to substitute the SoftMax function to perform sentiment classification, which can effectively make multi-classifications in high-dimensional space. Extensive experiments on SemEval2014, SemEval2016 and Twitter datasets are conducted, and compared experiments prove that SAN-ASVM model can obtain better performance.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, stochastic synchronization of the wind and solar energy using energy storage system based on real-time pricing in the day-ahead market along with taking advantage of the potential of demand response programming has been analyzed. Since renewable energies, loads and prices are uncertain, and planning is based on real-time pricing, the optimal biding proposition considers the wind power, solar system, and energy storage system. Uncertainty is addressed to solve the bidding strategy in a day-ahead market for optimal wind and PV power and optimal charging for energy storage. Batteries are the most promising device to compensate for the fluctuations of wind and photovoltaic power plants to mitigate their uncertainty. In general, using MILP is a suitable approach to address uncertainty as long as a linear formulation is acceptable for modeling either with continuous variables or integer ones. By setting some scenarios to formulate market prices, imbalance of energy, wind and solar system, the uncertainty problems could be easily solved by MILP solver. The model created enables the retailer to realize the potentials of the demand response program and exploit high technical and economic advantages. To ensure fair prices, a set of regulating constraints is considered for sales prices imposed by the regulation committees. A model is presented to optimize the electricity trading strategy in the electricity market, considering the uncertainty in the wholesale market price and the demand level. The retailer considered in this paper is a distribution company that is the owner and operator of the networks and operates under real-time pricing regulations. To model demand response, the elasticity coefficient is used. The proposed solution is implemented on a standard 144-bus sample network using a nonlinear integer programming method. The presented method results provide helpful and valuable information based on the optimal method proposed by the retailers considering the demand response program and real-time pricing system.},

The presence of harmful chemicals, inhalable particles, and toxic materials can be ten times worse as compared to outdoor air pollution. The increased concentration of PM10 pollutants in the indoor environment is a serious threat to human health in terms of critical respiratory health issues. Literature supports the application of artificial intelligence for the prediction of pollutant concentrations in building environments. In this paper, we proposed a novel application of fuzzy inference system (FIS) optimized using particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA) for forecasting PM10 concentration. The study was conducted on experimental data obtained from an Internet of Things-based IAQ monitoring system. The real-time monitoring system measures four indoor air pollutants: PM10, PM2.5, CO2, and VOC, along with two crucial thermal comfort parameters (Temperature and Humidity). The forecasting performance of the FIS with normalized dataset was measured in terms of MSE = 4.3656; MAE = 1.9351; MAPE = 9.633\% and RMSE = 2.0894. Two optimization algorithms have improved RMSE FIS-PSO = 1.0746; and FIS-GA = 0.998. The optimized FIS can be used to develop real-time air quality prediction systems for indoor environments to promote health and well-being for building occupants.},

Secondly, performing the local PCA (Pincipal Components Analysis) in the K-nearest neighbor region of data points, the relationship between intrinsic dimensions of image data is calculated. Combining it with the local tangent spatial similarity, the similarity function and its related similarity matrix of the spectral clustering can be constructed. Thirdly, by sampling points and sampling points, as well as sampling points and non-sampling points, two similarity matrices are constructed with Nyström approximation strategy and used to approximate the eigenvectors for image segmentation. Finally the IDLTS manifold spectral clustering image segmentation is accomplished based on the constructed k principal eigenvectors. Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and eight evaluation metrics are selected to compare the proposed algorithm with some existing image segmentation algorithms. Experimental results show that the IDLTS has good performance in terms of segmentation accuracy and time consumption.},

Iran is one of the top ten countries in the world in terms of producing agricultural products, especially citrus, but it does not have suitable conditions in terms of exports. Mazandaran province is a considerable source of citrus production in Iran, and the main produced citrus in the province is exported to Russia. Worth bearing in mind that although the production rate of citrus in the province is very well, the amount of export is not very appropriate. Therefore, the government struggles to adopt an appropriate approach to improve the conditions and taking the right approach is not possible without identifying the variables affecting exports. In this regard, in this study, first, the variables affecting citrus exports regarding the case are determined using literature review and the most related those to the case study are selected using the Delphi method. Then, the identified variables are ranked using the fuzzy DEMATEL method. Focusing on the results, it can be observed that “exchange rate fluctuation” and “marketing” have the most and the least impact on the development of citrus exports from the province to Russia, respectively. Moreover, to better analyze the gained results, the determined variables are divided into two main categories based on stages of trade, and each category’s variables are discussed in detail.},

One of the main contributions of this work is the proposed improvement of the Bird Swarm algorithm using a Fuzzy System approach, and we called this improvement the Fuzzy Bird Swarm Algorithm. Furthermore, we use a set of complex Benchmark Functions of the Congress on Evolutionary Computation Competition 2017 to compare the results between the original algorithm and the proposed improvement of the algorithm. The fuzzy system is utilized for the dynamic parameter adaptation of the C1 and C2 parameters of the Bird Swarm Algorithm. As a result, the Fuzzy Bird Swarm Algorithm has enhanced exploration and exploitation abilities that help in achieving better results than the Bird Swarm Algorithm. We additionally test the algorithm’s performance in a real problem in the medical area, using the optimization of a neural network to obtain the risk of developing hypertension. This neural network uses information, such as age, gender, body mass index, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, if the patient smokes and if the patient has parents with hypertension. Hypertension is one of the leading causes of heart problems, which in turn are also one of the top causes of death. Moreover, these days it causes more complications and deaths in people infected with COVID-19, the virus of the ongoing pandemic. Based on the results obtained through the 30 experiments carried out in three different study cases, and the results obtained from the statistical tests, it can be concluded that the proposed method provides better performance when compared with the original method.},

  abstract     = {Unanticipated failure of reinforced concrete structures due to corrosion of steel rebar embedded in concrete causes to increase the demand for finding methods to forecast the service life of concrete structures. In this field, the success of machine learning-based methods leads to the use of multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP) method for classifying the degree of corrosion destruction of steel in reinforced concrete in this paper. Despite the common application of MGGP that is the symbolic regression, in this research, MGGP was adapted to use in classification tasks. Accordingly, a large field database has been collected from different regions in the Persian Gulf for modeling of MGGP and neural networks. Comparing the results attained from the MGGP procedure with neural networks revealed that both methods have a good ability to predict the degree of steel corrosion damage for the data range of examined reinforced concrete. But, MGGP gives a particular mathematic equation to estimate the outcome by using the input variables. Moreover, this method can also implement sensitivity analysis simultaneously. The selected input variables by MGGP via the evolution process were the most relevant to the class corrosion whereas there was not any redundancy between them. It is in good agreement with results obtained from sensitivity analysis.},

  abstract     = {Risk aversion, which refers to the reluctant attitude of an economic agent to accept uncertain outcomes compared with a certain one even if the latter has a lower outcome in monetary value, plays a fundamental role in decision theory and risk management. This paper investigates how to measure different agents’ risk-averse attitudes towards a risky situation consisting of multiple uncertain components under uncertainty theory. First, a general method to approximately compute the multivariate uncertain risk premium is proposed. Subsequently, the multivariate uncertain risk aversion is formally defined based on the multivariate uncertain risk premium, and the corresponding sufficient condition for utility functions being multivariate risk-averse is given. Its relation to Richard’s correlation aversion under the framework of uncertainty theory is also discussed. Finally, the suggested theoretical findings are applied to an accounts receivables (ARs) pricing problem to exhibit their applicability. The results show that our method is more applicable in practice than the univariate approach. Moreover, for the AR financing, the AR owner should choose higher-credit trading partners and financial institutions with less risk aversion to cooperate for acquiring more cash.},

Numerous problems have been identified that are primarily related to the organization of planning and the role of decision-making in the reconstruction of the historic pedestrian bridges. The planning process for the reconstruction of these bridges is crucial due to increased traffic load, poor condition, or damage to bridges. Some of these bridges are part of the cultural heritage, while some are unfairly neglected. The motivation for this research arose from the need to establish the priority for the reconstruction of historic pedestrian bridges to achieve their safety, stability, functionality, and cultural preservation. For this reason, a new decision support model based on intuitionistic fuzzy group decision-making to the multi-criteria analysis is created. The model combines multi-criteria method Evaluation Based on Distance from Average Solution and grey relational degree (GRD) with intuitionistic fuzzy theory. Three relevant decision groups of experts are formed, with the knowledge and expertise in the area of research problematic, establishing criteria for the evaluation. A new approach to the consistency of criteria weights is proposed. The intuitionistic fuzzy likelihood function is developed for the aggregation of bridge evaluations. Furthermore, GRD values are calculated to determine the reconstruction priority ranking of bridge for each decision group. The final ranking is defined by integrating Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), determining spatial-functional, time, and financial constraints.},

An investment instrument in the market for structured investments is referred to as a mutual fund, and the tool to measure its price is the Net Asset Value (NAV). Investment managers and investors rely on accurate estimates of NAV of different investment funds to make informed decisions. However, predicting such complex financial series is challenging due to uncertainty and influence of economic and political factors. In this study, a NAV predictor model is designed using a low-complexity neural network, called Legendre Polynomial Neural Network (LPNN). Additionally, a Chaotic Flower Pollination Algorithm (CHFPA) was proposed in the learning phase of the network for tuning its unknown parameters. A series of ten chaotic maps has been applied to the classical FPA through three stagesto achieve improvement in the diversity of the initial population as well as to avoid local optima by carrying out unexpected swaps between global and local search processes. With an aim of accelerating global convergence speed, the selected chaotic variants have been thoroughly investigated on ten well known standard benchmark functions to find the most efficient one. The proposed LPNN-CHFPA NAV predictor model is tested on three separate data sets of reputed Indian financial firms for one day-ahead forecasting of NAV. In comparison with the other prediction models, based on the convergence curve, scatter plots, and various error metrics, the experimental results clearly show that the proposed framework performs well.},

Several simulations are provided to confirm the usefulness of the proposed model. The results validate that the recommended model can properly minimize the operation cost of the MG and reduce environmental pollution.

The popular FH techniques transform the face hallucination problem as a least square representation (LSR) formulation. The performance of these FH techniques entirely depends on how optimally the LSR problem is minimized. Hence, in this paper, a new FH model using a sparsity-based grey wolf optimization algorithm (named S-GWO-FH) is developed which optimizes the LSR problem more efficiently. The concept of sparsity with GWO helps the proposed FH model in ignoring the dislike training images; consequently, reconstructed images have better personal characteristics. It also helps in minimizing computational overhead as it reduces the population size. Moreover, a domain-specific prior is incorporated to initialize the positions of the grey wolves, which helps the GWO algorithm to converse with the more appropriate solution. Several state-of-the-art nature-inspired optimization algorithms and conventional super-resolution techniques are considered for performance comparison. The experiments results show that the proposed S-GWO-FH model is superior to competitive algorithms in terms of reconstruction capability as well as computation time.},

Recently, a lot of research has been conducted to optimize the virtual machine placement on physical machines to minimize energy consumption. Many previous studies have not considered the deadline and scheduling of Internet of Things (IoT) tasks. Therefore, the previous modelings are mainly not well-suited to the IoT environments where requests are time-constraint. Unfortunately, both the sub-problems of energy consumption minimization and scheduling fall into NP-hard issues. This study proposes a multi-objective virtual machine placement to jointly minimize energy costs and scheduling. After presenting a modified Memetic algorithm, we compare its performance with baseline methods and state-of-the-art ones. The simulation results on the CloudSim platform show that the proposed method can reduce energy costs, carbon footprints, service-level agreement violations, and the total response time of IoT requests.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, reducing greenhouse gases is a major global challenge. The CO2 emission has a remarkable contribution and reinforced concrete (RC) frames largely contribute to the emission of this gas. One method to reduce CO2 emission from the construction industry is the use of optimization methods in the structural design phase. No study has been conducted on the trade-off between structural cost and CO2 emission of RC frames with non-prismatic columns. Therefore, this paper presents the optimal design of RC frame with non-prismatic beams and non-prismatic columns to minimize the cost and CO2 emissions. The procedure is applied for RC frames and also for RC industrial frames with pitched roof. Design variables are taken as the dimensions of the cross sections of beams and columns, reinforcements of the beams and columns, compressive strength of the concrete as well as the tapered length for the non-prismatic elements. Optimal structural solutions are obtained utilizing the enhanced colliding bodies optimization algorithm. Here, designs based on minimizing CO2 emission are compared with the cost-based designs. Results show that in CO2-based design, the amount of CO2 is reduced by 3.8\% in RC frames with a 6\% increase in cost, and in the RC industrial frames with 1.3\% increase in cost, the amount of CO2 can be reduced by 7\%.},

  abstract     = {Generally, the performance of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) greatly depends on the setting of their control parameters. Many adaptive setting technologies have been developed to solve the time-consuming task of parameter settings. However, the adaptive technologies for the grey prediction evolution algorithm (GPE), which was proposed by Hu et al. in 2020 with two control parameters, have not been investigated. This paper proposes four adaptive GPE algorithms according to three typical adaptive technologies, i.e. probability distributions, statistics and mathematical models in the field of EAs. Four proposed adaptive GPE are separately based on the uniform distribution (aGPEu), normal distribution (aGPEn), average fitness (aGPEa) and chaotic sequences (aGPEc). The performance of the four proposed adaptive GPE algorithms is evaluated on CEC2014, CEC2017 benchmark functions and a suite of eight engineering constrained design problems. The experimental results show the superiority and competitiveness of all the four proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) is one of the promising optimization algorithms for optimization problems. However, it has the main drawback of trapping into a local minimum, which causes slow convergence or inability to detect a solution. Several modifications and combinations were suggested to overcome this problem. This paper presents a modified grasshopper optimization algorithm (MGOA)-based genetic algorithm to overcome this problem. Modifications rely on certain mathematical assumptions and varying the domain of the control parameter, Cmax, to escape from the local minimum and move the search process to an improved point. Parameter C is one of the essential parameters in GOA, where it balances the exploration and exploitation of the search space. These modifications aim to speed up the convergence rate by reducing the repeated solutions and the number of iterations. Both the original GOA and the proposed algorithms are tested with 19 main test functions to investigate the influence of the proposed modifications. In addition, the algorithm will be applied to solve five different cases of nonlinear systems with different types of dimensions and regularity to show the reliability and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Promising results are achieved compared to the original GOA. The proposed approach shows an average percentage of improvement of 96.18 as illustrated in the detailed results.},

  abstract     = {Support vector machine (SVM) is a popular and important machine learning technique based on the central idea of maximizing the $$minimum margin $$ , i.e., the smallest distance from the training points to the classification boundary. However, recent theoretical studies revealed that maximizing the minimum is not crucial to the generalization performance, while the $$margin distribution $$ is essential. Furthermore, kernel-free quadratic support vector machine becomes a new trend in the SVM area since it can avoid some difficulties such as finding appropriate kernel functions and tuning their hyper-parameters. This paper proposes two novel non-kernel quadratic surface optimal margin distribution machine (QSODM $$^L$$ and QSODM) models. Their basic idea is to optimize the margin distribution of training points by maximizing the margin mean, minimizing the margin variance and classifying data points by directly constructing a quadratic surface in the original space. These proposed models are convex so that they can be solved by some well-known solvers. Moreover, in order to improve the efficiencies of proposed models on large-scale data sets, a stochastic gradient descent with variance reduction (SVRG) algorithm is proposed to solve the proposed models. The numerical results on some artificial and benchmark data sets verify that QSODM $$^L$$ and QSODM are superior to some other well-known SVM models in classification accuracy and computational efficiency.},

Then, correlation coefficients are adopted to evaluate the recognition results of the DNNs. The reliabilities of the DNNs’ recognition results are divided into 6 levels according to the outputs of the DNNs and the correlation coefficients. Finally, the evaluation results of the three DNNs are put through fusion processing to generate more reliable recognition results. This algorithm identifies fault signals from multiple angles and combines the correlation coefficients to make a comprehensive judgment, which is beneficial for fault identification.

  abstract     = {Human age estimation from facial images has become an active research topic in computer vision field because of various real-world applications. Temporal property of facial aging display sequential patterns that lie on the low-dimensional aging manifold. In this paper, we propose hidden factor analysis (HFA) model-based discriminative manifold learning method for age estimation. The hidden factor analysis decomposes facial features into independent age factor and identity factor. Various age invariant face recognition systems in the literature utilize identity factor for face recognition; however, the age factor remains unutilized. The age component of the hidden factor analysis model depends on the subject’s age. Thus it carries significant age-related information. In this paper, we demonstrate that such aging patterns can be effectively extracted from the HFA-based discriminant subspace learning algorithm. Next, we have applied multiple regression methods on low-dimensional aging features learned from the HFA model. Effect of reduced dimensionality on the accuracy has been evaluated by extensive experiments and compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Effectiveness and robustness in terms of MAE and CS of the proposed framework are demonstrated using experimental analysis on a large-scale aging database MORPH II. The accuracy of our method is found superior to the current state-of-the-art methods.},

However I-ELM and its variants suffer from a notorious problem, that is, the input parameters of these algorithms are randomly assigned and kept fixed throughout the training process, which results in a very unstable performance of the model. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Back-Propagation ELM (BP-ELM) in this study, which can dynamically assign the most appropriate input parameters according to the current residual error of the model during the increasing process of the hidden nodes. In this way, BP-ELM can greatly improve the quality of newly added nodes and then accelerate the convergence rate and improve the model performance. Moreover, under the same error level, the network structure of the model obtained by BP-ELM is more compact than that of the I-ELM. We also prove the universal approximation ability of BP-ELM in this study. Experimental results on three benchmark regression problems and a real-life traffic flow prediction problem empirically show that BP-ELM has better stability and generalization ability than other I-ELM-based algorithms.},

To solve the problem of missing data in credit classification, this study proposes a multi-layer perceptron ensemble (MLP–ESM) model that can perform data interpolation and prediction simultaneously to predict CCR. The model makes full use of non-missing information and interpolates more missing columns with fewer missing values. In this way, not only the data features needed for missing data interpolation are extracted, but also the structural relationship features between the predicted target and the existing data are extracted, which can achieve the effect of simultaneous interpolation and prediction. The results show that the MLP–ESM model can effectively interpolate and predict the missing dataset of CCR. The prediction accuracy is 83.11\%, which is better than the traditional machine learning model. This fully shows that the dataset after interpolation can achieve a better prediction effect.},

The timely and effective detection of potholes is a critical step in developing appropriate strategies for driving maintenance and safety. Detecting potholes on Indian road surfaces under diverse climatic conditions, such as potholes covered by tree shadow and filled with water, remains a challenging task. As a result, this research presents a novel method for detecting potholes on Indian roads. This work is being done in two stages. To begin, the Haar feature cascade classifier ensemble is equipped with a sequence of 9-adaptive boosting (Ada-Boost) layers to locate the potholes. Following that, an 11-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to predict the potholes. Finally, an instance segmentation algorithm is used to mask and quantify the pothole region. The proposed method is trained and tested on Kaggle, CCSAD, and custom-based pothole datasets. For performance assessment of the proposed method, the evaluation metrics, namely sensitivity, precision, recall, F1 score, and mAP, were adopted. It is found that the proposed model detects potholes with an accuracy of 98.65\%. The segmentation of 50 test images showed that the Mean Intersection over Unit (MIoU) pothole rate could be 89.52\%.},

A sense of fuzziness prevails in these situations, sometimes numerically and sometimes linguistically. Neural networks (or neural nets) help to overcome this problem. Neural networks are explicitly and implicitly hyped to draw out fuzzy rules from numerical information and linguistic information. Logic-gate and switching circuit mobilize the fuzzy data in crisp environment and can be used in artificial neural network, also.

Especially, the development of new operational rules, aggregation operators, and multi-attribute group decision-making techniques based on these rules and operators have recently piqued the interest of scientists. Acknowledging the importance of t-spherical fuzzy sets and linguistic variable in this paper, firstly, we define the notion of linguistic T-spherical fuzzy set (Lt-SFS) where membership degree, abstinence degree and non-membership degree are presented in the form of linguistic variables. Dombi operations, score function, accuracy function for linguistic T-spherical fuzzy numbers (Lt-SFNs) are defined and some prominent properties of Dombi operations are then investigated. Furthermore, two aggregations operators based on Dombi operations namely, linguistic t-spherical fuzzy Dombi weighted averaging operator and linguistic t-spherical fuzzy Dombi weighted geometric operator are also developed. At that point, these Dombi operators are used to establish an extension of the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method, and a multi-attribute group decision-making approach is proposed to solve decision-making problems which is the key innovation of this paper. Finally, we apply the proposed technique for the selection of the best variety of maize and a comparison analysis is provided to demonstrate its applicability and feasibility.},

  abstract     = {In the field of graph theory, the shortest path problem is one of the most significant problems. However, since varieties of indeterminated factors appear in complex networks, determining of the shortest path from one vertex to another in complex networks may be a lot more complicated than the cases in deterministic networks. To illustrate this problem, the model of uncertain random digraph will be proposed via chance theory, in which some arcs exist with degrees in probability measure and others exist with degrees in uncertain measure. The main focus of this paper is to investigate the main properties of the shortest path in uncertain random digraph. Methods and algorithms are designed to calculate the distribution of shortest path more efficiently. Besides, some numerical examples are presented to show the efficiency of these methods and algorithms.},

As a consequence, type-2 fuzzy set has remarkably progressed as a promising tool for dealing uncertainties in both theoretical as well as practical perspectives of various domains, like engineering, social sciences, arts and humanities, computer sciences, medical sciences, physical sciences, business and management, as well as in other areas. In this paper, a comprehensive literature survey on type-2 fuzzy set theory is presented. With the help of graphical representations, it is elaborately explained how type-2 fuzzy sets are gradually attracting the researchers years after years since its initiation. This article explores on the subject areas on which type-2 fuzzy sets have already established their potentiality to tackle imprecise information. Also, various extensions and developments of type-2 fuzzy sets have been presented in a systematic manner. Finally, future research directions of type-2 fuzzy set theory have been discussed.},

The Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) is presented with the available characteristics of the membership function, and a coupling sampling pattern, for the T-S fuzzy systems. Based on LKF, together with time derivative information of membership function, and the generalized N-order free-matrix-based inequality, the suitable conditions are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for guaranteeing the asymptotic stability and stabilization of the concerned system. Then, the desired fuzzy coupling SDC gain is attained from the solvable LMIs. In the end, two examples are given to validate the derived theoretical results.},

A well-known result of S. A. Morris states that every topological space is homeomorphic to a subspace of a product of a finite (three-element) topological space. We have already shown that the space of S. A. Morris is (in general) no longer finite in case of affine topological spaces (inspired by the concept of affine set of Y. Diers), which include many-valued topology. This paper provides an analogue of the result of S. A. Morris for topological systems of S. Vickers, and also shows that for affine topological systems, an analogue of the above three-element space becomes (in general) infinite. A simple message here is that finite systems play a (probably) less important role in the affine topological setting (for example, in many-valued topology) than they do play in the classical topology.},

By forgetting the point set, many mathematical structures related to sets can be extended to certain structures of powersets and consequently be studied as ordered structures; research in this area has yielded some interesting results. In order to study three-way concept analysis in the ordered structures, in this paper, a kind of lattice-theoretic formal contexts is proposed unprecedentedly. Firstly, we introduce the lattice-theoretic three-way formal concept lattices. Secondly, the relationship between lattice-theoretic three-way formal concepts and the lattice-theoretic formal concepts is investigated. Thirdly, we illustrate that the lattice-theoretic three-way formal concept lattice is a direct generalization of L-fuzzy formal concepts based on three-way decisions. Fourthly, the fundamental theorem for the special cases of lattice-theoretic three-way formal contexts is studied. Finally, we show that the lattice-theoretic three-way concepts are pointfree forms of some kinds of classical concepts; moreover, by the fundamental theorem, we get the characterization theorems for the classical three-way concept lattices, three-way rough concepts lattices and mixed concepts lattices; these results are compared with the available ones.},

Casting is often characterized by the properties of intensive energy consumption and complex process routes, which motivate the in-depth investigation on construction of practical multi-objective scheduling models and development of effective algorithms. In this paper, for the first time, the multi-objective casting production scheduling problem (MOCPSP) is constructed to simultaneously minimize objectives of defective rate, makespan, and total energy consumption. Moreover, a neighborhood structure enhanced discrete NSGA-II (N-NSGA-II) is designed to better cope with the proposed MOCPSP. In the N-NSGA-II, the advantage of selection mechanism of NSGA-II is fully utilized for selecting non-dominate solution, three neighborhood structures are elaborately designed to strengthen the ability of the local search, and a novel solution generating approach is proposed to increase the diversity of solutions for global search. Finally, a real-world case is illustrated to evaluate the performance of the N-NSGA-II. Computational results show that the proposed N-NSGA-II obtains a wider range of non-dominated solutions with better quality compared to other well-known multi-objective algorithms.},

This model is promoted by the wavelet transform and the optimization algorithm which have prompted the error reduction and the accuracy promotion of the SVR model. In the hybrid model, the correlation coefficient (R) and mean square error (MSE) are improved by 12\% and 94\%, respectively, rather than SVR. The four error criteria are employed for evaluation, and their results are ameliorated in the use of the WSVR-TLBO model. Besides the SVR model, the feed-forward neural network (FFNN), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and generalized regression neural network (GRNN) models are also applied to forecast the reservoir water level. The comparison of these models with the hybrid one is performed, and the results show the superiority of the hybrid model.

  abstract     = {This paper considers a special vehicle routing problem, the two-echelon vehicle routing problem with simultaneous delivery and pickup demands (2E-VRPSDP). The 2EVRPSDP differs from classic transportation and vehicle routing problems in two ways. First, freight delivery from the depot to the customers is managed by shipping the freight through intermediate satellites. Second, each customer in the 2E-VRPSDP may have simultaneous delivery and pickup demands. The 2E-VRPSDP is an extension of the two-echelon vehicle routing problem (2E-VRP) and the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous delivery and pickup (VRPSDP). A variable neighborhood search algorithm is designed to solve the 2E-VRPSDP in which both feasible and infeasible solutions can be explored. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm is effective and that the algorithm can provide reasonable solutions within an acceptable computational time.},

  abstract     = {Wind energy is an important green energy. The use of wind energy can alleviate the pressure caused by the shortage of traditional energy. The wind speed is affected by many factors, which makes it difficult to forecast accurately. Most wind speed forecasting methods only consider the wind speed data. The other influence factors are usually ignored. In this paper, we use traditional wind speed data and weather factors as the input of our proposed model. In the proposed model, wavelet threshold is employed to reduce the noise of raw wind speed data. We apply grey relational analysis to select the weather factors that have great influence on wind speed. The wind speed data are the input vectors of Elman neural network (Elman) and back propagation optimized by cuckoo search. Weather factors are the input vectors of WNN-GRNN which combines the wavelet neural network (WNN) and general regression neural network (GRNN). Finally, the forecasting results of the weather factors and wind speed data are combined by variance reciprocal method. The data sets at Kalaeloa Oahu, Hawaii are chosen to test the validity of the proposed model. The results show that the proposed model has obvious advantages compared to other benchmark forecasting models.},

We propose SECOI as a global method or as SECOI+dist, where by involving spatial weighting, we create a local method with increased performance.

  abstract     = {The assessment of sustainable supplier is very significant for supply chain management (SCM). The procedure of sustainable supplier selection (SSS) is a complex process for decision experts (DEs) due to the association of diverse qualitative and quantitative attributes. As the uncertainty is usually ensued in the SSS and hesitant fuzzy set (HFS), an extension of fuzzy set (FS) has been demonstrated as one of the effective ways to treat the uncertain information in realistic problems. The objective of this paper is to propose an integrated hesitant fuzzy–data envelopment analysis (DEA)–full consistency method (FOCUM)–multi attribute border approximation area comparison (MABAC) method called HF-DEA-FUCOM-MABAC framework to assess the multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problems on HFSs settings. In this line, first, the efficient alternatives are chosen using the DEA method. Second, The FUCOM is used to compute the subjective weight of attributes. Third, The HF-MABAC method is presented to prioritize the alternatives in an MADM problem. In the following, a case study of SSS problem for an Auto-making company is taken to show the practicality and utility of the presented approach. Next, we present a sensitivity investigation with different attribute weights set to observe the steadiness of the presented approach. Finally, we draw attention toward a comparison between presented approach with the extant HF-FOCUM-TOPSIS model to show its advantage and potency as well.},

The feasibility of the algorithm is demonstrated, and the calculation method of the theoretical lower bound of the original problem is given. Experimental results show that TORA, RTO and UTO algorithms can get results close to the theoretical lower bound. When the number of unit tasks is too large, the average task completion time of TORA algorithm is more than 20\% less than that of RTO algorithm. When the user task uploads a large amount of data, the average completion time of TORA algorithm task is more than 15\% less than that of RTO and UTO algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Inventory management requires thousands or millions of individual transactions each year. Classification of the items influences the results of inventory management. Traditionally, this is usually classified with considering an annual dollar usage criterion but maybe other criteria such as lead time, criticality, perishability, inventory cost, and demand type can be affected on that classification. Inventory items that have more than one criterion are discussed under multi-criteria inventory classification (MCIC) methods in the literature. In this paper, the MCIC problem is considered with two objectives as follows: (1) minimization of total inventory relevant cost and (2) minimization of the dissimilarity index. The proposed Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model of the MCIC problem is formulated using Scatter Search Algorithm (SSA). The suggested multi-objective optimization problem is solved using LP-metric, ɛ-constraint and weighted sum method. Pareto optimal solutions are obtained according to these different methods and selected best method by using deviation index. Scatter Search Algorithm provides high-quality solutions within reasonable computation times. The proposed model generated a Pareto frontier solution with the maximum satisfaction level and minimum distance from ideal point. Finally, the proposed model is implemented with two numerical datasets to show the performance of its efficiency and compared our results with other studies in the previous literature.},

  abstract     = {Due to the extent and existence of multiple branches in the distribution network, one of the main challenges in this network will be the issue of fault location. Gradually, with the expansion of smart grids and the use of smart meters in the distribution network, various methods are proposed to use these devices to the fault location. In this paper, fault location in the distribution network is defined as an optimization problem with an objective function based on network voltage changes before and after the fault. The objective function of the problem consists of the difference between the two approaches. In the first approach, the combination of the power flow (PF) method with smart meter data is used to calculate voltage changes before and after the fault in each network node. In the second approach, by calculating the network impedance matrix per the hypothetical fault location in each node of the network, these voltage changes are calculated, and by comparing the results of these two approaches, when the objective function of the problem is minimized, the optimal answer will be the fault location in the network. Therefore, in this issue, two objective functions of the difference between these two approaches are defined, one to identify the faulty section and the other to fault location has been used. The required data are extracted from the network partly before the fault and partly after the fault. Due to the need to process these data, the volume of calculations and the wide distribution network, a genetic algorithm (GA) has been used to solve the problem. To evaluate the speed and accuracy of the proposed method in fault location, the proposed method has been implemented on the largest distribution network, namely the IEEE 123-node distribution test system through MATLAB software. The results showed that the proposed method had a good performance for types of faults and different fault resistance so that it was able to detect the location of the fault with an accuracy of 1.501\% in less than 60 s.},

In DSRACO, ACO is integrated with a unique dynamic space reduction method, an elite enhanced mechanism, and large-scale neighborhood search methods to improve the quality of the solution. The performance of DSRACO is evaluated using 73 well-known benchmark instances in comparison with ACO and three other cutting-edge algorithms.

Through DSM manipulation, a partitioned DSM is formed to express the activity process that is more suitable for reconstruction. This research shows that the activities sequence and content need to be changed to adapt to the reconstruction scenario, and some activities may even be canceled. Some suggestions can help construct the project faster, including closer cooperation between design and construction.

Such optimization problems are generally regarded as large-scale many-objective optimization problems (LSMaOPs). Although a variety of search-based optimization algorithms have been proposed to solve various types of synthetic and real-world LSMaOPs, the problems of producing a well-distributed approximation of the Pareto front remain challenging. In this work, we propose a grid-based large-scale many-objective particle swarm optimization, namely GLMPSO, for solving the LSMaOPs, i.e., large-scale many-objective software module clustering problems (LMSMCPs). To balance the convergence and diversity of the GLMPSO, a grid-based ranking strategy and angle-based selection strategy are employed at different stages of the selection process. To balance the exploration and exploitation of the solution space, and avoid GLMPSO getting stuck in local minima, we use the center-based velocity computation. To test the effectiveness of the proposed GLMPSO, it is applied over nine LMSMCPs of software module clustering and the obtained results are compared with five existing approaches. The comparative results demonstrate that the proposed approach is more effective and has significant advantages over existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {With the growth of multinational companies, increasing international and domestic competition between companies, upgrading information technology, and increasing customer expectations, accurate supply chain (SC) planning is essential. In such an environment, pollution has become more severe in recent decades, and with the weakening of the environment and global warming, green SC management strategies have become significant issues in recent decades. In this research, we consider the integrated production and distribution planning problem of a multi-level green closed-loop SC system, which includes multiple recycling, manufacturing/ remanufacturing, and distribution centers. We present a three-level bi-objective programming model to maximize profit and minimize the amount of greenhouse gas emissions. A hierarchical iterative approach utilizing the LP-metric method and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is introduced to solve the proposed model. The Taguchi approach is applied to find optimum control parameters of NSGA-II. Moreover, Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is applied to tackle uncertainty in demand, and the NSGA-II algorithm is integrated with MC simulation (MCNSGA-II). Through numerical experiments on randomly generated instances, we observe that the average of the relative gaps NSGA-II and LP-metric method are 7\%, 7\%, and 1\% for the three levels, respectively. Furthermore, it is observed that the value of convergence (C) and spacing (S) metrics of the MCNSGA-II algorithm are 0 and 1.82E + 07, which are better than NSGA-II.},

  abstract     = {Forest fire causes severe economic and ecological damage each year. Timely detection of forest fire in the early stage could effectively avoid possible disaster which requires efficient smoke recognition instead of fire identification. However, the appearance of smoke might share similarity with the background which makes accurate smoke detection difficult. In addition, in contrary to the normal state forest images, it is much more difficult to collect early stage forest fire images, so the available training data for forest smoke detection is severely imbalanced. To address the above issues, a dark channel boosted convolutional neural network has been developed for smoke detection termed as DarkCNN. A Min pooling layer is designed and adopted next to the input layer to extract the dark channel feature of the image. The dark channel of an image could enhance the difference between the smoke and non-smoke pixels and thus provide more discriminant features. To address the imbalanced data distribution problem, weighted softmax loss was adopted to train the DarkCNN. In addition, to localize the smoke region within an image with low time cost, a pipeline combining Simple Linear Iterative Cluster (SLIC) algorithm and DarkCNN has been developed which has much lower computational complexity than methods like R-CNN and its variants. SLIC is employed to segment the image and generate smoke candidates for DarkCNN. The classification results are used to localize the smoke region. Extensive experiments have verified the efficiency of DarkCNN for smoke detection based on single frame.},

In order to solve the problems of the above code recommendation technology, a code recommendation method based on joint embedded attention network (JEAN) is proposed in this paper. The method uses GRU Network to embed code snippets and describe queries into vector representation, which solves the problem of heterogeneous code snippets and natural language queries. The Attention mechanism is then used to distribute totally different weights to different components of every mode of the code snippet. The reason for the Attention mechanism is that different components of every mode of the code snippet contribute differently to the semantic vector of the final code snippet, making it interpretable. Finally, two commonly used evaluation indexes of information retrieval, SuccessRate@k and MRR, are used for experimental comparison with other baseline models. The experimental results show that the code recommendation method based on joint embedded attention network proposed in this paper can effectively recommend appropriate code snippets according to the needs of developers, and its performance is better than other baseline methods.},

Traffic has become one of the leading problems for modern life in urban settings because of the steady growth of vehicles. Tracking congestion throughout the network road for achieving intelligent transportation systems is important. However, predicting traffic flow is quite difficult due to its nonlinear characteristics. In this study, a model was proposed, that used an attention mechanism on modified recurrent neural networks (RNN). The attention mechanism was used to address the limitation of modeling long-dependencies and efficient usage of memory for computation. The modified RNN, which combines the residual module and deep stacked GRU-type RNN, was also applied as the encoder–decoder network function to improve the prediction performance of the model by decreasing vanishing gradient potential and enhancing the ability to capture longer dependencies. The proposed method was also evaluated on two real-world road sensor data from an open-access database named PeMS San Jose Bay area and Northbound Interstate 405 area. The results show how deep learning features with attention mechanisms can provide precise short-term and long-term traffic prediction compared to classical and modern deep neural network-based baselines.},

  abstract     = {Analog circuits are widely used in industrial systems and avionics. Intermittent faults (IFs) as a special type of fault in circuits are difficult to diagnose. Due to the short duration of IFs, it is first necessary to obtain IF samples from the original signal. Therefore, variational modal decomposition (VMD) and autoencoder are proposed to capture the appearing and disappearing moments of IFs. Then, IF samples can be extracted from the original signal by the detected moments of appearance and disappearance. Finally, the adaptive dynamic density peak clustering (ADDPC) method is proposed for automatically identifying IF categories. The dynamic nature of ADDPC is reflected in the fact that the density kernel is not a fixed scanning radius, but a dynamic radius density kernel based on the k nearest neighbor. The adaptability is reflected in the fact that the parameters of ADDPC can be selected automatically by particle swarm optimization according to the change of data distribution. The intelligent diagnosis method is subsequently applied to a typical analog filter circuit under three noise levels. The results show that the proposed framework has a better diagnostic performance in the presence of noise.},

  abstract     = {It is a challenging task to optimize network structure and connection parameters simultaneously in a single hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN). Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a popular non-iterative learning method in recent years, which often provides good generalization performance of a SLFN at extremely fast learning speed, yet only for fixed network structure. In this work, a cooperative binary-real genetic algorithm (CGA) based on ELM, called CGA-ELM, is proposed to adjust the structure and parameters of a SLFN simultaneously for achieving a compact network with good generalization performance. In CGA-ELM, a hybrid coding scheme is designed to evolve the network structure and input parameters, i.e., input weights between input nodes and hidden nodes as well as the biases of hidden nodes. Then output parameters, i.e., output weights between hidden nodes and output nodes, are determined by the ELM. A combination of training error and network complexity is taken as the fitness function to evaluate the performance of a SLFN. A binary GA is responsible for optimizing network structure, while a real GA and the ELM optimize collaboratively network parameters. Experimental results on classification applications demonstrate that CGA-ELM outperforms CGA and ELM significantly in terms of the generalization ability. Also, CGA-ELM has more competitive capacity when compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

The Dow Jones plus SPY data are from January 2002 to August 2008, while the NASDAQ 100 is from December 2012 to November 2017. If, on the one hand, we expect that this evolutionary behavior can be effectively captured adaptively through the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) flexible methods, on the other, in this setting, standard parametric approaches could fail to provide optimal predictions. We compared the volatility forecasts generated by the LSTM approach to those obtained through use of widely recognized benchmarks models in this field, in particular, univariate parametric models such as the Realized Generalized Autoregressive Conditionally Heteroskedastic (R-GARCH) and the Glosten–Jagannathan–Runkle Multiplicative Error Models (GJR-MEM). The results demonstrate the superiority of the LSTM over the widely popular R-GARCH and GJR-MEM univariate parametric methods, when forecasting in condition of high volatility, while still producing comparable predictions for more tranquil periods.},

The impacts of extreme events are vital to improving prediction accuracy. Aiming to demonstrate the crude oil price fluctuation and the impacts of external events, this paper employs the complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD). It decomposes the crude oil price into some constituents at various frequencies to extract a market fluctuation, a shock from extreme events and a long-term trend. The shock from extreme events is found to be the most crucial element in deciding the crude oil prices. Then we combine the iterative cumulative sum of squares (ICSS) test with the Chow test to get the structural breaks and analyze the extreme event impacts. Finally, this paper combines the structural breaks, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, and the support vector machine (SVM) to make a forecast of the crude oil prices. The empirical process proves that the CEEMD-ARIMA-SVM model with structural breaks performs the best when compared with the other ARIMA-type models and SVM-type models. The framework offers an insightful view to help decision-makers and can be used in many areas.},

  abstract     = {Khatter (Soft Comput 24:6847–16,867, 2020) pointed out that although several approaches are proposed in the literature to solve single-valued neutrosophic linear programming problems (SVNLPPS) (linear programming problems in which all the parameters except decision variables are either represented by single-valued triangular neutrosophic numbers (SVTNNS) or single-valued trapezoidal neutrosophic numbers (SVTrNNS)). However, all the methods for comparing single-valued neutrosophic numbers (SVNNS), used in existing approaches, are independent from the attitude of the decision-maker towards the risk. To fill this gap, Khatter (2020), firstly, proposed a method for comparing two SVNNS by considering the attitude of the decision-maker towards the risk. Then, using the proposed comparing method, Khatter (2020) proposed an approach to solve SVNLPPS. In this paper, it is pointed out that a mathematical incorrect result is considered in Khatter’s approach. Hence, it is inappropriate to use Khatter’s approach. Also, it is pointed out that some mathematical incorrect results are considered in other existing approaches for solving SVNLPPS. Hence, it is inappropriate to use other existing approaches for solving SVNLPPS. Furthermore, to resolve the inappropriateness of Khatter’s approach and other existing approaches, a new approach (named as Mehar approach) is proposed to solve SVNLPPS. Finally, correct optimal solution of some existing SVNLPPS is obtained by the proposed Mehar approach.},

  abstract     = {Neutrosophic cubic set is the generalized version of neutrosophic sets and interval neutrosophic sets. It can deal with the complex information by combining the neutrosophic set (NS) and cubic set (CS). Maclaurin symmetric mean operator is a classical aggregation operator in modern information fusion theory. Partitioned MSM operator can reflect the interrelationships among attributes in the same partition, but the attributes in different partitions are irrelevant. In order to efficiently gather NCS information where the attributes in the same partition are relevant but the attributes in different partitions are irrelevant, we extend the PMSM operator to neutrosophic cubic environment and define the neutrosophic cubic partitioned Maclaurin symmetric mean (NCPMSM) operator and neutrosophic cubic weighted partitioned Maclaurin symmetric mean operator. Later, in order to overcome the drawbacks of the existing score functions and effectively distinguish two NCSs, we define a novel score function of NCS. Next, based on NCWPMSM operator and the novel score function, we develop a multi-attribute group decision-making method. Finally, we give an example of supplier selection to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed MAGDM. At the same time, a comparative analysis is to show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method compared with the existing methods.},

An adaptive fuzzy system is used to generate the switching control signal to remove the chattering effect. Moreover, for better tracking and reducing the error, a supervisory fuzzy system is introduced for online tuning of the PID sliding surface gains. The Jaya optimization algorithm has been utilized for optimization of the membership function of the fuzzy sliding surface system. Due to the structural challenges associated with cable robots, the internal force concept is used to keep the cables in tension style. The stability proof of the closed-loop system is done in the sense of the Lyapunov theorem. Simulation results show the merits of the proposed controller and the reduced chattering and system robustness against parameter uncertainties, load disturbances and nonlinearities are confirmed.},

  abstract     = {Cross-efficiency evaluation is an extended form of DEA evaluation. The main difference from other models is that the evaluation of cross-efficiency takes the self-evaluation value and other evaluation values as the final efficiency score, and then ranks the decision-making units (DMUs). However, the traditional cross-efficiency model cannot guarantee the uniqueness of input weights and output weights, and the final result does not reach Pareto optimal. Also, the simple average aggregation of cross-efficiency values ignores the relative weight of DMUs and loses a lot of decision-making information, which leads to the lack of credibility of the results. Considering the decision information carried by the data and the weight of the decision-makers (DMs), this paper proposes an aggregate method of interval cross-efficiency matrix to realize the relative efficiency evaluation and the accurate ranking of the DMUs. In which DMUs are regarded as DMs, and then the relative weights of DMUs are determined by using the method of Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), and the relative advantage scores are obtained by considering the risk attitude of decision-makers based on the principle of the improved TODIM method. Finally, a numerical example is used to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, and the stability of the proposed method is verified by changing the value of $$\theta$$ . Compared with the simple average aggregation method of cross-efficiency values, the proposed method is more reasonable and feasible.},

  abstract     = {The essential idea of the residuation principle plays a fundamental role in the residuated lattice theory based on R-implications, which are derived from left-continuous t-norms providing a general logical framework frequently applied to achieve solutions for multiple criteria and decision-making problems. The definition of n-dimensional fuzzy R-implications (n-DRI) is introduced, showing that the main properties of R-implications on the unit interval [0,1] can be preserved in the n-dimensional upper simplex $$L_n([0,1])$$ , based on left-continuous n-dimensional t-norms. We also show a construction method for this class of implications, studying its relationships with intrinsic properties such as identity, neutrality, ordering and exchange principles. In addition, by considering the action of n-dimensional automorphisms, the conjugate of n-dimensional fuzzy R-implications is studied. The characterization of n-dimensional fuzzy R-implications and a methodology to obtain these operators from n-dimensional aggregations on $$L_n([0,1])$$ is discussed, as the left-continuous n-dimensional t-norms. The representable Łukasiewicz implication and minimum aggregation on $$L_n([0,1])$$ are considered to compare multiple alternatives in both approaches: (i) using admissible linear orders in $$L_n([0,1])$$ provided by a sequence of aggregations and (ii) applying the arithmetic means in n-dimensional data application, based on multiple attributes related to a selection of the best CIM (computer-integrated manufacturing) software systems obtained from decision maker evaluations.

Further, the statistical variance (SV) method is extended to the DHFS context for criteria weight determination. After that, an approach is made based on revised distance measures for ranking alternatives in multi-criteria group decision making (MCGDM).

The main aim of this paper is to design a state feedback controller such that the resulting closed-loop system is finite-time synchronized under a prescribed dissipativity performance level even in the presence of actuator failures. Moreover, a stochastic nature followed by Bernoulli distribution is described in the considered networks due to the occurrence of probabilistic nature in time-varying delays. By composing a suitable Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional containing triple summation terms with the aid of Kronecker product properties, Lyapunov stability theory and free weighting matrix approach, sufficient criteria are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities that assure finite-time synchronization and meet the dissipativity performance to the addressed CDNs. The usefulness of the presented design scheme is finally verified by numerical examples.},

This study constructed a two-stage breast cancer image segmentation framework and proposes a novel breast cancer lesion segmentation model (TR-IMUnet). The benchmark U-Net network model enables a rough delineation of the breast area in the acquired images and eliminates the influence of unrelated tissues (chest muscle, fat, and heart) on breast tumor segmentation. Based on the extracted results of the region of interest, the rectified linear unit (ReLU) function of the encoding–decoding structure in the model was replaced by an improved ReLU function to reserve and adjust the data dynamically according to input information. The segmentation accuracy of breast cancer lesions was improved by embedding a multi-scale fusion block and a transformer module in the coding path of the model, thereby obtaining multi-scale and global attention information. The experimental results showed that the breast tumor segmentation indexes Dice coefficient (Dice), Intersection over Union (IoU), Sensitivity (SEN), and Positive Predictive Value (PPV) increased by 4.27, 5.21, 3.37, and 3.68\%, respectively, relative to the U-Net reference model.

The network fully considers the high sensitivity of residual dense network to data fluctuation and uses selective convolution kernel to construct residual dense blocks to provide a dynamic selection mechanism for the receptive fields of different images, so that it can focus on the fine structure of Chinese characters and thus realize cross-channel information interaction and integration. The experimental results show that the accuracy and precision of recognition using this paper&#39;s network can reach 93.48\% and 95.37\%, which is a significant improvement compared with other recognition methods, and proves that SKRDN has good advantages in dealing with the recognition problem of ancient Chinese characters.},

  abstract     = {The article examined the deep learning models and Fastai text classification technique to predict the medical speech utterances, transcriptions, and intent to extract the 25 medicals problems. The experimental work was conducted using a large amount of data which contains 6661.wav files and one.csv file, including 13 distinct categorization fields of medical speech utterances. Each illness&#39;s exploratory data analysis demonstrated the phrase length classes and disease categorization based on the recorded speech sound of patients for each disease. The preprocessing of the task included the wordcloud consisting of all the vocabulary words having different sizes based on the number of speech utterances in each category, eliminating Nan values, verifying for duplicates, and computing the corpus and their term index. Further, features are extracted to determine the number of words in each category, the length of phrases, and the number of words in each phrase, followed by lemmatization and tokenization. Deep learning models such as GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), LSTM (Long Short Term Memory), bidirectional gated recurrent unit, bidirectional long short-term memory, and Fastai classifier have been used to exact category of disease from the medical speech utterances and their textual phrases. After the assessment, it was discovered that Fastai earned the most incredible precision, recall, accuracy, and lowest loss rate by 96.89\%, 95.8\%, 93.32\%, and 0.169, respectively. In comparison, bidirectional LSTM had achieved the highest F1 score by 95.69\% to predict the medical speech utterances for each category.},

On the other hand, the residual implications induced from commonly used aggregation functions (see, e.g., t-norms, pseudo-t-norms, uninorms, semi-uninorms and pseudo-uninorms), as a natural research topic of these commonly used aggregation functions in the case of lattice values, play a vital role in many-valued logic. In this paper, we consider the residual implications derived from the so-called $$C_L$$ -overlap functions on complete lattices which are the weak form of overlap functions on complete lattices. To be precise, firstly, we give the notion of $$R_{\mathscr {O}}$$ -implications which are residual implications induced from the $$C_L$$ -overlap functions on complete lattices and give some basic properties of them. Secondly, we focus on the conditions under which $$R_{\mathscr {O}}$$ -implications can satisfy the certain algebraic properties possessed by implications on complete lattices. Finally, we give a one-to-one correspondence between different families of certain implications on complete lattices and the family of $$C_L$$ -overlap functions on complete lattices.},

Regression tests are used to ensure that software updates do not affect other software functionality. In the process of regression tests, the tests previously used for software testing are run again. However, running all existing tests is a costly process as it will cause time and labor loss. Therefore, an optimization can be made by giving priority to the tests according to certain criteria and running the tests with high priority values. This reduces the burden of unnecessary tests and regression tests reach their goals more quickly. In this study, we show that TCP problem is equivalent to the problem of finding dominating sets for the bipartite graphs.

In the projected process, the swapping of capricious data is done with the illogical statistics stimulated by Laplace distribution to augment the aid of the possibility of creation level inside the exploration area. Opposition-based learning is one of the persuasive methods to enhance the convergence swiftness of methods. The prospering application of the opposition-based learning involves appraisal of opposite populace and prevailing populace in the parallel generation to determine the greater entrant elucidation. Quantum mechanics has been combined with the algorithms to emulate the analogous performance with the certain stage as they route in a credible powdered of median. Chaotic sequences are integrated into algorithms to augment the exploration and exploitation. Tinkerbell chaotic map engendering standards are implemented. Chaotic implanted opposition-based-quantum equipoise state (CIOQES) algorithm is based on the idea of quantum mechanics about the quantity, inbound, exodus, and fabrication in the governor capacity. Equipoise state algorithm possesses elements as entrant elucidation, and element’s location is designated as deliberation. Every element’s aptness function is calculated to define the equipoise state of populaces for picking the preeminent solution. Chaotic implanted opposition-based-quantum Ascidiacea (CIOQAA) algorithm is designed to solve the problem. Probing attitudes of Ascidiacea for nutrition spring is imitated to formulate Ascidiacea algorithm.

  abstract     = {Out of the various types of skin cancers, melanoma is observed to be the most malignant and fatal type. Early detection of melanoma increases the chances of survival which necessitates the need to develop an intelligent classifier that classifies the dermoscopic images accurately as melanoma or non-melanoma. Features extracted from an image have a major impact on the performance of a classifier. In this paper, handcrafted feature extraction techniques are used to extract features from dermoscopic images. It is quite possible that not all the features extracted from dermoscopic images contribute in the process of classification which imposes the need of selection of significant features from the feature set. Here, two binary variants of Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO) algorithm namely BHHO-S and BHHO-V are presented that employ S-shaped and V-shaped transfer functions with time-dependent behavior, respectively, for feature selection. The selected features are given to a classifier that classifies the dermoscopic image as melanoma or non-melanoma. Comparison of the performance of the proposed methods is done with existing metaheuristic algorithms. The results obtained after experimentation show the superiority of classifier that uses features selected using BHHO-S over BHHO-V and the classifiers that use existing state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms. The experimental results also reveal that texture features extracted using local binary pattern along with color features provides higher classification accuracy as compared to global and other local texture feature extraction techniques.},

This is done by deploying these RNNs with adequate data slicing and augmentation procedures to extract useful information from both domestic and international copper-related market indices for forecasting out-of-sample copper price movements. These RNN models are then empirically tested under various input window lengths, with the memory-free ANN model serving as a benchmark. The results show that the RNN models with memory units are superior to the memory-free ANN model, but the choice of a longer input window length may not produce a better prediction performance. To optimize the prediction results, the RNN models with relatively low forecasting errors are further combined using various ensemble averaging approaches (i.e., AVG or OLS, with the former being simpler) to integrate different model forecasts. Empirical findings show that the best ensemble prediction model is formed by combining just two RNNs (LSTM and BiLSTM) with shorter input window length, through the simpler AVG approach. Our results therefore suggest that in a sense, the “simpler is better” philosophy should apply for the deployment of RNN models for the task of copper price prediction.},

Therefore, in this paper, an efficient multi-modality image fusion model is proposed to fuse multi-modality medical images. To tune the hyper-parameters of the proposed model, a multi-objective differential evolution is used. The fusion factor and edge strength metrics are utilized to form a multi-objective fitness function.

  abstract     = {In laparoscopic surgery, image quality is often degraded by surgical smoke or by side effects of the illumination system, such as reflections, specularities, and non-uniform illumination. The degraded images complicate the work of the surgeons and may lead to errors in image-guided surgery. Existing enhancement algorithms mainly focus on enhancing global image contrast, overlooking local contrast. Here, we propose a new Patch Adaptive Structure Decomposition utilizing the Multi-Exposure Fusion technique to enhance the local contrast of laparoscopic images for better visualization. The set of under-exposure level images is obtained from a single input blurred image by using gamma correction. Spatial linear saturation is applied to enhance image contrast and to adjust the image saturation. The Multi-Exposure Fusion (MEF) is used on a series of multi-exposure images to obtain a single clear and smoke-free fused image. MEF is applied by using adaptive structure decomposition on all image patches. Image entropy based on the texture energy is used to calculate image energy strength. The texture entropy energy determined the patch size that is useful in the decomposition of image structure. The proposed method effectively eliminate smoke and enhance the degraded laparoscopic images. The qualitative results showed that the visual quality of the resultant images is improved and smoke-free. Furthermore, the quantitative scores computed of the metrics: FADE, Blur, JNBM, and Edge Intensity are significantly improved as compared to other existing methods.},

Besides, the interference intensity and channel gain are comprehensively analyzed to design the optimization goal to maximize network capacity. Then, by modeling the interaction between cognitive environment and decision engine as the interaction between environment and agent in deep reinforcement learning, the Q-learning algorithm integrating reinforcement learning is used to explore the maximum action reward feedback to cognitive decision engine, so as to intelligently obtain the effective interference parameters of communication state. Finally, the proposed algorithm is experimentally demonstrated based on MATLAB simulation platform. The results show that when the number of links is 300, the network capacity of proposed algorithm is about 960 $$\text{bit} \cdot \text{s}^{ - 1} \cdot \text{Hz}^{ - 1}$$ , and the cumulative average reward value reaches 0.59, which is better than the comparison algorithm, and realizes high reliable autonomous decision-making.},

  abstract     = {Cancer is a difficult disease and one of the leading causes of human mortality. There are various types of cancers associated with various parts of human anatomy. Among all cancer-related deaths, gastrointestinal (GI) cancers like esophageal, stomach, and colorectal cancer have significantly higher mortality rates. There can be a great reduction in mortality if these pre-cancerous lesions are detected and removed in earlier stages. Manual methods for cancer detection are painful and time-consuming. Video has been used as a means of detection for this type of cancer. However, video having many frames requires a lot of human effort for better analysis and is prone to the wrong diagnosis at a greater level. Automatic intelligent detection and classification help in the reduction of the death rate among cancer patients. This also can assist experts in better diagnosis and treatment. This paper presents a novel framework for the automated classification of ulcers using the WCE image KVASIR dataset. First, preprocessing is done to enhance the contrast, which improves the classification task. Well-known deep learning models ResNet50 and ResNet152-V2 are trained using preprocessed data and trained features are extracted. These features are fused using concatenation. These combined features are optimized using modified GA. The optimal number of features is then used for classification and an accuracy of 99.67 has been achieved. Results are compared with current state-of-the-art techniques and the proposed method has performed better in terms of improved accuracy.},

  abstract     = {With the emergence of deep learning method, which has been driven a great success for the field of person re-identification (re-ID). However, the existing works mainly focus on first-order attention (i.e., spatial and channels attention) statistics to model the valuable information for person re-ID. On the other hand, most existing methods operate data points respectively, which ignores discriminative patterns to some extent. In this paper, we present an automated framework named multi-scale local-global for person re-ID. The framework consists of two components. The first component is that a high-order attention module is adopted to learn high-order attention patterns to model the subtle differences among pedestrians and to generate the informative attention features. On the other hand, a novel architecture named spectral feature transformation is designed to make for the optimization of group wise similarities. Furthermore, we fuse the components together to form an ensemble model for person re-ID. Extensive experiments were conducted on the three benchmark datasets, i.e., Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, CUHK03, showing the superiority of the proposed method.},

RSA is used to decrypt digital signatures for messages. In the current communication scheme, node communication does not have scalability and communication requirements in different scenarios, and a population key negotiation communication protocol was proposed in this paper. Employing the kana and random key parameters of the nodes in the roadside cell group, 3 communication protocols for group broadcasting, group to vehicle communication, and RSU communication between groups were designed. The results show that the protocol can meet the security requirements of network communication. The results show that the communication protocol in this paper is safe and reliable. At last, the communication efficiency of communication protocol is analyzed using communication overhead and average delay. The proposed protocol is an efficient communication protocol and the scheme is superior to other schemes in terms of communication overhead and average delay.},

  abstract     = {Image denoising is tricky work required in various image processing and computer vision challenges. This paper proposes and implements a perceptual adversarial non-residual blind denoising training architecture based on non-residual adversarial learning for spatially variant blind image denoising challenges. The image denoising techniques based on the residual learning encounter an image artifacts problem on higher noise levels, fail to construct target-oriented images, and hence are limited to spatially invariant single image denoising tasks. Additionally, denoising techniques based on convolutional neural networks encounter a blurriness problem, resulting in blurry output texture of images. To solve the blind image denoising tasks and blurriness problem, we first conduct a theoretical investigation into the underlying cause. We then proposed the Non-Residual Blind Image Denoising Network, leveraging the generative adversarial network-based adversarial and non-residual learning procedures for blind image denoising applications. The proposed framework removes multiple spatially variant noises from given noisy images and constructs visually pleasant images with a single model. This model resolves the image artifacts and blurriness issue by motivating the denoising network to discover the sharp, perceptually strong, target-oriented noise-free distribution. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method can efficiently resolve the image artifacts and blurriness issue and accomplish significant denoising proficiency than the state-of-the-art denoising techniques.},

  abstract     = {Image denoising is a fundamental task in computer vision and image processing system with an aim of estimating the original image by eliminating the noise and artefact from the noise-corrupted version of the image. In this study, a nonlocal means (NLM) algorithm with NSST (non-subsampled shearlet transform) has been designed to surface a computationally simple image denoising algorithm. Initially, NSST is employed to decompose source image into coarser and finer layers. The number of decomposition levels of NSST is set to two, resulting in set of low-frequency coefficients (coarser layer) and four sets high-frequency coefficients (finer layers). The two number of levels of decomposition are used in order to preserve memory, reduce processing time, and mitigate the influence of noise and misregistration errors. The finer layers are then processed using NLM algorithm, while the coarser layer is left as it is. The NL-Means algorithm reduces noise in finer layers while maintaining the sharpness of strong edges, such as the image silhouette. When compared to noisy images, this filter preserves textured regions, resulting in retaining more information. To obtain a final denoised image, inverse NSST is performed to the coarser layer and the NL-means filtered finer layers. The robustness of our method has been tested on the different multisensor and medical image dataset with diverse levels of noise. In the context of both subjective assessment and objective measurement, our method outperforms numerous other existing denoising algorithms notably in terms of retaining fine image structures. It is also clearly exhibited that the proposed method is computationally more effective as compared to other prevailing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Recent years, software defect prediction systems are becoming quite popular since they improve software reliability by identifying the potential bugs in the code. Several models were introduced in literature that aim to support the developers. Unfortunately, these models consider the manually constructed code features and input into machine learning-based classifiers. Moreover, these baseline approaches ignore the semantic and contextual information of the source code. With this paper we present a software defect prediction model that address all these issues. The model employs bidirectional long-short term memory network (BiLSTM) and BERT-based semantic feature (SDP-BB) that captures the semantic features of code to predict defects in the corresponding software. In particular, it utilizes the BiLSTM to exploit contextual information from the embedded token vectors learned through BERT model. Moreover, it utilizes an attention mechanism to capture salient features of the nodes. This is done through a data augmentation technique for generating more training data. We evaluated our approach against state-of-the-art models using ten open-source projects in terms of F1-score in fault prediction. The experiments evaluated the performance of full-token and AST-node data processing methods conducting the length of coverage on each project from 50 to 90\% in both within-project defect prediction (WPDP) and cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) experiments. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms competing models.},

The proposed model is simulated on 5750 test images at a learning rate of 0.00001 and 30 epochs with the Adam optimizer obtaining an accuracy of 0.95 and precision of 0.97.

  abstract     = {Facial emotion recognition extracts the human emotions from the images and videos. As such, it requires an algorithm to understand and model the relationships between faces and facial expressions and to recognize human emotions. Recently, deep learning models are utilized to improve the performance of facial emotion recognition. However, the deep learning models suffer from the overfitting issue. Moreover, deep learning models perform poorly for images which have poor visibility and noise. Therefore, in this paper, an efficient deep learning-based facial emotion recognition model is proposed. Initially, contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) is applied to improve the visibility of input images. Thereafter, a modified joint trilateral filter is applied to the obtained enhanced images to remove the impact of impulsive noise. Finally, an efficient deep convolutional neural network is designed. Adam optimizer is also utilized to optimize the cost function of deep convolutional neural networks. Experiments are conducted by using the benchmark dataset and competitive human emotion recognition models. Comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed facial emotion recognition model performs considerably better compared to the competitive models},

  abstract     = {Extraction of built-up area (BUA) is essential for proper city planning and management. It enables the concerned authorities to formulate better city development policies and manage emergent disasters. However, the traditionally used optical data present spectral confusion where BUAs are mixed with other features adding to management complexities. Therefore, an advanced automated method is required to extract the spectral and textural features from satellite data for the pattern recognition of BUA. Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) has been used in the current study to identify the pattern and extract BUA of Gujranwala, Pakistan. First, eight textural features based on the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) are selected and combined with multispectral data. Then, feature selection methods are applied to select optimal features used to train the proposed support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Finally, the results from SVM classifiers are compared with k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and backpropagation neural network (BP-NN) to highlight any improvements in results. The comparisons show that the proposed approach increases the overall accuracy of linear-SVM by 8.41\%, radial basis function SVM by 8.3\%, BP-NN by 7.63\%, and k-NN by 6.6\%. This can help city managers and planners to extract critical BUA information in otherwise unplanned and rapidly expanding cities to move toward smart and sustainable cities.},

The explosive growth in online news contents has made it very difficult to discriminate between real and fake. As a result, fake news has become prevalent and immensely challenging to analyze and verify. Indeed, it is a big challenge to the government and public to debate the situation depending on case to case. For this purpose, a mechanism has to be taken on fact-checking rumors and statements particularly those that get thousands of views and likes before being debunked and refuted by expert sources. Various machine learning techniques have been used to detect and classify fake news. However, these approaches are restricted in terms of accuracy. This study has applied a random forest (RF) classifier to predict fake or real news. For this purpose, twenty-three (23) textual features are extracted from ISOT Fake News Dataset. Four best feature selection techniques like chi2, univariate, information gain and feature importance are used to select fourteen best features out of twenty-three. The proposed model and other benchmark techniques are evaluated on benchmark dataset using best features. Experimental findings show that the proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art machine learning techniques such as GBM, XGBoost and Ada Boost Regression Model in terms of classification accuracy.},

As the most common type of amentia, AD affects 60–65\% of all people with amentia and poses major health dangers to middle-aged and elderly people. For classification of AD in the early stage, classification systems and computer-aided diagnostic techniques have been developed. Previously, machine learning approaches were applied to develop diagnostic systems by extracting features from neural images. Currently, deep learning approaches have been used in many real-time medical imaging applications. In this study, two deep neural network techniques, AlexNet and Restnet50, were applied for the classification and recognition of AD. The data used in this study to evaluate and test the proposed model included those from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images collected from the Kaggle website. A convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm was applied to classify AD efficiently. CNNs were pre-trained using AlexNet and Restnet50 transfer learning models. The results of this experimentation showed that the proposed method is superior to the existing systems in terms of detection accuracy. The AlexNet model achieved outstanding performance based on five evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1 score, precision, sensitivity, and specificity) for the brain MRI datasets. AlexNet displayed an accuracy of 94.53\%, specificity of 98.21\%, F1 score of 94.12\%, and sensitivity of 100\%, outperforming Restnet50. The proposed method can help improve CAD methods for AD in medical investigations.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the use of the internet of things (IoT) has increased dramatically, and cybersecurity concerns have grown in tandem. Cybersecurity has become a major challenge for institutions and companies of all sizes, with the spread of threats growing in number and developing at a rapid pace. Artificial intelligence (AI) in cybersecurity can to a large extent help face the challenge, since it provides a powerful framework and coordinates that allow organisations to stay one step ahead of sophisticated cyber threats. AI provides real-time feedback, helping rollover daily alerts to be investigated and analysed, effective decisions to be made and enabling quick responses. AI-based capabilities make attack detection, security and mitigation more accurate for intelligence gathering and analysis, and they enable proactive protective countermeasures to be taken to overwhelm attacks. In this study, we propose a robust system specifically to help detect botnet attacks of IoT devices. This was done by innovatively combining the model of a convolutional neural network with a long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) algorithm mechanism to detect two common and serious IoT attacks (BASHLITE and Mirai) on four types of security camera. The data sets, which contained normal malicious network packets, were collected from real-time lab-connected camera devices in IoT environments. The results of the experiment showed that the proposed system achieved optimal performance, according to evaluation metrics. The proposed system gave the following weighted average results for detecting the botnet on the Provision PT-737E camera: camera precision: 88\%, recall: 87\% and F1 score: 83\%. The results of system for classifying botnet attacks and normal packets on the Provision PT-838 camera were 89\% for recall, 85\% for F1 score and 94\%, precision. The intelligent security system using the advanced deep learning model was successful for detecting botnet attacks that infected camera devices connected to IoT applications.},

  abstract     = {The rise of machine learning and neural networks has opened many doors for making various arduous real-life tasks far more accessible, in addition to their ability to analyze vast amounts of data that are considered to be impossible for humans to process. Neural networks are an essential topic as they can be applied in many real-life applications, such as image, video and sound matching, making them a very attractive research area. Numerous methods and approaches are available for training neural networks, but this paper is concerned with only the semi-supervised training approach, for which a new “enhanced semi-supervised” learning method is proposed. Semi-supervised learning means that machines, such as computers, can learn in the presence of datasets that are both labeled and unlabeled. In contrast, the supervised learning approach can be applicable with labeled data only. A novel semi-supervised learning approach for descriptor generation using artificial neural networks is proposed to control the values that are output by the neural network. However, no interaction with the assignment of these values to each input group occurs, nor is the space where the output values belong utilized. Thus, this method seeks to provide a more efficient learning approach with a more even distribution of the output throughout the output field of space, resulting in a more effective learning approach. The handwritten digit experiment showed an accuracy of 85.27\%, while Alzheimer’s detection experiment recorded an accuracy of 99.27\%. The results after applying the proposed method to two sets of experimental data revealed a significant improvement in accuracy compared with the use of Siamese neural networks in different applications.},

Among these applications, music is one that has gained attention in the last couple of years. AI-based innovative and intelligent techniques are revolutionising the music industry. It is very convenient for composers to compose music of high quality using these technologies. Artificial intelligence and music (AIM) is one of the emerging fields used to generate and manage sounds for different media like the Internet, games, etc. Sound effects in games are very effective and can be made more attractive by implementing AI approaches. The quality of the sounds in the game directly impacts the productivity and experience of the player. With computer-assisted technologies, game designers can create sounds for different scenarios or situations like horror and suspense and provide gamers with information. The practical and productive audio of a game can guide visually impaired people during other events in the game. For the better creation and composition of music, a good quality of knowledge about musicology is essential. Due to AIM, there are a lot of intelligent and interactive tools available for the efficient and effective learning of music. Learners can be provided with a very reliable and interactive environment based on artificial intelligence.

  abstract     = {One of the most important aspects for a deep interpretation of molecular biology is the precise annotation of protein functions. An overwhelming majority of proteins, across species, do not have sufficient supplementary information available, which causes them to stay uncharacterized. Contrastingly, all known proteins have one key piece of information available: their amino acid sequence. Therefore, for a wider applicability of algorithms, across different species proteins, researchers are motivated to make computational techniques that characterize proteins using their amino acid sequence. However, in case of computational techniques like deep learning algorithms, huge amount of labeled information is required to produce good results. The labeling process of data is time and resource consuming making labeled data scarce. Utilizing the characteristic to address the formerly mentioned issues of uncharacterized proteins and traditional deep learning algorithms, we propose a model called GOGAN, that operates on the amino acid sequence of a protein to predict its functions. Our proposed GOGAN model does not require any handcrafted features, rather it extracts automatically, all the required information from the input sequence. GOGAN model extracts features from the massively large unlabeled protein datasets. The term “Unlabeled data” is used for piece of information that have not been assigned labels to identify their characteristics or properties. The features extracted by GOGAN model can be utilized in other applications like gene variation analysis, gene expression analysis and gene regulation network detection. The proposed model is benchmarked on the Homo sapiens protein dataset extracted from the UniProt database. Experimental results show clear improvements in different evaluation metrics when compared with other methods. Overall, GOGAN achieves an F1 score of 72.1\% with Hamming loss of 9.5\%, using only the amino acid sequences of protein.},

  abstract     = {Recently, autonomous driving systems have become hot research which allows the drivers in making decisions to enhance safety, decrease traffic accidents, and move nearer toward completely autonomous cars and intelligent transportation systems. Autonomous driving systems necessitate consistent and accurate detection technique to detect objects in the real drivable environment. Though several object detection approaches have been available in the literature, a robust technique is needed for the recognition of occluded or truncated objects. Therefore, computer vision-based approaches can be used to accomplish cost-effective and robust solutions for the object detection process. In this aspect, this study focuses on the design of robust deep learning (DL)-enabled object detection and classification (RDL-ODC) model for autonomous driving systems. Primarily, preprocessing is performed to divide the images into local patches and transform them into a compatible form. In addition, the Adam optimizer-based MobileNetv2 model is applied as a feature extractor, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the features. Moreover, the optimal kernel extreme learning machine (OKELM) model is employed as a classifier. To properly tune the parameters included in the KELM method, the cuckoo search optimization (CSO) algorithm is utilized, and consequently, the overall classification accuracy gets improvised, showing the novelty of the work. A wide variety of simulation takes place on benchmark dataset, and the results are investigated in terms of different evaluation metrics. The simulation result demonstrates the promising performances of the RDL-ODC technique over the advanced methods with the maximum average precision of 0.960 and minimum average miss rate of 0.192\%.},

  abstract     = {Text messaging while driving has been considered a dangerous activity that may lead to serious injuries and traffic fatalities. Several assistive technologies and solutions have been developed to simplify texting activity. However, due to inconsistent and complex interface design, lack of logical navigational order, lack of context, complicated text-entry layouts, and laborious activities, the existing texting-related activities can lead to accidents. This paper recognized the risky driving patterns using the real-time AutoLog application. Based on this risky driving behavior, we have proposed ConTEXT, a usable SMS client, to overcome the issues pertaining to the usability of textual activities on smartphones while driving. ConTEXT application is evaluated both empirically as well as through real-time AutoLog application. We have collected data from 117 drivers through a questionnaire. The results show that the data are found reliable also alpha scores for all factors seem internally consistent as it ranges from 0.70 to 0.79 which is good. Similarly, we have reported Principal Component Factor Analysis and found satisfied and appropriate as the Eigenvalue for all the factors is greater than zero. Furthermore, results obtained from the AutoLog dataset show an improved user experience, better control over the touch screen with minimum visual, physical, and mental load.},

  abstract     = {Blind image quality assessment is a challenging task particularly due to the unavailability of reference information. Training a deep neural network requires a large amount of training data which is not readily available for image quality. Transfer learning is usually opted to overcome this limitation and different deep architectures are used for this purpose as they learn features differently. After extensive experiments, we have designed a deep architecture containing two CNN architectures as its sub-units. Moreover, a self-collected image database BIQ2021 is proposed with 12,000 images having natural distortions. The self-collected database is subjectively scored and is used for model training and validation. It is demonstrated that synthetic distortion databases cannot provide generalization beyond the distortion types used in the database and they are not ideal candidates for general-purpose image quality assessment. Moreover, a large-scale database of 18.75 million images with synthetic distortions is used to pretrain the model and then retrain it on benchmark databases for evaluation. Experiments are conducted on six benchmark databases three of which are synthetic distortion databases (LIVE, CSIQ and TID2013) and three are natural distortion databases (LIVE Challenge Database, CID2013 and KonIQ-10 k). The proposed approach has provided a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.8992, 0.8472 and 0.9452 subsequently and Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.8863, 0.8408 and 0.9421. Moreover, the performance is demonstrated using perceptually weighted rank correlation to indicatethe perceptual superiority of the proposed approach. Multiple experiments are conducted to validate the generalization performance of the proposed model by training on different subsets of the databases and validating on the test subset of BIQ2021 database.},

  abstract     = {With the advancement of intelligent operations and maintenance in china’s railways, necessity of equipment’s monitoring and protection from lightning has become an increasingly emerging phenomenon. The MOV (Metal Oxide Varistor) is the key component of railway surge protector, and it is necessarily used to study the description model of its degradation process. The output of the model that uses a single parameter to characterize degradation is more prone to contingency, and cannot truly and fully reflect the life state of the MOV. The degradation of MOV is a cumulative effect, and its life model should consider the surge history information. In view of the above problems, a prediction model of the residual life value of MOV is given by combining various degradation related parameters and surge history. Firstly, nine degradation related parameters are fused to construct degradation core. Then, the degradation core and surge history are fused through Markov chain to build a life model of MOV. Furthermore, the model is calibrated with experimental data. Finally, the model is validated and analyzed by experiments. The model used in this study described the degradation process of MOV more comprehensively and accurately, can predict the residual life value as well at the same time, and it has potential application in the life assessment of surge protective devices.},

In this paper, we propose task-specific image corpus summarization using semantic information and self-supervision. Our methodology makes use of GAN for the generation of features and leverages rotational invariance for employing self-supervision. All these objectives are facilitated on features from Resnet34. A summary can be obtained efficiently by using k-means clustering on the semantic embedding space and then selecting examples nearest to centroids. In comparison to end-to-end trained models, the proposed model does not require retraining to obtain summaries of different lengths.

  abstract     = {This work aims to cope with the increasingly complex geological conditions in the process of traffic tunnel construction in China, improve the stability of tunnel construction, and reduce the probability of collapse, water gushing and other hazards in the construction process. The instability and deformation mechanism of tunnel surrounding rock is explored based on the theoretical knowledge of support vector machine (SVM), fuzzy reasoning, and Q classification method, and combined with the characteristics of tunnel surrounding rock in China. Moreover, a classification model via SVM and fuzzy reasoning is constructed for tunnel surrounding rock, followed by the outline of the shortcomings of tunnel surrounding rock classification in China. Then, the corresponding optimization method is put forward according to Q classification method. Finally, simulation experiments are conducted on arch collapse surrounding rock to evaluate the deformation stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the unstable area of tunnel surrounding rock increases with the increase in tunnel span, and the supporting treatment area required by the tunnel is also greatly enlarged. With the increase in span, the settlement value of vault increases continuously, and the increase rate varies with the hardness of surrounding rock. Moreover, the influence of the change of structural plane spacing of surrounding rock on the stability of surrounding rock gradually reduces. The influence of surrounding rock with larger hardness is more significant than that of surrounding rock with smaller hardness. Furthermore, there is a corresponding relationship between the hardness of rock and the rebound value. Besides, through the comparison between the actual surrounding rock test and the surrounding rock grade, there is no significantly corresponding relationship between the rebound value and the surrounding rock grade. Therefore, the rebound instrument can be used as an auxiliary tool for determining the surrounding rock grade. The research conclusion is that the classification optimization method of tunnel surrounding rock reported here facilitates the classification speed of tunnel surrounding rock.},

  abstract     = {Predictive health monitoring systems help to detect human health threats in the early stage. Evolving deep learning techniques in medical image analysis results in efficient feedback in quick time. Fibrous dysplasia (FD) is a genetic disorder, triggered by the mutation in Guanine Nucleotide binding protein with alpha stimulatory activities in the human bone genesis. It slowly occupies the bone marrow and converts the bone cell into fibrous tissues. It weakens the bone structure and leads to permanent disability. This paper proposes the study of FD bone image analyzing techniques with deep networks. Also, the linear regression model is annotated for predicting the bone abnormality levels with observed coefficients. Modern image processing begins with various image filters. It describes the edges, shades, texture values of the receptive field. Different types of segmentation and edge detection mechanisms are applied to locate the tumor, lesion, and fibrous tissues in the bone image. Extract the fibrous region in the bone image using the region-based convolutional neural network algorithm. The segmented results are compared with their accuracy metrics. The segmentation loss is reduced by each iteration. The overall loss is 0.24\% and the accuracy is 99\%, segmenting the masked region produces 98\% of accuracy, and building the bounding boxes is 99\% of accuracy.},

  abstract     = {In order to overcome the problems of long encryption process, low data security and poor anti-attack rate of traditional tobacco enterprise trade data encryption methods, a trade data encryption of tobacco enterprises based on adversarial neural network is proposed. This method optimizes the traditional neural network by generating countermeasure network, so as to form adversarial neural network. In the adversarial neural network, the encryption processing of tobacco enterprise trade data is completed through data feature classification, design of tobacco enterprise trade data encryption protocol and data encryption channel. The experimental results show that the encryption process of this method takes between 6 s and 20 s, and the encryption efficiency is high, and this method can effectively scramble the original arrangement of the data, so as to effectively hide the effective information in the tobacco enterprise trade data, improve the anti-attack rate of the data, and effectively improve the security of the data.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing system, where multiple UAVs are used to serve mobile users. We aim to minimize the overall energy consumption of the system by planning the trajectories of UAVs. To plan the trajectories of UAVs, we need to consider the deployment of hovering points (HPs) of UAVs, their association with UAVs, and their order for each UAV. Therefore, the problem is very complicated, as it is non-convex, nonlinear, NP-hard, and mixed-integer. To solve the problem, this paper proposed an evolutionary trajectory planning algorithm (ETPA), which comprises four phases. In the first phase, a variable-length GA is adopted to update the deployments of HPs for UAVs. Accordingly, redundant HPs are removed by the remove operator. Subsequently, a differential evolution clustering algorithm is adopted to cluster HPs into different clusters without knowing the number of HPs in advance. Finally, a GA is proposed to construct the order of HPs for UAVs. The experimental results on a set of eight instances show that the proposed ETPA outperforms other compared algorithms in terms of the energy consumption of the system.},

  abstract     = {In many cases, images contain sensitive information and patterns that require secure processing to avoid risk. It can be accessed by unauthorized users who can illegally exploit them to threaten the safety of people’s life and property. Protecting the privacies of the images has quickly become one of the biggest obstacles that prevent further exploration of image data. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving scheme to protect sensitive information within images. The proposed approach combines deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing code, Arnold transformation (AT), and a chaotic dynamical system to construct an initial S-box. Various tests have been conducted to validate the randomness of this newly constructed S-box. These tests include National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) analysis, histogram analysis (HA), nonlinearity analysis (NL), strict avalanche criterion (SAC), bit independence criterion (BIC), bit independence criterion strict avalanche criterion (BIC-SAC), bit independence criterion nonlinearity (BIC-NL), equiprobable input/output XOR distribution, and linear approximation probability (LP). The proposed scheme possesses higher security wit NL = 103.75, SAC ≈ 0.5 and LP = 0.1560. Other tests such as BIC-SAC and BIC-NL calculated values are 0.4960 and 112.35, respectively. The results show that the proposed scheme has a strong ability to resist many attacks. Furthermore, the achieved results are compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. The comparison results further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

The use of a generative adversarial network (GAN) and a fully convolutional network (FCN) model to segment cell nuclei is suggested. First, the FCN model is used to perform preliminary segmentation of the cell nucleus image, in which the fully connected layer convolution and skip connection are used to improve the accuracy of image segmentation, then improve the GAN, introduce splitting branches into the discriminator structure, and combine the GAN and the splitting network into one. At the same time, pixel loss is introduced in the generator to obtain a nucleus image that is visually more similar to the real image. Finally, the segmented image output by the FCN model is used as the input of the GAN to achieve high-precision segmentation of the nucleus image. The proposed method is experimentally demonstrated based on the 2018 data science bowl data set. The results show that it can achieve rapid convergence, and the mean intersection over union (MIoU) is 85.34\%, which is better than other comparison methods.},

  abstract     = {Chinese couplet consists of two syntactically symmetric sentences which are concise but meaningful and equal in length. Creating Chinese couplets is a challenging task even in the artificial intelligence field. Couplet automatic generation approaches based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) have been studied. However, MLE-based methods are limited by exposure bias, and the token-level probability maximizing generation makes the model ignore the global control of sentences, while couplets also have strict requirements at the sentence level between two sentences, such as semantic and sentence pause. In this paper, we propose a GAN-based model to fill this gap, named CoupGAN. Specifically, we introduce a discriminative model to evaluate the global-level quality of generated sentences. Meanwhile, to deal with discrete text data, CoupGAN is trained by a policy gradient-based method. In detail, this method rewards the generator to mitigate exposure bias, which could encourage the model to generate more realistic samples. Experiments among large Chinese couplet corpora datasets demonstrate that our proposed model is superior to existing methods in various evaluation metrics.},

  abstract     = {In-Flight Wi-Fi connectivity (IFC) paves way for supporting the Internet of Things over the clouds by connecting things inside a moving aircraft to the ground. Aeronautical Ad hoc Networks (AANET) is a new breed of Mobile Ad hoc networks envisioned to experience IFC over remote or oceanic regions. Due to the challenging characteristics of AANET such as limited bandwidth, intermittent connectivity, dynamic topologies, the greater velocity of aircraft, and variable geographical network sizes, it is very hard to design a realistic mobility model and network routing with remarkable Quality of Service (QoS) and requires immediate research solution. As the complexity of provisioning QoS network services significantly relies on the routing layer, this work aims at providing intelligent, reliable, and efficient data delivery with ensured QoS. In the aim of attaining a solution for QoS routing, this paper presents twofold design strategies. Firstly, the mobility of moving aircraft is modeled with International Civil Aviation Organization separations standards to avoid collisions among moving aircrafts, second is, a novel hybrid approach combining deep learning and fuzzy logic is proposed to deal with highly dynamic nature and growing air traffic. The neighbor discovery phase of existing routing protocols incurs more packet overhead and delay because of the traditional beaconing method, which is overcome in this work by using Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast as it is kept on broadcasting the neighbor’s information in the cockpit display of every aircraft. To avoid the overwhelming of nodes, this work uses queuing delay of the neighbors to identify the node’s ability for packet transmission fairly distributes the load among aircrafts. The simulation results show that the proposed work provides notable improvements in packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and traffic overhead compared to the existing routing protocols in sparse and dense network scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Mobile robot path planning problem is a significant research area in industrial automation, which is to determine an optimal path for a robot to reach the destination by avoiding obstacles. Path planning (PP) is one of the most researched topics in mobile robotics. Deriving an optimal path from a huge number of feasible paths for a given environment is called a PP problem. The existing optimization techniques are used to consider path safety, path length, and path smoothness. The conventional optimization techniques implemented for the mobile robot path planning problem incur a lot of cost due to the high complexity to solve. In order to find the optimal path for handling the mobile robot path planning problem, the mobile robot path search based on multi-objective genetic algorithm (MRPS-MOGA) is proposed. The MRPS-MOGA is designed with the novelty of genetic algorithm with multiple objective function to solve mobile robot path planning problems. Hence the proposed MRPS-MOGA handles five different objectives such as safety, distance, smoothness, traveling time, and collision-free path to obtain optimal path. The MOGA is applied to select an optimal path among multiple as well as feasible paths. The population with feasible paths is initialized with randomly generated paths. The fitness value is evaluated for the number of available candidate paths by applying objective functions for different objectives. Then the fitness criterion determines the paths which are to be passed to participate in the next generation. MRPS-MOGA is developed with the novelty of genetic algorithms such as tournament selection, ring crossover, and adaptive bit string mutation for discovering the optimal path. For the successive generations, the population is selected using the tournament. The genetic operator, crossover operator, is applied for swapping the input string to obtain offspring which is called ring crossover. Consequently, another GA operator mutation is carried out randomly on the sequence to achieve diversity in the population. Again the individual fitness criterion is verified to obtain an optimal path from the population. An experimental study of the proposed MRPS-MOGA is carried out with different cases. The result reveals that the proposed MRPS-MOGA is better in the case of optimal path selection with lower time complexity. Based on the experimental analysis, MRPS-MOGA is a more efficient mobile robot path with higher safety, reduced energy consumption, lesser traveling time than the existing methods.},

This paper mainly studies dynamic system simulation models and algorithms based on artificial neural networks. This article mainly focuses on some practical problems of dynamic system simulation, and studies the artificial neural network model and corresponding algorithm suitable for dynamic system modeling. First, it summarizes the existing artificial neural network simulation models of dynamic systems: multi-layer feedforward network relationship model without feedback, recursive network relationship model with feedback, and their network topology diagrams are drawn. Secondly, a quantum genetic algorithm is proposed to optimize the parameters of artificial neural networks and feedforward process neural networks. To achieve the preprocessing of the parameters. Next, based on the analysis and research of BP neural network theory, this paper comprehensively compares the neural network models established under various network structures and algorithms, and establishes the simulation model based on the BP neural network monitoring data system, and compares the results with the monitoring data obtained in the field. The hidden layer of neural network with 4 and 6 nodes will increase the convergence step. When the number of nodes is 10 and 12, the convergence rate may reach 46 steps. This shows that if the non-display layer with different number of nodes in the same layer is selected for the same system simulation model based on artificial neural network, the repetition number of convergence steps of the prediction model will be different.},

Consequently, the attribute set and evaluation information chosen by decision-makers are different according to their preference. In this situation, this paper proposes a multigranulation rough fuzzy set model under heterogeneous preference information. We firstly present heterogeneous preference information system and the definition is given. What’s more, the weight information can be depicted at different levels from the perspective of granular computing. Considering the decision-makers or experts have different weights for they chosen the set of criterion, we recalculate the weight of attribute by using Choquet integral and the generalized Shapley index. Then we construct the arbitrary binary relation classes based on the inclusion measurement of the heterogeneous preference information system between any alternatives. We then give the lower and upper approximations of any fuzzy decision-making object over the heterogeneous preference information system. At the same time, several interesting properties for the defined model are given and optimistic and pessimistic multigranulation rough fuzzy set models are deduced, respectively. Moreover, the interrelationship among the established multigranulation rough fuzzy set over the heterogeneous preference information system as well as the existing multigranulation rough set models are discussed in detail. After that, we present a new approach to multiple attribute group decision making problem by using the multigranulation rough fuzzy set method with the heterogeneous preference information. The basic principle and the methodology as well as the algorithm of the decision making given in this paper are given.

  abstract     = {Participating in agricultural insurance programs can help farmers reduce risks of financial loss caused by adverse impacts, such as climate change. However, farmers in many developing countries face numerous obstacles to select a suitable agricultural insurance package, which can be attributed to different packages with various criteria including quantitative and qualitative, their different importance, and the aggregation of those weighted criteria. Thus, developing a method for evaluating packages has become a critical issue. To resolve the above problems, this paper proposes an AHP-based fuzzy TOPSIS method, in which ratings of alternative packages versus qualitative criteria are assessed in linguistic values represented by fuzzy numbers. In the proposed method, the criteria weights and the weights of distances of each alternative from positive and negative ideal solutions are generated by AHP to present the objectivity of the weight derivation process. In addition, the mean of removals is used to rank the final fuzzy values to clearly develop the formulas of the ranking procedure to help facilitate the decision-making process. A numerical example of evaluating and selecting agricultural insurance packages is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. Finally, a numerical comparison is conducted to show the robustness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Based on the basic principles of system dynamics, the mathematic description for the stock market evolution which is a typical complicated dynamic system is provided. And according to this mathematic description, a new hybrid intelligent method based on multi-layer feed-forward neural network (MFNN) which is the most widely used neural network and new improved black hole algorithm (IBHA) which is a new nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm is proposed to model the stock market. In this new hybrid intelligent method, the new IBHA whose structure is simple and which can be implemented easily, and the modified back propagation algorithm have been used to optimize the architectural and algorithmic parameters of MFNN simultaneously. This new method is applied to model two data groups of Shanghai stock market in 2015.9–2018.8 of China to show that the computing results of the new method coincide well with the real data and that the forecasting precision is highly accurate in these cases. At last, the new method has been applied to model seven other stock market data sets and compared with five state-of-the-art hybrid algorithms proposed in previous studies. The results show that the performance of the new method (including modeling effect and efficiency) has been demonstrated to be satisfactory by using for different problem settings and market situations and it is also easy to be implemented.},

  abstract     = {Due to the dependence of Photovoltaic (PV) systems on environmental conditions, their behavior is completely non-linear. Therefore, achieving the maximum power point in the nonlinear curve of PV systems faces many difficulties. The effective way to achieve the maximum power point in PVs is to design a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controller. Although different ideas are recommended for MPPT controllers, the use of the artificial neural network (ANN) controller is very attractive among them due to its high dynamic response and fewer oscillations. Nevertheless, the major challenge for designing the ANFIS-MPPT is obtaining precise training data. This work proposes a hybrid gravitational search and pattern search (GS-PS) algorithm trained ANN-based MPPT is implemented for different environmental conditions. Radiation and temperature are two important input variables while the optimum voltage is considered for the output in the proposed method. The optimum values are attained via the GS-PS algorithm to regulate ANN controller to maintain the tracking performance. In addition, the P&amp;O technique is started to operate in the following cycle and initiates a precise searching procedure from that point. Less number of samples for training is needed by applying the combined ANFIS and P&amp;O method because the P&amp;O can cover the disadvantage of the ANFIS when it cannot detect the accurate point. The simulations show the recommended method has much enhanced presentation than the previous methods in the time response as well as high accuracy. The accuracy of the offered MPPT compared to other approaches has been proven with a 2\%-8\% improvement in different temperature and radiation conditions.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing is an emerging paradigm that provides hardware, platform and software resources as services based on pay-as-you-go model. It is being increasingly used for hosting and executing service-based business processes. However, business processes are subject to dynamic evolution during their life-cycle due to the highly dynamic evolution of the cloud environment. Therefore, to efficiently manage them according to the autonomic computing paradigm, service-based business processes can be associated with autonomic managers. Autonomic managers monitor these processes, analyze monitoring data, plan configuration actions, and execute these actions on these processes. The main objective of cloud computing is to improve the performance level while minimizing operating costs. Thus, due to the diversity of business processes requirements and the heterogeneity of cloud resources, discovering the optimal management cost of a business process in the cloud becomes a highly challenging problem. For this purpose, we propose an approach based on an Integer Linear Program to find out the optimal allocation of cloud resources that meet customers’ requirements and resources’ constraints. Besides, to validate our approach under realistic conditions and inputs, we propose an extension of the CloudSim simulator to analyze the cloud resources consumed by an autonomic business process. Experiments conducted on two real datasets highlight the effectiveness and performance of our approach.},

Our work transforms the RVs into their linguistic counterparts and then formulates a methodology for pairwise comparison of the alternatives via their linguistically defines RVs. The Eigen vector corresponding to maximum Eigen value of the pairwise comparison matrix prioritizes the alternatives in each attribute. The priority vectors of the alternatives are aggregated to derive the weights of the attributes using Quadratic programming. The weighted aggregation of the attribute values provides the ranking of the alternatives in MADM. An algorithm is written to validate the procedure developed.

In this paper, an Enhanced Harris Hawk Optimization Algorithm (EHHO) is proposed and applied for estimating the required parameters of different PV models in an effective and accurate way. Harris Hawk Algorithm (HHO) is based on Hawks ways in hunting and catching their preys. The HHO utilizes two phases including exploration and exploitation. The main purpose of proposed enhancement is to improve the second phase of HHO. This enhancement is performed on the exploration phase by fluctuating toward or outward the best optimal solution using sine and cosine functions. Both conventional and proposed algorithms are applied for single, double and triple diode PV models. In order to test the applicability and robustness of proposed algorithm, it is applied for estimating the parameters of different real PV systems and compared with other recent optimization algorithms. The results show that the proposed EHHO is more accurate than conventional HHO and other algorithms.},

The conventional deep learning methods highly focused on the learning feature for a unique data type. In our work, a wavelet-based multi-modal deep convolutional neural network with an Adaptive group teaching optimization algorithm is proposed for learning hierarchical features from big data. Initially, the dataset is provided as the input to the network model for learning the optimal features. The wavelet with Haar transform has been implemented within the network to reduce the features by eliminating the redundant data. This step reduces the overall architectural complexities involved. The backpropagation algorithm with the stochastic gradient descent algorithm within the network model layers is utilized to enhance the training step. The adaptive group teaching optimization algorithm is utilized in the proposed network model to update the learned weight values by minimizing the loss function. Thus, the complexity of the architecture and the learning time can be decreased, which will lead to greater accuracy. Two datasets, such as Canadian Institute for advanced research-10 and self-taught learning-10, are used for evaluating the performances of wavelet-based multi-modal deep convolutional neural networks with an Adaptive group teaching optimization algorithm. The simulation results showed the overall performance of the proposed method in terms of accuracy, recall, and precision based on the two datasets is better than the existing methods.

In this paper, an isogrid tube multi-objective optimization considering six objectives is presented. The finite element method was applied to develop a numerical model for this complex structure, and a new optimization algorithm called the Multi-objective Lichtenberg Algorithm was used to find all the best possible designs. The optimizations were made considering two methodologies: (i) using a surrogate model derived from the design of experiments considering the response surface model and (ii) finite element updating, a direct link between the meta-heuristic and the numerical model. The latter is unprecedented in the literature for isogrid tubes and proved to be the best methodology, besides not even needing explicit equations. It discovered isogrid tube designs using TOPSIS that reduced at least 45.69\% of the mass, 18.4\% of the instability coefficient, 61.76\% of the TW, and increased the natural frequency by at least 52.57\%. The results show that optimizations via finite element updating associated with meta-heuristics not only allow the true interpretation of complex problems nature through real Pareto fronts, but can also deliver innovative results.},

For this purpose, a suitable Decision Support System should be able of providing not only early warnings, such as the detection of faults in real time, but even an accurate probability estimate of outages and failures. In other words, the performance of classification systems, at least in these cases, needs to be assessed even in terms of reliable outputting posterior probabilities, a really important feature that, in general, classifiers very often do not offer. In this paper are compared several state-of-the-art calibration techniques along with a set of simple new proposed techniques, with the aim of calibrating fuzzy scoring values of a custom-made evolutionary-cluster-based hybrid classifier trained on a set of a real-world dataset of faults collected within the power grid that feeds the city of Rome, Italy. Comparison results show that in real-world cases calibration techniques need to be assessed carefully depending on the scores distribution and the proposed techniques are a valid alternative to the ones existing in the technical literature in terms of calibration performance, computational efficiency and flexibility.},

Making decisions on how many clusters are formed, which nodes are selected as cluster heads (CHs) and who become the relay nodes significantly impact the network performance. Therefore, a distributed clustering routing protocol combined affinity propagation (AP) with fuzzy logic called DAPFL is proposed in this paper, which considers not only energy efficiency but also energy balance to extend the network lifetime. In DAPFL, AP is firstly used to determine the number of clusters and select the best CHs simultaneously based on residual energy, distance between nodes. Then, the optimal next-hop CHs are chosen by using fuzzy logic system with residual energy, data length and distance to BS as descriptors. Simulations in different scenarios are carried out to verify the effectiveness of DAPFL, and the results show that DAPFL exhibits the promising performance in terms of network energy consumption, standard deviation of residual energy, network throughput and lifetime, compared with the up-to-date distributed clustering routing protocols EEFUC, EEFRP, LEACH-AP and APSA.},

Nevertheless, the existing weight assignment methods can hardly reflect the significant influence of fuzzy evidence on the combination results. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a new method for assigning evidence weights and the corresponding combination rule. The proposed weight assignment method strengthens the consideration of fuzzy evidence. We further incorporate the Wasserstein distance to compute the clarity degree of the evidence. This is an important reference index for the weight assignment in the proposed combination rule and effectively reduces the impact of ambiguous evidence. Using experiments, we illustrate the significant impact of fuzzy evidence on the results of combination. This justifies its integration in the weight assignment process. The proposed combination rule with the new weight assignment method is also examined on a set of numerical arithmetic and Iris datasets.

  abstract     = {Fuzzy soft set theory presented by Maji et al. (J Fuzzy Math 9(3):589–602, 2001) and soft set theory presented by Molodtsov (Comput Math Appl 37(3):19–31, 1999) are important ideas in decision-making problems. They can be used to model uncertainty and make decisions under uncertainty. A single-valued neutrosophic soft set (svnf-set) is a hybrid model of a single-valued neutrosophic set and fuzzy soft set that is shown in this paper. The novel concept of single-valued neutrosophic soft topology (svnft) is defined to discuss topological structure of (svnf-set). Some fundamental properties of svnft and their related results are studied. It is good to use the proposed models of svnf-sets and svnft to figure out how to deal with uncertainty in real life. Thus, svnft is a generalization of fuzzy soft topology and fuzzy intuitionistic soft topology. Moreover, after giving the definition of a single-valued neutrosophic soft base svnf-base, we also added the concept of svnft. Finally, we set up the concept of single-valued neutrosophic soft closure spaces and show that the initial single-valued neutrosophic soft closure structures are real, which is what we did. From this fact, the category SVNSC is considered as a topological category over SET.},

To improve the feature representation capacity of BLS and guarantee the training efficiency, a novel ensemble deep model based on broad learning system is proposed, named as EDBLS. Unlike other deep or ensemble models of BLS, the results of EDBLS can be calculated by training the model only once. Meanwhile, the performance of BLS mainly depends on its structure, it is the same as EDBLS, we need to select network parameters for different real-world problems. As the lower efficiency of grid search, it is no longer suitable for EDBLS with more parameters. Therefore, coot optimization algorithm (COOT) is applied to determine the network structure of EDBLS for regression problems, it is important to note that the COOT is only a tool for determining the structure of EDBLS. Finally, the experimental results on MNIST, NORB and some regression benchmark datasets show that EDBLS has a better classification and regression performance, COOT is beneficial to select the network parameters of EDBLS for regression.},

Test cases play a significant role in software testing activities since it detects faults in the software. The selection of test cases for execution based on the priority is a considerable decision-making step since testing needs to be carried out with limited computing resources like cost, effort, and time. Prioritized selection of test cases involves considering specific test case parameters or criteria; prioritizing test cases can be conceived as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. In this paper, using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, we suggest an approach for prioritizing the selection of the test cases. AHP provides a rational framework for structuring a decision-making problem. It is used to determine the priority of a set of criteria and to calculate the consistency ratio of those criteria using pair-wise comparisons of various measures. Using a new priority regression test algorithm proposed in this study, regression test prioritization is transformed into a multi-criteria decision-making problem. The suggested strategy has a higher Average Percentage of Faults Detected (APFD) value when many determinants are taken into account. The experimental results indicate that our proposed prioritization approach would improve the probability that faults will be detected early and enhance performance compared to other prioritization strategies.},

It is observed that the effect of knowledge transferring works well together with smoothing of dependent attributes as the stock market data fluctuate with time. Finally, we give an empirical application in Shenzhen stock market with larger data sets to demonstrate the performance of the model.

One effective method to solve the corresponding problem is feature extraction-based intelligent algorithm (FEIA) framework. In the previous study, the mapper and the re-constructor of the framework are generally obtained by principal component analysis (PCA), but the solving performance still needs to further improve. Recently, neural network has attracted the attention of lots of researcher, and many structures of neural network can be used to construct the mapping-reconstruction structure of FEIA framework. However, the related studies applying neural network in FEIA framework are lacking. Compared with PCA, neural network might obtain a proper structure for FEIA framework with the well-directed training. Therefore, this paper suggests two ways applying neural network in FEIA framework, and the corresponding frameworks are tested to solve CNOP of double-gyre variation in Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). The results show that FEIA framework with neural network can obtain the solutions with better objective function values, and the corresponding solutions have a larger probability leading to the related physical phenomenon.},

  abstract     = {The current experimental teaching quality evaluation methods have been difficult to meet the quantitative and accurate requirements of evaluation indicators. For that, in this paper, we propose an ICNNs-DS (improved convolution neural networks-Dempster–Shafer) integrated model for the quality evaluation of experimental teaching. We first develop the structural risk of support vector machines to replace the criteria for the minimization of empirical risk of designing ICNNs model. Then, we devise both an advanced data processing method of evaluation matrix and a reconstruction function to comprehensively calculate various values. Furthermore, we present a targeted fusion evaluation model of DS (ICNNs-DS model) to combine various results of each of the ICNNs modules. Finally, we conduct related experiments to demonstrate the performance advantage of the ICNNs-DS integrated model. Experiment results show that: (1) the operation of ICNNs can effectively solve the complex nonlinear relationship among the evaluation indexes of experimental teaching quality. (2) The fusion method of DS, which has taken into account and retained the values representing the essential characteristics of the evaluation indexes, can well assemble various independent ICNNs modules. (3) ICNNs-DS model can enhance complementary advantages in experimental teaching quality assessment. The results of performance metrics show that the proposed ICNNs-DS integrated model has the best performance of all experimental teaching quality evaluation methods in the study.},

  abstract     = {Measurement and recognition of partial discharge (PD) in power apparatus are considered a protuberant tool for condition monitoring and assessing the state of a dielectric system. Several machine learning (ML) approaches are used for recognizing the status of the 11-kV high-voltage (HV) polymer insulator in the past decades. However, ML techniques mainly depend upon feature extraction by human experts. Recent advancement shows that usage of deep learning (DL) methods to predict the type of faults that occur in the power apparatus has attracted much attention. Compared to the machine learning (ML) algorithm, DL is very sensitive in choosing the hyperparameters. Two majors confront when applying the DL for shed damage prediction: First is very hard to find optimal network depth of convolution neural network (CNN) architecture, and second is a selection of hyperparameters during the training of the network. In this proposed work, Bayesian optimization (BO) is considered as the most popular technique for hyperparameters optimization (HO) in CNN. Meanwhile, the proposed algorithm with Nadam training optimizers shows the higher recognition rate of 99.68\% compared to other training optimizers.},

  abstract     = {Settlement estimation of a footing located over a buried conduit in a sloping terrain is a challenging task for practicing civil/geotechnical engineers. In the recent past, the advent of machine learning technology has made many traditional approaches antiquated. This paper investigates the viability, development, implementation, and comprehensive comparison of five artificial intelligence-based machine learning models, namely multilayer perceptron, Gaussian processes regression, lazy K-Star, decision table, and random forest (RF) to estimate the settlement of footing located over a buried conduit within a soil slope. The pertaining dataset of 3600 observations was obtained by conducting large-scale numerical simulations via the finite element modeling framework. After executing the feature selection technique that is correlation-based subset selection, the applied load, total unit weight of soil, constrained modulus of soil, slope angle ratio, hoop stiffness of conduit, bending stiffness of conduit, burial depth of conduit, and crest distance of footing were utilized as the influence parameters for estimating and forecasting the settlement. The predictive strength and accuracy of all models mentioned supra were evaluated using several well-established statistical indices such as Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r), root mean square error (RMSE), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), scatter index (SI), and relative percentage difference (RPD). The results showed that among all the models employed in this study, the multilayer perceptron model has shown better results with r, RMSE, NSE, SI, and RPD values of (0.977, 0.298, 0.937, 0.31, and 4.31) and (0.974, 0.323, 0.928, 0.44, and 3.75) for training and testing dataset, respectively. The sensitivity analysis revealed that all the selected parameters play an important role in determining the output value. However, the applied load, constrained modulus, unit weight, slope angle ratio, and hoop stiffness have the highest strength with the relative importance of 18.4\%, 16.3\%, and 15.3\%, 13.8\%, 11.4\%, respectively. Finally, the model was translated into a functional relationship for easy implementation and can prove useful for practitioners and researchers in predicting the settlement of a footing located over a buried conduit in a sloping terrain.},

  abstract     = {The cross-efficiency method is an effective way to rank decision-making units (DMUs) in data envelopment analysis. The traditional approach for cross-efficiency aggregation relies on an equally weighted average that ignores their relative importance. Although many aggregation methods based on prospect theory and Shannon entropy have been proposed by scholars, there are still some drawbacks in existing cross-efficiency aggregation approaches. First, the subjective weighting method based on prospect theory cannot reflect the preference of the decision maker (DM) in a more flexible way. Second, the determination of aggregation weights only considers a single perspective that may not comprehensively reflect the decision information. To address these deficiencies, this study proposes a new method for deriving meaningful aggregation weights from subjective and objective perspectives. From a subjective perspective, prospect theory is introduced to reflect the preference of DM, and this method provides an interval of reference point that is able to select such a reference point in light of the DMs’ preferences and decision goals. The idea of variance is then used to reflect the degree of deviation between peer-evaluation efficiency and self-evaluation efficiency, and objective weights are obtained. Moreover, an optimization model is constructed to obtain integrated weights that reflect both the subjective preference of the DM and the intrinsic objective information contained in the cross-efficiency matrix. Finally, two numerical examples are examined to illustrate the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed method.},

At present, many industries use SCADA to monitor as well as control the processes. In recent days, numerous attacks are targeting these systems. Thus, the furtherance of high-security SCADA is much-needed one on account of its susceptibility to attacks centered on the architectural restriction. To identify these attacks, numerous classifications, optimization methods, and intrusion detecting systems (IDS) are posited. The chief drawbacks of this prevailing work are detecting accuracy, high training time, and security. For prevailing over these disadvantages, an NK-RNN classifier is proposed to recognize the intrusions in the SCADA method. Initially, the features from the datasets are organized, and the important attributes are chosen by utilizing the Elephant Herding Optimization (EHO). Secondly, the data, which is optimized, are grouped and classified by applying the NK-RNN classifier. Then, the outcomes, which are classified, are assessed and utilized to outcome prediction. In normal data, Caesar Ciphering is employed for the prevention of attacks and also the modified elliptic curve cryptography is employed for enhancing the security level. From the performance assessment, it is revealed that the NK-RNN method attains superior performance than the prevailing classification method along with IDS algorithms.},

Additionally, the effects of different strategies are compared. Our results reveal the following: First, when the subsidy is based on output or green degree, the proportion of green product retailers receiving subsidies has only a positive impact on the wholesale price of green products. Second, when the product R&amp;D input cost is subsidized, the proportion of green product retailers receiving subsidies is negatively correlated with greenness, wholesale price, loyalty price, poaching price, market share of green products and GSC profit. Third, when the product R&amp;D input cost is subsidized, the loyalty and poaching prices of green products always increase with an increase in the subsidy coefficient. However, when the subsidy is based on output or green degree, the loyalty and poaching prices of green products increase or decrease with the increased subsidy coefficient. A numerical case example shows that the optimal subsidy strategy of a GSC under a BBP is different from those of previous studies. Subsidies based on green degrees are the optimal strategy for green product retailers, green consumers and governments.},

Another linear dynamic part in the model is expressed by the IIR digital filter. To design weights and thresholds contained in VNN and filter coefficients in IIR, a popular particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is adopted such that the model output is able to approximate the actual nonlinear system output. Finally, many examinations including different population sizes and initial conditions are performed for two nonlinear system examples. All of simulation data including the mean squared error and sum of squared error derived by the proposed method are superior to those by other existing design methods.

To evaluate the performance, each method is tested on the same parameters like population size and number of iteration. The proposed IAOA is evaluated by varying the dimensions. The impact of varying dimensions is a standard test used in previous studies for optimizing test functions that show the effect of varying dimensions on efficiency of IAOA. From this, it is noted that it works efficiently for both high and low dimensional problems. In high dimensional problem, the proposed method gives efficient search results.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this study is to introduce a stochastic computing solver for the multi-pantograph delay differential equation (MP-DDE). The MP-DDE is not easy to solve due to the singularities and pantograph terms. An advance computational intelligent paradigm is proposed to solve MP-DDE of the second kind by manipulating the procedures of the artificial neural networks (ANNs) through the optimization of genetic algorithm (GA) and sequential quadratic programming (SQP), i.e., ANNs-GA-SQP. A fitness function is constructed based on MP-DDE of second kind and corresponding boundary conditions. The correctness of the ANNs-GA-SQP is observed by performing the comparison of the proposed and exact solutions. The values of the absolute error (AE) in good measures are provided to solve the MP-DDE of the second kind. The efficacy and correctness of the stochastic computing approach to solve three problems of the MP-DDE of second kind to signify the efficiency, worth, and consistency. Moreover, the statistical soundings are applied to validate the accuracy and consistency.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the distributed economic dispatch problem (EDP) using incremental cost (IC) consensus approach for multiple distributed generators (DGs) integrated in a smart grid under supply-demand constraint. The communication topology between DGs has been considered as directed, and a novel communication scenario based on smart meters, global positioning system, and an existing graph (rather than a new communication topology for supply-demand balance) has been considered. It also relaxes the assumption of initial supply-demand balance for the consensus of ICs. Based on an additional feedback mechanism, it is shown that the consensus between incremental costs and tracking control of supply-demand in smart grid paradigm can be achieved by virtue of the proposed communication mechanism and the resultant coordination protocol. The proposed approach has been modified to cater for load/transmission system losses and measurement errors by formulating a modified EDP problem, with the addition of a parameter for compensation of losses and errors. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed distributed optimization approach via IC consensus is based on a directed communication topology, and it provides an efficient handling of supply-demand balance. In addition, novel distributed optimization methods for the conventional undirected graphs for a smart grid can be attained as a specific scenario to deal with the initial balance assumption of supply and demand. The proposed approach has been applied for distributed optimization in a smart grid and simulation results under different scenarios are provided.},

  abstract     = {A number of problems from specifiers for Boolean networks to programs for quantum computers can be encoded as matrices. The paper presents a novel family of linear, generative representations for evolving matrices. The matrices can be general or restricted within special classes of matrices like permutation matrices, Hermitian matrices, or other groups of matrices with particular algebraic properties. These classes include unitary matrices which encode quantum programs. This representation avoids the brittleness that arises in direct representations of matrices and permits the researcher substantial control of the part of matrix space being searched. The representation is demonstrated on a relatively simple matrix problem in automatic content generation as well as Boolean map induction and automatic quantum programming. The automatic content generation problem yields interesting results; the generative matrix representation yields worse fitness but a substantially greater variety of outcomes than a direct encoding, which is acceptable when generating content. The Boolean map experiments extend and confirm results that demonstrate that the generative encoding is superior to a direct encoding for the transition matrix of a Boolean map. The quantum programming results are generally quite good, with poor performance on the simplest problems in two of the families of programming tasks studied. The viability of the new representation for evolutionary matrix induction is well supported.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a quantitative method for the selection of strategic objectives and causal relationships to be included in a strategy map of a Balanced Scorecard. A strategy map usually contains the strategic objectives of an organization, grouped into four perspectives: (a) finances, (b) clients, (c) internal processes, and (d) growth and learning, all of them linked through cause-effect relationships. The use of quantitative tools, such as multicriteria decision making, has been proposed to model a strategy map and to select the causal relationships to be included. However, no work has been found in the literature to select the strategic objectives to be incorporated into the map. This is the gap that is addressed in this paper. To overcome this gap, the proposed method incorporates a fuzzy multicriteria method known as DEMATEL (decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory) with an optimization model to choose the strategic objectives and their causal relationships. DEMATEL is used to set priorities to the components of the strategy map, whereas the optimization model selects those to be included by producing the appropriate balance between conflicting goals that appear in building a strategy map (minimum amount of relationships among strategic objectives, maximizing the weight of the relationships/objectives selected). As an illustrative case, the method is applied to a higher education institution where expert judgment in this field provided validation of the strategy map designed.},

  abstract     = {The K-nearest neighbor-weighted multi-class twin support vector machine (KWMTSVM) is an effective multi-classification algorithm which utilizes the local information of all training samples. However, it is easily affected by the noises and outliers owing to the use of the hinge loss function. That is because the outlier will obtain a huge loss and become the support vector, which will shift the separating hyperplane inappropriately. To reduce the negative influence of outliers, we use the ramp loss function to replace the hinge loss function in KWMTSVM and propose a novel sparse and robust multi-classification algorithm named ramp loss K-nearest neighbor-weighted multi-class twin support vector machine (RKWMTSVM) in this paper. Firstly, the proposed RKWMTSVM restricts the loss of outlier to a fixed value, thus the negative influence on the construction of hyperplane is suppressed and the classification performance is further improved. Secondly, since outliers will not become support vectors, the RKWMTSVM is a sparser algorithm, especially compared with KWMTSVM. Thirdly, because RKWMTSVM is a non-differentiable non-convex optimization problem, we use the concave–convex procedure (CCCP) to solve it. In each iteration of CCCP, the proposed RKWMTSVM solves a series of KWMTSVM-like problems. That also means RKWMTSVM inherits the merits of KWMTSVM, namely, it can exploit the local information of intra-class to improve the generalization ability and use inter-class information to remove the redundant constraints and accelerate the solution process. In the end, the clipping dual coordinate descent (clipDCD) algorithm is employed into our RKWMTSVM to further speed up the computational speed. We do numerical experiments on twenty-four benchmark datasets. The experimental results verify the validity and effectiveness of our algorithm.},

Specifically, we discuss and evaluate the performance of the ML approaches such as SVM, KNN, and LD-PCA by utilizing raw data obtained from the optical performance monitoring tools such as wavelength division multiplexer (WDM) analyzer and optical spectrum analyzer. It is necessary to guarantee the quality of transmission (QoT) in fiber optic communication to meet the end-user requirements. Conventional approaches acquire more complex system designs to ensure the QoT that leads to computational difficulties. ML has accomplished haulage in the lightpath community in recent years to achieve high-level accurate QoT. In this work, we evaluate the performance of the proposed ML approaches on fiber networks in terms of fit-model analysis. Here, we also compared the performance of the conventional and predicted model by attributing synthetic data such as R-value, marginal error calculations, A.D factor, and standard deviations, which are retrieved from the ML regression approaches. In addition, we also provide an ML-based analytical model, which detects, identifies the quality of PMFs, allows performing decision making in unestablished lightpath implementation, and meets the state-of-art QoT classification models.},

Reinforcement learning has been proved as an efficient way to complete the quantum system control task. To learn a satisfactory control strategy under the condition of limited resources, a quantum system control method based on enhanced reinforcement learning (QSC-ERL) is proposed. The states and actions in reinforcement learning are mapped to quantum states and control operations in quantum systems. By using new enhanced neural networks, reinforcement learning can quickly achieve the maximization of long-term cumulative rewards, and a quantum state can be evolved accurately from an initial state to a target state. According to the number of candidate unitary operations, the three-switch control is used for simulation experiments. Compared with other methods, the QSC-ERL achieves close to 1 fidelity learning control of quantum systems, and takes fewer episodes to quantum state evolution under the condition of limited resources.},

We argue that the underlying information in behavior patterns can characterize users, by generating specific representation from user activities. In this paper, we propose a deep transfer learning-based recommendation model (DeepTransferR), which conducts knowledge transfer from multiple user activities. We adopt attention network to migrate the behavior pattern from auxiliary activities, and to generate personalized representations for users. In DeepTransferR, we set up an independent predictor for each user activity. We then define a weighted loss function to model knowledge interaction by incorporating the independent loss in each activity predictor. Experiments have been conducted on real-world datasets, and the results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in not only recommendation performance, but also convergence and robustness in sparse-data and cold-start environments.},

Available data on energy demand usually consist of a nonlinear real-valued sequence, but the samples are often derived from uncertain assessments without satisfying any statistical assumptions. This study thus establishes interval grey prediction models without statistical assumptions by using data intervals to represent uncertainty in energy demand forecasting. The proposed prediction models first apply nonlinear regression analysis using neural networks to determine the interval data. The models then employ grey prediction to derive the tendency of the upper and lower limits of energy demand. Finally, the best non-fuzzy performance value can be further obtained for each time point using the estimated upper and lower limits. The advantage of the proposed models is that hyper-parameter settings involving residual modification and machine learning are not a serious problem, and the construction is simple enough to implement as a computer program without any statistical assumptions. The forecasting accuracy of the proposed models was verified using actual energy demand data. The results showed that the proposed grey-prediction-based models using functional-link nets to modify residuals performed well compared to other interval grey prediction models.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce a concept of L-E-fuzzy skew lattices as a particular fuzzified version of skew lattices relative to lattice-valued algebraic structures, with fuzzy equality and fuzzy identities. In particular, L-E-fuzzy version of Green’s relations are also introduced as fuzzified forms of their classical ones in semigroup theory, and several equivalent forms of the fuzzy relations are obtained. Finally, we mainly prove that: (1) The L-E-fuzzy Green’s relations of L-E-fuzzy skew lattices are fuzzy compatible equalities on them; (2) The cut sets of L-E-fuzzy skew lattices are classical subalgebras in underlying algebras and, finally, we prove two important decomposition theorems concerning quotient algebras of cut sets over the fuzzy Green’s relations.},

  abstract     = {With the widespread popularity of cloud storage, a growing quantity of tenants prefer to upload their massive data to remote cloud data center for saving local cost. Due to the great market prospect, a large quantity of enterprises provide cloud storage services, which are equipped with different prices, reliability, security, and so on. Hence, outsourced data transfer has become a fundamental requirement for tenants to flexibly change cloud service providers (CSPs) to enjoy more suitable services. Nevertheless, how to guarantee the data integrity when the data are transferred from a cloud data center to another is a concern of tenants. To solve this concern, we design a new validation data structure, namely, counting Bloom filter tree (CBFT), which can be viewed as a specific binary tree based on CBF. Then, we present an efficient outsourced data transfer scheme supporting provable data deletion, in which tenants can flexibly change CSPs and transfer their outsourced data blocks from a cloud data center to another without retrieving them. At the same time, after the data are successfully transferred, tenants can validate the transferred data integrity and usability on the new cloud data center and permanently delete the transferred data from the old cloud data center. Moreover, the formal security analysis proves that our new solution can achieve all of the anticipant security goals without interaction with a third party. At last, we develop a prototype system and implement our new solution, thus providing accurate performance evaluation, which intuitively presents the high efficiency and practicality of our new solution.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the periodic signal tracking and the disturbance rejection problems are considered for a class of time-varying delay nonlinear systems with unknown exogenous disturbances under limited communication resources. The Takagi–Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is used to approximate the nonlinear system. The developed scheme achieves periodic reference tracking and improves the performance of periodic and aperiodic unknown disturbances rejection effectiveley. This can be operated by incorporating the equivalent-input-disturbance (EID) estimator with the modified repetitive controller (MRC) scheme. Moreover, a fuzzy periodic event-triggered feedback observer (FPETFO) is proposed for the purpose of reducing the computational burden, energy consumption and saving communication resources. The periodic event-triggered technique is designed to observe the occurrence of an event which is described by an error signal. When this error signal exceeds a prescribed threshold, the event occurs and the current data are transmitted; otherwise, there is a zero-order hold to keep data unchanged. The overall system consists of MRC, EID and FPETFO based on a T-S fuzzy model. Then, some sufficient conditions are derived to gurantee the asymptotic stability of the overall system subjected to unknown disturbances using the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) stability theory and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The fuzzy state feedback controller and observer gains are designed using the LMI and matrix decomposition approaches. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed scheme with comparative study.},

  abstract     = {These days, the digital health care system has been gaining popularity due to the flexibility of health care services to patients. Based on the digital health care system, the ratio of health care applications has been growing progressively in practice. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is the current emerging digital health care system that leverages the advanced features of wireless networks and cloud computing with different biomedical sensors. Due to the amalgamation of other technologies, IMoT can share data between different connecting nodes; therefore, security and resources cost is the biggest issue in the IMoT system. This study proposed the blockchain-enabled IMoT with cost, deadline, and security constraints. Due to multiple rules, the study formulates this problem as multi-objective combinatorial convex optimization. The objective of the study is to minimize latency and execution cost, which are tradeoffs and conflicting goals for the health care application in the IMoT system. The study devises the novel BECSAF (Blockchain-Enabled Cost-Efficient Scheduling Algorithm Framework), consisting of the following schemes: Smart-Contract-Scheme, Function Verification Pool, Task, and Function Sequencing, Resource Matching, Blockchain-Consensus-Scheme-Task-Scheduling. Simulation results show that BECSAF reduces the security risk by 33\%, minimizes the latency by 52\%, and minimizes the execution cost by 42\% compared to existing studies in the IoMT system for the health care applications.},

  abstract     = {Clock synchronization provides fundamental timing reference for various services in the Internet of Things. Unlike centralized synchronization algorithm, which relies heavily on the synchronization routing and brings about error accumulation consequently, the distributed synchronization algorithm achieves clock synchronization through time message exchange and calculation among adjacent nodes, hence the error accumulation can be greatly eliminated. However, the convergence speed of existing distributed synchronization algorithms is generally slow, and network topology information is seldom utilized to improve the convergence speed, which may cause additional energy consumption, especially in resource-constrained scenarios. To improve the convergence speed of distributed clock synchronization, a consensus tracking-based clock synchronization (CTCS) algorithm is proposed in this paper. By analyzing the synchronization process in the state space framework, the convergence acceleration term is designed to optimize the eigenvalue distribution of synchronization error matrix, hence the convergence speed can be greatly improved. To be suitable for clock synchronization in the dynamic network, a reference clock input term is designed in the clock update formula, which eliminates the oscillation of synchronized clocks triggered by synchronization of newly joined nodes. To prove the convergence of CTCS, an in-depth analysis of the algorithm is conducted. Both simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness of CTCS in comparison with other solutions.},

  abstract     = {The flue gas desulfurization (FGD) process eliminates Sulphur dioxides from flue gas produced by the combustion of fossil fuels in furnaces, boilers, and other sources. Limestone is an essential element for the FGD process in coal-fired thermal power plants. FGD system contributes efficaciously to the prevention of air pollution through its limestone/gypsum treatment in greater reliability, higher efficiency, and more capability. The selection of the limestone suppliers is thus a crucial task to improve environmental aspects and reduce cost. To optimize the selection of limestone suppliers, appropriate criteria determination and an effective solution approach are the central undertakings, which need to be made scientifically. Addressing the multi-criteria nature of the selection process, this study introduces a new Multi-Criteria-Decision-Making (MCDM) approach to evaluate supplier selection and deliver a group decision making (GDM) method in an ambiguous and fuzzy environment. The proposed method also takes decision makers’ judgments into account in times of pressure, bias, and lack of expertise during the evaluation process. Consequently, this study, for the first time, integrates the Pythagorean Fuzzy Sets (PFSs), Simple Additive Weighting (SAW), and Evaluation Based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) under GDM setting. This paper, also for the first time, includes the analyses of an evaluation for the right supplier selection in a thermal power plant. A real case study from Turkey is applied to illustrate the validity of the proposed approach. Sensitivity analysis and comparison of the results with the existing techniques are also presented to verify the significance of the found outcome.},

FIM assumes only binary frequency value for items in the dataset and assumes equal importance value for items. In order to target all these limitations of FIM, high-utility itemsets (HUIs) mining has been presented. HUIs mining is more complicated and difficult than FIM. HUIs mining algorithms spend more execution time because of large search space. Therefore, soft computing techniques-based HUIs mining has been proposed. Soft computing techniques provide a systematic process to discover the optimum solutions by using the concept of natural evolution. This article explores the usage of soft computing techniques in HUIs mining. The article presents a taxonomy of soft computing techniques-based HUIs mining including evolutionary computation and fuzzy logic-based approaches. This article enhances understanding of HUIs mining problems, the current status of provided solutions. The paper provides a comparison analysis of key techniques and discusses theoretical aspects of the various nature-inspired and fuzzy logic-based techniques along with their pros and cons.

A 90 W, 50 Hz, 220 V, 1500 rpm single-phase induction motor which is having a squirrel cage rotor has been modified into the PMG by replacing the squirrel cage rotor with the surface mounted permanent magnet rotor. The four ceramic magnets have been installed on the rotor surface to provide the excitation. The no-load and load tests of the machine have been conducted. It has been seen that the induced electromotive force depends upon the speed of the prime-mover, which is a 3-phase induction motor 2 hp, 50 Hz, 1490 rpm rated speed. It also depends upon the flux density of the magnet used which is 0.004 T. The Digital Storage Oscilloscope (DSO) has been used to analyze the output voltage of the permanent magnet generator.

The performance, as well as parameters of the electrical equivalent circuit of the permanent magnet generator is estimated offline using Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) and its hybridization with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in MATLAB environment.

This paper examines the multiple-criteria group decision-making problems in which the decision-makers use the unbalanced 2-tuple linguistic term set to describe the alternative–criteria assessments matrices. We adopt a data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach and develop a linear programming model to evaluate alternatives criteria weights for each decision-maker. The non-rational factor of risk in criteria gets modeled using the value function from the prospect theory. The values of prospect gain and prospect loss, respectively, on cost and benefit parameters are computed and applied to formulate a DEA model to assess the weights of each criterion on each alternative. Eventually, the cross-efficiency scores and their entropy values provide a ranking of the alternatives. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the methodology. A comparative analysis of the proposed method with fuzzy ordinal priority approach and fuzzy TOPSIS is performed for the illustrative example. Finally, an application example of ranking the faculties on their end-semester feedback from their class students in an academic institute is presented.},

  abstract     = {Image contrast enhancement (ICE) is an important step in image processing and analysis as the quality of an image plays a pivotal role in human understanding. Moreover, contrast is considered a key aspect for the assessment of picture quality. Incomplete beta function (IBF) is one of the widely used transformations and histogram equalization (HE) is also one of the most popular methods used for this task. However, HE has some limitations as the local contrast of an image cannot be uniformly enhanced. In the present work, a contrast enhancement method is proposed for grey-scale images based on a recent socio-inspired meta-heuristic called political optimizer (PO). The PO algorithm follows the multi-phased process of politics. The exploitative capability of PO is improved by combining it with the adaptive $$\beta $$ -hill climbing (A $$\beta $$ HC) which is regarded as one of the best local search techniques. The hybridization of these two algorithms is then used to find the optimal values of pixels which can intensify the hidden characteristic of the low-contrast images. The proposed algorithm is tested over a publicly available Kodak image dataset along with some standard images and evaluated in terms of standard metrics. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully outperform many existing methods considered here for comparison.},

With the ever-zooming power transfer, the hassles encountered by the power system have assumed alarming proportions of added intricacy with dwindling security of the power system in the power industry. In the paper, an enhanced optimal technique is proposed for solving the optimal power flow (OPF) issues with uncertainties. An enhanced technique is the Yin–Yang Pair Optimization algorithm, which is based on maintaining a balance between exploration and exploitation of the search space. Initially, the OPF is analyzed with the N–R approach and after that, the FACTS devices-based power flow is analyzed. The FACTS devices are considered as STATCOM, UPFC and IPFC devices, after the placement of FACTS devices as contingency is relived. Initially, the multi-objective function is defined and the power losses, voltage deviation, investment cost and fuel cost are analyzed. For the OPF analysis, multi-objective functions are considered under the uncertainty period. The proposed method is tested with the IEEE 30- and IEEE 118-bus system, and the corresponding line loading, line outage, generator outage, both outage and bus voltage impact are analyzed. To verify the performances of the proposed method, it is compared with the traditional methods such as Particle Swarm Optimization, Firefly Algorithm, ant Lion Optimization and Bat Optimization. The proposed method is implemented in MATLAB platform and tested with the various cases.},

Further, it undergoes rounds where in each round one byte is compressed at the same time and its preceding seven bytes participate in encryption. It takes a block as input and yields resultant block of size seven bytes. The results depict that the proposed approach does more compression and encryption by generating optimal key sizes in experiments carried out in the investigation.

  abstract     = {From the past decade, many researchers are focused on the brain tumor detection mechanism using magnetic resonance images. The traditional approaches follow the feature extraction process from bottom layer in the network. This scenario is not suitable to the medical images. To address this issue, the proposed model employed Inception-v3 convolution neural network model which is a deep learning mechanism. This model extracts the multi-level features and classifies them to find the early detection of brain tumor. The proposed model uses the deep learning approach and hyper parameters. These parameters are optimized using the Adam Optimizer and loss function. The loss function helps the machines to model the algorithm with input data. The softmax classifier is used in the proposed model to classify the images in to multiple classes. It is observed that the accuracy of the Inception-v3 algorithm is recorded as 99.34\% in training data and 89\% accuracy at validation data.},

  abstract     = {Advertising Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a relatively successful application in the field of recommendation system. Improving the accuracy of advertising click-through rate can not only make the user experience better, but also give more benefits to advertising platforms and advertisers. It can be seen from the research status that the interaction between learning features has become a very important part of the advertising CTR prediction model. Although the existing CTR prediction models based on deep learning have achieved good results, some models only consider a single interaction mode and lack the diversity of feature interaction. To resolve this problem, this paper proposes a CTR prediction model based on multi-feature interaction, called EDIF, which aims to enhance the diversity of feature interaction. Firstly, the model learns multiple different embedding vectors for each feature in the embedding layer, which reflects the correlation between features; secondly, in the interaction of high-order features, the embedding vectors of each feature are added and pooled to form the aggregation vector of the whole feature as the input, which reflects the integrity of the feature; finally, after the feature embedding operation, the model introduces two layers in parallel: compressed excitation network layer and explicit high-order interaction layer, which improves the ability of feature interaction. We have done a lot of experiments on two public data sets, Avazu and Criteo. The results show that the model effect of this paper has great advantages over the latest model.},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection based on generative models usually uses the reconstruction loss of samples for anomaly discrimination. However, there are two problems in semi-supervised or unsupervised learning. One is that the generalizing ability of the generator is too strong, which may reduce the reconstruction loss of some outliers. The other is that the background statistics will interfere with the reconstruction loss of outliers. Both of them will reduce the effectiveness of anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection method called MHMA (Multi-headed Memory Autoencoder). The variational autoencoder is used as the generation model, and the vector in potential space is limited by the memory module, which increases the reconstruction error of abnormal samples. Moreover, the MHMA uses the multi-head structure to divide the last layer of the decoder into multiple branches to learn and generate a diverse sample distribution, which keeps the generalization capability of the model within a reasonable range. In the process of calculating outliers, a likelihood ratio method is employed to obtain correct background statistics according to the background model, thus enhancing the specific features in the reconstructed samples. The effectiveness and universality of MHMA are tested on different types of datasets, and the results show that the model achieves 99.5 $$\%$$ recall, 99.9 $$\%$$ precision, 99.69 $$\%$$ F1 and 98.12 $$\%$$ MCC on the image dataset and it achieves 98.61 $$\%$$ recall, 98.73 $$\%$$ precision, 98.67 $$\%$$ F1 and 95.82 $$\%$$ MCC on the network security dataset.},

  abstract     = {Efficient feature extraction and its application in scene labelling is a rapidly growing field in the area of computer vision and image processing. Many applications such as semantic labelling, object tracking, and augmentative reality have required robust feature selection methods. This paper proposes a two-step robust LM-MFP method for pixel-wise semantic image parsing in a pixel-labelled environment. In step 1, we have generated the morphological features from an image using attribute filters. Firstly, the image features based on attributes like area, diagonal, and inertia have been extracted and arranged in the form of a min-tree and max-tree architecture. Then, we have decided on some iterative threshold for tree pruning and obtained several distinct and redundant features. Although these features are highly informative, many are redundant. Therefore in step 2, we have explored a feature pooling method to discard the redundant features using similarity measures. For the measurement of similarity between two features, we have taken three parameters, i.e. correlation ( $$\rho $$ ), structural similarity (SSIM), and mutual information (MI). Subsequently, we formulated a hypothesis based upon the predicate containing $$\rho $$ , SSIM, and MI as a variable. Based on the hypothesis, the redundant features are extracted, and a weighted average has taken for those features. This process has resulted in an exclusive and non-redundant features space. The reduced feature space has been used for pixel-based semantic classification for labelled images. Finally, we have applied a multi-class SVM to train the available pixel-label set model. The complete pixel set of the image has been used in the prediction of labelled objects by using the trained SVM model. The proposed LM-MFP approach has achieved 90.96, 89.03, 90.57, 91.12, and 93.63\% accuracy for highway, house, sheep, horse rider, and horse keeper images, respectively, obtained from sift-flow and pascal-voc datasets. Conclusively in the comparative analysis section, the LM-MFP method has been observed to be state-of-art since it has significantly outperformed the previous techniques.},

We attain this goal by creating a mobile application that analyses patient&#39;s medical records, such as diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney diseases. Then, we implement the system to diagnose patients with chronic conditions using machine learning techniques. Machine learning classifiers are used in this paper to decide whether a person has any chronic diseases. The investigated diseases are hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. Four datasets were used to build the classifying models. Orange3 from Anaconda-Navigator, a data mining tool, was used to test machine learning algorithms. The study findings revealed the superiority of the tree algorithm with 100\% accuracy for hypertension; it was the highest outcome for both males and females using Orange3. The highest precision, which is 100\%, is observed by SVM, k-NN, decision trees, logistic regression, and CART for hypertension males’ data collection. In comparison, the highest precision is 100\% in SVM, MLP, decision tree, random forest, logistic regression, and CART for the female dataset. We conclude that the two datasets for the same diseases share mostly the same algorithm accuracy. For kidneys, the Random Forest algorithm produced 100\% accuracy, which is the highest value among other algorithms. For diabetes, neural networks have attested the best accuracy. It was 76.3\%, yet the accuracy increased slightly as the kNN algorithm showed 83\% accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Despite the growing popularity of deep learning, even with recent progresses, many existing methods struggle with applications challenged by non-ideal datasets and partial understanding of input–output relationships. This is the case of prognosis and health management of industrial assets, where operating conditions might be recorded, but failure of equipment is only partially observed and partially understood. In this contribution, we address the issue of incomplete knowledge in models used to estimate time-dependent damage propagation. Specifically, unaccounted corrosion-fatigue of aircraft fuselage panels is presented as a case study. While degradation resulting from mechanical fatigue is accounted by damage models, unforeseen corrosion effects are not, yielding in large discrepancies between predicted and observed crack lengths. To address this model-form uncertainty, we propose using hybrid neural networks. Hybrid models are composed of physics-informed layers addressing well-understood aspects of damage accumulation, while data-driven layers are trained to act as correction terms. To improve overall accuracy, ensemble techniques are adapted to merge resulting predictions. Optimal ensemble weights are derived to help with the task of defining safe operation in the fleet. The proposed case study encompasses highly imbalanced data sets with uncertainties acting asynchronously. Main contributions of the proposed work are: (i) in a modeling perspective, an approach capable of compensating for model-form uncertainty by formulating the numerical integration of governing ordinary differential equations as hybrid recurrent neural network models; (ii) from a prognosis perspective, the proposed methods can be used to rank damage severity, allowing to prioritize aircraft for inspection and/or route reassignment.},

  abstract     = {Accurate sensing and understanding of gestures can improve the quality of human–computer interaction and show great theoretical significance and application potentials in the fields of smart home, assisted medical care and virtual reality. WiFi channel state information (CSI)-based device-free wireless gesture recognition requires no sensors and has a series of advantages such as permission for non-line-of-sight scenario, low cost, preserving for personal privacy and working in the dark night. Although most of the current WiFi CSI-based gesture recognition approaches can achieve good performance, they are difficult to adapt to the new domains. Therefore, this paper proposes ML-WiGR, a novel approach for device-free gesture recognition in cross-domain applications. ML-WiGR applies convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks as the basic model for gesture recognition to extract spatial and temporal features. Combined with the meta-learning training mechanism, ML-WiGR can dynamically adjust the learning rate and meta-learning rate in training process adaptively and optimize the initial parameters of a basic model for gesture recognition, only using a few samples and several iterations to adapt to the new domain. In the experiments, the approach is tested under a variety of scenarios. The results show that ML-WiGR can achieve comparable performance against existing approaches with only a small number of samples for training in cross-domains.},

In GEI-BBO, we design an eigendecomposition mechanism for migration operation, which can reduce the dependency of biogeography-based optimization (BBO) on the coordinate system, improve the rotation invariance and share the information between eigensolutions more effectively. Meanwhile, to find the local optimal solution better, gradient descent is added, and the system search strategy can reduce the occurrence of local trapping phenomenon. In addition, combining the GEI-BBO with cubic spline interpolation will solve the problem of mobile robot path planning through a defined coding method and fitness function. A series of experiments are implemented on benchmark functions, whose results indicated that the optimization performance of GEI-BBO is superior to other algorithms.

Based on this, firstly, this paper introduces the concept of complement and lattice model proposed by Li and Hu. Secondly, based on the concept of positive region consistency of inconsistent multi-scale decision tables, the paper proposes complement model and lattice model based on positive region consistent and gives the algorithm. Finally, some numerical experiments are employed to verify that the model has the same properties in processing inconsistent multi-scale decision tables as the complement model and lattice model in processing consistent multi-scale decision tables. And for the consistent multi-scale decision table, the same results can be obtained by using the model based on positive region consistent. However, the lattice model based on positive region consistent is more time-consuming and costly.

Traditional DEA assumes that the dataset should be crisp. However, in real-world problems, there might be imprecise data. On the other hand, the network DEA (NDEA) measures the efficiency of multistage processes. The NDEA models deal with the internal structure of decision-making units (DMUs). This study offers a novel analysis and contribution to the knowledge of efficiency evaluation by (1) proposing a novel robust two-stage NDEA (RTNDEA) model to evaluate the sustainability of supply chains and (2) dealing with undesirable outputs and uncertain conditions for efficiency analysis.

After creating the FAUL of the items (1-itemsets), there is no need to re-scan the database in the proposed algorithm, and all the FAULs of the (k + 1)-itemsets can be obtained from the combination of the FAULs of k-itemsets and (k − 1)-itemsets. The complete set of all FHAUIs can be extracted by HiFAM, through a depth first exploration process. A pruning technique is also used in the proposed method to prevent the exploration of unpromising itemsets; their exploration does not lead to discover FHAUIs. This pruning strategy effectively reduces the memory consumption and time complexity of the proposed method. Various experiments are conducted using real and synthetic datasets, the results of which show the efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The fuel cell-based electric power generation system is playing a major role in the present electrical power distribution system. The fuel cell gives a nonlinear V-I curve. As a result, the extraction of fuel cell power is very difficult. To extract the peak power of the fuel cell, a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) technique is used. In this work, an Improved Beta-based Fuzzy Logic Controller (IBeta-FLC) is proposed to track the MPP with high speed. The proposed MPPT technique is compared with other hybrid MPPT techniques in terms of maximum power extraction, settling time, oscillations across MPP, tracking speed, and efficiency. The Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) stack gives high output current, and low output voltage. As a result, the overall system conduction losses are improved. So, in this work, a new Single Switch Universal Input-voltage Boost Converter (SSUIBC) is introduced to step-up the fuel cell output voltage. The features of the proposed boost converter are high voltage gain, less complexity in design, wide output operation, and less voltage stress across the switch. The proposed PEMFC fed boost converter system performance is evaluated successfully by using a MATLAB/Simulink window. In addition, the utilized boost converter is investigated experimentally by using an external DC-source.},

Inequality on Pythagorean fuzzy set plays an important role in uncertainty theory. In this paper, we firstly derive some Pythagorean fuzzy inequalities based on some existing operations. Further, based on the existing operations, we develop three Pythagorean fuzzy aggregation operators, including Pythagorean fuzzy square (PFSq), Pythagorean fuzzy arithmetic and Pythagorean fuzzy geometric. Meanwhile, some inequalities on them are profoundly explored. Finally, we construct some Pythagorean fuzzy inequalities by equality $$\mu ^2+\upsilon ^2+\pi ^2=1$$ in critical definition and prove them by some existing well-known inequalities, which will provide a new basis for Pythagorean fuzzy inequalities in operations and aggregation operators.},

To extend the concept of relative pseudocomplementation to non-distributive lattices, the first author introduced so-called sectionally pseudocomplemented lattices, i.e. lattices with top element 1 where for every element y the interval [y, 1], the so called section, is pseudocomplemented. We extend this concept to posets with top element. Our goal is to show that such a poset can be considered as an algebraic semantics for a certain kind of more general intuitionistic logic provided an implication is introduced as shown in the paper. We prove some properties of such an implication. This implication is “unsharp” in the sense that the value for given entries need not be a unique element, but may be a subset of the poset in question. Using this implication we show that we can even recover the order of the original poset. Further, a new “unsharp” operator $$\odot $$ of conjunction can be introduced which is adjoint to “unsharp” implication and hence we obtain an “unsharp” residuated poset.},

  abstract     = {Essentially, cancer refers to the formation of abnormal cells in any section or area of the body. The goal of early cancer detection is to identify patients who are showing signs early on in order to maximise their chances of a successful therapy. Early detection and treatment of cancer reduce the disease mortality. A wide range of image processing and machine learning techniques have been presented for the identification of cancer. There was no improvement in detection accuracy or efficiency with existing systems. To overcome these problems, we present the Least Mean Square Filterative Ricker Wavelet Transform-based Deep Convolutional Neural Learning Classifier Model (L-DCNLC). By using a fully connected max pooling deep convolutional network with higher accuracy and reduced time consumption, the L-DCNLC Model aims to identify cancer early. There are three hidden layers and one output layer in the fully linked max pooling deep convolutional network. The number of patient photographs in the database is used as input in the L-DCNLC Model&#39;s input layer. Following that, preprocessing is performed in hidden layer 1 to perform denoising in order to improve image quality. This is accomplished by employing the Least Mean Square Weiner Filtering process, which has a higher peak signal-to-noise ratio. The Continuous Ricker Wavelet Transform is then used to extract the image features from the preprocessed image in hidden layer 2. Finally, the classification process is performed in hidden layer 3 using the Kulczynksi Similarity Coefficient to detect the cancerous image by comparing the testing and extracted features. Thus, the cancerous image is detected and displayed with a low error rate in the output layer. The brain cancer and lung cancer datasets are analysed to determine peak signal to noise ratios (PSNR), cancer detection accuracy, and cancer detection time. The evaluation results indicate that the L-DCNLC Model improves accuracy and PSNR while requiring less computational time than previous works.},

Various performance indices like root mean squared error (RMSE), determination coefficient (R2), and mean absolute error (MAE) are used for understanding model efficacy. Performance indices of model indicate MAE (0.043), R2 (0.999), and RMSE (0.066) values for FNN, which shows its effectiveness in imputation of missing precipitation data as compared to KNN, SOM, and RF, especially in regions with extreme missingness. Results of this research proved to be highly imperative in selecting preeminent techniques to estimate precipitation data and reduce data gaps in complex watersheds like Cachar.

A real-time power system model has been chosen appropriately to validate the efficacy of the suggested method. An exhaustive comparison has been performed with new heuristic methods as well as some classical approaches to demonstrate the superiority of the advocated techniques. About 75\% or more betterment is produced by the suggested techniques in comparison to the parent and other existing techniques in terms of the error function, which is quite a drastic improvement. The computation time and memory usage of the algorithms have been assessed to manifest the efficacy of the novel integrated methods. The convergence plot between the normalized error function and the number of iterations also support adequate justification with respect to convergence speed and accuracy.

  abstract     = {As prevalent substructure systems in geotechnical engineering, piles are susceptible to underlying uncertainties and complex interactions to surrounding soils, associated with their geometry, pattern, and the project cost influences. The spatial variability of surrounding soils and diversity of knowledge in pile engineering highlight selecting an appropriate predictive method(s) for design. Various methods, including static analyses, in situ-based methods, static pile load testing (SPLT), dynamic methods, and numerical analyses, have been developed to predict the axial pile bearing capacity. The cone penetration test (CPT) is one of the in situ tests that provides continuous and reliable records with depth. Due to the similarities between CPT and pile, different CPT-based methods have been advanced. However, these methods result in a wide range of predictions. In this regard, several statistical, probabilistic, and reliability-based criteria are used to assess the accuracy, precision, and error embedded in each method. Therefore, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) models are introduced and implemented to distinguish superseding methods. Accordingly, a database of 60 driven piles with adjacent CPT records has been compiled. About twelve static analyses and in situ-based methods were implemented to predict the pile axial bearing capacity for the investigated database. Moreover, aggregative methods, such as Copeland or Borda count, are employed to evaluate and revisit these various decision-making models and designate more critical approaches for the current database.

  abstract     = {Since the demand for a clean source of energy has increased, it led to the consequent rise in the importance of solar energy. Thus, the concept of solar cell modelling has drawn the attention of various researchers across the world. A useful and accurate mathematical model for such cells is therefore necessary. In the literature, the three-diode model is suggested as a more reliable approach to satisfy the behaviour of photovoltaic (PV) cells. This paper proposes a new swarm intelligent technique, namely the chaotic chicken swarm optimization, which is originated from the parent chicken swarm algorithm, for parameter assessment of the three-diode PV model, as the three-diode PV model incorporate the grain boundaries and leakage current. Ten different popular chaotic maps have been considered for the study to identify the parameters from the manufacturer datasheet. The chicken swarm technique yields great optimization results both in terms of accuracy and robustness. Further, the use of chaotic maps improves the diversification feature of this metaheuristic technique for which it is preferred. The performance of the proposed approach proved better when compared with some of the popular techniques available in the literature in terms of convergence accuracy and speed. The accuracy of the proposed technique is also verified by extracting I–V and P–V curves. Moreover, several nonparametric statistical tests are also performed to validate the significance of the outcomes obtained by the proposed method.},

The side lobes can be adjusted to any arbitrary specification, and flat-top far-field radiation patterns are generated using enhanced flower pollination algorithm (EFPA) which is discussed in this paper. The problem of designing an array can be expressed as an optimization problem that aims to reduce the first two side lobes to − 50 dB and by reducing the remaining side lobes to − 40 dB in case 1. The EFPA is applied to determine the excitation coefficients of their amplitudes so as to obtain the required pattern. The objective for case 2 is to obtain the flat-top sector beam for specified angular regions. Complex excitation coefficients are determined using EFPA for various beam widths. The radiation patterns are generated numerically using the obtained excitation coefficients. The results reveal that not only the ripples are controlled in the trade-in region, but the side lobe levels are also maintained in the acceptable limits. The results presented are very much useful for marine radar applications.},

  abstract     = {In this study, the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is modified with the K-Opt operation to solve the covering salesman problem (CSP) under one restriction in crisp and imprecise (fuzzy, rough) environments. A CSP involves two phases—the division of cities into groups with the selection of the visiting cities and searching of the Hamiltonian circuit through the visiting cities. But, none of the studies in the literature is made following the direct approach. Also, none of the studies in the literature gives attention to reduce the total travel distance of the unvisited cities from the visited city of a group. Moreover, there is no algorithm in the literature which provides the solution of a CSP with the specified coverage range r. Also, none has introduced any algorithm to solve CSPs in imprecise environments. Though algorithms are available to solve the Traveling Salesman Problems in the imprecise environments, the approach cannot deal with the problems involving fuzzy data with nonlinear membership functions or the problems involving rough data where the rough estimation can not be done using Lebesgue measure. The well-established algorithm for any routing problem is the ACO, but not much attention has been paid to solve the CSP using ACOs. To overcome these limitations on the studies of the ACO on the CSPs, here, an algorithm is proposed for the division of groups of the set of cities depending upon the maximum number of cities in a group and the total number of groups. Then, ACO is used to find the shortest/minimum-cost path of the problem by selecting only one visiting the city from each group without violating the restriction of the specified coverage range r of the location of the unvisited cities. K-Opt operation is applied periodically at the end of ACO operation to improve the quality of the best found solution so far by the ACO algorithm and to arrest any premature convergence. For the restricted problems, paths are searched in such a manner that the total distance/travel cost of different unvisited cities of a group from the visited city of the group should not exceed a predefined upper limit. To solve the problem in an imprecise environment, some approach is followed so that the tour is searched without transferring the imprecise optimisation problem into an equivalent crisp optimisation problem. Also, the simulation approaches in fuzzy and rough environments are proposed to deal with the CSPs with any type of estimation of the imprecise data set. Algorithm is tested with the standard benchmark crisp problems available in the literature. To test the algorithm in the imprecise environments, the imprecise instances are derived randomly from the standard crisp instances using a specified rule. Test results imply that the proposed algorithm is efficient enough in solving the CSPs in the crisp as well as in the imprecise environments.},

If the waste is grown in a supply chain, the quality level and efficiency of the firms will be declined and extra costs are provided. This paper presents a multi-stage multi-product multi-supplier multi-period supply chain model considering the wastes of raw materials, end products, and semi-finished products. Also, in the proposed model, the manufacturer can select the production technology considering cost and efficiency. The proposed model is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model considering minimization of cost elements, including raw materials inspection waste, manufacturing waste, ordering, purchasing manufacturing technologies, transportation, production inventory holding, and raw material inventory holding. A numerical example is developed to validate the model, and a sensitivity analysis is provided to investigate fluctuation effects of parameters, including the waste rate of products, waste rate of purchased raw materials, raw materials purchasing price, transportation cost, and demand on the model. Also, several sample problems in different dimensions are defined, in which we demonstrate the model in large-size problems is NP-hard. To solve NP-hard problems, using evolutionary algorithms is necessary. For this reason, a genetic algorithm (GA) and a hybrid genetic algorithm and simulated annealing (GASA) algorithm, which fits with the proposed model configuration, are designed. Finally, we evaluate the performance of these two algorithms.},

Drones may utilize one source of energy, which is usually a battery. However, drones operating on fossil fuels and large capacity fuel cells also exist. This paper introduces a novel optimization framework to decide on the optimal source or mix of sources to be installed on drones to minimize their running cost. The proposed approach considers three sources: batteries, fuel cells, and super-capacitors, the characteristics of which are embedded in the optimal selection approach. In addition, a drone aerodynamic model is incorporated, which is composed of four actions: hovering, ascending, descending, and moving forward. The proposed approach selects the optimal source(s) from a defined database of sources to power the drone according to the user-specified trip profile. The offline simulation of various case studies shows that the proposed framework enables the selection of appropriate power source(s) to sufficiently support the drone flight while simultaneously minimizing its operational cost. The present work focuses on energy sources, but future extensions can allow automated selection of all parts required to assemble a drone, such that longest flight time is achieved at least cost. The proposed approach also quickly allows ascertaining if a desired flight time is achievable given a flight profile and a database of energy sources/parts.},

  abstract     = {The present investigation includes the performance enhancement concept of discrete meta-heuristics (MHs) for truss design with concurrent size and topology optimization. The five basic MHs, viz. teaching–learning-based optimization (TLBO), whale optimization algorithm (WOA), dragonfly algorithm (DA), heat transfer search (HTS), and ant lion optimization (ALO) algorithm, are investigated. Often these MHs found incompetent in answering complex problems like concurrent topology and sizing optimization of truss structures due to their poor convergence rate, local optima trap, and higher computation time. Also, the balance between diversification and intensification is very significant for MHs efficiency. A mutation is a strong strategy for balancing the diversification and intensification of MHs and can assist in guiding the population towards the global optimum. Moreover, population diversity can be improved by incorporating the selection of simulated annealing that can reduce the chances of local optima tarp. Therefore, an effective search technique based on a random mutation search along with simulated annealing-based selection is developed. Here, five modified MHs, i.e. the modified DA (MDA), modified ALO (MALO), modified WOA (MWOA), modified HTS (MHTS), and modified TLBO (MTLBO) algorithms, using random mutation search phase and SA-based selection are proposed. The developed techniques are implemented on three standard test problems where dynamic and static constraints and multiple load cases are imposed. The comparative performance of the proposed algorithms and their original algorithms is carried out. An empirical evaluation was done using Friedman rank, and the respective algorithms ranks are assigned. The findings reveal that the new technique results in significant performance enhancement of the various MHs by synchronizing the diversification and intensification of search.},

  abstract     = {The most commonly used analysis method in performance-based design (PBD) is nonlinear static analysis (NSA). In unsymmetrical 2D frames, unlike for the symmetrical state, NSA should be performed in two lateral loading directions. This complicates the process of achieving a feasible optimal design in addition to increasing the volume of calculations. In this study, to overcoming this issue, a two-step approach is proposed for the optimal PBD of unsymmetrical 2D steel moment-resisting frames (SMRFs). In this approach, in two independent steps, the structure is analyzed with a lateral loading pattern based on the first mode shape in the positive and negative directions. The implementation of the second step is conditional on the satisfactory completion of the first step. The objective function takes into account the differences between successful and unsuccessful steps. The constraints considered are based on the acceptance criteria for SMRF according to FEMA-356 at each performance level. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been investigated by employing four meta-heuristic optimization algorithms to determine the optimum design for case studies of SMRF structures having three and nine stories.},

  abstract     = {In high-resolution remote sensing imageries, the scene classification is one of the challenging problems due to the similarity of image structure and available datasets are all small. Performing training with small datasets on new convolutional neural network (CNN) is inclined to overfitting, and attainability is poor. To overcome this, we go for a stream of transfer learning, fine-tuning strategy. Here, we consider AlexNet, VGG 19, and VGG 16 pre-trained CNNs. First, design a network by replacing the classifier stage layers with revised ones through transfer learning. Second, apply fine-tuning from right to left and perform retraining on the classifier stage and part of the feature extraction stage (last convolutional block). Third, form a classifier ensemble by using the majority voting learner strategy to explore better classification results. The datasets called UCM and SIRI-WHU were used and compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, to check the usefulness of our proposed methods, form sub-datasets from AID and WHU-RS19 datasets with likely labeled class names. To assess the performance of the proposed classifiers compute overall accuracy using confusion matrix and F1-score. The results of the proposed methods improve the accuracy from 93.57 to 99.04\% for UCM and 91.34 to 99.16\% for SIRI-WHU.},

  abstract     = {Aiming at the sequential tasks of Chinese word segmentation and part-of-speech labeling, this paper proposes a parallel model for word segmentation and part-of-speech labeling that combines BERT model, bidirectional long-short memory model, and conditional random field model, Markov family model (MFM) or Tree Probability (TLP). In part-of-speech labeling combined with MFM or TLP, the part-of-speech of the current word is not only related to the part-of-speech of the previous word, but also related to the current word itself. The use of the joint method helps to use part-of-speech information to achieve word segmentation, and organically combining the two is beneficial to eliminate ambiguity and improve the accuracy of part-of-speech labeling or word segmentation tasks. Experimental data shows that the joint model for part-of-speech labeling and Chinese word segmentation proposed in this paper can significantly enhances the precision of Chinese word segmentation and the accuracy of part-of-speech labeling.},

Therefore, the construction and measurement of the industrial value chain height can effectively avoid the collapse of the industrial value chain caused by the low system value of the value chain. In this paper, the mobile virtualization channel allocation algorithm is used to construct the multi-objective industrial value chain height index, and the actual industrial value chain height in China is measured. This paper first describes the channel allocation algorithm of mobile virtualization, extracts the allocation rules of the algorithm, constructs the model of multi-objective industrial value chain, then measures the value chain of eight regions in China combined with the elements of technology, production, and marketing in the height of value chain, and quantitatively compares the results of value chain height of different regions according to the embeddedness and depth. Finally, it puts forward the improvement scheme for the measurement results and the problems faced by the value chain. The research shows that the average value chain height of South China is about 70.86, while the average value chain height of Northwest China is about 46.58, ranging from 40.58 to 60.45. Through quantitative data, the value chain height of South China is generally higher than that of Northwest China by more than 50\%, which may be related to the innovation of technology and the imitation form of production. Therefore, this paper proposes to strengthen the technological innovation in the upstream of the value chain, so as to drive the development of the regional value chain.},

Therefore, many researchers have considered seeking techniques for automatically detecting fake news in the last decade. The most popular news agencies use e-publishing on their websites; even websites can publish any news they want. However, thus before quotation any news from a website, there should be a close look at news resource ranking by using a trusted websites classifier, such as the website world rank, which reflects the repute of these websites. This paper uses the world rank of news websites as the main factor of news accuracy by using two widespread and trusted websites ranking. Moreover, a secondary factor is proposed to compute the news accuracy similarity by comparing the current news with fakes news and getting the possible news accuracy. Experiments results are conducted on several benchmark datasets. The results showed that the proposed method got promising results compared to other comparative methods in defining the news accuracy.},

In this study, the capability of newly integrated hybrid prediction models based on artificial intelligence and data processing methods was assessed for monthly river streamflow modeling. In this regard, three successive hydrometric stations of Housatonic River were selected and based on the previous time steps of streamflow values during the period of 1941–2018 several models were developed. During the modeling process, two states based on stations own data (state 1) and upstream stations data (state 2) were considered. For data preprocessing, first temporal features of the streamflow series were decomposed via wavelet transform (WT). Then, the obtained subseries were further broken down into intrinsic mode functions using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) to obtain features with higher stationary properties. Finally, the most efficient subseries were selected and used for artificial intelligence approaches [i.e., feed forward neural network (FFNN), kernel extreme learning machine (KELM), and support vector machine (SVM)] as inputs. Also, data post-proceeding was done using simple linear averaging (SLAM) and nonlinear neural ensemble (NNEM) methods. Based on the results, the pre- and post- processing data were more accurate as compared to single artificial intelligence method. The integrated pre-post-processing models improved the models efficiency by approximately 45\%. It was observed that via the integrated approaches, the upstream stations data could be applied successfully for streamflow modeling when the stations own data were not available.},

  abstract     = {One-class classification is an important branch of machine learning. Feature extraction is an important means to improve the performance of one-class classifiers, but there is no generalized method yet reported to solve this problem. In this paper, a framework is proposed for one-class feature extraction. The proposed framework divides the original feature space into two orthogonal spaces, namely the principal space and the complementary space. The principal space is used to learn the features of the target class, and the complementary space is used to learn the features of the abnormal class. The features extracted from the two spaces are fused as the final one-class feature vector of the original feature space. Furthermore, a specific implementation method, complete principal component analysis (CPCA), is proposed. First, CPCA conducts principal component analysis to calculate the projection scores of the target class samples in the principal space. Then, according to the projection vectors of the principal components (obtained in the principal space), the corresponding complementary space is constructed. The projection of the sample in the complementary space is calculated and transformed into the first-order norm as the extracted feature in the complementary space. Several datasets are used to verify the effect of this proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed CPCA has good universality for one-class feature extraction problems.},

Graph data mining of uncertain graphs is the most challenging and semantically different from correct data mining. The main problem of the GDM is mining uncertain graph data and subgraph pattern frequency. This paper discussed different techniques related to GDM, complexities, and the different size of the graph, and also investigated the dataset used for GDM, techniques of GDM like clustering analysis, and anomaly detection. To improve the performance of the online learning system, GDM is introduced. Additionally, the study algorithm is used for GDM, dataset, advantages, and disadvantages. In the end, future directions to enrich online learning based on the results of GDM are discussed. Performance metrics of different techniques such as accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, and runtime are observed.

However, the existing methods of passenger flow prediction cannot achieve adequate accurate results due to its complex nonlinear spatiotemporal characteristics. To improve the accuracy of short-term passenger flow prediction, this paper proposes a deep learning model based on a spatiotemporal framework. Firstly, the graph convolutional network, which incorporates prior domain knowledge (such as travel time and origin–destination demand), is used to extract spatial features of passenger flow. Secondly, the attention mechanism is integrated into the gated recurrent unit to extract the time correlation of passenger flow. Finally, external factors are introduced to capture their impact on passenger flow as well. A case study of the Beijing Subway system is illustrated to verify the performance of the proposed model. The results show that compared with the existing models, the proposed model achieves the highest prediction accuracy and strong robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the adjacency matrix based on travel time outperforms the one based on OD demand, especially during evening peak hours. In addition, it is also verified that the attention mechanism and external factors can improve the prediction performance of the proposed model.},

Analysis of health care data becomes more important so that proper medications can be provided and issues can be reduced by taking proper precautions based on the history. Data analysis becomes efficient because of automation, however, due to data integrity, data diversity, and inconsistency, the performance gets lagged. Various machine learning models are introduced to handle big data management; however, researchers are still working to attain a better model with improved accuracy. So with the objective to attain maximum classification accuracy, fuzzy c means clustering and generative adversarial network are employed in this research work for health care data clustering and classification. Benchmark lung cancer dataset and Arrhythmia dataset are used in the experimentation. The proposed model exhibits the maximum accuracy of 97.8\% for dataset 1 and 98.6\% for dataset 2 compared to existing techniques like support vector machine, decision tree, and random forest algorithms.},

The picture fuzzy number (PFN) is an ordered value triple, including a membership degree, a neutral-membership degree, a non-membership degree, of a PFS. The PFN is a useful tool to study the problems that have uncertain information in real life. In this paper, the main aim is to develop basic foundations that can become tools for future research related to PFN and picture fuzzy calculus. We first establish a semi-linear space for PFNs by providing two new definitions of two basic operations, addition and scalar multiplication, such that the set of PFNs together with these two operations can form a semi-linear space. Moreover, we also provide some important properties and concepts such as metrics, order relations between two PFNs, geometric difference, multiplication of two PFNs. Next, we introduce picture fuzzy functions with a real domain that is also known as picture fuzzy functions with time-varying values, called geometric picture fuzzy function (GPFFs). In this framework, we give definitions about the limit of GPFFs and sequences of PFN. The important limit properties are also presented in detail. Finally, we prove that the metric semi-linear space of PFNs is complete, which is an important property in the classical mathematical analysis.},

The introduced MEO meta-heuristic algorithm is compared with a standard EO algorithm and other meta-heuristic algorithms for different standard benchmark test functions. Furthermore, the genuine utilization of the MEO algorithm is tried by designing a multi-stage PID (MS-PID) controller for frequency regulation of the power system with distributed energy sources including renewable sources. The supremacy of the reinforced MEO methodology-based MS-PID controller for enhanced frequency regulation is presented and its outcomes are compared with the EO-tuned PID and MS-PID. From the performance comparison, it is recognized that the MEO-based MS-PID controller is more efficacious.},

In this work, an image encryption scheme based on the updating processes of particle swarm optimization algorithm and hyperchaotic system is proposed. Specifically, a key generation mechanism combined with secure hash algorithm 256 hash is first introduced to generate the initial values of hyperchaotic complex Lü system. Then, the plain image is confused by the position and velocity updating processes of particle swarm optimization algorithm. In addition, an adaptive diffusion mechanism is designed and applied to the confused image to obtain the final cipher image. Simulation results and security analysis show that the proposed scheme exhibits good performance of sophisticated dynamic behavior, high sensitivity to key, and effectively resisting the typical cryptanalysis attacks, and provides an alternative to real-time image encryption application.},

  abstract     = {Identifying responses/sensitivity of drugs to explore personalized therapy related to drugs has been a significant issue in pharmacogenomic-related studies. Cancer is an acute disease involving heterogeneous behavior of similar tumor types of human’s data related to drug therapy. Some large-scale pharmacogenomic studies related to cancer cell lines have been emerging pharma clinical systems to predicting advanced genetic sub relations like sensitivity for influence therapeutic approach. Advanced machine learning approaches related to pharmacogenomic data studies have evaluated the ability to identify drug/compound sensitivity. Recently, drug sensitivity prediction has been critical in drug identification and design because some of the pharmacogenomic online data contribute as open access. These databases are used to identify drug sensitivity by developing computational methodologies. However, all these methodologies are not sufficient to predict the sensitivity of drugs because of multi-features. So that in this paper, we propose a Novel Regression-based Ensemble Convolution Neural Network Model (NRECNNM) to identify the sensitivity of drugs based on multiple pharma omics data &amp; addresses heterogeneity in the selection of features to sub pharmacogenomic parameters. This approach also evaluates the number of components with the regression calculation method. Ensemble convolution network describes the significance of distance metrics relates to neighborhood dependencies related to drug therapy relations. The proposed approach uses Cancer cell line Encyclopedia (CCLE) data sets, and experimental results examine the performance in predicting sensitivity can enhance with conventional approaches.},

In this view, we have introduced a novel convolutional architecture with an integration of a hierarchical attention mechanism. The model comprises three parts: Feature extraction layer, which uses to extract the convoluted feature map; hierarchical attention layer, which is used to obtain weighted hierarchical feature map; classification layer, which uses weighted features for classification of healthy and seizure subjects.

  abstract     = {It would not be an overstatement to say that Cloud services have exponentially increased the computing power of mobile devices, enabling operators to undertake complex procedures including research, data mining as well as adept handling of multimedia. However, these gains are not without substantial challenges brought on by the dynamic nature of ad hoc and unpredictable network tasks, often triggered by random topological alterations in the systems. This makes network congestion and the subsequent load balancing issues very complex. In fact, network congestion and flexibility, along with channel errors, contribute most to the loss of data in wireless grid systems. While most of the relevant research work has been directed toward the issues of energy efficiency and congestion load balancing, the aim of this study was to research and build an ad hoc mobility model using Cloud computing to enable secure Internet of Things communication between smart devices. It proposed to construct a new connectivity architecture to enable secure communication between smart devices in a network. This was aided by a proficient routing protocol proposed in this work for adaptive control of network congestion and efficient load balancing in mobile ad hoc networks. The proposed technique combined the discovery of multiple alternate paths between two nodes, while calculating the cost and stability of the link and traffic load based on the available power of the participating nodes and intelligent routing of traffic based on threshold values. It took into account various aspects like packet delivery ratio versus data rate, comparison of end-to-end delay for differing traffic loads, and comparison of throughput of differing data rates in the proposed scheme vis-à-vis existing schemes. It was evident from the outcomes of the simulations that the projected approach enhanced the network lifespan by integrating load balancing and congestion control with energy-efficient algorithms. Consequently, it significantly reduced the packet dropping probability and node to node delay in the network and improved the system lifetime.},

  abstract     = {An efficient scheduling of dependent-tasks over edge-cloud is the key for achieving better utilization of computational resources and timely completion of interdependent tasks for scientific as well as defence-oriented applications. Many applications comprise several tasks that are dependent in nature and are required to be executed in a specific sequence within a minimum span of time. To handle the execution of such dependent-tasks on distributed computational resources is a challenging problem; as the number of tasks increase, the solution space comprising different task-resource mapping sequences also increase exponentially and it is very difficult to find the near optimal solutions in the search space. In this paper, we focus on two strategies for obtaining optimal solutions for scheduling the multiple dependent-tasks with the specified sequence in a parallel and distributed environment. In the first approach, a hybrid mechanism is proposed to efficiently search the scheduling solution space for multiple dependent tasks. The idea is to first find a schedule by heuristic algorithms and use these as initial solutions in the search space to obtain better solutions using unsupervised machine learning methods. In the second approach, each task-graph is partitioned into different clusters of sub-tasks, where each partitioned cluster is mapped onto the same resource. This strategy reduces the idle times on the resources, wherever possible, in comparison with the first approach. The innovative part of the proposed approaches is to schedule the multiple dependent-tasks in a parallel fashion rather than scheduling in sequential manner. The results show that the schedules obtained by our proposed approaches minimize the total execution time (TET) significantly as compared to other approaches considered in our research study.},

Nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms have proven to be a promising tool for solving such problems due to their performance in a variety of fields. JAYA algorithm is a novel population-based algorithm which could have been able to present reliable results. This is because it does not need any parameters to be set other than the population size and the maximum number of iteration. Despite its positive feedbacks, this algorithm should be modified to witness more efficiency. This paper aims to amend the original version of Jaya to present a high-efficiency version named Powerful Enhanced Jaya (PEJAYA). In other words, the methodology of updating position in Jaya is modified to enhance the convergence and search capabilities. This approach is assessed according to solve 20 well-known benchmark functions, feature selection, and statistical tests. The output results of proposed optimization algorithm are then evaluated by comparing it with other recent algorithms including crow search algorithm (CSA), standard version of JAYA, particle swarm optimization (PSO), dragonfly algorithm (DA), grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), moth-flame optimization (MFO) and sine–cosine algorithm (SCA). Solving a real-world problem is another way of checking the efficiency of this approach with other published works. Prompt escape from local minima, superior convergence, and stability demonstrate that the suggested approach is a very powerful instrument that may be employed in a variety of optimization situations.},

Firstly, the solution of expected value and standard deviation value of uncertain random variables is extended to general monotonic functions. Secondly, considering the influence of correlation on the objective functions, the order relationship of expected values among comonotonic functions considering general monotonic functions is deduced. On this basis, the order relationship of expected values and standard deviation values of uncertain random multi-objective function with correlation is obtained, and the order relationship of uncertain random multi-objective function on the basis of the expected value-standard deviation value criterion (CESD criterion) is derived. Then, for the two decision-making situations where the importance of the objective functions is known and the ideal points of the objective functions are known, two methods are proposed, respectively, which are proved that the methods can retain the uncertainty and randomness of the original problem. Finally, a numerical example is given to prove the effectiveness of the methods, which shows that the results obtained on the basis of the CESD criterion can consider both the long-term stability and short-term volatility of decision-making.},

Also, an implication method is proposed to infer the investment ratio/weights for a given realization of the portfolio returns. In the presented model, optimum knowledge, derived from a stochastic portfolio problem, is used to construct SRBDSS, instead of using a few number of experts’ opinion.

  abstract     = {The knowledge about groundwater level (GWL) fluctuations is very significant in water resources planning and management. In Loisingha and Saintala watersheds situated in Balangir district of Odisha, there is overexploitation of groundwater. Management of groundwater resources needs a thorough understanding about its dynamic nature. However, the dynamic nature of GW flow is constantly varying in response to climatic and human stresses and is too complex. This involves many uncertain and nonlinear factors. Present research examines applicability of two data-driven models, i.e., CFBPNN (Cascade Forward Back Propagation Neural Network), ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System), and one hybrid model ANFIS-GWO combining ANFIS with a robust optimization algorithm, namely GWO (Grey Wolf Optimizer) for forecasting GWL at two watersheds of Balangir, India. As ANFIS parameters impact forecasting accurateness, adjustment and optimization of these parameters utilizing GWO are essential. In this context, 18 years of data comprising different hydrological constraints such as precipitation, average discharge, evapotranspiration, minimum and maximum temperature are utilized as input data for predicting GWL. To assess the performance of proposed models, quantitative statistical measures, namely R2 (coefficient of determination), RMSE (root-mean-squared error), WI (Willmott index), and NSE (Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency), are applied. Based on analysis of results obtained, it is concluded that ANFIS-GWO with NSE-0.9745, WI-0.9763, and RMSE-0.0450 performed superiorly to standalone ANFIS and conventional CFBPNN model. Predictions with these conditions revealed that proposed models show better performance considering evapotranspiration as an input parameter.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer, if diagnosed in its early stages, can be treated more effectively. For this purpose, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems based on ultrasound images have been proposed in order to detect breast lesions and discriminate between the benign and malignant types of these lesions. In this paper, a novel CAD system based on gated convolutional neural networks (CNN) is proposed, which can help classify breast lesions in ultrasound images and differentiate benign lesions from malignant ones. Specifically, the required feature maps are extracted by using a pre-trained CNN. A common strategy for improving the performance of the classification methods for breast lesions is to combine the feature maps learned at different layers; yet, most of the current methods combine these feature maps without adherence to feature map selection. The problem is that lack of feature map selection may impose redundant information on the network and may cause over-segmentation when more information from the lower layers is required. To tackle this problem, the present study proposes a gate mechanism for use with entropy maps in order to select the features. Subsequently, the selected feature maps are adaptively weighted according to their relative significance. According to the experimental results, the proposed method would significantly improve the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and F1 score area under the ROC curve of the classification process, and the method would outperform the other breast cancer CAD systems.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent transport systems need accurate short-term traffic flow forecasts. However, developing a robust short-term traffic flow forecasting approach is a challenging task due to the stochastic character of traffic flow. This study proposes a novel approach for short-term traffic flow prediction task, namely Robust Long Short Term Memory (R-LSTM) based on Robust Empirical Mode Decomposing (REDM) algorithm and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). Short-term traffic flow data provided from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) database were used in the training and testing of the model. The dataset was composed of traffic data collected by 25 traffic detectors on different freeways’ main lanes. The time resolution of the dataset was set to 15 min, and the Hampel preprocessing algorithm was applied for outlier elimination. The R-LSTM predictions were compared with the state-of-the-art models, utilizing RMSE, MSE, and MAPE as performance criteria. Performance analyses for various periods show that R-LSTM is remarkably successful in all time periods. Moreover, developed model performance is significantly higher, especially during midday periods when traffic flow fluctuations are high. These results show that R-LSTM is a strong candidate for short-term traffic flow prediction, and can easily adapt to fluctuations in traffic flow. In addition, robust models for short-term predictions can be developed by applying the signal separation method to traffic flow data.},

This research examines the application of optimized neural network models for estimating the condition of water pipelines in Shaker Al-Bahery, Egypt.

These metrics are; Fraction of Prediction within a Factor of Two (FACT2), Willmott&#39;s index of agreement (WI), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Bias Error (MBE). The results show that the neural network trained using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm (FACT2 = 0.93, WI = 0.96, RMSE = 0.09, and MBE = 0.05) outperforms other machine learning models. Furthermore, three multi-objective swarm intelligence algorithms are applied to determine the near-optimum intervention strategies, namely PSO salp swarm optimization, and grey wolf optimization. The performances of the aforementioned algorithms are evaluated using Generalized Spread (GS), Spread (Δ), and Generational Distance (GD). The results yield that the PSO algorithm (GS = 0.54, Δ = 0.82, and GD = 0.01) exhibits better results when compared to the other algorithms. The obtained near-optimum solutions are ranked using a new additive ratio assessment and grey relational analysis decision-making techniques. Finally, the overall ranking is obtained using a new approach based on the half-quadratic theory. This aggregated ranking obtains a consensus index and a trust level of 0.97.},

The most valuable SPC tool is control charts, however, if data assumptions are not met, alterations of the statistical performance of traditional control charts may be expected. In practice, the independence assumption is commonly violated in many discrete and continuous industrial processes. Recently, machine learning has been applied in the field of control chart pattern recognition (CCPR) in order to detect and identify abnormal patterns associated with assignable causes. In several instances, the performance of SVMs has been proven superior to other machine learning algorithms. In this paper, a SVM-GA-based monitoring system is presented for fault identification in AR(1) auto-correlated processes. A two stages classification scheme is presented. The initial classification stage is centered on abnormal pattern identification. The integration of a genetic algorithm in this stage boosts the performance of the SVM by simultaneously optimizing the input feature vector, the classifiers’ hyper-parameters, and the window size. A second stage provides additional information on the detected abnormal pattern in order to facilitate the fault diagnosis. The results showed a good accuracy performance on both classification stages. The proposed monitoring system yielded better classification accuracies for positive autocorrelation levels than it did for their negative counterparts. The worst classification accuracies were obtained when autocorrelation was not present.},

  abstract     = {In geological disasters, the slope instability of open-pit mining may result in a natural disaster. Thus, a reliable decision-making strategy of slope stability is a critical issue. In the slope stability assessment process, it is difficult for humans to usually obtain exact/certain information due to the uncertainty and vagueness/impreciseness of the measurement data and human knowledge and judgments. To enhance the credibility measure of the interval-valued fuzzy information assessment, an interval-valued fuzzy number (IVFN) should be combined with its credibility degree as a single framework for expressing the hybrid information of both. From this perspective, this study first proposes an interval-valued fuzzy credibility set/number (IVFCS/IVFCN) to express the hybrid information of IVFNs and credibility degrees. Then, we define logic relations of IVFCNs and propose a generalized distance between IVFCSs and the similarity measure and cosine and tangent similarity measures based on the generalized distance. Next, the proposed similarity measures are used for the decision-making of slope stability to assess risk grades of slope stability. Finally, the proposed DM strategy is applied to nine cases/slope samples of slope stability to illustrate its usability and effectiveness. The established strategy not only makes the decision results more reasonable and credible but also overcomes the defect of existing assessment methods.},

In the test step, the single pretrained model is used to reconstruct high-quality images from optimized low-dimensional compressed measurements for each channel and synthesize a color image.

To achieve this purpose, a novel color image watermarking scheme based on an improved QR decomposition is proposed in this paper. The proposed method gives a new algorithm to find elements of Q and R matrices instead of using the Gram–Schmidt algorithm for QR factorization. First, the R matrix is performed by solving a set of linear equations where diagonal elements of R are checked and modified if they are zero or negative. After that, the Q matrix is computed based on the R matrix. In addition, a novel formula is proposed to improve the extracting time where the first element R(1, 1) of the R matrix is found instead of computing QR decomposition as the previous proposals. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other considered methods in this paper in terms of the quality of the watermarked images. Furthermore, the execution time is significantly improved, and the extracted watermark is more robust against almost tested attacks.},

  abstract     = {Interval difference equations can be used for modeling biological, economic, or physical systems that, due to lack of information or measurement errors in the input data from real-world applications, contain uncertainties. These types of systems are usually called uncertain systems. The stability analysis of those systems is of particular interest among the various properties of the uncertain systems. In this paper, we propose a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of linear interval difference equation using single-level constrained interval arithmetic. The interval Lyapunov matrix equation is developed coupled with the interval Sylvester criterion. The stability analysis of the interval difference equation proposed here, using constrained interval arithmetic, is, to a certain degree, similar to the case in crisp environment. This similarity is of great advantage for the treatment of systems with uncertainty. We illustrate the application of the stability theory developed here with a variety of examples.},

The algorithm composed of three main steps: social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. In the social distancing phase, the algorithm attempts to maintain a safe physical distance between people and limit close contacts. In the quarantine phase, the algorithm quarantines the suspected people to prevent the spread of disease. Some people who have not followed the health protocols and infected by the virus should be taken care of to get a full recovery. In the isolation phase, the algorithm cared for the infected people to recover their health. The algorithm iteratively applies these operators on the population to find the fittest and healthiest person. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on standard multi-variable single-objective optimization problems and compared with several counterpart algorithms. The results show the superiority of ACVO on most test problems compared with its counterparts.},

According to the geometrical characteristics of the packed parts, the idea of divide and conquer is adopted, and the corresponding collision strategies are designed, respectively. Two-point bidirectional collision calculation, aligned bidirectional collision and slipping calculation are proposed to determine the collision relationship between graphics. The interpolation strategy is used to reduce the computation of NFP (No-Fit-Polygon). The precise interpolation between graphics is achieved by first marking and positioning, and then sliding interpolation in both directions, which improves the interpolation efficiency. Finally, the results of the comparison test by several cases of different types show that the algorithm is effective, stable, reliable and adaptable.},

This controller is suitable for the control problems in which the plant deals with hard external disturbance and model uncertainties. Fractional calculus and interval type-2 fuzzy sets are considered as two seminal parts of the SIT2FOF controller which provide robust control performance. In addition, single-input interval type-2 fuzzy (SIT2F) sets in the structure of the proposed controller reduce computational efforts and the number of tuning parameters. Accordingly, the controller can be implemented and tuned easily. Thus, the control problem of an automatic voltage regulator in a power system and a Kubota M110X tractor active suspension system were considered as case studies to validate the suggested method. To this end, simulations were performed in three scenarios, followed by comparing the proposed technique in each scenario with single-input type-1 fuzzy (ST1F), single-input type-1 fractional-order fuzzy (ST1FOF), and single-input interval type-2 fuzzy (SIT2F) controllers. The results revealed that the SIT2FOF control technique can significantly handle external disturbances and model uncertainties more efficiently compared to the other controllers.},

WSNs efficiently manage the broader network with available resources, such as residual energy and wireless channel bandwidth. Therefore, a routing algorithm is essential to enhance battery-constrained networks. Many existing techniques are developed for balancing energy consumption, but the efficient routing was not achieved. The multivariate weighted isotonic regressive modest adaptive boosting-based Resource-Aware Routing (MWIRMAB-RAR) technique is introduced to enhance routing. The MWIRMAB-RAR technique includes a different process, namely resource-aware node selection, route path discovery, and data transmission. Initially, the MWIRMAB-RAR technique uses the modest adaptive boosting technique uses the multivariate weighted isotonic regression function for detecting resource-efficient sensor nodes for effective data transmission. After that, multiple route paths are established based on the time of flight method. Once after showing a route path, the source node sends data packets to the sink node via resource-efficient nodes. The data delivery was enhanced and minimized packet loss as well as delay. The simulation analysis is carried out on certain performance factors such as energy consumption, packet delivery ratio, packet loss rate, and delay with several data packets and sensor nodes. The obtained evaluation indicates that MWIRMAB-RAR outperforms well in increasing data packet delivery and reducing energy consumption, packet loss rate, and delay.},

Therefore, security/privacy is necessary between users and an efficient authentication approach using a robust security key. Existing techniques have several limitations while handling the attack sequences in data transmission over IoD environment systems. A novel elliptic curve cryptographic-based Chebyshev polynomial source authentication schema is proposed to enable secure data services between users to access information directly from one drone/node authorized access from other drone/user in 5G network systems. Also, we use elliptic curve cryptography for secure authentication to each node to share session key with a similar secure channel to transmit data with interactive computational complexity and secure communication in wireless IoD.

  abstract     = {System operation features such as grid size, changes in regional distribution of power grid, power grid structure and diversity in networks bring more complexity due to the electrical connections and integrity of the distributed networks. Problems in relay safety and identification of faults in distribution network are the key issues that require immediate solutions due to flaws in the existing relay protection methods. The current paper proposes a relay protection method based on a feeder segment switches in multilevel differential defense-oriented distribution network. A greedy algorithm is devised to set the positions of feeder switches for optimal utilization of energy. After considering the multiple benefits of using feeder switches in the distribution networks, the main feeder is segmented and is linked to contact switches to enhance safety and to reduce the overhead cost of multiple feeder switches. The positioning of feeder switches is determined using greedy algorithm. Main feeder switches of the distribution network select the load switches to meet the requirements of relay protection. In case of occurrence of fault in the distribution network branches, the corresponding sectional feeder switch will trip immediately and the fault will be removed before the resumption of feeder switch. A relay protection method is integrated in the proposed method to keep the distributed network free from faults. The empirical results prove the efficacy of the proposed method with respect to the safety of the relay station, cost saving, determination of faults and consumption of energy. The comparative study with the existing methods reveals that the proposed method has the maximum safety factor of relay protection for the multistage differential distribution network, i.e., about 97\%. The proposed method has the least fault location error, it saves operational cost, and it consumes minimal energy as compared to other techniques.},

  abstract     = {Many population-dependent solutions have recently been suggested. Despite their widespread adoption in many applications, we are still researching using suggested methods to solve real-world problems. As a result, researchers must significantly adjust and refine their procedures based on the main evolutionary processes to ensure faster convergence, consistent equilibrium with high-quality results, and optimization. Thus, a new hybrid method using Aquila optimizer (AO) and arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) is proposed in this paper. AO and AOA are both modern meta-heuristic optimization methods. They can be applied to different problems, including image processing, machine learning, wireless networks, power systems, engineering design etc. The proposed approach is examined concerning AO and AOA. To determine results, each procedure is evaluated using the same parameters, such as population size and several iterations. By changing the dimensions, the proposed approach (AO–AOA) is evaluated. The impact of varying dimensions is a standard test that has been used in previous studies to optimize test functions that demonstrate the influence of varying dimensions on the efficiency of AO–AOA. It is clear from this that it fits well with both high- and low-dimensional problems. Population-based methods achieve efficient search results in high-dimensional problems.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a novel optimization-based method is proposed to determine the parameters of a rotating unbalance in a rotor-bearing system. For that purpose, the weighted sum of squared difference between the analytical and predicted unbalance response due to rotational unbalance is considered as the objective function. A hybrid algorithm integrating salp swarm algorithm and Nelder–Mead algorithms is presented for detecting unbalance magnitude and phase as the unbalance parameters. Parameters of the aforementioned optimization algorithm are determined systematically using the Taguchi design of experiments method. The efficiency of the proposed method is compared with various optimization algorithms in the literature. The optimization method is validated with different unbalances experimentally to consider the real-world conditions. The results show the superiority of the proposed hybrid algorithm in terms of the accuracy of the unbalance parameters and computational efficiency.},

In this study, we consider the integrated supplier selection, lot sizing and facility location decisions and propose a two-phase decision framework based on TBL approach. In the first phase of the study, we use a trapezoidal type-2 fuzzy AHP algorithm for the initial evaluation of the suppliers based on various economic, environmental and social criteria, whereas in the second phase of the study, we propose a two-stage stochastic programming model for the integrated supplier selection, lot sizing and facility location decisions under supply and demand uncertainties. We also present a real-life case study to test the proposed decision framework. Computational results, on one hand, show the applicability of the proposed decision framework on real-life cases and, on the other hand, bring significant managerial insights. Particularly, we observe that all three pillars (economic, environmental and social) of sustainability are in conflict with each other and thus being both environmentally and socially responsible is much more costlier than being solely environmentally or socially responsible. Moreover, we observe that ignoring the uncertainties in the system may yield to higher costs and impractical results.},

The Lotka–Volterra continuous systems (Predator–Prey, Cooperative and Competitive Models) were used for the design of the algorithm. To verify the efficiency of the algorithm, experiments with 36 mathematical functions were performed, but we are only presenting results of the functions with which comparisons were made with other methods. Hypothesis tests were also carried out, where in most of the results the MTOA algorithm was better by 70\% and only in the experiments in 100 dimensions it was better by 60\%.

  abstract     = {The rapid development of mobile Internet has spawned various mobile applications (apps). A large number of apps make it difficult for users to choose apps conveniently, causing the app overload problem. As the most effective tool to solve the problem of app overload, app recommendation has attracted extensive attention of researchers. Traditional recommendation methods usually use historical usage data to explore users’ preferences and then make recommendations. Although traditional methods have achieved certain success, the performance of app recommendation still needs to be improved due to the following two reasons. On the one hand, it is difficult to construct recommendation models when facing with the sparse user–app interaction data. On the other hand, contextual information has a large impact on users’ preferences, which is often overlooked by traditional methods. To overcome the aforementioned problems, we proposed a context-aware feature deep interaction learning (CFDIL) method to explore users’ preferences and then perform app recommendation by learning potential user–app relationships in different contexts. The novelty of CFDIL is as follows: (1) CFDIL incorporates contextual features into users’ preferences modeling by constructing novel user and app feature portraits. (2) The problem of data sparsity is effectively solved by the use of dense user and app feature portraits, as well as the tensor operations for label sets. (3) CFDIL trains a new deep network structure, which can make accurate app recommendation using the contextual information and attribute information of users and apps. We applied CFDIL on three real datasets and conducted extensive experiments, which shows that CFDIL outperforms the benchmark methods.},

  abstract     = {Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) approach has made great progress in reducing the computational costs of designing automatically neural architectures. DARTS tries to discover an optimal architecture module, called as the cell, from a predefined super network containing all possible network architectures. Then a target network is constructed by repeatedly stacking this cell multiple times and connecting each one end to end. However, the repeated design pattern in depth-wise of networks fails to sufficiently extract layered features distributed in images or other media data, leading to poor network performance and generality. To address this problem, we propose an effective approach called Layered Feature Representation for Differentiable Architecture Search (LFR-DARTS). Specifically, we iteratively search for multiple cell architectures from shallow to deep layers of the super network. For each iteration, we optimize the architecture of a cell by gradient descent and prune out weak connections from this cell. Meanwhile, the super network is deepen by increasing the number of this cell to create an adaptive network context to search for a depth-adaptive cell in the next iteration. Thus, our LFR-DARTS can obtain the cell architecture at a specific network depth, which embeds the ability of layered feature representations into each cell to sufficiently extract layered features of data. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm solves the existing problem and achieves a more competitive performance on the datasets of CIFAR10 (2.45\% error rate) , fashionMNIST (3.70\%) and ImageNet (25.5\%) while at low search costs.},

Therefore, weight trainees usually hire a coach or an athletic trainer for guidance. However, the cost of hiring a trainer is high and may be prohibitive in the long term. In this study, the OpenPose system and inexpensive webcams are used to develop the WTPose algorithm that can determine whether a weight trainee&#39;s posture is correct in real time. When there is deviation in the weight trainee&#39;s posture, the algorithm will immediately display the correct posture, thereby helping the weight trainee to correct her/his weight training posture by merely spending a small fee.

HDP takes one project for training and testing against another project. We have shown the best machine learning algorithm for the DP model.

In this paper, we propose a framework that takes into account the properties of local connectivity and long range under-connectivity in the autistic brain. The originality of the proposed approach is to adopt elimination as a technique in order to well emerge the autistic brain connectivity alterations, and show how they contribute to differentiate ASD from controls. Experimental results conducted on the large multi-site Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) show that our approach provides accurate prediction up to 70\% and succeeds to prove the existence of deficits in the long-range connectivity in the ASD subjects brains.},

In fact, in this paper, GHFNs will be utilized to model the uncertainty of the assessment values of options against criteria in multi-attribute decision making (MADM) problems. It means that all of the elements of decision matrix are GHFNs. Then, the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method, as a very successful method in solving MADM problems, will be updated to be used with GHFNs. To this end, the distance between GHFNs must be defined to obtain the distances between given alternatives from each of two subjective alternatives (positive/negative ideal solutions). Thus, three existing famous distance measures, i.e., general distance ( $$d_g$$ ), Hamming distance ( $$d_h$$ ), and Euclidean distance ( $$d_e$$ ) measures, have been updated for GHFNs firstly. Then, the new TOPSIS method will be proposed based on GHFNs. Finally, the numerical examples have been appointed to illustrate the proposed method, analyze comparatively and validate it.},

The lack of consistency in preference relations results in a vague solution. The main goal of this paper is to achieve the consistent intuitionistic multiplicative preference relation using a graphical approach. We have proposed two different approaches of the consistency for intuitionistic multiplicative preference relation (IMPR). In the first approach, we propose an algorithm to achieve the consistency of IMPR by using the cycles of various lengths in a directed graph. The second approach proves isomorphism between IMPRs and asymmetric multiplicative preference relations. The result explores the methodologies developed for asymmetric multiplicative preference relations in the case of IMPRs and achieves the consistency of asymmetric multiplicative preference relations using a directed graph. Sometimes the decision maker may not be able to provide the complete reference. So the above-said method is applied for an incomplete IMPR; consistency plays an important role here. The examples are provided to illustrate both the ways in all cases.},

  abstract     = {The hedge-algebras (HA) theory has been effectively applied in different fields such as fuzzy database, logic programming, classification and regression, data mining, linguistic database summarization, and process control. This work presents a simple approach to design an HA-based controller in stabilizing a nonlinear and underactuated system, an inverted pendulum-cart model, including four input state variables and one output control variable. The HA-based controller is divided into four intermediate controllers with one input state and one output control variable. The combination method of the above intermediate controllers to achieve values of the global control variable in control loops is proposed following the influence level of state variables on the stable state of the system and the principle of HA-Inference step. The proposed approach is appropriate for controlling underactuated systems. Simulation results have indicated that the HA-based controller has high performance, adaptation, stability, and robustness. Moreover, the proposed method significantly reduces the computational time of the controller when compared to a classical Sugeno-type fuzzy controller.},

Second, a natural consequence of the classic fractional calculus, they investigated the possibility of fractional integrals and derivatives of a variable order, although more restricted when discussing basic and fundamental properties of the fractional calculus. From these two pillars and the g-calculus theory (pseudo-analysis), a third pillar started to be built, although recently, but there are already some interesting results. In this sense, in the present paper, we present new extensions of pseudo-fractional operators for integral and derivative in the sense of g-calculus and investigate some essential properties of fractional calculus.

This is because role of the singular kernel has become imperative due to the wide applications of rate-type fluid subject to the mixed convection flow. To have the systematical and molecular dynamics of Oldroyd-B fluid, the temperature distribution, velocity profile, and Nusselt numbers have been explored by invoking the Laplace transform on the governing equations. Owing to the strengthening of physical parameters, the enhancement of convective heat transfer is emphasized based on relaxation as well as retardation phenomenon.

  abstract     = {Human activity detection and response in real time is one of the major objectives in many defense applications. Many technologies that include surveillance cameras and wearable devices using sensors were proposed for human activity detection. But, these technologies are not popular due to a lack of convenience, privacy, availability, and affordability. Sensing and recognizing various human activities using wireless signal characteristics have been in the reckoning in recent years. This paper proposes a multi-stage deep learning model consisting of a convolutional neural network and other popular deep neural architectures, namely Alexnet, Googlenet, and Squeezenet, for Wi-Fi sensing-based human activity recognition. Transfer learning is used for recognizing crucial human activities using the channel state information (CSI) of the Wi-Fi signal. The objective is to identify critical human activities and then to minimize the false negatives. In the proposed multi-stage model, a data sample is tested in one network for identifying the critical activity; if classified as negative with predefined confidence, the sample is tested again in the subsequent architectures. A sample is considered negative only if all the stages confirm it as negative. Our proposed multi-stage model can reduce the false negatives with a slight increase in the false positive rate. We have considered the dataset consisting of measured CSI values of three transmitter–receiver pairs for six different activities: fall, wave, jump, walk, clap, and sit. We report the results of the experiments with a focus on reducing false negatives of individual activities during the testing phase.},

We classify tweets into two classes: neutral and non-neutral; the latter class includes both positive and negative polarity. This type of classification will be considered for applications that aim to test the neutrality of content posted by the users in social media platforms. In our proposed model, features are extracted by integrating natural language processing with fuzzy logic; hence, it is able to deal with the fuzziness of natural language in a very efficient and automatic manner. We have proposed a novel set of 64 rules for the proposed neuro-fuzzy network that can classify tweets correctly by working on fuzzy features fetched from VADER, AFINN and SentiWordNet lexicons. The proposed novel rules are domain independent, i.e., we can extend these rules for any textual data that employs lexicons. The antecedent and consequent parameters of the ANFIS are optimized by gradient descent and least squares estimate algorithms, respectively, in an iterative manner. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) a novel neuro-fuzzy system: MultiLexANFIS that takes as its input the positive and negative sentiment scores of tweets computed from multiple lexicons—VADER, AFINN and SentiWordNet, in order to classify the tweets into neutral and non-neutral content, (2) a novel set of 64 rules for the Sugeno-type fuzzy inference system—MultiLexANFIS, (3) single-lexicon-based ANFIS variants to classify tweets when multiple lexicons are not available and (4) comparison of MultiLexANFIS with different fuzzy, non-fuzzy and deep learning state of the art on various benchmark datasets revealing the superiority of our proposed neuro-fuzzy system for social sentiment analysis.},

  abstract     = {The major challenge of this paper is to examine how various forms of speed perception affect motor vehicle crash (MVC) involvement. To model this relationship, we use a type-2 fuzzy inference system (T2FIS). Another general challenge is to improve the performance of seven created T2FISs in a sense of compliance with the empirical data. This is achieved by a proposal of an algorithm based on the bee colony optimization (BCO) metaheuristic. The main novelty of this algorithm is the way how the testing points are selected in a type-2 fuzzy environment, which influences the execution efficiency. Data collection was carried out in twelve experiments. A total of 178 young drivers assessed the speed level from four positions; three of them relate to the speed perception of other vehicles on the road, while the remaining one represents the assessment of their own speed. At each position, three speed levels were assessed: 30, 50, and 70 km/h. As a result of the implemented methodology, a relationship between the various forms of speed perception and participation in MVCs can be quantified. The BCO-based algorithm achieved an average improvement of 21.17\% in the performance of the initial T2FIS structures. The final results indicate that the drivers whose speed perception of the vehicle they are looking at from the rear side, as well as of the own vehicle, is poor have an elevated risk toward participation in MVCs compared to other forms of speed perception. This can be useful in various educational and recruitment procedures.},

To meet the secure communication and access control requirements in the user–medical server, user–patient, patient–medical server, and other scenarios in the E-healthcare system, secure and efficient authenticated key agreement and access authorization scheme need to be studied. However, the existing multi-server solutions do not consider the authentication requirements of the Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) and are not suitable for user–patient, patient–medical server scenarios; most of the existing WBAN authentication schemes are single-server type, which are difficult to meet the requirements of multi-server applications, and the study of user–patient real-time scenarios has not received due attention. This work first reveals the structural flaws and security vulnerabilities of the existing typical schemes and then proposes an authentication and access control architecture suitable for multiple scenarios of the E-healthcare system with separate management and business and designs a novel ECC-based multi-factor remote authentication and access control scheme for E-healthcare using physically unclonable function (PUF) and hash.

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is a promising decentralized deep learning technology, which allows users to update models cooperatively without sharing their data. FL is reshaping existing industry paradigms for mathematical modeling and analysis, enabling an increasing number of industries to build privacy-preserving, secure distributed machine learning models. However, the inherent characteristics of FL have led to problems such as privacy protection, communication cost, systems heterogeneity, and unreliability model upload in actual operation. Interestingly, the integration with Blockchain technology provides an opportunity to further improve the FL security and performance, besides increasing its scope of applications. Therefore, we denote this integration of Blockchain and FL as the Blockchain-based federated learning (BCFL) framework. This paper introduces an in-depth survey of BCFL and discusses the insights of such a new paradigm. In particular, we first briefly introduce the FL technology and discuss the challenges faced by such technology. Then, we summarize the Blockchain ecosystem. Next, we highlight the structural design and platform of BCFL. Furthermore, we present the attempts ins improving FL performance with Blockchain and several combined applications of incentive mechanisms in FL. Finally, we summarize the industrial application scenarios of BCFL.},

The objective of this article is to establish a WASPAS (weighted aggregated sum product assessment)-based outranking approach for MCDM in a picture fuzzy set (PFS) environment. To illustrate the practicality and reasonableness of the suggested method, in reality, scenario research involving appropriate air-conditioning system selection is provided.

These risks can be modeled probabilistically by random variables or possibilistically by fuzzy numbers. In mixed models, one of the components is probabilistic and the other one is possibilistic. After the construction of two mixed models of optimal saving, several notions of precautionary saving are defined. These measure the variation in optimal saving level when moving from one model to another (usually by adding a risk component). The main results of the paper establish necessary and sufficient conditions on the positivity of different precautionary savings. (This means that the presence of new risks generates extra-saving.)},

The Archimedean t-norm and t-conorm (ATS) also have many advantages for the processing of uncertain data. Under this environment, the confidence q-rung orthopair fuzzy aggregation operator based on ATS is one of the most successful extensions of confidence q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers in which we decrease the deviation caused by the subjective perspective of the decision-maker in the multicriteria group decision-making problems. In this paper, we propose weighted, ordered weighted averaging aggregation operators and weighted, ordered weighted geometric aggregation operators based on ATS, respectively. Moreover, the properties and four specific forms associated with aggregation operators are also investigated. In this study, a novel MCGDM approach is introduced by using the proposed operator. A reasonable example is proposed and compared the results that are obtained by our operators and that in the existing literature, so as to verify the rationality and flexible of our method. From the study, we concluded that the proposed method can reduce the impact of extreme data, and make decision-making results more reasonable by considering the attitudes of decision-makers.},

With its distinctive advantages in settling complex issues in practice, more and more researchers have paid attention to this point. Compared with other swarm algorithms, the symbiotic organism search (SOS) algorithm, a promising meta-heuristic evolutionary one, is featured by high convergence and high-quality solutions in the overall optimization process. However, when the SOS algorithm was proposed, it was to solve real-life problems, and there are many discrete problems to be solved by us, so some scholars discretized the SOS algorithm. The discretized SOS algorithm has the shortcoming that it is very easy to fall into the local optimum, which leads to insufficient convergence, so in this paper, we propose a multi-group discrete SOS algorithm with gene transfer and path cross for elimination strategies to improve the performance of the DSOS algorithm in solving TSP. To prove the performance and efficiency of the algorithm for the TSP problem, the symmetry problem in the TSPLIB data set is employed to verify it, and this paper compares it with other algorithms to show the practicability of the method.},

As one of the recent-developed successful metaheuristics, Social Engineering Optimizer (SEO) algorithm is according to the inspiration of the rules of social engineering to solve approximate optimization problems. In this research, a Modified Social Engineering Optimizer algorithm (MSEO) by using an adjustment operator is proposed in which there are some assessment criteria for defender and attacker to determine and calculate the weight simultaneously for the first time. This enhancement comprises adding adjustment operators to improve the performance of SEO in terms of search accuracy and running time. Most notably, this operator is utilized to make a better new generation and improve the interaction between the search phases. The adjustment operator strategy is also applied to a novel division based on the best person. As an extensive comparison, the suggested algorithm is tested on fourteen standard benchmark functions and compared with ten well-established and recent optimization algorithms as well as the main version of the SEO algorithm. This algorithm is also tested for sensitivities on the parameters. In this regard, a set of engineering applications were provided to prove and validate the MSEO algorithm for the first time. The experimental outcomes show that the suggested algorithm produces very accurate results which are better than the SEO and other compared algorithms. Most notably, the MSEO provides a very competitive output and a high convergence rate.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the Multi-Objective Multi-Modal Green Tourist Trip Design Problem (MO-MM-GTTDP) as the multi-modal variant of the orienteering problem is investigated. For this problem, a mixed-integer linear model is formulated, containing three objectives: (1) maximizing the total score of the trip, (2) minimizing the total cost of the trip, and, (3) minimizing the total CO2 emission produced by transportations in the trip. Various transportation modes are considered for the tourist to choose to move between points of interest (POIs). The tourist choice may be affected by the transportation time and cost. Moreover, choosing the transportation mode will have an impact on the amount of trip pollutants. The cost of visiting POIs, as well as the cost of transportation between POIs, is considered as the total cost of the tour. The proposed problem is solved for two types of tourists: (1) tourists who give the highest priority to the total score, then the total cost, and at last, the total emission; (2) tourists who would like to compromise between objective functions and select a solution which best suits their situation. For the former type, the problem is solved using lexicographic method and one best solution is proposed. For the latter type, a $$\upvarepsilon -\mathrm{constraint}$$ method is implemented which provides Pareto optimal solutions. In addition, a Multi-Objective Variable Neighborhood Search (MOVNS) algorithm is designed to solve instances of this problem. The performance of this method is evaluated by comparing its results with the $$\upvarepsilon -\mathrm{constraint}$$ and the lexicographic methods. New instances of the problem are generated based on the OP existed benchmark instances. Moreover, the MOVNS is also compared against two other metaheuristic versions of the solution approach using multiple metrics. The conclusion is the high quality of the proposed MOVNS algorithm solutions in practically acceptable computation time (few seconds). Finally, a small case study based on real data on several POIs in the city of Tehran is generated and used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed model and algorithm in practice. For this case study, by using the multi-attribute decision-making method of TOPSIS, the obtained non-dominated solutions are ranked, and the best ones are presented.},

Everyone makes use of their vehicles like two-wheelers or four-wheelers to reach the destination. Vehicle condition plays a major role which includes many parameters such as tyre condition, engine overheating, low fuel mileage. This paper concentrates on the examination of tyre track design for deformities. The mileage of a vehicle relies upon different components. However, it depends on different parameters like street condition, tyre weight and numerous others. For smooth driving and for safe traffic reasons, the auspicious maintenance of tyres plays a vital task. Consequently, the likelihood of prediction of tyre imperfections is assumed to play a vital role to fleet proprietors, government and tyre makers. Researchers make use of recent technologies such as machine learning and deep learning concepts to provide a solution to various real-life problems. The creation of a weighted quality-based convolutional neural network with the purpose of discovery of imperfections on tyres by the examination of pictures of tyre track designs is being proposed. The proposed system with the accessible data-set made public by different tyre producers is included for evaluation. The consequences of our tests demonstrate that it is conceivable to predict the deformities and durability of a tyre from its track designs through a weighted quality-based convolutional neural network. The proposed methodology is used to identify the group of feature values from the tyre image. These kinds of feature values are utilized to implement the dissimilarity of the feature related pixels. The number of epochs is varied as a callback mechanism has been used to validate the proposed model. Binary accuracy and mean absolute error are the best metrics to evaluate the performance which are discussed in the results section.

For the governance of the flight missions in a complex defense environment, the usage of these systems necessitated a sound command over data mining process. The large volume of data is generated by UAVs and processing of this data is a challenging issue. The existing data tracking and management systems are expensive and complex. For defense systems, smarter solutions are needed to process the large volume of data at low cost and with high accuracy. Therefore, a technique of tracking the data generated by UAV and automatic measurement of trajectory based on micro-electro-mechanical systems sensor in UAV has been proposed in this paper to provide inexpensive solutions to overcome the problems of the existing data tracking and processing systems. An iterative learning control algorithm is utilized in UAV to ascertain the disturbance and modeling errors. The finest characteristics of the Kalman filter technique are used for estimations of UAV trajectory. The quadratic performance function is introduced in discrete equation to solve the model error disturbance. Then on the basis of gyroscope data, the quaternion differential equation is formulated. The gradient descent process is also used to speed up the processing of UAV data. The results depict that the proposed technique has the lowest data tracking error of the UAV trajectory (0.09\%) and has good measurement accuracy of 92\%. The proposed method also reduces time complexity and searches the solution space in a faster manner.},

In the first part, we initiated the notion of picture fuzzy bi-ideals and picture fuzzy generalized bi-ideals in semigroups and investigated some of its properties. In particular, we also prove that a non-empty subsets $$\mathcal {PM}\left( \mu _{A} : \alpha \right) $$ , $$\mathcal {NEUM}\left( \eta _{A} : \beta \right) $$ and $$\mathcal {NM}\left( \nu _{A} : \delta \right) $$ of a semigroup S are bi-ideals (generalized bi-ideals) of S if and only if the picture fuzzy set $$\mathcal {A} = \left( \mu _{A}, \eta _{A}, \nu _{A}\right) $$ is a picture fuzzy bi-ideal (picture fuzzy generalized bi-ideal) on S. In conclusion of this paper, we prove that a semigroup S is completely regular if and only if for every picture fuzzy generalized bi-ideal $$\mathcal {A} = \left( \mu _{A}, \eta _{A}, \nu _{A}\right) $$ on S and for all $$x \in S$$ it holds $${\mu _{A}}(x) = {\mu _{A}}(x^{2}), {\eta _{A}}(x) = {\eta _{A}}(x^{2})$$ and $${\nu _{A}}(x) = {\nu _{A}}(x^{2})$$ .},

A new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is proposed based on Caputo derivative which leads to obtaining less conservative stability conditions are proposed. Both approaches state feedback and delayed state feedback are applied in the form of a parallel-distributed compensation scheme for stabilization of the closed-loop system. Each of the stability conditions is written as a linear matrix inequality. Finally, some examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Deriving the rating of technical attributes (TAs) is a crucial step in QFD. However, the prioritization of TAs may be misleading in conventional QFD because of the uncertainty in linguistic data and result randomness. This study proposes a novel method to rate TAs based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets, continuous ordered weighted averaging aggregation operator, Choquet integral, K-additive measures, and mixed integer programming. Firstly, the continuous ordered weighted averaging aggregation operator is proposed under interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment to reflect individuals’ risk attitudes. Then, K-additive measures and Choquet integral are integrated to consider the correlation among customer requirements. Finally, the mixed integer programming is employed to prioritize technical attributes when maximizing the utility of design company and minimizing the group disagreements. The proposed method could rank TAs more robustly. An example of robot perception system design is cited to demonstrate the application of the method.},

However, the existing research on rough graphs has not considered graph characteristics, such as path information. To address this shortcoming, this paper considers the transitive closure and minimum equivalent graph, which keep the path information of a directed graph unchanged. Namely, using the minimum equivalent graph and the transitive closure to approximate a directed graph, a path information-based rough directed graph (PIRDG) model is constructed. In addition, the current studies on granular structure reduction in graphs have been mostly focused on vertex reduction, which cannot make full use of structural information contained in graphs. To address this limitation, the paper introduces three graph reducts by treating each directed graph as a PIRDG, studies the relationship between them, and proposes a method to determine an optimal graph reduct. The proposed PIRDG model is verified under the conditions of rumor propagation and communication network reduction, its practicability in decision making is demonstrated, and the result shows that this model is more efficient than other rough graph models in some fields such as information dissemination.},

Proposing smart algorithms for fast parking is crucial not only to facilitate drivers, but also to reduce traffic congestion, pollution, and vehicle energy consumption. Typically, an urban area has several competitive car parks and, in order to make the parking process automatic, a mechanism to ensure a fair competition among them is needed. Among all the methods able to guarantee transparency and equity in a system, blockchain is a robust technology. It has been successfully applied in many different research fields, from financial to health. In this work, we provide an automatic parking system in which vehicles are allocated among several competitive parking areas (called competitors), through a blockchain-based approach, by applying a consensus mechanism to manage the system modifications. To this aim, two classes of fairness constraints are defined, according to which any new operation on the parking consortium must be approved by the members. Such an approach brings benefits for different reasons, starting from traffic condition improvement, up to driver stress and pollution decrease.},

A model-based hybrid feature extraction method is proposed by optimizing the weight matrix of the LSDA algorithm. The effectiveness of the suggested approach is demonstrated by preliminary experiments on the English video database.

FHS-set is projected to address the limitations of these models regarding the entitlement of multi-argument approximate function. This kind of function maps the sub-parametric tuples to power set of universe. It emphasizes the partitioning of each attribute into its attribute-valued set that is missing in existing soft set-like structures. These features make it a completely new mathematical tool for solving problems dealing with uncertainties. As convexity has an essential function in optimization and control, pattern classification and recognition, image processing and in different fields of operation research, numerical analysis, etc. In order to tackle the various features of classical convexity (concavity) with uncertain environment of multi-argument approximate function, an articulate cum mathematical technique is utilized to develop a theoretical framework of convexity cum concavity on fuzzy hypersoft set which is more generalized and effective concept to deal with optimization relating problems. Moreover, some generalized properties like strictly convex (concave), strongly convex (concave), $$\delta $$ -inclusion and aggregation operations are established.

The method of complex proportional assessment of alternatives is used to obtain the final rank of states.

The results of sensitivity analysis indicated that when financial aspects are focused upon, California is the best alternative, followed by Texas and Oklahoma.

  abstract     = {In microgrids, to have minimal operation cost, optimal power scheduling among distributed energy resources is an essential task. Owing to nonlinearity and complexity of power scheduling problem, it is vital to use a high-performance optimization technique to efficiently solve this problem. To achieve this goal, in this paper, crow search algorithm (CSA) is proposed and improved to optimally solve the power scheduling problem in a microgrid including photovoltaic modules, wind turbines and combined heat and power system. In the improved CSA (ICSA), there are three modifications: (1) oriented differential operator, (2) adaptive flight length and (3) repulsion factor. These modifications help the algorithm to provide a better balance between diversification and intensification. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the results obtained by ICSA are compared with the results found by the other algorithms. Over IEEE 37-node feeder, simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm finds more accurate results than the other methodologies. In comparison with artificial fish swarm, additive increase multiplicative decrease, memory-based genetic algorithm, genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization with inertia weight (PSOw) and particle swarm optimization with constriction factor (PSOcf), when ICSA is applied, operation cost decreases around 19, 19.7, 0.7, 36, 6.1 and 5\%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The procedure of identifying and classifying opinions in a piece of text to find out whether customer reviews toward a particular product or service are positive, negative, or neutral is termed as sentiment analysis. Stock market prediction is one of the most attractive topics in academic and real-life business. Many data mining techniques about sentiment analysis are suffering from the inaccuracy of prediction. The low classification accuracy has a direct effect on the reliability of stock market indicators. Treebank filtering Data Preprocessing based Ochiai-Barkman Relevance Vector Linear Programming Boost Classification technique is used for stock market prediction using sentimental analysis with higher prediction accuracy and lesser classification time for enhancing accuracy of stock market based on product review. Initially, the customer reviews and feedback on services or products are collected from the large database. After that, the collected customer reviews are preprocessed by performing the process such as tokenization, stemming, filtering. In order to achieve sentimental analysis through classifying customer reviews as positive and negative, Ochiai-Barkman Relevance Vector Linear Programming Boost Classification algorithm is used. The Linear Programming Boost Classification algorithm constructs with an empty set of weak classifiers as the Ochiai-Barkman Relevance Vector machine. The customer reviews are classified based on the Ochiai-Barkman similarity coefficient. The ensemble technique combines the weak classification results into strong by minimizing the error. In this way, the classification performance gets improved and the prediction of the stock market is carried out in a more accurate manner. Experimental evaluation is carried out on factors such as prediction accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and prediction time versus amount of customer reviews.},

  abstract     = {Petri nets, as an effective mathematical tool, have been intensively used in modeling and analyzing automated manufacturing systems (AMSs). Many deadlock control policies have been proposed for AMSs, but most of them assume that resources never fail during product processing. However, resource failures may happen in a real world, which may invalidate existing control policies. This paper concentrates on robust liveness-enforcing supervisor design for a system of simple sequential processes with multiple unreliable resources. Recovery subnets model resource failure and recovery, which are added to the holders of unreliable resource places. The proposed method consists of two steps. At the first step, a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem is developed to detect a strict minimal siphon that can be emptied. At the second step, an extended constraint set derived by the complementary set of a siphon is constructed. The siphon is controlled through the extended constraint set by adding a control place. The above two steps are executed in an iterative way until no new empty siphon is found and a robust liveness-enforcing supervisor can be obtained. Examples are used to expose the advantages of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Animal conservation is imperative, and technology can certainly assist in different ways. The extinction of endangered species like tigers and elephants has boosted the necessity for such efforts. Human–elephant collision (HEC) has been an active area of research for years. Apart from deforestation, the roads and rail tracks laid down through forest areas intervene a lot in wildlife. Collisions and tragedies are every day, especially in green belts in India and other Asian countries. Therefore, it is crucial to develop vision-based, automated, warning-generating systems to identify the animal/elephant near-site. In the proposed work, different deep learning-based models are proposed to identify elephants in image/video. Several convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models and three transfer learning (TL)-based models, i.e., ResNet50, MobileNet, Inception V3, have been experimented with and tuned for elephant detection. All the models are tested on a synthesized dataset having about 4200 images built using two public datasets, i.e., ELPephant and RailSem19. Two accurate CNN and transfer learning-based models are presented in detail. These highly accurate and precise models can alarm the trains and generate warning signals on site. The proposed CNN and inception network demonstrated high accuracy of 99.53\% and 99.91\%, respectively, and are remarkable in identifying elephants and hence preventing HEC. The same model can be trained for other animals for their preservation in similar scenarios.},

Existing research rarely investigates the time-updated dynamic in project complexity as the project process progresses. This study develops a novel systematic soft computing approach based on Bayesian inference to explore the evolutionary dynamics in project complexity under uncertainty. By learning the network structure and parameters from given data, a dynamic Bayesian network model is established to simulate the complex interrelations among 7 complexity-related variables. The developed approach is capable of performing predictive, sensitivity, and diagnostic analysis on a quantitative basis. The construction project of EXPO 2010 is used to testify the effectiveness and applicability of the developed approach. Results indicate that (1) more attention should be paid to technological complexity and task complexity in the process of complexity management; (2) the developed dynamic Bayesian network approach can model the evolutionary dynamics of project complexity at different scenarios; and (3) the complexity level of a specific construction project over time can be predicted in a dynamic manner. This research contributes to (a) the state of the knowledge by proposing a systematic soft computing methodology that can model and identify the dynamic interactions of project complexity factors over time, and (b) the state of the practice by gaining a better understanding of the most sensitive factors for managing complexity in a changing project environment.},

To overcome this drawback, we introduce the prospect theory to describe the perception of the subjects. At first, the probabilistic linguistic evaluations are normalized. Then, the evaluations under the cost criteria are transformed into their benefit types to guarantee the consistency of the computation process. Thereafter, calculate the prospect values for the subjects based on the defined relative normalized Lance distance of the probabilistic linguistic term sets. Afterwards, aggregate the prospect values into the satisfaction degrees. On the basis of this, build the multi-objective two-sided matching decision-making model and further transform it into the single-objective model. To solve the latter is to obtain the optimal matching result. An illustrative example of intelligent technology transfer is presented to validate the proposed approach, and the optimal matching result is obtained for the demanders and the providers. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach comparing with the existing methods.},

Therefore, for overcoming the drawbacks of ACO, a heterogeneous ant colony optimization based on adaptive interactive learning and non-zero-sum game is proposed. Firstly, three subpopulations with different characteristics are constructed into heterogeneous ant colony to enhance the performance of the ant colony. Secondly, the adaptive interactive learning mechanism is adopted when the algorithm diversity decreases, in which the objects to be communicated are selected adaptively according to the population similarity. In this mechanism, the way of communication is to pair the inferior individuals with the superior individuals, which enlarges the searching range and speeds up the convergence speed. Finally, an elite information exchange strategy based on non-zero-sum game is adopted when the algorithm falls into local optimum, in which each subpopulation selects the partners for elite information exchange according to the normalized comprehensive evaluation operator, which is helpful for each subpopulation to select the most appropriate strategy for getting out of the local optimal. Through this model, the accuracy of the solution is further improved. The data that used for this experiment is from the TSPLIB library under MATLAB simulation with various ranges of TSP datasets. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm has a higher quality solution and faster convergence speed in solving the traveling salesman problem.},

Relief logistics planning in disaster management is a dynamic process that includes deliberate processes taken before and after a disaster. This paper presents a robust optimization model for relief logistics planning covering before and after disaster actions to minimize the total cost. In this model, demand and traveling time between nodes are non-deterministic parameters, and scenario-based robust optimization is applied to handle uncertainty. The model is an integrated multi-echelon, multi-period, and multi-commodity vehicle routing problem considering the fair distribution of goods and services in a way that social costs are minimized. Vehicles can enter nodes and exit them several times. In this paper, a genetic algorithm (GA) is considered the solution approach. To estimate the GA parameters, an experimental design based on the Taguchi method is considered. A roulette wheel method is applied to select a child from parents for the next generation. Single-point crossover and swap mutation operators are used to generate the new child. Test problems in different scales are generated and solved using GAMS and GA. The results indicate that GA solutions have 3.75\% gaps in average with optimal solutions. Finally, the model is applied with the data of a real case (Tehran). The results also indicate that it is better to consider the appropriate capacity for supply centers and distributors and select vehicles.},

Nevertheless, one weakness of such models concerns their hyperparameters’ setting, being highly specific for each particular problem. One common approach is to employ meta-heuristic optimization algorithms to find suitable sets of hyperparameters at the expense of increasing the computational burden, being unfeasible under real-time scenarios. In this paper, we address this problem by creating Convolutional Neural Networks ensembles through Single-Iteration Optimization, a fast optimization composed of only one iteration that is no more effective than a random search. Essentially, the idea is to provide the same capability offered by long-term optimizations, however, without their computational loads. The results among four well-known datasets revealed that creating one-iteration optimized ensembles provides promising results while diminishing the time to achieve them.},

The MSA enjoys a higher advantage than PSA since it predicts the similarity in a family of similar sequences, providing more biological data. Moreover, while the dynamic programming (DP) technique is used in PSA to provide the optimal method, it will lead to more complexity if used in MSA. So, the MSA mainly uses heuristic and approximation methods. Such methods include progressive alignment, iterative alignment, Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and Metaheuristic algorithms. This paper presents a genetic algorithm and chromosome design to solve a mathematical model for MSA. This model uses a basis for an optimal solution in different ways, and an X-mediated matrix with binary elements is used to model the sequence. Then, the model is implemented using the Genetic Algorithm method on the web, and the final results indicate the success of GA for the MSA approach.},

  abstract     = {A multi-person multi-task optimization dispatch method, which considers two-sided matching, is proposed for volunteers to enable them to assist government departments with disaster relief activities more efficiently. First, the method uses disappointment theory and a linear weighting method to calculate the bilateral satisfaction. More specifically, the method is based on the conditions and needs of the different evaluation indicators on both sides, and takes into account the psychological perception of the disappointment and rejoicing of both parties. Second, combined satisfaction is calculated with the goal of achieving the highest bilateral satisfaction consistency. Then, according to the demand of both parties, a multi-person multi-task optimization model is built, and an improved predator search algorithm is used to solve the model. The efficacy of the proposed method was evaluated using the &quot;8.12&quot; dangerous goods fire and explosion at Tianjin Port in China as an example. The results are compared and analyzed in terms of the three aspects to demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of this method.},

  abstract     = {Protein Secondary Structure (PSS) prediction emerges as a hot topic in the area of bioinformatics.PSS helps to predict the tertiary structure and helps to understand its structures, which in turn helps to design various drugs. The existing PSS prediction techniques are capable of achieving Q3 accuracy of nearly 80\% and have no improvement till now. In this paper, we propose a novel technique that uses amino acid sequences alone as an input feature and the respected feature vector matrix is given through the deep learning model (DLM) for PSS prediction. We use OneHotEncoding and LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) technique to forecast PSS that helps to achieve more accuracy. The OneHotEncoder is used to extract the local contexts of amino-acid sequences, and LSTM captures the long-distance interdependencies among aminoacids. The overall implementation is carried in MATLAB 2020a. The performance of this model is evaluated in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and by the percentage of accuracy of both Q3 and Q8 secondary structure predictions. The Q3 structure of the proposed scheme gained 86.54, 85.2 and 85.7\%CullPDB, CASP10, and CASP11 and the accuracy of Q8 is 77.8, 72.5 and 74.9\% on the benchmark datasets such as CullPDB, CASP10, and CASP11 respectively. Some of the advantages of the proposed scheme are minimize the computation time and achieves better accuracy when compared to the other baseline models in the prediction of PSS.},

  abstract     = {Basic science is becoming more computing intensive with the incremental need for large-scale computing and storage resources. Cloud computing provides great potentials for hosting and executing scientific applications, which can be represented as workflows for automatic execution and run time provisioning. However, workflow scheduling is highly challenging under dynamic cloud environments since certain runtime QoS. In this paper, we propose an improved swarm search algorithm, i.e., an Owl Search Algorithm embedded with a newly designed Mutation strategy (OSAM) for scheduling workflows with makespan minimized under budget constraints. A population update mechanism, where each particle is updated in term of the impact of current best solution, is modified for an Owl Search Algorithm (OSA) to address discrete sequential optimization problems. We then adjust a step parameter $$\beta $$ such that it decreases adaptively with the number of iterations to enhance OSAM’s convergence speed. To further increase the diversity of population and enlarge OSAM’s global search ability, we embed a mutation strategy into OSA’s evolutionary process for better balancing between exploitation and exploration. A series of experiments are conducted to verify the proposed algorithm by comparing with benchmarking algorithms over well-known scientific workflows with different types and sizes through WorkflowSim. Experimental results show that in almost all the cases, the proposed OSAM outperforms the existing algorithms in the solution quality and constraint satisfiability, i.e., it can find near-optimal solutions that meet the tight and loose budget constraints within an acceptable time interval, especially in addressing large-scale applications, e.g., its RSR values are at least 0.10 greater than other algorithms in these cases. Besides, a nonparametric statistical hypothesis test, i.e., Wilcoxon signed-rank test, is applied to the resulting solutions, and the testing results demonstrate that our OSAM is significantly different from its peers.},

This paper improves recently developed Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm by extending it with three new features: namely presenting a new formulation for evaluating the positions of search agents, applying mirroring distance to the variables violating the limits, and proposing a dynamic decision approach for each agent either in exploration or exploitation phases. The performance of Advanced Grey Wolf Optimization (AGWO) method is tested using several optimization test functions and compared to several heuristic algorithms. Moreover, a planning problem in smart grids is solved by considering different objective functions using 33 and 141 bus distribution test systems. From the numerical simulation results, we observe that, AGWO is able to find the best results compared to other methods from 10 and 9 out of 13 test functions for 30 and 60 variables, respectively. Similar to this, it finds best function values for 5 out of 10 fixed number of variable test functions. Also, the result of the CEC-C06 2019 benchmark functions shows that AGWO outperforms 8 for optimization problems from 10. In power distribution system planning problem, better objective function values were determined by using AGWO, resulting a better voltage profile, less losses, and less emission costs compared to solutions obtained by Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Aging process is one of the main unsolved problems of modern biology that affects almost all living species, resulting from multiple interactions of genetics and environmental factors. Numerous studies have shown that DNA methylation changes are one of the most sustainable biomarkers in predicting biological age that has complex relationship with chronological age. This point shows the importance of selecting age-related CpG-sites. Most feature selection methods that have been proposed in this field are problem-dependent techniques for finding important age-related CpG-sites. However, in this study, we propose a general-purpose framework that is problem independent. This adaptive framework is proposed to find the best sequence of feature selection methods and the number of features that selected in each step according to the used dataset. To evaluate our proposed framework, we used two groups of DNA methylation dataset related to blood tissue and non-blood tissues from healthy samples. The results of our adaptive framework have been compared with four studies in terms of mean absolute deviation (MAD) and correlation (R2) separately on blood and non-blood datasets. Our framework achieved MAD of 3.9 years and 5.33 years on the blood and non-blood test datasets, respectively. Also, a correlation (R2) of 95.24\% and 91.92\% between chronological age and DNAm has been reported on the blood and non-blood test datasets, respectively. The experimental results show that our proposed framework was able to adaptively find the best feature selection method appropriate to the data that has an acceptable performance compared to other studies.},

  abstract     = {Within the explainable recommendation field, most of recent knowledge graphs (KG)-oriented recommendation techniques mainly focus on the direct interactions between entities in a given KG. These interactions are considered as the rich information sources for leveraging the quality of recommendation outputs. However, these recent recommendation techniques are still hindered by the heterogeneity, type-varied entities and their relationships in a given KG as the heterogeneous information networks (HIN). This limitation seems challenging to build up an effective approach for the KG-based recommendation system in both semantic path-based exploitation and heterogeneous information extraction. In order to overcome these challenges, we proposed a novel integrated HIN embedding with reinforcement learning (RL)-based feature engineering for recommendation, called as: HINRL4Rec. First of all, we apply the combined textual meta-path-based embedding approach for learning multiple-rich-schematic representations of user/item and their associated entities. Then, these extracted multi-typed embeddings of user and item entities are fused into the unified embedding spaces during the KG embedding process. In the end, the combined representations of users and items are used to facilitate the RL-based policy-driven searching process in the next steps for performing the explainable recommendation task. Extensive experiments in real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model in comparing with recent state-of-the-art recommendation baselines.},

The stiffness characteristic of the shape memory coil (SMC) is sensed during actuation which plays a significant role in development of intelligent robotics in defense systems. The electrical property of SMC such as electrical resistance changes due to martensitic phase transformation which is further used to sense the mechanical properties such as strain, stress, temperature, length, and force of the equipment. Nowadays electrical properties are used to sense the stiffness of the shape memory coil. As of now, there is no well-established analytical model to predict the stiffness of SMC during actuation accurately. Therefore, a soft model based on machine learning is proposed in this paper for autosensing of the stiffness in SMC. The experimental facility has been developed for the collection of data with respect to diverse Joule heating currents. To determine the experimental data values of stiffness and electrical resistance of SMC is a cumbersome task. Hence, we have proposed an automated method to predict the stiffness of the SMC using soft computing-based methods. The Classical Polynomial and Bayesian optimization-based Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) models are developed for analyzing the stiffness of the SMC. It is found that the hybrid FFNN model outperforms the other ML-based model by attaining 95.2650\% accuracy. The FFNN model is also able to explain almost all the predicted stiffness values which are experimentally recorded.},

In this paper, the electric circuit model of fractional stiff differential equations is investigated using a novel multi-step approach of reproducing kernel method (MS-RKM). Fractional operator with non-singular kernel, Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivative, is considered to obtain accurate approximate solutions over a sequence of intervals for the fractional stiff system. To maintain dimensionality of the physical parameters appearing in the electrical circuit, a parameter is used to characterize the presence of fractional structures in the electrical model. Solving our model, in the context of classic numerical methods, is a difficult task, and solutions are often offered in a very small region with a very slow rate of convergence or they may diverge in wider regions. MS-RKM is treated as a new modification of RKM on subintervals, which considerably reduces the number of arithmetic operations and thus time and effort to get approximate solutions. Efficiency, simplicity, and accuracy of the proposed multi-step approach in solving the fractional stiff system is evident through numerical simulations performed for RL, RC, and RLC circuit models.},

Each approach has its own benefits over the others. The main objective of this paper is to design an efficient image encryption approach. Initially, various image encryption approaches have been studied. It is found that the majority of the existing image encryption approaches suffer from the hyperparameters tuning problem. Also, it is desirable to develop secret keys which are highly sensitive to plain images. Therefore, in this paper, an improved seven-dimensional hyperchaotic system (i7DHS) is adopted to generate secret keys. But, i7DHS is sensitive to its initial parameters. Therefore, a dual local search-based evolutionary algorithm (DEA) is utilized to tune the initial parameters of i7DHS. The computed optimal keys are utilized to encrypt the input images. Performance analysis shows that DEA-based i7DHS outperforms the competitive approaches. DEA-based i7DHS is highly sensitive to the input images and has large secret key space. It is found that DEA-based i7DHS can resist various security attacks.},

Based on high-level features, the resultant information often requires well-detected results like activity monitoring, detection, and classification. The objective of the study focuses on the vision-based FD and activity monitoring (AM) methods using different types of cameras and determines the finest method for different backgrounds and complex surroundings in outdoor and indoor scenes. Several works of literature provide various detection algorithms which cannot differentiate the fall from other actions. So, there is a need for efficient detection techniques which can efficiently work on all sorts of fall event images. Also, the AM algorithm lies in different classification techniques but it is not robust to classify the actions being the same speed with the fall such as jumping, bending, etc. In this paper, we view the comparative study of vision-based FD and monitoring techniques such as Inactivity/Body shape change based, Posture based, 3D head motion-based, Spatial–temporal based, Gait based and skeleton tracking techniques based on the source of their techniques, types, description, advantages, and disadvantages. In addition, several performance metrics were used to evaluate the results and compare the resulting study with the previous comparative evaluations. This comparative analysis leads to a deeper understanding of different FD and AM techniques and suggests the possible direction for the researchers to identify a suitable method for their needs.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection for dynamic data sets has been perceived as a very significant hot research problem in data mining. In practice, most real-world data usually are hybrid, which means both include categorical data and numerical data. For dynamic hybrid data, this paper first introduces a new neighborhood relation and information entropy based on neighborhood accordingly. Secondly, the single incremental mechanism and group incremental mechanism are analyzed and proofed to construct feature significance. On this basis, two incremental approaches to feature selection are developed for dealing with hybrid data. To better demonstrate the new algorithm, four common classifiers and twelve UCI data sets are introduced in the experiments. The experimental results further validate the feasibility of the incremental algorithms, and especially the efficiency of the group incremental algorithm.},

This paper studies measures of uncertainty for a 4HIS and its application in attribute reduction. The distance function for each type of attribute in a 4HIS is first provided. Then, this distance is used to produce the tolerance relation induced by a given subsystem in a 4HIS. Next, information structure of this subsystem is proposed in terms of a set vector and dependence between information structures is introduced. Moreover, granulation and entropy measures in a 4HIS are investigated on the basis of information structures. In order to verify the feasibility of the proposed measures, effectiveness analysis is performed from a statistical perspective. Finally, an application of the proposed measures for attribute reduction in a 4HIS is given.},

Thanks to the power of deep CNNs, the reconstruction performance is largely improved. However, the high-frequency information and details in the low-resolution image still can hardly be reconstructed. To deal with the above problems, we propose a multi-scale generative adversarial network in this paper. The multi-scale Pyramid module inside the generator could extract the features containing high-frequency information, and then the high-resolution image with the results of the bicubic interpolations is reconstructed. The discriminator in our model is used to identify the authenticity of the input image after refactoring. Our final loss function includes an adversarial loss and the mean square error (L2) reconstruction loss. In order to further improve the efficiency of training, the generator is pre-trained with the L2 loss, so as to improve the efficiency of the discriminator optimization. Compared with the algorithms based solely on normal plain convolutional networks, the proposed algorithm performs better in two indexes PSNR and SSIM of the super-resolution task.},

We show that reinforcement learning techniques are an alternative approach to solve the given problem over time and are computationally more efficient than sequential DCOP solvers. We also use the novel heuristic to obtain the correct results and describe a formalism that has been adopted to model dynamic DCOPs with cooperative agents. We evaluate this approach in dynamic weapon target assignment (dynamic WTA) problem, via experimental results.

The proposed methodology multi-layer protection with deduplication (MLPD) enhance the security of voice messages by converting voice as an array of numeric values (Matrix) and applying multiple protection layers like (shuffling, transpose, and byte swap) and doing the reverse process in the receiver end with the help of the digital signature metadata file. Meanwhile, sharing the same message over a shared environment is another challenge. The encrypted redundant voice messages may flood the shared environment. The proposed model acknowledges the quality of encryption over voice data. The uniqueness of the proposed work is the performance of deduplication operation over the encrypted messages without any hashing techniques.

ECG recording is collected from millions of cardiac cells and depolarization and re-polarization conducted in a synchronized manner as: the P wave occurs first, followed by the QRS-complex and the T wave, which will repeat in each beat. The signal is altered in a cardiac beat period for different heart conditions. This change can be observed in order to diagnose the patient’s heart status. Simple naked eye diagnosis can mislead the detection. At that point, computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) is therefore required.

The findings of this research and associated studies are without any cumbersome artificial environments. This work investigates the viability of using deep learning-based architectures for heartbeat classification. The DL architecture is used for the proposed project, and the results suggest that it is feasible to use 2D images to train a deep learning architectures for heartbeat classification. The CNN produced the highest overall accuracy of around 99\%. The CAD method proposed has high generalizability; it can help doctors efficiently identify diseases and decrease misdiagnosis.},

A three-parameter hyperbolic function is employed to rigorously examine the obtained q-s curves and to determine the model parameters. Also, the results of some CPT soundings, including the corrected cone tip resistance (qt) and the skin friction (Rf), are adopted to predict the results of plate load tests (PLT). The findings corroborate the high accuracy of the proposed model, the reasonable performance of the hyperbolic function and the use of the Volterra series to predict the q-s curves. Moreover, the obtained curves from the newly developed model are compared to those from other methods in the literature which cross-confirms the efficacy of the current model. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted, and the exclusive effects of all the contributing parameters are assessed among which Rf is shown to be the most influential. Ultimately, simple solutions are adopted to determine various key geotechnical parameters, like the ultimate bearing capacity (qult), the allowable bearing capacity (qa) and the modulus of subgrade reaction (ks).},

Due to the high complexity of this problem, a heuristic algorithm was employed to find an acceptable solution.

  abstract     = {Model-based testing is an automated process in which executable tests are derived from behavioral models of a system. Model checking is a verification technique to reveal errors in which all reachable states of a system can be generated as state space. In the literature, different approaches suggest using model checkers for model-based testing. Model checker explores all possible system states, so utilizing the various paths in the state-space as test cases seems a promising solution. However, these approaches suffer from two main challenges. The first challenge is state space explosion, which prevents generating all reachable states by the model checker. The second one is generating redundant test cases. Recently, several methods using meta-heuristic and evolutionary approaches have been proposed to cope with these problems. Therefore, exploring a portion of state space using an optimization approach to detect the test objectives can be a proper way to manage the state space explosion and generate an optimal test suite with the least redundancy. In this paper, a method is proposed using a Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), and a model checker is as a bed to generate test cases for the service-oriented systems. In the proposed approach, the test suite is a set of paths on the state space starting from an initial state and leading to the state in which all the test objectives are satisfied. In this research, we have implemented BOA with three different structures in GROOVE toolset, an open-source toolset for designing and model checking graph transformation. Experimental results show that our solution generates better results in terms of coverage and speed in different case studies than the existing approaches.},

The kernel idea of CBR is similar in cases having similar solutions. CBR can play its best role only by finding cases that are most similar to new problems through some retrieval methods. Currently, commonly used case retrieval algorithms are basically based on mean operator method. Although the difficulty of calculation is low, the accuracy is limited, and if a certain local similarity is low, the overall result can be affected. We introduce the soft likelihood functions into case retrieval, combine it with KNN, and propose a hybrid retrieval strategy, which is a new and softer way to calculate case similarity. The core of our hybrid retrieval strategy is to aggregate the local similarity and feature similarity of cases by soft likelihood functions, so as to obtain the global similarity. And at the same time, take into account the different attitudinal characteristics of the decision-maker, whether optimistic or pessimistic. The accuracy of this strategy is more than 81 $$\%$$ in simulation experiments on real data sets, which verifies its effectiveness.},

The cloud model is used to unify the mixed uncertain information. Then, we design a two-stage consensus reaching process to realize stable matching.

Among these techniques, a neuro-fuzzy model of ANFIS (adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system) has started to emerge. A conventional ANFIS model cannot deal with the large dimension of a dataset, and cannot work with our dataset, which is composed of a 62 time-series, as well. This study attempts to develop an ensemble model by incorporating neural networks with ANFIS to deal with a large number of input variables for multivariate forecasting. Our proposed approach is a collaboration of two base learners, which are types of the neural network models and a meta-learner of ANFIS in the framework of the stacking ensemble. The results show that the stacking ensemble of ANFIS (meta-learner) and ANN models (base learners) outperforms its stand-alone counterparts of base learners. Numerical results indicate that the proposed ensemble model achieved a MAPE of 7.26\% compared to its single-instance ANN models with MAPEs of 8.50 and 9.18\%, respectively. Finally, this study which is a novel application of the ensemble systems in the context of tourism demand forecasting has shown better results compared to those of the single expert systems based on the artificial neural networks.},

Second, the picture fuzzy Schweizer–Sklar prioritized aggregation operators, namely the picture fuzzy Schweizer–Sklar prioritized weighted average operator and the picture fuzzy Schweizer–Sklar prioritized weighted geometric operator, are developed, and their related properties are investigated as well. Third, an extended picture fuzzy MULTIMOORA method with unknown weight information, which involves the ratio system, the reference point, and the multiplicative form methods simultaneously, is constructed based on the developed aggregation operators. Finally, an illustrative example with public–private–partnership investment project selection is presented to verify the feasibility and validity of the constructed method. The results indicate that the constructed method is effective to realize an optimal decision-making.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, with the development of high-speed railway in China, the operating mileage and passenger transport capacity have increased rapidly in transportation industry. Due to the high density of trains in the daytime, we usually set up skylights at night (0:00–6:00 am) on high-speed railway for comprehensive maintenance. However, this arrangement contradicts with the operation demand of D-series overnight high-speed trains (overnight D-trains for short). In order to adjust the operation plan of overnight D-trains with skylights coordinately, it is necessary to predict the passenger demand of newly added overnight D-trains. Therefore, in this paper, a mixed logit model based on nonlinear random utility functions for different transport modes is proposed, in order to predict transfer passenger demand. According to Maximum Simulated Likelihood Method, the likelihood function of this mixed logit model is proposed to maximize the overall utility value of different passenger groups while Metropolis–Hastings algorithm is adopted to iteratively solve the probabilities of discrete random variables in utility functions. After that, the unknown distributions of parameters are estimated and the optimal solution of this model is provided by traditional algorithms, basic heuristic algorithms and improved heuristic algorithms including improved fireworks-simulated annealing algorithm proposed in this paper, respectively. Finally, a real-world instance with related data of Beijing–Shanghai corridor is implemented to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.},

Experimental results for the width, depth, and height of the weld bead geometry were collected, and the interaction effect of the process parameters on the weld bead geometry was investigated. Three-dimensional finite-element modelling was performed for the AM, and the width, depth, and height of the weld geometry were predicted. The Taguchi method-based graph theory and matrix approach and the utility concept were used to optimise the process parameters for achieving the dimensional accuracy in AM. The optimal working condition was as follows: a torch angle of 60°, a wire feed speed of 6 m/min, and a welding speed of 0.4 m/min. Under the optimal working conditions, the height, width, and depth of the weld bead were 3.910, 7.615, and 2.000 mm, respectively. The optimization was also validated with ANN and a comparison among the ANN, simulation and experimental results revealed good agreement.},

  abstract     = {In the lung computer-aided detection (Lung CAD) system, the region of interest (ROI) of lung nodules has more false positives, making the imbalance between positive and negative (true positive and false positive) samples more likely to lead to misclassification of true positive nodules, a cost-sensitive multikernel learning support vector machine (CS-MKL-SVM) algorithm is proposed. Different penalty coefficients are assigned to positive and negative samples, so that the model can better learn the features of true positive nodules and improve the classification effect. To further improve the detection rate of pulmonary nodules and overall recognition accuracy, a score function named F-new based on the harmonic mean of accuracy (ACC) and sensitivity (SEN) is proposed as a fitness function for subsequent particle swarm optimization (PSO) parameter optimization, and a feasibility analysis of this function is performed. Compared with the fitness function that considers only accuracy or sensitivity, both the detection rate and the recognition accuracy of pulmonary nodules can be improved by this new algorithm. Compared with the grid search algorithm, using PSO for parameter search can reduce the model training time by nearly 20 times and achieve rapid parameter optimization. The maximum F-new obtained on the test set is 0.9357 for the proposed algorithm. When the maximum value of F-new is achieved, the corresponding recognition ACC is 91\%, and SEN is 96.3\%. Compared with the radial basis function in the single kernel, the F-new of the algorithm in this paper is 2.16\% higher, ACC is 1.00\% higher and SEN is equal. Compared with the polynomial kernel function in the single kernel, the F-new of the algorithm is 3.64\% higher, ACC is 1.00\% higher and SEN is 7.41\% higher. The experimental results show that the F-new, ACC and SEN of the proposed algorithm is the best among them, and the results obtained by using multikernel function combined with F-new index are better than the single kernel function. Compared with the MKL-SVM algorithm of grid search, the ACC of the algorithm in this paper is reduced by 1\%, and the results are equal to those of the MKL-SVM algorithm based on PSO only. Compared with the above two algorithms, SEN is increased by 3.71\% and 7.41\%, respectively. Therefore, it can be seen that the cost sensitive method can effectively reduce the missed detection of nodules, and the availability of the new algorithm can be further verified.},

To solve this problem, we formulate it with a mathematical model. Then, we implement a variable neighborhood tabu search algorithm with a tailored solution representation to solve large-scale instances. Dummy satellites time windows are applied in our algorithm to speed up the search. Finally, we generate two benchmark instance sets to analyze the performance of our algorithm. Computational results show that our algorithm can obtain the optimal results for 10 out of 11 small-scale instances and produce promising solutions for 200-customer instances within a few minutes. Additional experiments indicate that the usage of dummy satellite time windows can save 19\% computation time on average.},

Many deep learning models have been developed in the segmentation of medical images. Although segmentation accuracy has been increased, segmentation performance needs to be improved due to the variability of tissue, cell and image acquisition methods. In the deep-learning-based segmentation and classification methods, the parameters of the method should be optimized in order to obtain more successful results for segmentation. In this study, the optimization of the parameters has been performed with five optimization algorithms according to segmentation loss. These algorithms are Grey Wolf Optimizer, Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Black Widow Optimization (BWO). In the experimental studies, each algorithm was run independently ten times and ABC obtained the lowest average segmentation loss with a value of 0.135. However, ABC achieved this performance about seven hours longer than PSO and about 5 h longer than BWO. Since the parameter optimization of CNN-based models takes much more time than other benchmarks, the convergence speed of algorithms is very important. For this reason, it has been observed that PSO is much more successful than other algorithms with an average run time of 9.438 h. As a result, considering the Jaccard similarity coefficient, it was seen that the model performance increased by 8.1\% with the optimization compared to manual parameter selection.},

This article introduces an improved iCSPM algorithm called iCSPM with elite opposition-based learning and multiple mutation methods (iCSPM2). iCSPM2 has three main characteristics. Firstly, it separates candidate solutions into several islands (sub-populations) and then divides the islands among four improved Cuckoo Search algorithms: Cuckoo Search via Lévy flights, Cuckoo Search with highly disruptive polynomial mutation, Cuckoo Search with Jaya mutation and Cuckoo Search with pitch adjustment mutation. Secondly, it uses elite opposition-based learning to improve its convergence rate and exploration ability. Finally, it makes continuous candidate solutions discrete using the smallest position value method. A set of 15 popular benchmark functions indicate iCSPM2 performs better than iCSPM. However, based on sensitivity analysis of both algorithms, convergence behavior seems sensitive to island model parameters. Further, the single-objective IEEE-CEC 2014 functions were used to evaluate and compare the performance of iCSPM2 to four well-known swarm optimization algorithms: distributed grey wolf optimizer, distributed adaptive differential evolution with linear population size reduction evolution, memory-based hybrid dragonfly algorithm and fireworks algorithm with differential mutation. Experimental and statistical results suggest iCSPM2 has better performance than the four other algorithms. iCSPM2’s performance was also shown to be favorable compared to two powerful discrete optimization algorithms (generalized accelerations for insertion-based heuristics and memetic algorithm with novel semi-constructive crossover and mutation operators) using a set of Taillard’s benchmark instances for the permutation flow shop scheduling problem.},

The algorithm is designed for fine-tuning of the controller’s optimal gain for automatic generation control (AGC) in a nonlinear interconnected power system. A thermal generating unit with a reheat turbine, generation rate constant, and governor dead band is included in each area of the power system. A three-degree-of-freedom-proportional integral derivative (3DoF-PID) controller structure is studied while building a proper AGC. The suggested AQCTO method is used to optimize the controller parameters. The performance of the AQCTO-based 3DoF-PID is analyzed separately for step and random load perturbation. AQCTO-based 3DoF-PID controllers are analyzed against AQCTO-based PI, ID, and PID controllers in terms of performance. The 3DoF-PID controller outperforms existing optimization techniques such as biogeography-based optimization, class topper optimization (CTO), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) in terms of integral square error (ISE) by 17\%, 10\%, and 57.67\%, respectively. In addition, an inter-line power flow controller (IPFC) is strategically placed to increase the system’s performance. Based on OPAL-RT, the ideal position of IPFC is also investigated in a real-time environment.

  abstract     = {Learning-based image restoration approaches typically learn to map distorted images to clean images. To remove multiple combined distortions with unknown mixture ratios, most of the existing methods have focused on the development of different deep neural network architectures and novel loss functions. Although these methods have proved their effectiveness on image restoration tasks, they require expensive training data and produce results in a noninterpretable way. In this work, we present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based method to restore the distorted images, which casts an image restoration Problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) where actions are defined as multiple pixel-wise image denoising operations. In our method, each agent possesses a pixel, the agent learns to adjust the corresponding pixel value by determining the proper combination of the actions. We also develop a novel exploration scheme such that similar actions have similar value, thereby avoiding overfitting in state-action value estimation. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method can restore images with multiple combined distortions and our DRL approach performs comparable or better performance against previous learning-based approaches. By visualizing the process of weighting multiple pixel-wise operations, we can identify what combination of operations is employed for each pixel at each stage. We believe our work takes a step toward the explainability and interpretability of learning-based image restoration methods.},

  abstract     = {Since the 1980s, information fusion as an emerging discipline has been rapidly developed in the fields of military surveillance and defense systems, intelligent transportation and environmental monitoring. In this paper, we study the application of multi-data fusion technology to traffic flow in the context of traffic flow information fusion. Firstly, the data sources of smart highways are collected using traffic flow theory and further fused with multiple data sources using the minimum variance weighted average method. Secondly, travelers on smart highways make real-time travel decisions based on the fused information; travelers on ordinary highways select travel routes based on the previous day&#39;s road network traffic conditions and historical travel experience. In this paper, the equivalence, existence and stability conditions of the model solutions are proved using immobility theory. The final simulation results show that: the increase of road traffic behavior coefficients and the increase of perceived time errors lead the model into an unstable state; as far as the stability of the model solution is concerned, risk-averse travelers are significantly better than risk-averse travelers, and the road network formed by the fusion of traffic flows based on multi-source data is more robust. Thus, the accuracy of prediction is improved, and the prediction accuracy of the algorithm proposed in this paper reaches 96\% compared with other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {EEG signals offer qualitative insights during brain disorder analysis and help in the brief assessment of brain diseases. However, EEG signal acquisition is susceptible to noise of various kinds and renders the analysis phase difficult and ill-posed. Hence, an appropriate technique is necessary to reduce the impairment effect caused by the noise on analysis. Wavelet thresholding is one of the most widely used techniques to recover the EEG signals from the noise. However, all the variants of wavelet thresholding algorithms suffer from pseudo-Gibbs phenomenon leading to ringing effect. Wave atom is a novel multiscale–multidirectional transformation technique. However, this wavelet thresholding produces pseudo-Gibbs phenomena, which are visual distortions and oscillations in the area of signal processing. The widely appreciated wave atom transformation too fails from artifacts around the sharp edges. The proposed shift-based cycle spinning technique of wave atom transformation model estimates the thresholding parameter, in an unbiased manner, from the data and de-noises the signal in a translation-invariant manner. De-noising studies on the OpenNeuro EEG dataset indicate the usefulness of the suggested technique. The results are analysed based on the performance measurements SNR and MSE that establish an advantage of shift-based cycle spinning model in getting better results.},

Previously, various types of techniques have been developed by many researchers for this shortest path issue in a networking environment. However, most of them exhibit computational complexity issues when updating their weights for every iteration. Based on this observation, the proposed work plans to solve SPP (Shortest Path Problem) in an undirected network using Fuzzy Dijkstra’s approach based on improved WSM (Weighted Sum Method) with heuristic optimization. Here, the weight updating process of WSM is optimized by Sea Lion Optimization approach in order to improve the working performance of WSM while combining with Fuzzy Dijkstra method. The proposed concept is evaluated in MATLAB, and the performance evaluation is done using time consumption, energy utilization, network lifetime and prediction accuracy by comparing it with Dijkstra, Fuzzy-MPSO and WSDA methods.},

Predictive analytics plays a major role in tackling errors present in the data acquired during the manufacturing process. Data uncertainties are unavoidable; however, they need to be mapped appropriately for the effective implementation of suitable control schemes. In this work, an attempt is made to predict the machinability of α–β titanium alloy during turning operation using three cooling agents such as dry, liquid nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. Interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2FLS) along with centre of sets type reduction is considered to handle uncertainties present during the turning operation. The computational complexity of IT2FLS is overcome by reducing it to type 1 fuzzy logic system using Mendel&#39;s first results. Simulation results of both IT2FLS and T1FLS are compared with semi-elliptic membership function and trapezoidal membership function. The results obtained validate the Mendel&#39;s statement by reflecting similar behaviour in both the fuzzy logic systems. The results also confirm that the predictions of machinability parameters in turning operation using SEMF are a preferred option.},

  abstract     = {It is highly important for governments and health organizations to monitor the prevalence of breast cancer as a leading source of cancer-related death among women. However, the accurate diagnosis of this disease is expensive, especially in developing countries. This article concerns a cost-efficient method for estimating prevalence of breast cancer, when diagnosis is based on a comprehensive biopsy procedure. Multistage ranked set sampling (MSRSS) is utilized to develop a proportion estimator. This design employs imprecise rankings based on some visually assessed cytological covariates, so as to provide the experimenter with a more informative sample. Theoretical properties of the proposed estimator are explored. Evidence from numerical studies is reported. The developed procedure can be substantially more efficient than its competitor in simple random sampling (SRS). In some situations, the proportion estimation in MSRSS needs around 76\% fewer observations than that in SRS, given a precision level. Thus, using MSRSS may lead to a considerable reduction in cost with respect to SRS. In many medical studies, e.g., diagnosing breast cancer based on a full biopsy procedure, exact quantification is difficult (costly and/or time-consuming), but the potential sample units can be ranked fairly accurately without actual measurements. In this setup, multistage ranked set sampling is an appropriate design for developing cost-efficient statistical methods.},

IS-algebras have been studied algebraically and topologically since the 1980s, but a corresponding logic (here denoted $$\mathcal {IS}_{\le }$$ ) has been introduced only very recently. This logic is the departing point of the present study, which we then extend to a wide family of previously unknown logics defined from IS-algebras. We show that $$\mathcal {IS}_{\le }$$ is a conservative expansion of the Belnap-Dunn four-valued logic (i.e., the order-preserving logic of the variety of De Morgan algebras), and we give a finite Hilbert-style axiomatization for it. More generally, we introduce a method for expanding conservatively every super-Belnap logic (i.e., every strengthening of the Belnap-Dunn logic) so as to obtain an extension of $$\mathcal {IS}_{\le }$$ . We show that every logic thus defined can be axiomatized by adding a fixed finite set of multiple-conclusion rule schemata to the corresponding super-Belnap base logic. Our results entail that the lattice of super-Belnap logics (which is known to be uncountable) embeds into the lattice of extensions of $$\mathcal {IS}_{\le }$$ . In fact, as in the super-Belnap case, we establish that the finitary extensions of $$\mathcal {IS}_{\le }$$ are already uncountably many. When the base super-Belnap logic possesses a disjunction, we show that we can reduce the multiple-conclusion calculus to a traditional one; some of the multiple-conclusion axiomatizations so introduced are analytic and are thus of independent interest from a proof-theoretic standpoint. We also consider a few extensions of $$\mathcal {IS}_{\le }$$ that cannot be obtained in the above-described way, but can nevertheless be axiomatized finitely by other methods.},

  abstract     = {Throughout the past decades, network dismantling gained an increasing interest by the research community, given tremendous importance of robust socio-technical systems. The problem of optimally dismantling a given network is provably NP-hard. Accordingly, existing studies on network dismantling resort to various heuristics, including the use of node centralities and finely tuned decycling and cutting techniques. However, it is known that these existing techniques largely lack the optimal baseline. Particularly, these techniques perform bad when compared to (expensive-to-compute) betweenness-based attacks. Therefore, there is a strong need for developing scalable, yet accurate attacking methods for being able to understand the robustness of large, real-world complex systems. In this study, we propose a novel network attack technique based on genetic algorithms. In order to develop a scalable framework, we first design an exact method for measuring the effectiveness of an attack, requiring O(|E|) time, where |E| is the number of edges in the network. Since this algorithm runs in linear time of the network size, it can scale up well for very large networks. Second, we develop and analyze a collection of genetic population constructors, which aim at providing a rich set of initial genetic material to the framework. Several genetic operators are proposed, which preferably select previously critical nodes to be attacked first. Finally, we evaluate our framework on a wide range of real-world networks. Results show that our novel technique significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, providing an interesting sweet spot between attack quality and computational complexity. We believe that our work contributes toward the scalable robustness estimation of complex networks, and that the perspective of using non-deterministic methods will inspire future research in this domain.},

We divide a policy set into different clusters, distinguish different rules based on their own features and label them for the training of neural networks by using the K-means algorithm and an asynchronous SGDK-means algorithm. Then, we utilize neural networks to search for the applicable rule. A quantitative neural network is introduced to reduce a server’s computational cost. By simulating the arrival of requests, XDNNEngine is compared with the Sun PDP, XEngine and SBA-XACML. Experimental results show that 1) if the number of requests reaches 10,000, the evaluation time of XDNNEngine on the large-scale policy set with 10,000 rules is approximately 2.5 ms, and 2) in the same condition as 1), the evaluation time of XDNNEngine is reduced by 98.27\%, 90.36\% and 84.69\%, respectively, over that of the Sun PDP, XEngine and SBA-XACML.},

  abstract     = {Sentiment analysis or opinion mining has an extensive area in the field of research. Today we consider the huge amount of structured and unstructured data available in the web for a particular subject to get an opinion. The surplus data handling termed as big data requires some new technology to deal with. This paper considers the requirement of sentiment analysis of such huge data for fast processing. Based on fast Fourier transform on temporal intuitionistic fuzzy set generated from text, this algorithm (FFT–TIFS) expedites the sentiment classification. Fourier analysis converts a signal from its time domain to its representation in frequency domain. Such frequency domain algorithm on temporal intuitionistic fuzzy set is used in sentiment analysis for the first time. This algorithm is useful for short Twitter text, document-level as well as sentence-level binary sentiment classification. It is tested on aclImdb, Polarity, MR, Sentiment 140 and CR dataset which gives an average of 80\% accuracy. The proposed method shows significant improvement in required time complexity where the method achieves 17 times faster processing in comparison with sequential fuzzy C-means (FCM) method, and again, it is at least 7 times faster than distributed FCM method present in the literature. The method presented in this paper has a novel approach towards fastest processing time and suitability of various sizes of the text sentiment analysis.},

This paper provides the criteria for evaluating a handball goalkeeper and applies a variety of soft-computing methodologies for estimating their weights. More specifically, a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making method, a metaheuristic optimisation algorithm, and statistical and domain-knowledge-based methods were used to evaluate the actions of goalkeepers during the game. Computer experiments were performed for all the proposed methodologies, using data from the 2020 European Men’s Handball Championship, in order to estimate the weights of the indicators. Then, these weights were used to identify the best goalkeeper and identify and rank the top five goalkeepers as determined by the tournament organisers. The results obtained show that using the metaheuristic-based method is extremely helpful in quantifying the expert assessments, which are often challenging to express in a disaggregated form. The other two techniques offer a less optimal but more easily interpretable result for coaches and fans.},

This paper proposes a novel brain emotional neural network to support addressing such challenges. The proposed network integrates a wavelet neural network into a conventional brain emotional learning network. This is further enhanced by the introduction of a recurrent structure to employ the two networks as the two channels of the brain emotional learning network. The proposed network therefore combines the advantages of the wavelet function, the recurrent mechanism, and the brain emotional learning system, for optimal performance on nonlinear problems under uncertain environments. The proposed network works with a bounding compensator to mimic an ideal controller, and the parameters are updated based on the laws derived from the Lyapunov stability analysis theory. The proposed system was applied to two uncertain nonlinear systems, including a Duffing-Homes chaotic system and a simulated 3-DOF spherical joint robot. The experiments demonstrated that the proposed system outperformed other popular neural-network-based control systems, indicating the superiority of the proposed system.},

This study aims to develop a Pythagorean fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making approach to deal with decision-making problem under uncertainty circumstance. Firstly, the concept, representation and related properties of Spearman rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) originated from statistical theory between two PFSs are introduced, which is used to measure the closeness degree between ideal alternative and each alternative. Then, a multi-criteria decision-making approach with Pythagorean fuzzy environment is developed based on the proposed SRCC. Finally, to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method, a real-world infrastructure project decision-making was demonstrated.

However, these will go up their extra costs. Meanwhile, for a green manufacturer who sells the green product through the online channel and the offline channel, the expression of its market demand needs to rethink in the new environment. In these conditions, for a dual-channel green supply chain (hereafter, DGSC), chain members pay more attention on the pricing problems considering the inputs of CBDI and greening R&amp;D. Hence, to resolve this question, a DGSC a green manufacturer selling by the online channel and with one retailer selling by the offline channel was chosen. Afterward, the demand function of the DGSC was revised, and we analyzed the profits models and its pricing rules in the proposed four common cost-sharing models. Results indicate that whether the retailer bears the CBDI costs or the greening R&amp;D costs, the retailer will not change its retail price. If the retailer can bear some CBDI costs, the alteration tendencies of the best wholesale price are related to the cost-sharing parameter.},

In obtaining performance scores of the banks at the financial ratios the rationing process is used. In the applied rationing process, three different thresholds (quartiles: Q1, Q2, and Q3) are determined for each financial ratio. In the paper, the results of the proposed hybrid model are compared with the results of the AHP approach to determine its advantages over the usage of the AHP approach alone.

A comprehensive analysis of objective reduction approach is carried out with existing multi-objective methods on many-objective DTLZ and WFG test suite which highlight the superiority of proposed technique. Further, the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on satellite images to detect cloudy region against various types of earth’s surfaces. The performance of the proposed approach is compared against existing benchmark many-objective algorithm, NSGA-III in order to evaluate the potential of proposed method in clustering application.

We aim to determine a fair share of profit or loss of a movie for each of its actors based on their performance and efficiency on the success or failure of the project. One of the Iranian latest movies is considered as a case study, and its lead actor’s wage is determined under this contract. The sentiment analysis technique investigated the viewers’ opinions about the movie and the actor’s performance. Since the reviewers mainly are the people who have no expertise in cinematography, they cannot discern the influence of other participants on the actor’s performance. So the proposed method used experts’ opinions through the fuzzy DEMATEL method to consider the overlapping effect besides enhancing the validity of the reviewers’ opinions. The results of this paper assert that the actor’s performance will improve under the proposed method and therefore the movie will be more successful and profitable.},

  abstract     = {This article deals with automatic generation control (AGC) of a three-area power system having five diversified sources of generation like thermal unit, hydro unit, wind unit, diesel unit and a gas unit are interconnected together. Area-1 of the power system consists of a thermal, a hydro and a wind unit, area-2 has a thermal, a hydro and a diesel unit and area-3 consists of a thermal, a hydro and a gas unit. To make system more realistic different nonlinear components like governor dead band (GDB), generation rate constraint (GRC), boiler dynamics and communication delay are taken into account. A novel two-degree of freedom fractional order PID with derivative filter and fractional order PD with derivative filter (2-DOF-FOPIDN-FOPDN) cascaded control strategy is adopted to improve the dynamic performance of the power system. The results obtained with the proposed cascaded controller are compared with that of PID, FOPID and 2-DOF-PIDN-PDN cascaded controller to prove its superiority. To enumerate the gains of different controllers optimally, a recently developed bio-inspired optimisation algorithm named selfish herd optimisation (SHO) is capitalised. Further, the work is extended by taking a two-area hydro-thermal system to compare the result of the SHO tuned PID controller with that of modern hybrid firefly algorithm-pattern search (hFA-PS) technique. Transient analysis is carried out by applying a sudden load disturbance of 0.01 p.u in area-1 and the robustness of the controller is examined by varying both system parameters and applying a randomly varying load in area-1. From the investigation it is concluded that the 2-DOF-FOPIDN-FOPDN controller gives a flawless and a distinct performance.},

  abstract     = {Dimensionality reduction (DR) is an effective preprocessing step in hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis. A particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based unsupervised DR method is proposed in the present paper where spectral divergence as well as spatial gradient information is used in selecting informative bands. In general, HSI is negatively affected by low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Hence, in the proposed method, a noise filter is applied to minimize the effect of noise in band selection. Clustering is introduced to reduce spatial redundancy and extract distinct patterns from the data. This enables improvement in the computation performance of each iteration in PSO. The proposed method is applied on two standard datasets, and the performance is evaluated using overall classification accuracy. Finally, results are compared with other recent state-of-the-art methods where the proposed method performed reasonably better than other tested methods in terms of consistency and classification accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Design strategies of model architecture greatly affect the performance of tasks for multimodal classification. Neural network architectures in traditional models are designed manually, depending on human understanding for specific tasks, and generalization capability is limited. This paper mainly discusses exploring the optimal architecture for multimodal fusion using Neural Architecture Search. Neural architecture search relies on a controller to generate better architectures and predict the accuracy of given architectures. However, the controller evaluation for architectures is very time-consuming. We discuss a semi-supervised strategy for architectures evaluation to reduce the search time complexity; however, the performance degradation for the predictor is caused. A method for relational-graphic-predictive NAS (RGNAS) is therefore presented to compensate the insufficiency of labeled architectures for improving the accuracy of the predictor. RGNAS leverages the intrinsic relationship between labeled architectures and abundant unlabeled architectures to compensate the insufficiency of labeled architectures. A reasonable trade-off between accuracy and the search time complexity is achieved. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on different multimodal datasets (eNTERFACE05, AFEW9.0 and MM-IMDb). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state of the arts and achieves better robustness and generalization performance.},

  abstract     = {Multi-label feature selection attracts considerable attention from multi-label learning. Information theory-based multi-label feature selection methods intend to select the most informative features and reduce the uncertain amount of information of labels. Previous methods regard the uncertain amount of information of labels as constant. In fact, as the classification information of the label set is captured by features, the remaining uncertainty of each label is changing dynamically. In this paper, we categorize labels into two groups: One contains the labels with few remaining uncertainty, which means that most of classification information with respect to the labels has been obtained by the already-selected features; another group contains the labels with extensive remaining uncertainty, which means that the classification information of these labels is neglected by already-selected features. Feature selection aims to select the new features that are highly relevant to the labels in the second group. Existing methods do not distinguish the difference between two label groups and ignore the dynamic change amount of information of labels. To this end, a Relevancy Ratio is designed to clarify the dynamic change amount of information of each label under the condition of the already-selected features. Afterward, a Weighted Feature Relevancy is defined to evaluate the candidate features. Finally, a new multi-label feature selection method based on Weighted Feature Relevancy (WFRFS) is proposed. The experiments obtain encouraging results of WFRFS in comparison with six multi-label feature selection methods on thirteen real-world data sets.},

  abstract     = {The era of big data has arrived, making it impossible for traditional machine learning algorithms to perform training in a stand-alone computing environment. In this paper, we propose a method for imbalanced binary classification of large-scale datasets based on undersampling and ensemble. More specifically, our method first adaptively partitions the majority class big data into k clusters, followed by undersampling to create k balanced datasets. Subsequently, k base classifiers are trained on each balanced dataset and are combined to perform the final prediction. Existing undersampling methods randomly select a subset of the majority class; thus, important instances may be lost during the process. In contrast, our proposed fuzzy data reduction scheme selects informative instances from each cluster, preventing information loss. Traditional ensemble methods have negative correlations between the base classifiers, whereas our proposed classifier fusion scheme fuses the base classifiers using fuzzy integral to facilitate modeling the relations between the base classifiers. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on six imbalanced large data sets and compared with state-of-the-art undersampling and ensemble methods, including the synthetic minority oversampling technique bagging (SMOTE-Bagging), SMOTE-Boost, and Binary Ensemble Classification for Imbalanced big data based on MapReduce and Upper sampling (BECIMU). Quantitative evaluations and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the three state-of-the-art methods by 1.47\%, 2.00\% and 2.03\%, and by 3.15\%, 2.15\% and 2.52\%, in terms of the average G-mean and AUC-area, respectively.},

Each approach has its own benefits over the others. The main objective of this paper is to design an efficient image encryption approach. Initially, various image encryption approaches have been studied. It is found that the majority of the existing image encryption approaches suffer from the hyperparameters tuning problem. Also, it is desirable to develop secret keys which are highly sensitive to plain images. Therefore, in this paper, an improved seven-dimensional hyperchaotic system (i7DHS) is adopted to generate secret keys. But, i7DHS is sensitive to its initial parameters. Therefore, a dual local search-based evolutionary algorithm (DEA) is utilized to tune the initial parameters of i7DHS. The computed optimal keys are utilized to encrypt the input images. Performance analysis shows that DEA-based i7DHS outperforms the competitive approaches. DEA-based i7DHS is highly sensitive to the input images and has large secret key space. It is found that DEA-based i7DHS can resist various security attacks.},

The first and more well-known, Nelson paraconsistent logic, results from dropping the explosion axiom of Nelson logic; a more recent series of papers considers the logic (dubbed quasi-Nelson logic) obtained by rejecting the double negation law, which is thus also weaker than intuitionistic logic. The algebraic counterparts of these logical calculi are the varieties of N4-lattices and quasi-Nelson algebras, respectively. In the present paper we propose the class of quasi-N4-lattices as a common generalization of both. We show that a number of key results, including the twist-structure representation of N4-lattices and quasi-Nelson algebras, can be uniformly established in this more general setting; our new representation employs twist-structures defined over Brouwerian algebras enriched with a nucleus operator. We further show that quasi-N4-lattices form a variety that is arithmetical, possesses a ternary as well as a quaternary deductive term, and enjoys EDPC and the strong congruence extension property.},

By integrating these coverings into a single covering, covering rough set-based feature selection finds valuable features from a mixed decision system with symbolic, real-valued, missing-valued and set-valued features. Existing approaches to covering rough set-based feature selection, however, are intractable to handle large mixed data. Therefore, an efficient strategy of incremental feature selection is proposed by presenting a mixed data set in sample subsets one after another. Once a new sample subset comes in, the relative discernible relation of each feature is updated to disclose incremental feature selection scheme that decides the strategies of increasing informative features and removing redundant features. The incremental scheme is applied to establish two incremental feature selection algorithms from large or dynamic mixed data sets. The first algorithm updates the feature subset upon the sequent arrival of sample subsets and returns the reduct when no further sample subsets are obtained. The second one merely updates the relative discernible relations and finds the reduct when no subsets are obtained. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the two proposed incremental algorithms, especially the second one speeds up covering rough set-based feature selection without sacrificing too much classification performance.},

  abstract     = {In the present paper, we introduce the idea of deferred statistical convergence of order $$\beta $$ using fractional difference operator $$\Delta ^{a,b,c}$$ for the sequence of fuzzy numbers. Some results on limits of deferred statistical convergence of order $$\beta $$ of difference fuzzy sequences have been established. Also, certain relations between this convergence and the strongly deferred-summability for the fractional difference sequences of fuzzy numbers have been discussed. As an application, we apply the idea of newly defined statistical convergence for proving fuzzy Korovkin-type approximation theorem, which allows us to approximate various fuzzy positive linear operators. Finally, for more clarifications, we provide an example involving fuzzy-type Bernstein operator in support of the applications of our work.},

  abstract     = {Identifying the defects in apples is commonly done with visual examination techniques. However, it is a slow and laborious process. Image processing techniques have begun to be used to help and make the diagnosis of fruit diseases more efficient. In image processing systems, the segmentation of regions in the scenes is a crucial step. Specifically for images from apples, disease segmentation is a complicated task due to the different elements that affect the acquisition of the images. In addition, apple diseases also have features that need to be segmented. In this work, an efficient approach that uses the Gaining-sharing Knowledge-based (GSK) algorithm is proposed to optimize the minimum cross-entropy thresholding (MCET) for the segmentation of apple images highlighting the diseases defects. The proposed MCET-GSK has been tested for experimental purposes over different images and compared with various metaheuristics. The experiments were conducted to provide evidence of the GSK’s optimization capabilities by performing the Wilcoxon test and applying a set of metrics to verify the quality of the segmented images. The experimental results validate the performance of the MCET-GSK in the segmentation of apple images by adequately separating the regions with damage produced by a disease. The quality of the segmentation is superior compared with other similar approaches.},

  abstract     = {Establishing a healthy lifestyle has become a very important aspect in people’s lives. The latter requires maintaining a healthy nutrition by considering the nature and quantity of foods being consumed, allowing to regulate one’s intake and consumption of calories and nutrients. As a result, people reach out for nutrition experts which services are costly, time-consuming, and not readily available. While various e-solutions have been developed to perform meal planning, yet most of them lack a completely automated process and require domain expert intervention at different stages of the recommendation process (e.g., identifying macronutrient distribution, providing pre-defined meal plans, or combining recommended foods into meal structures). In addition, most solutions focus on fulfilling the patients’ nutrition requirements (in terms of caloric intake and macronutrients) while disregarding other relevant factors such as patient food preferences, food variety, food-meal compatibility, and inter-food compatibility. Hence, there is a need for an automated solution to produce a full-fledged meal plan from scratch, based on a recommended caloric intake and considering multiple factors. In this study, we introduce a novel solution titled MPG for automated Meal Plan Generation recommendations, designed based on an adaptation of the transportation optimization problem to simulate the “human thought process” involved in generating daily meal plans. MPG allows to: (i) generate plans which fulfill a recommended caloric intake, given a set of available foods, while (ii) personalizing the plans following patient chosen factors (e.g., food preferences, variety, and compatibility), and (iii) evaluating the relevance of the produced plans following patient preferences. We have conducted various experiments involving 9 human testers and 124 meal plans to test the performance of MPG. Results highlight MPG’s effectiveness in producing “healthy” and personalized meal plans while complying with the testers’ preferences.},

  abstract     = {In fuzzy mathematical programming literature, most of the transformation approaches were mainly focused on integer linear programs (ILPs) with fuzzy parameters/variables. However, ILP-based solution approaches may be inadequate for solving large-scaled combinatorial fuzzy optimization problems, like project scheduling under mixed fuzzy-stochastic environments. Moreover, many real-life project scheduling applications may contain different types of uncertainties such as fuzziness, stochasticity, and dynamism simultaneously. Based on these motivations, this paper presents a novel constraint programming (CP)-based transformation approach for solving a multi-objective and multi-mode, fuzzy-stochastic resource investment project scheduling problem (FS-MRIPSP) which is a well-known NP-complete problem. In fact, the proposed approach mainly depends on a bound and decomposition principle which divides fuzzy components of the problem into the crisp middle, lower, and upper level problems. Thus, it reduces the problem dimension and does not need to use any standard fuzzy arithmetic and ranking operations directly. Furthermore, the stochastic nature of the problem is also taken into account by using a multi-scenario-based stochastic programming technique. Finally, a weighted additive fuzzy goal program is embedded into the proposed CP-based transformation approach to produce compromise fuzzy project schedules that trade-off between expected values of project makespan and total resource usage costs. To show the validity and practicality of the proposed approach, a real-life application is presented for the production-and-operations management module implementation process of an international Enterprise Resource Planning software company. The fuzzy-stochastic project schedules generated by the proposed CP-based approach are also compared to the results of a similar ILP-based method. Computational results have shown that the CP-based approach outperforms the ILP-based method in terms of both solution quality and computational time.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) is defined as the process of selecting a criterion function for evaluating a feature subset and a search strategy for finding the best feature subset from a large number of feature subsets. Many strategies have been established to date, most of which are based on statistical theory; nevertheless, research is currently ongoing to find better solutions in terms of optimality and computing ease. In FS, where most other methods require supplemental knowledge, the rough set ideology of using only the available data and no further information offers several advantages. The key drawback is that the rough set-based feature selection does not function well on data that are real-valued or noisy (continuous datasets). To overcome this problem, we propose three algorithms based on particle swarm optimization with fuzzy rough fitness function for getting optimal feature subset from a feature set with a large number of features (i.e. continuous or discrete datasets). The suggested algorithms are compared against two classical feature selection methods, as well as three PSO and rough set-based feature selection approaches. Seven commonly used discrete datasets with a modest number of features and eight continuous datasets with a large number of features were utilized in the experiments. Two classification techniques (decision tree or DT and Naive Bays or NB) are used to evaluate the classification performance of selected feature subsets. The results show that using the proposed techniques, a small feature subset may be automatically selected with better classification accuracy than utilizing all features. In terms of classification accuracy and amount of features, the suggested algorithms beat the two traditional and three PSO and rough sets-based feature selection approaches. There is also a significant reduction in the number of features with higher weight on the rapid reduct of the fitness function, as well as improved classification accuracy.},

In addition to pledging to adapt to and mitigate climate change, experts, economists, and policymakers expressed their determination to do so. Green growth and sustainable development have become the focus of policymakers and governments. The progress toward green economic efficiency (GEE), which will benefit the economy, society, and environment, continues. In terms of green growth and development, implementing environmental regulations and policies has been one of the most challenging aspects of the process. China, the world&#39;s second-largest economy, has begun its journey to GEE. Nonetheless, the green economy faces many challenges. The objective of the study is to use AHP analysis to analyze environmental regulation and GEE in China. Accordingly, the study identified three alternative approaches to achieve GEE by analyzing four criteria and ten sub-criteria in the context of environmental regulations in China. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) has been used to rank criteria, sub-criteria, and alternative approaches. According to the model, China&#39;s best path to GEE is through resource efficiency and green purchasing strategies.

  abstract     = {The q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFS) is a generalized orthopair fuzzy set which quantifies vague information comprehensively. The objective of this paper was to develop some novel Muirhead mean (MM) operators for any orthopair fuzzy numbers using Hamacher t-norm and t-conorm inspired arithmetic operations. The benefit of using Hamacher t-norm and t-conorm based arithmetic operations with MM operator is that their combination can consider not only the interrelationship among the multiple attributes but also provides flexibility in aggregation process due to additional parameters involved. Also, MM has prominent characteristics of being generalization of some well-known aggregation operators such as arithmetic mean (AM), geometric mean (GM), Bonferroni mean (BM), and Maclaurin symmetric mean (MSM). So, this paper develops MM operators based on Hamacher operations under q-rung orthopair fuzzy environment, i.e., q-rung orthopair fuzzy Hamacher Muirhead mean (q-ROFHMM) and q-rung orthopair fuzzy Hamacher weighted Muirhead mean (q-ROFHWMM) operators with some of their desirable properties. Paper also provide some special cases of these operators. Further, a multiple attribute decision making (MADM) method based on the proposed q-ROFHWMM operator has been developed. Finally, by utilizing this developed approach, a real-world MADM problem related to the selection of enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is discussed to illustrate the effectiveness of proposed operators},

Aiming at this situation, we propose an expert clustering and information fusion method. First, criteria weights of experts are derived through an optimization model based on the minimization of the deviation between double information. Then, a double clustering method combining the similarity degrees of experts’ fuzzy preference relations and of their criteria weights is proposed to classify the large-scale experts into several clusters. Meanwhile, a clustering validity index is put forward to objectively determine the clustering threshold to ensure its rationality. Third, targeting to guarantee high consistency and consensus of the final selected alternative, an optimization model is constructed to fuse the double information of clusters to obtain the collective comprehensive information. Finally, a case study and comparisons are performed to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The comparison results suggest that the heterogeneity of experts about criteria weights is important in LGDM, the clustering results are more rational when combining the similarities of the fuzzy preference relations and the criteria weights, and the consistency and consensus indexes of the fusion result are greater with the proposed optimization model.},

From one side, they are characterized by rational features defining the utility of each alternative. From the other side, the choice is affected by emotions labeling the alternatives as attractive or repulsive, pleasant or unpleasant. A decision maker needs to make a choice taking into account both these features, the utility of alternatives and their attractiveness. The notion of utility is based on rational grounds, while the notion of attractiveness is vague and rather is based on irrational feelings. A general method, allowing for the quantification of the choice combining rational and emotional features, is described. Despite that emotions seem to avoid precise quantification, their quantitative evaluation is possible at the aggregate level. The analysis of a series of empirical data demonstrates the efficiency of the approach, including the realistic behavioral problems that cannot be treated by the standard expected utility theory.},

Although the information volume of the probability distribution can be calculated by Shannon entropy, how to calculate the information of the mass function is still being explored. Recently, the concept of extropy was proposed by Lad et al. Based on extropy, the information volume of mass function is proposed in this paper. For a basic probability assignment function (BPA), if the focal elements of the frame of discernment (FOD) are all single elements, the information volume proposed in this paper is equal to the corresponding extropy. Otherwise, the information volume is greater than the corresponding extropy. Besides, when the cardinality of the FOD is identical, both the total uncertainty case and the mass function distribution of the maximum extropy have the same information volume. More precisely, the distribution of the latter can be regarded as the former obtained by decomposing the BPA once. Finally, the experiment proves that the maximum information volume increases with the increase in the cardinality of the FOD, and has the same limit value log $$_2e$$ as the maximum extropy. Some numerical examples are given to prove the nature of the information volume.},

In such data analyses, composite models, which are built by piecing together two or more weighted distributions at specified threshold(s), are alternative models. When data contain covariate information, composite regression models can be used. In the existing literature, there is not much work done on this topic. The only study is Gan and Valdez (N Am Actuar J 22(4):554–573, 2018) paper. In this study, a novel Lognormal-Pareto type II composite regression model is proposed. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is performed to obtain model parameters of the proposed model. The proposed model is applied to model monthly consumption expenditure and affecting factors. The data is obtained from the National Household Budget Survey, which is conducted annually by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat). Since the sampling design of the Household Budget Survey is stratified two-stage cluster sampling, the parameters are estimated under weighted data by updating the proposed model and PSO. Additionally, the proposed regression model performance is compared with Lognormal, Lomax, Gamma, and Gamma–Pareto type II regression models. The results demonstrate that the proposed model provides an improved fit to data.},

  abstract     = {The methodology of managing hesitancy situations is improving step by step with new basics and tools which have their specific characteristics. As a rule, aggregation operators can undoubtedly deal with the data in a definite way. Employing hesitant intuitionistic fuzzy linguistic term sets (HIFLTSs), the adaptability in creating assessment data under uncertainty can be accomplished to a bigger degree than either intuitionistic linguistic sets or hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets do. In this view, this paper provides a multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) method based on new aggregation operators for HIFLTSs and the proposed modified VIKOR method. Besides, some operational laws for HIFLTSs are studied with their important properties, which is followed by the definitions of some aggregation operators, including the hesitant intuitionistic fuzzy linguistic weighted averaging (HIFLWA) operator and the hesitant intuitionistic fuzzy linguistic weighted geometric (HIFLWG) operator. The hesitant intuitionistic fuzzy linguistic individual regret (HIFLIR) measure and hesitant intuitionistic fuzzy linguistic compromise (HIFLC) measure are established with the help of hesitant intuitionistic fuzzy group utility measure. After that, by using the proposed aggregation operators, we develop a modified VIKOR method in the context of HIFLTSs. The outcome of this research is ranking and selecting of best alternative with the help of modified VIKOR method based on aggregation operators for HIFLTSs. A numerical problem is provided to verify the proposed approach, and its accuracy and effectiveness have been demonstrated through the comparative analysis of the modified VIKOR method with the TOPSIS method for the selection of the best alternative. This research study showed that the proposed approach can describe the fuzziness and uncertainty of experts more relevantly and the ranking results calculated with the modified VIKOR method are effective and reliable.},

  abstract     = {Heart disease is the most life-threatening disease globally, affecting human life very critically. On-time and precise diagnosis of heart disease is vital for the prevention and treatment of heart failure. In the earlier stage, several detection techniques were developed to detect heart disease using machine learning techniques. But the heart problems have not been detected accurately with the minimum required time. This paper presented an effective heart disease prediction system that accurately diagnoses abnormality within a short duration. The feature selection process is carried with stochastic gradient boosting with a recursive feature elimination approach. For classification, the features are clustered by using the adaptive Harris hawk optimization clustering approach. Based on clustered features, the classification is processed with an enhanced deep genetic algorithm. This method improves the performance of the deep neural network by augmenting its initial weights with an enhanced genetic algorithm, which recommends better weights for the neural network. The demonstration of the proposed work is simulated in the MATLAB platform and the dataset used in UCI machine learning repository. The experimental outcome shows that the developed feature selection and classification approach attain 98.36\% and 97.3\% accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art techniques.},

  abstract     = {Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) is an effective and ecofriendly alternative for the oil extraction from natural products. However, its large-scale operation requires lots of resources like money, time and efforts. In this regard, it is always advantageous to get a prior idea about the process scale up and its optimization, which can be achieved through process modeling. In the present study, two statistical models; artificial neural network (ANN) and central composite design (CCD) are studied for SFE of hemp and papaya seeds. Hemp seed oil (HSO) and papaya seed oil (PSO) are rich in nutrition and have various health benefits, but not much studied. Studies on papaya seed extraction are almost negligible. Therefore, CCD and ANN modeling are investigated to predict and optimize the response of the SFE process for HSO and PSO. In CCD, face-centered and rotatable design is adopted. For ANN, feed-forward back propagation (FFBP) with multilayer perceptron networks is applied using Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm. The accuracy of the developed models is investigated through statistical parameters like average absolute relative deviation, mean square error, and correlation coefficient, R2. The most optimized FFBP-ANN model is obtained for [5 8 1] neurons configuration for HSO and PSO. Quadratic models, developed through CCD, exhibit good agreement with experimental data. In comparison, CCD modeling is observed to be slightly better at the prediction of experimental data as compared to ANN modeling. Effect of operating variables is investigated on the extraction yield of HSO and PSO, obtained through SFE and predicted through ANN and CCD.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer is one of the common reasons for deaths of women over the globe. It has been found that a Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system can be designed using X-ray mammograms for early-stage detection of breast cancer, which can decrease the death rate to a large extent. This paper work proposes a novel 2-way threshold-based intelligent water drops IWD “algorithm for feature selection to design an effective and efficient CAD system that can detect breast cancer in early stage. This approach first extracts the local binary patterns in wavelet domain from mammograms and then applies our introduced 2-way threshold-based IWD algorithm to extract most important subset of features from the extracted features set. Two-way thresholding is a technique to find a lower bound and an upper bound on the number of features to be selected in the optimal subset. So, using these threshold values, IWD is capable of producing multiple optimal subsets of features rather than producing a single optimal subset of features. The best subset among the above subsets is then used to train and deploy support vector machine (SVM) to classify new mammograms. The results have shown that the proposed model outperforms many of the existing CAD systems. Further we have compared our introduced feature selection technique with other meta-heuristic features selection techniques such as ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, genetic algorithm, gravitational search algorithm, inclined planes optimization and gray wolf optimization algorithm and found that it outperforms the other feature selection techniques. The accuracy, precision, recall, specificity and F1-score of our proposed framework are measured on MIAS dataset as 99\%, 98.7\%, 98.123\%, 96.2\% and 98.4\%, respectively, and on DDSM dataset as 97.89\%, 96.9\%, 96.4\%, 94.8\% and 96.2\%.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces two novel lightweight algorithms based on a single non-uniform mutation (SNUM) operator: a single solution algorithm and a SNUM-based compact Genetic Algorithm. The first algorithm, called also SNUM with reference to the operator, performs the search by an iterative process that perturbs one design variable selected randomly from a single solution. The latter, called compact SNUM (cSNUM), incorporates the SNUM mechanism into the compact Genetic Algorithm scheme, that replaces a population of solutions with a probabilistic model. Both approaches are characterised by a purposely simple and highly generic algorithmic structure. These two attractive features make it possible to readily employ the core part of each algorithm and combine it with other techniques for extended complexity. The results obtained from applying the two proposed algorithms on the BBOB and CEC-2017 benchmarks reveal that the use of SNUM is largely beneficial. Not only the two algorithms (in particular cSNUM) are able to deal with separable functions, especially when the problem dimensionality increases, but they also prove to be competitive on other classes of functions, displaying very good performances compared to other methods from the literature, also on non-separable functions},

For this aim, a multi-objective nonlinear formulation is proposed and its linearized version is also presented. Since, according to the literature, the U-shaped assembly line balancing problem with equipment requirements is an NP-hard problem, the problem of this study is NP-hard too. Because of this complexity, the classical algorithms like simulated annealing, variable neighborhood search, and classical genetic algorithm with a novel encoding/decoding scheme are used as solution approaches. As an extension, two hybrid versions of the proposed classical algorithms are proposed according to the characteristics of the problem. In order to evaluate the proposed meta-heuristics, because the problem is new, some test problems are generated randomly. Computational study of the paper, including sensitivity analysis of the proposed meta-heuristics and final experiments on the test problems, proves the superiority of the hybrid versions of the classical algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Label-specific features learning is a multi-label learning framework that utilizes label feature extraction to solve a single example where multiple class labels exist simultaneously. As an essential multi-label learning method, label correlation learning has been widely used in multi-label classification learning. However, in the existing label-specific features learning, the label correlation measurement often assumes that the label correlations are a global structure or that the label correlations only have a local smoothness. In actual application scenarios, the two situations may occur together. This paper proposes a multi-label classification method by joint Label-Specific features and Global and Local label correlation learning, named LSGL. Firstly, we obtain the weight of the label-specific features of each class label utilizing the $$l_1$$ -norm and then learn high-order global label correlation and label local smoothness. By adding manifold regularization terms, we fully utilize the structural relationship between features and labels and mine global and local label association information. These processes are carried out in a unified optimization model, and each part learns and promotes each other. Finally, in the low-dimensional label-specific features representation learning is to carry out multi-label classification learning through the support vector machine and the extreme learning machine, respectively. A comparative study with state-of-the-art approaches and statistical hypothesis testing manifests the validity of the LSGL method and the features learned from label-specific features learning.},

Here proposed a novel approach to improve the generation of Chinese stories in artificial intelligence, in order that it can effectively control the part-of-speech structure in sentence generation to imitate the writer’s writing style. The main proposal consists of three parts. First, the pre-processing of the sentence discards the input as the summary and the output as the text. It uses the format containing      for processing and the detailed method is defined in session 4. The second part is for vectorization. Traditional vectorization methods include Word2vec, Fasttext, LexVec and Glove; the different vectorization methods can help data semantic or grammatical understanding. Combining different vectorization methods improves the information of the input data. Therefore, this paper proposes the multi-channel word embedding and the details defined in session 5. The last part contains the optimization of the model architecture and how to control the process of sentence generation effectively. It also rewrites the Bert model proposed by Google to be the proposed model architecture. In addition, the Softmax function had been optimizing to reduce the search time during training and increase the training speed in the model. To make the model have better performance, the necessary training of the generative adversarial network was carried out, and the GAN architecture was revised for the data set, and the detail is defined in session 6. After the model is trained, to effectively control the structure of the generated sentence. This paper proposes a complete generation flowchart. In the process, based on the concept of FP-Tree, all sentences in the data set are built into a tree structure, and the part-of-speech structure of the next sentence is restricted through model generation combined with FP-Tree and the detail is defined in session 7. In addition, the experimental results show that our proposed method can effectively control the results of Chinese story generation and generate sentences with better performance and the detail is defined in session 8.},

In this paper, we consider the issues posed by bipolar fuzzy linear systems (BFLSs) and bipolar fuzzy complex linear (BFCL) systems of equations with real and complex coefficients. Primarily, we find the solution of the BFLS of equations by the resort into two parts: one is negative $$(\bullet )$$ and other is positive $$(\star )$$ $$n \times n$$ linear fuzzy systems; to this aim, we use $$n \times n$$ bipolar fuzzy center system and $$2n \times 2n$$ bipolar fuzzy width system. We describe the fundamentals of proposed method with the aid of $$n= 2,5$$ -dimensional numerical examples, and we get the weak and strong solutions of the system. Subsequently, we describe a technique to solve BFCL systems of equations whose coefficients are real and complex by a pair of positive $$(\star )$$ and negative $$(\bullet )$$ $$n \times n$$ real and complex crisp linear systems; to this aim, we use bipolar fuzzy complex center and width. Ultimately, we use our proposed technique to solve a current flow circuit which is defined in terms of a BFCL system with complex coefficients, and we get the unknown current in the form of bipolar fuzzy complex number.},

  abstract     = {Negation operation is important in intelligent information processing. Different existing arithmetic negation, an exponential negation is presented in this paper. The new negation can be seen as a kind of geometry negation. Some basic properties of the proposed negation are investigated, and we find that the fix point is the uniform probability distribution, which reaches the maximum entropy. The proposed exponential negation is an entropy increase operation, and all the probability distributions will converge to the uniform distribution after multiple negation iterations. The convergence speed of the proposed negation is also faster than the existed negation. The number of iterations of convergence is inversely proportional to the number of elements in the distribution. Some numerical examples are used to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed negation.},

To achieve this, the fuzzy conformable fractional derivative based on the generalized Hukuhara differentiability is defined, and several properties are brought on the topic, such as switching points and the fuzzy chain rule. After that, a new analytical method is applied to find the exact solutions for two famous mathematical equations: the fuzzy fractional wave equation and the fuzzy fractional diffusion equation. The present work is the first report in which the fuzzy traveling wave method is used to design an analytical method to solve these fuzzy problems.

  abstract     = {Marine pollution is an important environmental problem. One of the important causes of marine pollution is ship origin. This study deals with defining the importance degrees of ship origin marine pollution criteria. This paper suggests employing quality function deployment (QFD), interval type-2 fuzzy (IT2F) numbers, TOPSIS (technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution) and SWOT analysis to determine these importance degrees. Internal factors, which indicate the strengths and weaknesses of the SWOT analysis in this paper, are the infrastructure of the sea to prevent pollution. External factors, which indicate the opportunities and threats of the SWOT analysis in this paper, are ship-related activities that cause pollution of the relevant sea. Five CRs and fourteen DRs are handled to examine ship origin marine pollution. Three experts have presented their judgments about the correlations and relationships of design requirements (DRs) and customer requirements (CRs). The proposed IT2F number-based QFD method uses IT2F numbers to determine the weights of DRs with the help of the correlations and relationships of the DRs and CRs. The most important internal factors are complying with the law and hard supervision, respectively. The most important external factors are direct discharge of waters of tank washing, direct discharge of ballast waters of ships and direct discharge of bilge waters of ships, respectively. Four seas are ranked in terms of ship origin marine pollution by using TOPSIS approach based on IT2F number. The most polluted sea exposed to ship origin marine pollution is Sea of Marmara according to the obtained results.},

The ACWOA algorithm integrates the artificial bee colony algorithm and chaotic mapping, effectively avoiding the local optimal situation and improving the quality of the initial solution. Also, nonlinear convergence factors and adaptive inertia weight coefficients are added to accelerate the convergence rate. To verify the performance of the improved algorithm, 20 benchmark functions and CEC2019 multimodal multi-objective benchmark functions have been used to compare ACWOA with the classical intelligent population algorithms (PSO, MVO, and GWO) and the recent state-of-the-art algorithms (CWOA, HWPSO, and HIWOA) in recent years. The proposed algorithm is applied to two well-known engineering mathematical models and a real application (the quality process control). The experiments show that the ACWOA algorithm has strong competitiveness in convergence speed and solution accuracy and has certain practical value in complex mathematical model scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Congestion is an essential concept in data envelopment analysis (DEA). It occurs when the decrease in at least one decision-making unit (DMU) input increases at least one output without affecting the other inputs or outputs. Although various methods have discussed congestion determination in static DEA, congestion calculation in dynamic DEA under inter-temporal dependence has not been considered in the literature. This paper deals with the congested input levels in multi-period production systems under inter-temporal dependence and the inter-temporal dependence of production periods due to the stock capital. Due to the importance of evaluating DMUs in the presence of time factors, this paper expands the determination of congestion of DMUs under the time factor and dependence of input and output levels in periods. The proposed models determine the congested unit in the assessment window and characterize the extra-input and lack-output amounts in all of the congested unit components in each period of the assessment window. This paper aims to specify production system performance in different evaluation periods by determining the dynamic congestion of DMUs. This paper proposes a method to identify the congested paths. The main advantage of this method is to prevent inappropriate allocation of the resources during evaluation periods of the assessment window. The validity of the proposed method is investigated through an example in the banking sector. Moreover, this method can be utilized in other sectors to homogeneous units with the same structure.},

Evaluating the risks of PPP projects precisely is critical to their successful implementation. However, the traditional approaches often lack mechanisms in manipulating imprecise and vague information, and they need auxiliary information or pre-assumptions (e.g., preset fuzzy membership functions). To solve this problem, an integrated method for evaluating risks in public–private partnership projects is proposed. This method is based on the strength of the group analytic hierarchy process (GAHP), rough set theory, and cloud model theory. The proposed approach integrates the strength of rough set theory in coping with vagueness of the information from experts’ assessments without much pre-assumptions, the advantage of cloud model theory in investigating the randomness of experts’ judgments, and the merit of the AHP method in evaluation under multiple criteria and complex situation. Finally, an application in a PPP project in Wuhu, China, is provided to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed approach is effective in modeling hierarchy assessment as well as dealing with vagueness and randomness, and it can help managers to make reasonable and effective decisions in risk management.},

Most object segmentation algorithms are dedicated to improving the structure of the feature extraction and fusion modules, but the processing of complex redundant information is not sufficient, which makes them unable to segment the camouflage objects well. Aiming at the data characteristics of the camouflage object, we propose a novel structure of fully convolutional network called DAFNet, which mainly consists of feature filter module (FFM). FFM is formed by multi-path dilated convolution through multiplication, which “filters” the redundant features flowing in the network to improve the network’s segmentation performance on camouflage objects. We also design an attention module based on Gaussian convolution called Gaussian attention module (GAM), which is used to refine the rough predicted map to further improve the output quality. Experiments on existing camouflage object datasets show that the DAFNet can achieve state-of-the-art performance on camouflage object segmentation.},

  abstract     = {In today’s world, changes in the economic and industrial sectors are taking place more quickly than in the past. Based on today’s competitive market, considering the needs and desires of the customer is very important. Thus, designing the supply chain network to minimize the costs and improve the system efficiency, the service facility, and attention to the timely service delivery to the customer should be considered. Also, deployment costs to determine the number and position of facilities are regarded as another strategic issue. Therefore, to become closer to the real-world application, by considering the Jackson network model (queuing theory), the present study aims to design a closed-loop supply chain network to reduce the waiting time in the queue. Two objectives, namely minimizing the cost and waiting time incurred in queues formed in producers and distributors, are investigated. Queuing mathematical expressions are used both in dealing with objectives and constraints. To develop a model, which is close to real by considering uncertainty, the parameters, including demand rate and shipping cost of products, were considered as a trapezoidal fuzzy number. Also, we crisp this fuzzy uncertainty using both Jimenez and chance-constrained programming approaches. Due to the suggested model’s complexity and nonlinearity, we linearized the mathematical model as much as possible, then two meta-heuristic algorithms, namely multi-objective particle swarm optimization and non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), are used to solve the model. First, the structural parameters of these algorithms are tuned by the Taguchi method. Then, numerous numerical test problems ranging from small to large scales are used to compare these algorithms considering Pareto front measuring indexes and various hypothesis tests.},

More specifically, an explorative mutation strategy DE/current-to-embest with an elite individual serving as part of the difference vector and an exploitative mutation strategy DE/ebest-to-rand with selecting an elite individual as the base vector are employed simultaneously to achieve the balance between local and global performance of the whole population instead of only one mutation strategy in classical DE algorithm. The control parameters F and CR for above mutation strategies are updated adaptively to supplement the optimization ability of DMIE-DE based on a rational probability distribution model and the successful experience from the previous iterations. Moreover, an inferior solutions eliminating technique is embedded to enhance the convergence speed and compensate cost of the fitness evaluation times during the evaluation process. To evaluate the performance of DMIE-DE, experiments are conducted by comparing with five state-of-the-art DE variants on solving 29 test functions in CEC2017 benchmark set. The experimental results indicate that the performance of DMIE-DE is significantly better than, or at least comparable to the considered DE variants.},

  abstract     = {Mutation is the main operator of differential evolution (DE), as it is responsible for combining the information of distinct solutions to generate a donor vector. Aiming at improving the search effectivity of DE, previous research incorporated the calculation of centroids into the DE mutations. In some of the existing methods, the centroids are simply calculated as the center of some selected solutions (or, the entire population); in other cases, one-step clustering is used to perform a local search, or the centroids themselves are used as actual solutions in the population. As opposed to these methods, in this paper we extend some traditional DE mutation strategies to incorporate centroids calculated by deterministic hierarchical clustering. Experimental results on two sets of well-known benchmark problems show that the proposed cluster-centroid-based mutation strategies outperform, in general, the traditional rand/1 strategy, as well as several metaheuristics from the literature. Therefore, the use of clustering is an effective way to improve the search performance that could be exploited also in other population-based metaheuristics.},

Key objectives of the paper are the minimization of voltage deviation, voltage stability enhancement and power loss reduction. Belleville washer is coned-disc spring, which can encumber the length of its axis by static and dynamic mode. Belleville washers are helpful for modification since dissimilar breadth can be exchanged within and away and it can be used to attain vast tune of coil rate. They are perfect in circumstances wherever a weighty coil power is necessary with least complimentary distance end to end and firmness previous to attainment of firm elevation. Fundamental law of force has been employed to design the Belleville Washer Search optimization algorithm. Belleville washer impresses a force on the particle in horizontal direction and an external force pressure the particle in anti-clockwise direction. Belleville washer’s force is equal to the peripheral force in the period of time the particle will be in balanced condition. Initially, the particle moves certain distance, and Belleville washer’s force will tender a resistance over the particle during the time peripheral force acting over the particle. Stiffness property of the Belleville washer is tailored relative to the objective function. Force and movement of the particle have been observed. Papilionoidea Optimization Algorithm is based on performance of the Papilionoidea in nutrition foraging. Opposition-based Learning is a technique integrated with Papilionoidea Optimization Algorithm.

The developed hybrid algorithm is compared with firefly and whale optimization algorithms considering unimodal, multimodal, composite and CEC-C06 2019 benchmark optimization problems in terms of statistical analysis. Comparison results showed that hybrid algorithm has the best performance for approximately 67\% of 39 benchmark functions in finding the minimum in an average of independent 100 experiments for each function. For the functions in which the proposed algorithm gives the best results, approximately 64\% improvement is achieved compared to FA and 39\% improvement compared to WOA. In terms of convergence speed, in average 2\% of improvement is obtained. As an application to engineering problems, optimization of parameters of the model predictive control for inverted pendulum and distillation column is considered and the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the performances of firefly algorithm and whale optimization algorithm. For the considered applications, a novel objective function is selected. The selected objective function for hybrid firefly–whale optimization algorithm enables finding the optimal prediction horizon and control horizon as well as the Q and R matrices such that the system responses satisfy desired settling time and maximum overshoot criteria.

  abstract     = {Natural disasters cause heavy casualties and financial losses annually. To reduce these damages, the rescue teams need to be planned effectively. In this regard, in this research, a mixed-integer programming model is offered to allocate and schedule rescue teams in a response phase of disaster management under uncertainty. The objective function minimizes the incident’s total weighted completion times. The literature review shows that the uncertain condition and time windows have been less addressed in the previous studies. To cover these gaps, this paper investigates the problem under uncertainty and considers time windows for incidents. Besides, the fatigue effect is considered in this paper. Accordingly, within a planning horizon, incident processing times are not fixed. Since the considered problem is an NP-hard one and exact methods cannot solve it within a reasonable amount of time, this research develops a heuristic-based simulated annealing algorithm. The presented model is solved using the developed algorithm and three known meta-heuristic algorithms. Then, the results obtained by algorithms are compared and analyzed. Finally, the sensitivity analysis is carried out on some crucial parameters of the presented model, and the related results are reported.},

  abstract     = {Students’ performance prediction systems play a vital role in enhancing the educational performance inside universities, schools, and training centers. Big data can come from different resources such as examination centers, virtual courses, registration departments, e-learning systems. Extracting meaningful knowledge from educational data is a complex task, so reducing the data dimensionality is needed. In this paper, we proposed an enhanced binary genetic algorithm (EBGA) as a wrapper feature selection algorithm. Novel hybrid selection mechanism based on a k-means algorithm and electromagnetic-like mechanism (EM) method is proposed. K-means will cluster the population into a set of clusters, while EM will determine a value called a total force (TF) for each solution. Each cluster has an accumulated total force (ATF) (i.e., adding all TFs together). Selection process will select two solutions with the highest TF from the cluster, which has the highest ATF. We employed a hybrid machine learning approach between the proposed EBGA and five different classifiers (i.e., k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)). Two real case studies obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository are used in this paper. Obtained results showed the ability of the proposed approach to enhance the performance of the binary genetic algorithm. Moreover, the performances of all classifiers are improved between $$1\%$$ and $$11\%$$ .},

To tackle the above problems, we propose a manifold p-spectral clustering with sparrow search algorithm (SSA-MpSC). Based on the manifold learning theory, we introduce an adaptive neighborhood selection method based on expansion strategy and construct an improved manifold spatial distance to better pay attention to the local consistency of manifold data. In addition, considering the importance of parameter p to the local optimization of the algorithm, a chaotic sequence improved SSA was proposed to adjust the parameter. Increase the algorithm adaptability to datasets and the clustering accuracy by improving the similarity matrix and parameter optimization. As shown in experiment, we have also empirically verified these proprieties by testing the proposed SSA-MpSC on 3 artificial datasets as well as 6 UCI datasets with different data sizes and dimensions.

It increases protection by reminding the driver of the current condition of the route, such as notices, bans, limitations, and other valuable driving information. This paper describes a novel system for automatic detection and recognition of road signs, which is achieved in two main steps. First, the initial image is pre-processed using DBSCAN clustering algorithm. The clustering is performed based on color information, and the generated clusters are segmented using artificial neural networks (ANN) classifier. The resulting ROIs are then carried out based on their aspect ratio and size to retain only significant ones. Then, a shape-based classification is performed using ANN as classifier and HDSO as feature to detect the circular, rectangular and triangular shapes. Second, a hybrid feature is defined to recognize the ROIs detected from the first step. It involves a combination of the so-called GLBP-Color which is an extension of the classical gradient local binary patterns feature to the RGB color space and the local self-similarity feature. ANN, AdaBoost, and support vector machine have been tested with the introduced hybrid feature and the first one is selected as it outperforms the other two. The proposed method has been tested in outdoor scenes, using a collection of common databases, well known in the traffic sign community (GTSRB, GTSDB, and STS). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method when compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.},

This paper studies uncertainty measurement for a 3HIS and its application in feature selection. A 3HIS is first put forward. Then, the fuzzy relation on the object set with respect to each subsystem is defined. Next, four measure tools are used to assess the uncertainty of a 3HIS according to the fuzzy information granules induced by the defined fuzzy relation. Combining with the proposed measures, an application for feature selection in a 3HIS is given, and the corresponding algorithms based on the uncertainty measures are presented. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out and effectiveness analysis from the statistics perspective is done as so to evaluate the performance of the presented algorithms. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm is more effective than some existing algorithms. These results will contribute to understanding the essence of uncertainty in a 3HIS.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the semi-intermittent synchronization in fixed time for hybrid couple neural networks with uncertain multiple weights and discontinuous nonlinearity. Firstly, the principle of the global convergence in fixed time with respect to nonlinear systems with periodically semi-intermittent scheme is developed. Secondly, in order to realize the global synchronization goal in fixed time, novel controllers, which are composed of the semi-intermittent adaptive controller and semi-intermittent feedback controller, are designed. Under Filippov differential inclusion framework, by applying Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional method and inequality analysis technique, the global synchronization conditions in fixed time are achieved in the form of linear matrix inequalities. In addition, the upper bound of the settling time, which is adjusted in advance by choosing the controller parameters, is estimated accurately. Finally, the correctness of the theoretical results and the feasibility of the designed controller are verified by an example.},

During this time, the need for a method that can comprehensively and scientifically evaluate the alternatives of videoconferencing tools to be used in distance education has emerged. This paper proposes a novel hybrid multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) model by integrating the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) methodologies. The proposed model is developed with spherical fuzzy (SF) sets, which enable decision-makers (DMs) express their membership, non-membership and hesitancy degrees independently, and in a large three-dimensional spherical space. The applicability of the developed spherical fuzzy AHP EDAS is illustrated through a problem of selecting a videoconferencing tool for distance education. For this purpose, three DMs evaluate five popular videoconferencing tools, namely Zoom, Google Meet, Cisco WebEx, Skype and Microsoft with respect to six criteria, which are expanded with 32 related sub-criteria from the literature to more comprehensively handle the problem. The implications, sensitivity and comparative analyses, limitations and future research avenue are also given within the study.},

Every day billions of images are uploaded over the internet. The search for a relevant image on the search engines seems quite challenging for the research community. CBIR system made this search easier as high-level image visuals which are characterized in the form of feature vectors. In this work, Deep Search and Rescue (SAR) Algorithm-based CBIR is presented for effective retrieval of relevant images. The steps involved in proposed Deep Neural Network-SAR (DNN- SAR) are pre-processing, multiple feature extraction, feature fusion, clustering and classification. Initially, Fast Average Peer Group (FAPG) filter is used to remove the noise in the pre-processing stage. Then multiple features like color, shape and texture are extracted and feature vectors are calculated. All these three features are fused into a single feature using average and weighted average techniques. Next, the fused features are clustered using adaptive Sunflower optimization (SFO) algorithm. Finally, the relevant images are retrieved using DNN-SAR optimization algorithm. The proposed work is implemented in PYTHON platform and tested on four different types of image databases, namely Corel 1 K, 1.5 K, 5 K, and Caltech-256. Thus, the simulation outcomes proved that the proposed DNN-SAR technique had improved the CBIR performance in terms of precision and recall.},

The proposed opposition-based chaotic Henry&#39;s law-based -soluble gas optimization algorithm is based on the Henry’s law of solubility. Opposition-based learning and chaotic are integrated with Henry&#39;s law-based -soluble gas optimization algorithm to perk up the performance of the algorithm. Henry’s law states that the total explains about the gas diffuse in the fluid and unswervingly comparative to the fractional force on top of the fluid. Anthoathecata reproduction procedure and foraging behavior of Chelonioidea are mathematically formulated and hybridized to solve the power loss reduction problem. Anthoathecata algorithm (AA) emulates the natural stages of Anthoathecata life cycle to make the exploration further efficient Chelonioidea move in the direction of the food source, which discharge the brawny aroma. Chelonioidea progress may be vigorous and unswerving, but it may also be submissive, aid by the ocean currents. AA is good in exploration and Chelonioidea algorithm is excellent in exploitation. To the hybridization of Chelonioidea algorithm with Anthoathecata algorithm (HAC) an adaptive crossover operator has been integrated to augment the exploration ability. Liquid molecules are taken as individuals of the projected VOL algorithm and concrete platform is imitated as the exploration space. Diminishing of concrete platform wet conditions restructure the liquid accretion from monolayer to a self-locomotion globule. Such a performance is in concurrence with the layout of the VOL algorithm individual’s which vicissitudes to one another. The preeminent approach for renewing the vaporized liquid molecules is by means of the present set of liquid molecules. In this method an arbitrary transformation grounded step size can be considered for conceivable alteration of individuals. The consequent set of molecules is stimulated by accumulation of arbitrary transformation grounded step size and it is multiplied by the similar streamlining prospect called vaporization probability of monolayer and globule vaporization probability proposed opposition-based chaotic Henry’s law-soluble gas optimization algorithm (HOC), hybridization of Chelonioidea algorithm with Anthoathecata algorithm (HAC) and vaporization of liquid optimization (VOL) algorithm are appraised in IEEE 30 bus system and IEEE 14, 30, 57, 118, 300 bus test systems without considering the voltage constancy index.

Although a text prediction system facilitates the typing process, it is helpful for people with disabilities to type or enter texts at a limited or slow speed. This means that when a user types a word, then the system suggests the next word to be chosen. It is also beneficial for people with dyslexia and those who are not good at spelling words. Besides, it can be used in entertainment as a game, for example, to determine a target word and reach it or tackle it within 10 attempts of prediction. Generally, the text prediction systems depend on a corpus. Writing every single word is time-consuming; therefore, it is vitally important to decrease time consumption by reducing efforts to input texts in the systems by offering the most probable words for the user to select. This paper addresses a survey of miscellaneous techniques toward text prediction with entertainment systems and their evaluation.

Then we introduce some related theorems which determining upper bounds and lower bounds for the inverse fuzzy planarity value.

Facing this challenge, we proposed a textual attention mechanism, which can obtain semantic relevance between words by scanning all generated words. The retrospect network for image captioning (RNIC) proposed in this paper aims to improve input and prediction process by using textual attention. Concretely, the textual attention mechanism is applied to the model simultaneously with the visual attention mechanism to provide the input of the model with the maximum information required for generating captions. In this way, our model can learn to collaboratively attend on both visual and textual features. Moreover, the semantic relevance between words obtained by retrospect is used as the basis for prediction, so that the decoder can simulate the human language system and better make predictions based on the already generated contents. We evaluate the effectiveness of our model on the COCO image captioning datasets and achieve superior performance over the previous methods.},

  abstract     = {The quality of information extracted from the vibration signals, and the accuracy of the bearing status detection depend on the methods used to process the signal and select the informative features. In this paper, a new hybrid approach is introduced in which the relatively new swarm decomposition (SWD) method and the optimized compensation distance evaluation technique (OCDET) are used to enhance the signal processing stage and to improve the optimal features selection process, respectively. Firstly, the vibration signals are decomposed into their Oscillatory Components (OCs) using the SWD. The feature matrix is constructed by computing the time-domain features for the OCs. The CDET method is consequently utilized to select the most sensitive features corresponding to the bearing status. On the other hand, The CDET approach contains a parameter called threshold which affects the number of the selected features. In this way, the hybrid optimization algorithm, which is a combination of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm with the Sine–Cosine Algorithm (SCA) and the Levy flight distribution, has been used to select the optimal CDET threshold and improve the support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The proposed technique ability is evaluated by vibration signals corresponding to different bearing defects and various speeds. The results indicate the capability of the proposed fault diagnosis method in identifying the very small-size defects under various bearing conditions. Finally, the presented method shows better performance in comparison with other well-known methods in the most of the case studies.},

  abstract     = {The current work concentrates on the conception, design, and implementation of an intelligent multi-input multi-output fuzzy logic controller for the energy management of a hybrid renewable energy system including solar power and storage battery in laboratory dimensions. In proposed topology, to guarantee the sustainability of accessing electricity in the case of peak time and different weather conditions, connection to the power grid is considered, as well. The experimental effort is based on the powerful Arduino boards that attempted to provide a software and hardware prototype platform for the further worldwide development of using renewable energy resources. The main purpose of the designed intelligent fuzzy controller is to extract instantaneously the generated power by the solar panel to keep the storage battery adequately charged for various conditions of the system and ensure the reduction of grid electricity consumption. The proposed intelligent multi-input multi-output fuzzy controller has been attained and verified through simulation and experimental examinations, the output control signals are investigated and the hybrid renewable energy system performance ratio is underscored.},

Only one copy of each type of tools is made available due to economic restrictions, and the tools are stored in a central tool magazine (CTM) that shares with and serves for several machines. Jobs and tools among machines are carried by AGVs and tool transporter (TT). This simultaneous scheduling problem is highly complex in nature as it involves job operations sequencing on machines, allocation of tools and AGVs to job operations and associated trip operations including the times of dead heading trip and loaded trip of AGVs. This paper presents a nonlinear mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation to model the combined scheduling of machines, AGVs and tools and a flower pollination algorithm (FPA) built on the flowers’ pollination process for solving this simultaneous scheduling problem. The results indicate the proposed FPA is superior in terms of final solution quality, efficiency, convergence rate and robustness.},

A supply chain with suppliers, potential plants, potential distribution centers, customers, potential collection/recycling centers, potential disposal centers, and multi-mode transportation under cost, environmental-, and social-based objective functions is formulated mathematically. In the proposed formulation, according to the uncertain nature of the problem in real-world situations, some of the parameters are considered as intuitionistic fuzzy values. In addition to the required location and allocation decisions, two main difficulties of the proposed problem are its uncertain nature and its multi-objectivity. To overcome such difficulties, a method considering the acceptance degree of fuzzy constraints violated is used to convert the fuzzy formulation to its equivalent crisp form. As a novelty, this method for the first time is modified for intuitionistic fuzzy values. Then the obtained multi-objective crisp formulation is solved by five multi-objective optimization approaches of the literature. At the end the data of the case study from Iran are used to evaluate the proposed crisp formulation and comparison of the multi-objective solution approaches.},

  abstract     = {Linear infrastructure projects in congested urban cities require optimal site layout planning. Nevertheless, most of the existing models are developed to address building construction projects with confined boundaries. This paper presents a model for assigning construction facilities locations (CFL) to each work segment in linear infrastructure projects that are characterized by frequent changes of construction site location as the work progresses. The model accounts for the resource transportation cost, land renting cost, relocation cost of CFLs, as well as duration needed for each work segment. The proposed model utilizes a tree search algorithm—Uniform Cost Search (UCS)—that guarantees a global optimal solution. In addition, a pruning technique is utilized to decrease the tree size to reduce the needed computation time. Finally, to account for the stochastic factors (i.e., transportation cost and duration needed per segment), the model is integrated into a Monte Carlo simulation. The proposed model, with the pruning algorithm, is able to solve a 4 trillion-solution space problem in under 3000 ms using an 8 GB Ram, 2 GHz machine. The proposed model can be integrated into the planning and site layout decision making processes for linear infrastructure projects to reduce the overall site layout cost and maintain adequate site conditions while reducing the interruptions in road utilization. Finally, the presented pruning algorithm can be utilized in similar construction engineering problems to efficiently identify global optimal solutions.},

  abstract     = {Researchers from different domains have developed several metaheuristic algorithms that are inspired by the biological phenomenon. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm that is inspired by the prey–predator interaction of animals. In the proposed algorithm, two random populations are considered as a predator and preys. The energy gain for both predators and preys calculated based on their body mass and the interaction between predators and their mutual preys. The best predator (i.e., predator with the highest energy gain) performs a local search (exploitation). The other solution members in prey population facilitate the exploration of the search space. The proposed algorithm is evaluated by three phases. Firstly, a set of 16 mathematical functions are considered to test different characteristics of predator–prey optimization (PPO) algorithm as a optimizer. Secondly, it is evaluated by seven datasets as a solver for feature selection problem. The proposed algorithm as an global optimizer has been compared with other metaheuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), ant lion optimizer (ALO), gray wolf optimizer (GWO), whale optimization algorithm (WOA), differential evolution (DE), sine–cosine algorithm (SCA), moth flame optimization (MFO), and salp swarm algorithm (SSA). The results indicate that PPO improves convergence rate by 33.8\%, 24.2\%, 37.3\%, 10.5\%, 12.4\%, 22.7\%, 18.6\%, 30.7\%, and 29.1\% in average compared to GA, PSO, ALO, GWO, WOA, DE, SCA, MFO, and SSA, respectively. Furthermore, PPO obtains a higher Performance Index around 5–10\% than competitor approaches with respect to exploration–exploitation balance and a high degree of stability. Secondly, the performance of PPO for feature selection issues demonstrates the applicability PPO algorithm in solving real problems with unknown search spaces.},

  abstract     = {Optimization algorithms often have several critical setting parameters and the improvement of the empirical performance of these algorithms depends on tuning them. Manually configuration of such parameters is a tedious task that results in unsatisfactory outputs. Therefore, several automatic algorithm configuration frameworks have been proposed to regulate the parameters of a given algorithm for a series of problem instances. Although the developed frameworks perform very well to deal with various problems, however, there is still a trade-off between the accuracy and budget requirements that need to be addressed. This work investigates the performance of unbalanced distribution of budget for different configurations to deal with the automatic algorithm configuration problem. Inspired by the bandit-based approaches, the main goal is to find a better configuration that substantially improves the performance of the target algorithm while using a smaller run time budget. In this work, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II is employed as a target algorithm using jMetalPy software platform and the multimodal multi-objective optimization (MMO) test suite of CEC’2020 is used as a set of test problems. We did a comprehensive comparison with other known methods including random search, Bayesian optimization, sequential model-based algorithm configuration (SMAC), iterated local search in parameter configuration space (ParamILS), iterated racing for automatic algorithm configuration (irace), and many-objective automatic algorithm configuration (MAC) methods. In order to characterize, validate and evaluate the performance of these methods, hypervolume (HV), generational distance, and epsilon indicator ( $$I_{{\epsilon }^{+}}$$ ) are used as performance indicators. The experimental results interestingly proved the efficiency of the proposed approach for automatic algorithm configuration with a minimum time budget in comparison with other competitors.},

  abstract     = {In public or private transport industry, crew scheduling of any public transport is an important problem. It is associated with the assignment of crews for their to and fro trips of public/private sector transportation at an optimum time/cost. This paper deals with a crew scheduling problem with day-to-day allotment of duties of a set of crew members for their to and fro trips such that the total standby times (or rest times or waiting times) and overall service times (along with standby times) will be minimized separately. Here the standby times and service times (along with standby times) are considered as uncertain due to uncertain arrival of transport vehicle. This uncertainty is represented by interval and the corresponding problem is formulated as an optimization problem with two interval valued objectives. To solve the said problem, the existing Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) developed by Deb et al. (IEEE Trans Evol Comput 6:182–197, 2002) is extended and ENSGA-II (Extended NSGA-II) has been developed with interval fitness (for 0–1 programming problem) and column exchange crossover and mutation. Then, the problem is formulated as optimization problem with multiple objectives in crisp environment considering centre-radius form of interval. To illustrate and validate the problem along with solution methodology, three numerical examples are solved and the results are compared for different approaches. Then to investigate the impact of different genetic algorithm parameters along with the stability of the algorithm, sensitivity analyses are done on the overall service time and total standby time.},

By using the kernel smoothing method, we construct a squared-error consistent probability estimator for symbolic data, followed by a new data transformation model proposed to embed symbolic data into Euclidean space. Based on the model, the inner product and distance measure between symbolic data objects are reformulated, allowing a new Support Vector Machine (SVM), called SVM-S, to be defined for nonlinear classification on symbolic data using the Mercer kernel learning method.

The proposed model has a strong backbone of CNN in the primary branch complemented by resolution preserving dilated convolution layers in secondary branches. The proposed model extracts multiple features at different scales and finally fuses them together to fetch the dominant global feature that aids in binary classification problem. A new dataset has been created in collaboration with All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi. The efficacy of the proposed model has been verified using the developed dataset using various subjective and objective parameters. Feature maps generated at each branch have been thoroughly analyzed to understand the quality of learning. Thorough experimental analysis indicates that the proposed model yields an accuracy of 0.96, sensitivity of 0.93 and specificity of 0.97 on real data collected from AIIMS Delhi. To verify the efficacy of the proposed dilated CNN, extensive analysis has been done using standard KID dataset as well. For a fair comparison, these datasets have also been used for pre-trained inception net model. Thorough analysis indicates that the proposed architecture performs well both for AIIMS dataset and the standard KID dataset.

The main concern of network embedding is to keep the local structural features while effectively capturing the global features of the network. The “shallow” network representation models cannot capture the deep nonlinear features of the network, and the generated network embedding is usually not the optimal solution. In this paper, a new graph autoencoder-based network representation model combines the first- and second-order proximity to evaluate the performance of network embedding. Aiming at the shortcomings of existing network representation methods in weighted and directed networks, on one hand, the concepts of receiving vector and sending vector are introduced with a simplification of decoding part of the neural network which reduces computation complexity; on the other hand, a measurement index based on node degree is proposed to better emphasize the weighted information in the application of network representation. Experiments including directed weighted networks and undirected unweighted networks show that the proposed method achieves better results than the baseline methods for network reconstruction and link prediction tasks and is of higher computation efficiency than previous graph autoencoder algorithms. Besides, the proposed weighted index is able to improve performances of all baseline methods as an external assistance.},

The core of SABE is stacking, which is a machine learning technique. Stacking is beneficial as it works on multiple models harnessing their capabilities and provides a better estimation accuracy as compared to a single model. The proposed method is validated on four software effort estimation datasets and compared with the already existing solution functions: closet analogy, mean, median and inverse distance weighted mean. The evaluation criteria used are mean magnitude of relative error (MMRE), median magnitude of relative error (MdMRE), prediction (PRED) and standard accuracy (SA).

The proposed training data augmentation method can generate data using kernel density estimation models while maintaining statistical guarantees using unbiased estimators of linear regression, which has low computational costs and easy hyper-parameter tuning compared to deep neural networks. In addition, we derive an upper bound for the $$L_{1}$$ loss of the proposed method relative to probability density functions. Experiments were conducted with four benchmark and three materials (i.e., binary compounds, oxide ionic conductivity, and phosphorescent materials) datasets. Regarding the generated data, we examined training and generalization performances using kernel ridge regression compared to those of generative adversarial networks and real-NVPs. For the materials datasets, we analyzed influential factors regarding material properties (conductivity and emission intensity). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate data that can be used as new training data.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy parameterized fuzzy soft matrices (fpfs-matrices) which can model problems involving fuzzy objects and parameters are one of the mathematical tools used to deal with decision-making problems. To utilize soft decision-making methods via fpfs-matrices in machine learning is likely to draw much scholarly attention. In this paper, we propose Comparison Matrix-Based Fuzzy Parameterized Fuzzy Soft Classifier (FPFS-CMC) in order to transfer modeling success of fpfs-matrices to machine learning. We then compare FPFS-CMC with Fuzzy Soft Set Classifier (FSSC), FussCyier, Fuzzy Soft Set Classification Using Hamming Distance (HDFSSC), and Fuzzy k-Nearest Neighbor (Fuzzy kNN) in consideration of accuracy, precision, recall, macro-F-score, and micro-F-score performance metrics, and 15 datasets in UCI Machine Learning Repository. Besides, we compare the proposed classifier with the state-of-the-art Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) in terms of five performance metrics herein. Afterward, the results from the experiments are analyzed by employing the Friedman and Nemenyi tests to assess the statistical significance of the differences in performances. Both experimental and statistical results show that FPFS-CMC outperforms the others. Finally, we provide the conclusive remarks and some suggestions for further research.},

Different strategies have been proposed for generating synthetic minority samples. However, noisy samples which may cause the overlapping of minority and majority classes have not yet been properly treated for reducing their influence on the performance of a classification model. A new method, named Importance-SMOTE, is proposed in this paper. In this method, only borderline and edge samples in minority class are oversampled. The synthetic minority samples are generated proportionally to the importance of the minority samples which is calculated according to the composition and distribution of its nearest neighbors. The positions of the synthetic minority samples are determined by the relative importance of the paired neighbors. The proposed method is expected to obtain a more precise estimation of the true decision surface and reduce the influence of noisy samples. Various public imbalanced datasets and a real case study are considered in the experiments to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The main aim of this paper is to develop a fast deep learning and yet an efficient approach to classify cardiac arrhythmias. The approach is implemented using 744 ECG signals for 45 persons. The approach is based on analyzing a single ECG beat and calculating the iris spectrogram. Then the iris spectrogram is fed to a convolutional neural network. The proposed method is efficient, simple and fast, which makes it feasible for real-time classification. The results show that the proposed methodology has an overall recognition accuracy of 99.13\% ± 0.25, 98.223\% ± 0.85, and 97.494\% ± 1.26 for 13, 15, and 17 arrhythmia classes, respectively.

  abstract     = {Decision implication is an elementary representation of decision knowledge in formal concept analysis. Decision implication canonical basis (DICB), a set of decision implications with completeness and non-redundancy, is the most compact representation of decision implications. The method based on true premises (MBTP) for DICB generation is the most efficient one at present. In practical applications, however, data are always changing dynamically, and MBTP, lacking an update mechanism of DICB, still needs to re-generate inefficiently the whole DICB. This paper proposes an incremental algorithm for DICB generation, which obtains a new DICB just by modifying and updating the existing one. Experimental results verify that when samples in data are much more than condition attributes, which is actually a general case in practical applications, the incremental algorithm is significantly superior to MBTP. Furthermore, we conclude that even for the data in which samples are less than condition attributes, when new samples are continually added into data, the incremental algorithm must be also more efficient than MBTP, because the incremental algorithm just needs to modify the existing DICB, which is only a part of work of MBTP.},

The presented method has been evaluated using an openly available dataset, namely Retinopathy Online Challenge (ROC).

  abstract     = {Many real-world datasets consist of multiple views of data items. The rough method of combining multiple views directly through feature concatenation cannot uncover the optimal latent structure shared by multiple views, which would benefit many data analysis applications. Recently, multi-view clustering methods have emerged and been applied to solving many machine learning problems. However, most multi-view clustering methods ignore the joint information of multi-view data or neglect the quality difference between different views of data, resulting in decreased learning performance. In this paper, we discuss a multi-view clustering algorithm based on concept factorization that effectively fuses useful information to derive a better representation for more effective clustering. We incorporate two regularizers into the concept factorization framework. Specifically, one regularizer is adopted to force the coefficient matrix to move smoothly on the underlying manifold. The other regularizer is used to learn the latent clustering structure from different views. Both of these regularizers are incorporated into the concept factorization framework to learn the latent representation matrix. Optimization problems are solved efficiently via an iterative algorithm. The experimental results on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-view clustering algorithms.},

The methodology adopted in the current study deviates from the existing approaches by integrating transfer learning. Also, multiple feature extraction techniques have been used to extract features from audio to analyze bird sounds, including the Fourier Transform, Mel-Spectrogram, and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients.

The absolute best classification accuracy is 97.43\%, which DenseNet201 and ResNet50 classification model attained on validation set. Also, DenseNet201 incurred least validation loss (0.1080).

  abstract     = {Classical Rough Set Theory (RST) is a prominent tool to deal with uncertainty of categorical data. However, in a case where values of attributes maintain preference order over each other, RST does not consider it. Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA), a generalization of RST, studies the dominance aspect of attributes and defines the dominance relation. The lower and upper approximations form the basis of most algorithms based on RST. However, determining DRSA approximations is computationally expensive so that the algorithms using approximations may suffer serious performance bottleneck when dealing with datasets of larger sizes. In this paper, we proposed a heuristic approach to compute lower and upper approximations based on DRSA, in time efficient manner. The proposed algorithm directly calculates approximations without going through the heavy computations of dominance positive or negative cones. We introduce heuristic rules to calculate approximations without considering the intersection and subset relations. By using the properties and logical structure of approximations, our mathematical implications select an object for all relevant approximation sets. The proposed approach was compared with the conventional method using eleven benchmark datasets from UCI. The results showed that the proposed rules significantly reduce the execution time by avoiding the redundant computations, which ultimately affect the structural complexity and memory requirements. The average reduction in execution time was found to be 83\%. The proposed approach also reduces the structural complexity and memory consumption by 89.69\%.},

  abstract     = {Cross-chain exchange is an important way to promote cooperation and exchange between different blockchains. However, current cross-chain approaches mainly rely on smart contracts with essential pre-deployment steps, several of which need to be synchronized, resulting in low performance. In this paper, we propose an asynchronous cross-chain exchange model based on a transaction that embeds a control condition to determine whether to transfer assets. The condition is used to specify the paired transaction. In order to find which cross-chain transaction meets the condition, the fields of cross-chain transactions are compared mutually, including sender, receiver, value, blockchain identifier, etc. Meanwhile, the balance process in the blockchain consensus needs to be changed: subtracting the balance of the sender first, increasing the balance of the receiver when the conditions match, or returning the assets to the sender if the time expires. By embedding conditions in transactions, the step of pre-deploying smart contracts is eliminated, and transactions can be sent in parallel. The simulation results show that compared with smart contract-based method, the exchange waiting time is reduced by up to 73.4\%.},

  abstract     = {The lung diagnosis is one of the essential needs of the medical world. Lung CT images are often affected by salt and pepper noise (or impulse noise) that results the diagnosis output as an imperfect one. The occurrence of impulse noise reduces the accuracy of lung diagnosis which leads the pulmonologists to prescribe wrong treatments or surgery. Image denoising techniques reduce the impulse noise to enhance the quality of medical images. The existing denoising methods are suffered by less denoising-quality, incapable for huge level noise and high time consumption. Hence, there is a need of a new denoising method for the removal of impulse noise in lung CT images. This paper proposes a novel denoising method for impulse noises of lung CT images namely &#39;Noise reduction using Soft Threshold-based Fuzzy Trimmed Switching Median filter (STFTSM)&#39;. The STFTSM filter removes the noise based on the four concepts, viz. soft threshold computation, fuzzy logic, trimming process and switching median technique. The main contributions of this paper are: (a) soft computation-based max-window-size determination and (b) fuzzy membership determination using switching median-based fuzzy absolute luminance difference computation, soft thresholding approach and fused parallelogram shaped windows. The performance analysis proves that this filter is robust one against the heavy noise environment of lung CT images, and it has less time consumption and significant improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio by achieving 26.16 db for 90\% noise environment.},

  abstract     = {For usual uncertain heat equations, it is challenging to acquire their analytic solutions. A forward difference Euler method has been used to compute the uncertain heat equations’ numerical solutions. Nevertheless, the Euler scheme is instability in some cases. This paper proposes an implicit task to overcome this disadvantage, namely the Crank–Nicolson method, which is unconditional stability. An example shows that the Crank–Nicolson scheme is more stable than the previous scheme (Euler scheme). Moreover, the Crank–Nicolson method is also applied to compute two characteristics of uncertain heat equation’s solution—expected value and extreme value. Some examples of uncertain heat equations are designed to show the availability of the Crank–Nicolson method.},

  abstract     = {Single-valued neutrosophic numbers (SVNNs) are very much useful to express uncertain environments. In real-life problems, there are many situations where players of a matrix game can not assess their payoffs by using ordinary fuzzy sets or intuitionistic fuzzy sets. In these situations, single-valued trapezoidal neutrosophic numbers (SVTNNs) play a vital role in game theory, as it includes indeterminacy in the information besides truth and falsity. The objectives of this paper are to explore matrix games with SVTNN payoffs and to investigate two different solution methodologies. To solve such games, a pair of neutrosophic mathematical programming problems have been formulated. In the first approach, the two neutrosophic mathematical programming models are converted into interval-valued multi-objective programming problems by using a new ranking order relation of SVTNNs. Finally, the reduced problems are solved using the weighted average approach and utilizing LINGO 17.0 software. It is worth mentioning that the values of the game for both the players are obtained in SVTNN forms, which is desirable. In the second approach, each neutrosophic mathematical programming model is transformed into a crisp one by using the idea of $$\alpha $$ -weighted possibility mean value for SVTNNs. A market share problem and another numerical example are illustrated to show the validity and applicability of the proposed approaches.},

In this study, artificial neural network employed in order to estimate the daily sediment load on rivers. Two different algorithms, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and hybrid MLP-FFA (MLP integrated with the FFA) were used for this purpose in the Lake Mahabad, Iran. For this purpose, nine different scenarios are considered as inputs of the models. Performance of selected models was evaluated on basis of performance criterion namely root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R2) for choosing best fit model. The results indicated that the new hybrid model MLP-FFA is successful in estimating sediment load with high accuracy as compared with its alternatives with RMSE = 2018 ton/day, MAE = 1698 and R2 = 0.95, which were much lower than those of MLP-based model with RMSE = 3044 ton/day, MAE = 2481 and R2 = 0.90.

  abstract     = {Text non-text separation is one of the most essential pre-processing steps for any optical character recognition (OCR) system. As an OCR engine can only process texts, the non-texts present in an input document image are required to be suppressed at the initial level. Therefore, to build a complete OCR system, an efficient text non-text separation module needs to be developed. To this end, we have proposed a texture-based feature descriptor followed by a novel feature selection technique for region-based text non-text classification. First, we have incorporated rotation invariant property with local ternary pattern to form a new texture-based feature descriptor, rotation invariant local ternary pattern (RILTP). Next, a novel feature selection technique is proposed which is a modified version of binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO). For the evaluation of the proposed text non-text classification method, we have initially constructed a database consisting of 690 images of text and non-text regions extracted from 70 pages of RDCL 2015 and 75 pages of RDCL 2017 page segmentation competitions databases. In this database, each class contains 345 data samples. The proposed texture-based feature descriptor has obtained an accuracy of 97.09\% on this database. Whereas, after applying BPSO, the feature dimension is reduced by approximately 55\% and at the same time, the accuracy reaches 97.5\%. Furthermore, in this work, another database is also created from Media team document pages to validate the robustness of this method. The second database comprises 100 text and 100 non-text images. The method has achieved 96.28\% accuracy when it is trained with the first database and tested with the second database. The comparative study reveals the robustness and strength of the proposed method as it outnumbers many state-of-the-art texture-based features. Besides, the proposed feature selection method is also compared with various standard feature selection methods, and it has been observed that the proposed one outperforms all those methods considered here for comparison.},

  abstract     = {Human activity recognition aims to determine actions performed by a human in an image or video. Examples of human activity include standing, running, sitting, sleeping, etc. These activities may involve intricate motion patterns and undesired events such as falling. This paper proposes a novel deep convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) network for skeletal-based activity recognition and fall detection. The proposed ConvLSTM network is a sequential fusion of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and fully connected layers. The acquisition system applies human detection and pose estimation to pre-calculate skeleton coordinates from the image/video sequence. The ConvLSTM model uses the raw skeleton coordinates along with their characteristic geometrical and kinematic features to construct the novel guided features. The geometrical and kinematic features are built upon raw skeleton coordinates using relative joint position values, differences between joints, spherical joint angles between selected joints, and their angular velocities. The novel spatiotemporal-guided features are obtained using a trained multi-player CNN-LSTM combination. Classification head including fully connected layers is subsequently applied. The proposed model has been evaluated on the KinectHAR dataset having 130,000 samples with 81 attribute values, collected with the help of a Kinect (v2) sensor. Experimental results are compared against the performance of isolated CNNs and LSTM networks. Proposed ConvLSTM have achieved an accuracy of 98.89\% that is better than CNNs and LSTMs having an accuracy of 93.89 and 92.75\%, respectively. The proposed system has been tested in realtime and is found to be independent of the pose, facing of the camera, individuals, clothing, etc. The code and dataset will be made publicly available.},

The data processing of new sentiment word extraction can provide information service better for users and provide theoretical support for the related research of edge computing. Traditional methods for extracting new sentiment words generally ignored the context and syntactic information, which leads to the low accuracy and recall rate in the process of extracting new sentiment words. To tackle the mentioned issue, we proposed a data processing method based on sequence labeling and syntactic analysis for extracting new sentiment words from product reviews. Firstly, the probability that the new word is a sentiment word is calculated through the location rules derived from the sequence labeling result, and the candidate set of new sentiment words is obtained according to the probability. Then, the candidate set of new sentiment words is supplemented with the method of matching appositive words based on edit distance. Finally, the final set of new sentiment words is collected through fine-grained filtering, including the calculation of point mutual information and difference coefficient of positive and negative corpus (DC-PNC). The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of new sentiment words extracted by the proposed method which can obviously improve the accuracy and recall rate of sentiment analysis.},

We find that firstly, the retail price and direct price are positively related to product quality level, and the product quality level is negatively related to the demand price elasticity in traditional retail channel and the demand price elasticity in internet channel. What&#39;s more, the retailer’s retail price in traditional retail channel will be higher than direct price in internet channel. Thirdly, in the case of centralized decision, the manufacturer&#39;s product quality level, retail price, joint expected revenue and consumer surplus will all rise, but the direct price will fall. Fourthly, when the manufacturer entrusts the third-party platform to build the internet channel, the manufacturer&#39;s product quality level, retail price, direct price, expected revenue, and consumer surplus will all decrease. Finally, we conduct the simulation analysis by MATLAB 2018, which verifies the validity and credibility of our conclusions and points the direction for the specific application of the model in practice.},

  abstract     = {So far, a great bulk of research has been dedicated to demand fluctuations in the make-to-order (MTO) environment, and several solutions have been proposed. In contrast, cellular layouts have received little attention from researchers. Also, in studies on dynamic cell production systems, the concept of dynamics is limited to the possibility of making changes between periods. This paper presents a new mathematical model to create an integrated system of order prioritizing, capacity measurement, and scheduling for dealing with new orders in MTO environments arranged by a cellular manufacturing layout. In this model, it is possible to negotiate the price and delivery time. The periods are also considered to be connected, and unlike the existing dynamic cellular manufacturing systems (DCMSs), it is possible to receive an order at any moment. Moreover, machine relocation is allowed with regard to the time of relocation during the periods. Another notable feature is the alternative routing for parts and cell formation (CF) at the same time as scheduling. The proposed model has two objectives including a) maximizing the profit and b) maximizing the number of orders accepted based on their priorities. The bi-objective model for small sizes has been solved by GAMS software using the augmented epsilon-constraint method. The effects of key parameters as well as some important features of the model, such as the possibility of checking the acceptance/rejection of a new order during the program, are addressed. Generally, the proposed model is able to develop a DCMS in an online cellular manufacturing system (OCMS). The results of sensitivity analysis show that the integration of CF, GS, order acceptance, pricing, and delivery time in a mathematical model simultaneously can significantly improve system performance and increase system profits. Finally, an NSGA-II algorithm is developed to solve the problem in larger sizes. To verify the computational effectiveness of the employed NSGA-II in comparison with a CPLEX solver, its performance is evaluated using two methods.},

  abstract     = {The notable characteristic of large-scale linguistic decision-making problems is that there are so many decision makers who provide linguistic assessments by using fuzzy linguistic representation models. In real-world applications, fuzzy linguistic terms mean different things for different people, and linguistic assessments based on different linguistic representation models may be simultaneous in the same large-scale linguistic decision-making problems. To this end, a novel linguistic decision-making method based on the voting model is proposed in the paper to deal with multi-linguistic assessments provided by decision makers. In large-scale linguistic decision process, evaluation-based voting is defined and multi-linguistic decision matrix is designed to represent multi-linguistic assessments provided by decision makers by using different linguistic representation models, and properties of the decision matrix are analyzed to show that linguistic assessments based on different linguistic representation models can be simultaneously represented. Based on multi-linguistic decision matrix, a new linguistic decision-making framework is developed to deal with large-scale linguistic decision-making problems with multi-linguistic assessments, in which normalization of multi-linguistic decision matrix and trust degrees of linguistic terms are contained, and more important, based on trust degrees of linguistic terms and 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic aggregation operators, an uniform fusion method of multi-linguistic assessments is proposed to aggregate multi-linguistic assessments of large-scale linguistic decision-making problems. Finally, user experiences of shared bikes, which are a large-scale linguistic decision-making problem in real-world applications, are employed to show the new decision-making framework and the uniform fusion method of multi-linguistic assessments, and furthermore, compared with existing linguistic decision-making methods analyzed in the example, it seems that multi-linguistic decision matrix and the uniform fusion method are useful and effective tools to deal with large-scale linguistic decision-making problems with multi-linguistic assessments.},

  abstract     = {Since the highly diversified consumer demands and changing market environment pose a great challenge for the automobile industry, this paper presents an extreme learning machine and knowledge base-based dynamic scheduling method to solve the dynamic scheduling problem of material handling for mixed-model assembly lines based on line-integrated supermarkets. First, the dynamic material handling scheduling problem is described and a mathematical model is established to maximize the weight sum of the throughput of the assembly line and the number of logistics workers under the condition of variable product ratio and weights of scheduling criteria, considering the random failure of the equipment and the instability of the cycle time. Subsequently, an extreme learning machine and knowledge base-based dynamic scheduling method is constructed, consisting of a knowledge base-based scheduling rule selection and an extreme learning machine (ELM)-based product mix matching method. Afterward, considering the defects of extreme learning machine, an elite opposition learning self-adaptive differential evolution-based extreme learning machine (EOADE-ELM) is proposed to optimize the parameters of ELM. Elite opposition-based learning and self-adaptive operators are employed to the EOADE-ELM to improve the performance. Finally, the simulation results prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed dynamic scheduling method in the dynamic scheduling process.},

A large percentage of computational cost of MOEAs is spent on non-dominated sorting. So, the complexity of non-dominated sorting method in a large extent decides the efficiency of the MOEA. In this paper, we present a novel non-dominated sorting method called the dynamic non-dominated sorting (DNS). It is based on the sorting of real number sequence instead of dominance comparisons. The computational complexity of DNS is $$O(mN\log N)$$ (m is the number of objectives, N is the population size), which equals to the best record so far. In the numerical experiments, we verify the outperformance of DNS comparing with other non-dominated sorting methods. Based on DNS, we introduce a novel multi-objective genetic algorithm called the dynamic non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (DNSGA). Numerical experiments on DNSGA are also given. The results show that DNSGA outperforms some other MOEAs on both general-scale and large-scale multi-objective problems.},

Given that the resulting integer programming model makes use of a big number of binary variables and given the extended time horizon considered, 30 days in our case, the problem is characterized by a high level of complexity. However, our developed heuristic is able to solve instances having up to 40 nodes, 520 arcs and 5 hierarchies, whereas a general-purpose solver like Gurobi was not able to provide solutions for instances having more than 10 nodes.

However, in terms of traffic speed prediction, the modules that integrate temporal and spatial features in the existing traffic speed prediction methods are effective in short-term prediction, but the medium-term or long-term prediction errors are relatively large. In order to reduce the errors of existing methods in short-term prediction and predict the medium-term and long-term traffic speed, this paper proposes a traffic speed prediction method that combines attention and Spatial–temporal features, referred to as ASTCN. Specifically, unlike previous methods, ASTCN can use the temporal attention convolutional network (ATCN) to separately extract temporal features from the traffic speed features collected by each sensor, and use the spatial attention mechanism to extract spatial features and then perform spatial–temporal feature fusion. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that the proposed ASTCN model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {Recent advanced deep learning architectures, such as neural seq2seq and transformer, have demonstrated remarkable improvements in multi-typed sentiment classification tasks. Even though recent transformer-based and seq2seq-based models have successfully enabled to capture rich contextual information of texts, they still lacked attention on incorporating global semantic information which enables to sufficiently leverage the performance of downstream SA tasks. Moreover, emotional expressions of users are normally in the form of natural human-written textual data which contains a lot of noises and ambiguities that impose great challenges on the processes of textual representation learning as well as sentiment polarity prediction. To meet these challenges, we propose a novel integrated fuzzy neural architecture with a topic-driven textual representation learning approach for handling the SA task, called as: TopFuzz4SA. Specifically, in the proposed TopFuzz4SA model, we first apply a topic-driven neural encoder–decoder architecture with the incorporation of latent topic embedding and attention mechanism to sufficiently learn both rich contextual and global semantic information of the given textual data. Then, the achieved rich semantic representations of texts are fed into a fused deep fuzzy neural network to effectively reduce the feature ambiguity and noise, forming the final textual representations for sentiment classification task. Extensive experiments in benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TopFuzz4SA model compared with contemporary state-of-the-art baselines.},

This article introduces a CNN-LSTM hybrid deep learning prediction model, which can correctly forecast the COVID-19 epidemic across India. The proposed model uses convolutional layers, to extract meaningful information and learn from a given time series dataset. It is also enriched with the LSTM layer&#39;s capability, which means it can identify long-term and short-term dependencies. The experimental evaluation has been performed to gauge the performance and suitability of our proposed model among the other well-established time series forecasting models.

  abstract     = {As social media has become a ubiquitous part of daily life, researchers made a great progress in identifying the emotion in user-generated texts. However, it is a challenging task as people express their emotion in explicit and implicit ways. This paper focuses on the problem of identifying sentiments from implicit sentences which contain no emotional word or phrase. Most of the existing sentiment classification models cannot identify the sentiments accurately since they usually focus on extracting features from grammatical information without taking contextual information into account. In this paper, we argue that the contextual information is the key to identify sentiments in implicit sentences. Moreover, multiple features extracting from different aspects should be taken into account to improve sentiment identification. This paper proposes a multi-feature neural network model considering three aspects: contextual information, syntactic information and semantic information. To better get the semantic information of the sentence, we propose an attention mechanism based on contextual affective space. The experimental results on the SMP2019-ECISA dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms the previous systems and strong neural baselines.},

In this research article, linear discriminant regression technique is proposed based on cognitive computing in order to predict the user’s quality of experience over software-defined network. By varying the network and the objective parameters, initially the mean opinion score is collected from the users. Further, a new architecture is developed on the basis of linear discriminant regression technique that uses the mean opinion score under different network conditions to predict the expected mean opinion score. The simulation results showed that the linear discriminant regression technique achieved better video quality compared to linear regression technique in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, and video quality metric by varying the video resolutions, bit-rates, and frame rates.},

The remaining weights are determined such that they minimize the sum of squares of the residuals of the differential equation computed at arbitrary set of interior points in the domain of the problem. Error bounds for the approximate solutions for ordinary and partial differential equations are derived. The resulting optimization problem is solved using meta-heuristic algorithms, namely particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), and a hybrid PSO–GA algorithm.

The improved performance is mainly by virtue of the footprint of uncertainty (FoU) underlying the IT2 fuzzy sets. But the design of IT2 fuzzy controllers remains a challenging task since the FoU increases the computational complexity. We propose in this paper a simplified structure of a novel three-input IT2 Takagi–Sugeno (TS) fuzzy PID controller, a parallel combination of fuzzy PI and fuzzy PD controllers having two inputs, respectively. A novel TS rule base is presented which incorporates uncertainty in both input IT2 fuzzy sets and the rule consequent parameters. The rule base consists of two rules that are logically connected with algebraic product (AP) triangular norm and bounded sum (BS) triangular co-norm. AP and BS operators enable the simplification of the input plane, which in turn reduces the complexity of the controller structure. The effect of FoU on the controller structure is fully investigated. Further, we present the simulation studies on magnetic levitation (MagLev) and cart-pole systems to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed fuzzy PID controller.},

Nowadays waste management has become an important issue for the solution of environmental problems. Hence, we discussed the municipal solid waste management. Municipal solid waste management problem is a complex and it has many different aspects as political, social, technological and economical criteria have to consider. The evaluation of these criteria numerically is complicated and vague. This paper deals with this complexity by proposed methodology. Also the contribution of the article to the literature is that the proposed methodology is applied for the first time in municipal solid waste management problems. In this paper, two fuzzy decision making approaches are combined for sitting a waste to energy plant in the Kırıkkale in Turkey. Four alternative locations and nine criteria are defined from the expert opinions and the literature survey. A new hybrid methodology that has not been applied before for this decision problem is proposed. In proposed methodology, there are two main stages. Criteria weights determination is the first stage, and ranking of the alternative locations is the second stage of the methodology. In first stage, Interval type 2 Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy process method is performed and in the second stage hesitant fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution method is used for ranking the alternative locations. Also decision makers have different experience level and knowledge about the problem and different decision makers’ weights are considered for group decision making. Two fuzzy methods are combined for the solid waste energy production plant location selection problem. As a result of the study, the second alternative (Bahsılı-Bedesten) is determined as the most suitable area for waste to energy production plant. Besides, with scenario analysis the effect of criteria on ranking of the alternatives is analyzed.},

This strategy was inspired while we were considering Padé approximant as tensor elements in the proper generalised decomposition for solving partial differential equations. The proposed algorithm can use the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) technique when dealing with a polynomial with floating-point arithmetic. We compare it with Brown’s algorithm and another one, that is based on SVD technique, which is proposed by Corless, in two wedges: multiplication for finite and integral field. Comparison are made in term of time of computation and robustness. The proposed algorithm yields the reduced fractional polynomail with less time complexity than the Brown algorithm and Corless’ one, and that for multiplication in finite, fractional and integral fields. Robustness of the algorithm has been tested too and compared with those algorithms. Tests have shown the ability of removing Froissart doublets and producing reduced fractional polynomials having errors close to the machinery’s precision. This work ends with the integration of the reducing algorithm in the process of PGD methods to reduce rational polynomials considered as tensor elements. Results show the essential utility of the proposed algorithm: producing parametric solutions, with rational polynomials to solve parametric nonlinear equations.},

Considering the cluster characteristics of nodes in complex networks and the time convergence of synchronization, the method of finite-time cluster synchronization, which plays an important role in information encryption/decryption, is investigated and the influence of stochastic disturbance is taken into consideration as well. A two-layer encryption system is proposed, in which the drive layer is used for encryption, and the response layer is used for decryption. The encryption process can be mainly divided into three steps: scrambling preprocessing, encryption function operation, and diffusion. The encryption scheme uses a symmetric encryption method, and both the encryption keys and the decryption keys are disposable and dynamic, which can increase the complexity and security of the keys. A detailed theoretical analysis for the capability of encryption scheme, which has the advantages of great cipher set, fast encryption and decryption speed, good encryption effect, is provided and the time for information encryption/decryption is controllable and predictable. The availability and practicability of the encryption scheme are verified by simulation results.},

  abstract     = {It is crystal clear that discovering the rules for finding a specific pattern among given data for extraction of association rules in rule-based learning systems has been defined in previous researches. Making use of game theory for the processes contributing to discovery of rules can be seen in numerous researches. In recent years, modeling based on game theory in rule learning sphere has gained much more attention for computer scientists. When two or more players use different strategies independently, the strategy game modeling could be used. In this view, strategic play is a desirable model for situations with no permanent strategic relationship among interactions. In addition, Nash equilibrium is the most widely used solution concept in game theory. This concept is a state-of-the-art interpretation of a strategy game. Each player has an accurate prediction of other players’ behavior and acts according to such a rational prediction. In the present study, by extracting rules from frequent patterns we have presented a model that can extract learning rules by abstraction based on game theory, which can be used not only for association rules but also for rule-based learning systems. Also, the introduced method can be easily generalized to fuzzy data. To find Nash equilibrium (FNE) in the proposed method, we used meta-heuristic bus transportation algorithm. The results indicated that the method reduces computational complexity in the associate rule discovery process and rule learning, provided that FNE is solved.},

But the majority of deep learning algorithms have their own limitations, such as slow convergence, high training time, sensitivity to noisy data, the problem of local minimum, etc. A deep learning architecture called Multilayer ELM can overcome these limitations to a large extent where there is no backpropagation and hence saves a lot of training time, eliminates the need to fine-tune the parameters, ensure global optimum, able to handle a large volume of data, etc. As above, the most important feature of Multilayer ELM is the characteristics of its feature space, where the input features can linearly be separable without using any kernel techniques, and it still has not taken any attention from the research community. The paper studies the feature space of Multilayer ELM by considering its architecture and feature mapping technique. To justify the effectiveness of its feature mapping technique, semi-supervised and supervised learning algorithms are tested extensively on the feature space of Multilayer ELM and on TF-IDF vector space. Results from the experiment have shown that Multilayer ELM feature space is more effective than the TF-IDF vector space, and the performance of Multilayer ELM is better compared to the baseline machine and deep learning architectures.},

Named entity recognition (NER), which is the process of determining the elementary units in a text and classifying them with pre-defined categories, plays a significant role to extract essential and usefulness information. However, NER is a challenging task due to the utilized informal text in the Twitter platform such as grammatical errors and nonstandard abbreviations. In this paper, recurrent neural network (RNN)-based approaches considering diversity of activation functions and optimization functions with NER tools are utilized to extract named entities such as organization, person, and location from the tweets. Inputs for RNN models are provided via two different NER tools which are natural language toolkit (NLTK) and general architecture for text engineering (Gate). Then, pre-labeled data are trained via GloVe word embedding technique, and RNN model variants such as LSTM, BLSTM, and GRU are demonstrated. Therefore, outperforming models among RNN variants are presented for predicting named entities. Yellowbrick interpreter is used for evaluation of the proposed method and Wilcoxon signed-rank test are applied on results of two different data sets to demonstrate consistency of the proposed method. In addition, comparison is made with existing machine learning methods. The experiments by utilizing the Nepal earthquake Twitter data set show that the RNN-based approaches achieve good results in finding named entities. In emergencies, the results of this paper can help in reducing the efforts of event location detection and provide better disaster management.},

The paper also explored two-component Weibull mixture distribution (2CMWD) as a suitable model for modeling left-censored mixture data. As the explicit derivations for the estimators of the parameters are not possible, MCMC methods and Lindley’s approximation (LA) have been considered for approximate estimation of the model parameters. The sensitivity of the proposed Bayes estimates with respect to change in sample size, mixing parameter, censoring rates, loss function, prior, true parametric value and approximate methods has been discussed. The reliability characteristics for the left-censored 2CMWD have been studied in detail. The proposed estimators performed efficiently to estimate the parameters and reliability characteristics from the left-censored 2CMWD. The proposed estimators were insensitive with respect to change in censoring rates, true parametric values, prior parameters and mixing weights. Three different real datasets have been used to discuss the applicability of the proposed estimators in different real-life studies.},

In order to verify this finding, we choose the yolov5 model and propose four methods to improve the detection precision of small object based on it. At the same time, considering that the model needs to be small in size, speed fast, low cost and easy to deploy in actual application, therefore, when designing these four methods, we also fully consider the impact of these methods on the detection speed. The model integrating all the improved methods not only greatly improves the detection precision, but also effectively reduces the loss of detection speed. Finally, based on VisDrone-2020, the mAP of our model is increased from 12.7 to 37.66\%, and the detection speed is up to 55FPS. It is to outperform the earlier state of the art in detection speed and promote the progress of object detection algorithms on drone platforms.},

  abstract     = {Linear programming (LP) has long proved its merit as the most flexible and most widely used technique for resource allocation problems in various fields. To solve an LP problem, we have traditionally considered crisp values for the parameters, which are unrealistic in real-world decision-making under uncertainty. The fuzzy set theory has been used to model the imprecise parameter values in LP problems to overcome this shortcoming, resulting in a fuzzy LP (FLP) problem. This paper proposes a new method for solving fuzzy variable linear programming (FVLP) problems in which the decision variables and resource vectors are fuzzy numbers. We show how to use the standard simplex algorithm to solve this problem by converting the fuzzy problem into a crisp one once a linear ranking function is chosen. The novelty of the proposed model resides in that it requires less effort on fuzzy computations as opposed to the existing fuzzy methods. Furthermore, to solve the FVLP problem using the existing methods, fuzzy arithmetic operations and the solution to fuzzy systems of equations are required. By contrast, only arithmetic operations of real numbers and the solution to crisp systems of equations are required to solve the same problem with the method proposed in this study. Finally, a transportation case study in the coal industry is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed algorithm.},

Green supplier selection is one of the vital decisions of supply chain management, as it is preferred for businesses in the market that adopt an environmental approach and green philosophy in line with material and moral benefits. In this context, the problem of choosing the most efficient green supplier is addressed with a three-step methodology using big data analytics that includes an integrated approach and hybrid fuzzy AHP-TOPSIS techniques. First of all, big data plays an important role in delivering meaningful results by reducing complexity to a more fundamental level. It is possible to obtain more consistent results by examining a series of criteria in green supplier selection at a more reasonable and operational level. Thus, the role of big data analytics provides an input for decision-making, which enables a systematic reduction to more concise data. Then, these inputs are evaluated in a fuzzy environment with hybrid MCDM techniques and the most efficient green supplier is determined among the suppliers. This authentic study sheds light on providing a significant competitive advantage to businesses in line with their strategic targets as well as having environmental contributions to sustainability.},

In this article, a novel high-order intuitionistic fuzzy cognitive map (HIFCM) is proposed, where intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) is introduced into fuzzy cognitive maps with temporal high-order structure. By means of IFS, the ability of model for the representation of uncertainty can be effectively improved. In order to capture the fluctuation features of series data, variational mode decomposition is utilized to decompose time series into sequences of various frequencies, based on which fine feature structures on different scales can be obtained. Each concept of HIFCM corresponds to one decomposed sequence such that casual reasoning can be achieved among the obtained features in various frequencies of time series. All parameters are learned by the particle swarm optimization algorithm. Finally, the performance of the method is verified on the public datasets, and experimental results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In comparison with the conventional radio environment, the Cognitive Radio (CR) has numerous security threats as it is flexible together with functions on the wireless network. Attributable to the inherent nature of the technology, the security susceptibility in CR technology, therefore, it is vital to guarantee system security in CRN. So, this paper proposes an optimal Neural Network (NN) model explicitly Brownian movement based Harris Hawks Optimization for Elman Neural Network (BMHHO-ENN) for attaining a secure CRN. Additionally, this paper also proposes Secure Hash Algorithm 2-Rivest Shamir Adlemans (SHA2-RSA) to render safe data communication. Initially, the Amplitudes Modulations signal of PU is deemed as an input. Then, the energy together with Cyclo Stationary features of the inputted signal are extracted utilizing the mathematical model. Aimed at Attack Detection (AD), the extracted features are fed to the proposed BMHHO-ENN. BMHHO-ENN classifies the inputted signal into ‘4’ disparate sorts of attack, and if the signal is not attacked by the intruder, it renders the classification outcomes as “normal”. Lastly, if it is not attacked, then the SHA2-RSA algorithm encrypts that classified normal data and stores it in the cloud for the receiver-side data access to render security. The proposed methods’ outcomes are examined as well as contrasted with the other prevailing methods to show the proposed work’s efficiency for AD along with the data’s security.},

The performance measures of control charts are calculated through Monte Carlo simulation approach by considering the variant symmetric and skewed distributions. Results revealed that control limits of the proposed control charts are observed closest to exact control limits. Also, proposed skewness correction-based location control charts are robust in terms of maintaining the actual false alarm rate close to desire level as compared the existing control charts. Among various proposed location control charts, median and Hodges–Lehmann control charts are observed excellent relative to the others when unknown symmetric distribution is leptokurtic. Among various dispersion estimators, interquartile range and Gini mean difference played maximum role with control charts to maintain the actual false alarm rate.

There are different software-based link quality estimation methods; the prominent methods among them are ETX and Link Quality Level (LQL). The ETX is a method of approximation of the transmitted packets. It uses probe packets to predict the expected transmission count, and it may not accurately reflect the link quality. The proposed Link Quality-Based Objective Function (LQBOF) makes use of the LQL metric which provides better link estimation values than the ETX method. The proposed method intends to provide a more reliable routing based on the link quality. The LQL is estimated through a metric called Packet Reception Rate (PRR). The LQL is calculated and ranked as values from 1 to 7, reflecting the best and worst link quality, respectively. The estimated LQL value is linked with the default ETX in computing the best path. This method intends to increase the reliability of the network. The reliability of the objective function is evaluated with the performance metrics packet delivery ratio, power consumption, throughput, convergence time, control traffic overhead and hop count.},

  abstract     = {Binary information table, multi-valued information table and set-valued information table are three kinds of information systems often encountered in information processing. For any information system, we can often induce different information granular structures, and then construct the corresponding rough set models. Generally speaking, for the same information system, three models of Pawlak rough set, covering rough set and multi-granulation rough set can be induced according to different rules. These three kinds of rough set models are effective tools for data mining and information processing. This paper studies the relationship among Pawlak rough set, covering rough set and multi-granularity rough set induced in binary information table, multi-valued information table and set-valued information table, and obtains many important conclusions. The research content of this paper effectively connects the theories, methods and applications of Pawlak rough set, covering rough set and multi-granularity rough set, which not only enriches the rough set theory, but also expands the application prospect of rough set.},

  abstract     = {The concept of a Sheffer operation known for Boolean algebras and orthomodular lattices is extended to arbitrary directed relational systems with involution. It is proved that to every such relational system, there can be assigned a Sheffer groupoid and also, conversely, every Sheffer groupoid induces a directed relational system with involution. Hence, investigations of these relational systems can be transformed to the treatment of special groupoids which form a variety of algebras. If the Sheffer operation is also commutative, then the induced binary relation is antisymmetric. Moreover, commutative Sheffer groupoids form a congruence distributive variety. We characterize symmetry, antisymmetry and transitivity of binary relations by identities and quasi-identities satisfied by an assigned Sheffer operation. The concepts of twist products of relational systems and of Kleene relational systems are introduced. We prove that every directed relational system can be embedded into a directed relational system with involution via the twist product construction. If the relation in question is even transitive, then the directed relational system can be embedded into a Kleene relational system. Any Sheffer operation assigned to a directed relational system $${\mathbf {A}}$$ with involution induces a Sheffer operation assigned to the twist product of $${\mathbf {A}}$$ .},

A time-varying step size tactic is adopted to increase the global and local searching abilities of the improved MOBCC algorithm. An external archive is created to keep previously found Pareto optimal solutions. A non-dominated sorting method integrating crowding distance assignment is applied to enhance the time efficiency of the improved MOBCC algorithm. A hybrid method combining bacterial individual mutation, oriented mutation of bacterial colony and local search of external archive is applied to enhance the convergence of the algorithm and maintain the diversity of solution set. The framework of MOEAs based on Pareto dominance is integrated into the improved MOBCC algorithm properly through replacements of the bacterial individuals in the bacterial colony, archive operation, and updating of the bacterial colony. The improved MOBCC algorithm is compared with three common multi-objective optimization algorithms SPEA2, NSGA-II and MOEA/D on fifteen test problems and evolution of optimization, and the experimental results confirm the validity of the improved MOBCC algorithm. Furthermore, the effects of the improved MOBCC algorithm’s parameters on the performance of the improved MOBCC algorithm are analyzed.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies have shown that social networks exhibit interesting characteristics such as community structures, i.e., vertexes can be clustered into communities that are densely connected together and loosely connected to other vertices. In order to identify communities, several definitions were proposed that can characterize the density of connections among vertices in the networks. Dense triangle cores, also known as k-trusses, are subgraphs in which every edge participates at least $$k-2$$ triangles (a clique of size 3), exhibiting a high degree of cohesiveness among vertices. There are a number of research works that propose k-truss decomposition algorithms. However, existing in-memory algorithms for computing k-truss are inefficient for handling today’s massive networks. In this paper, we propose an efficient, yet scalable algorithm for finding k-trusses in a large-scale network. To this end, we propose a new structure, called triangle graph to speed up the process of finding the k-trusses and prove the correctness and efficiency of our method. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through extensive experiments using real-world networks. The results of comprehensive experiments show that the proposed algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art methods by several orders of magnitudes in running time.},

The degradation process is a linear uncertain process, and the external shock is described by an uncertain renewal reward process. The reliability and the mean time to failure of the system are calculated by employing uncertainty theory.

  abstract     = {Decision making is a process that ranks or chooses subsets from given sets of options, for example, project proposals or machine tools, with high relevance in industry and economics. Each decision option may be associated with a degree of utility with respect to a specific criterion. Often experts are not willing or able to quantify utilities but rather compare individual pairs of options, which leads to fuzzy pairwise preference matrices. Conventionally, decision making on preference matrices uses scoring indices that exhibit different characteristics. Selecting the most appropriate scoring index is often difficult. Scoring indices are associated with different levels of risk, and none of these indices alone can be considered superior. We show that any fuzzy preference matrix induces interval utilities which can be interpreted as memberships of interval type-2 fuzzy sets, so preference-based decision making has to take into account uncertainty and therefore has to be risk sensitive. We propose a risk-sensitive preference-based decision making method called Pareto optimization of interval utilities (PIU) that chooses a subset of options ranked by degrees of risk. This allows the decision maker to choose an option that represents an appropriate trade-off between opportunity and risk for the given decision problem. Experiments with the YouTube Comedy Slam data set show that PIU compared with conventional scoring methods allows to trade a slight decrease in the best-case utility for a strong increase in the worst-case utility, and vice versa.},
