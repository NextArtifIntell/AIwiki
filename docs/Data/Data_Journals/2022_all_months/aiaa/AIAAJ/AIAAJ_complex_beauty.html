  abstract     = {A novel simplified numerical simulation method for bleed holes in supersonic inlets was developed to estimate the bleed mass flow rate and simulate the flowfield structure in the bleed region. First, the Prandtl–Meyer expansion theory was employed to calculate the location of the barrier shock and reconstruct the flow structure inside the bleed hole. Next, a novel discrimination algorithm was developed to distinguish the grids connected to the bleed hole in the bleed zone instead of directly modeling the hole opening and plenum chamber. Finally, the bleed mass flow rate was obtained based on the boundary-layer properties in the bleed region and the fitting scaled coefficients. This method was also evaluated by performing numerical simulations for a series of different bleeding situations. For all the examined cases, the simulation results were in good agreement with the experimental data, and the number of grid points’ requirement for modeling the bleed hole as compared with the fully resolved method was considerably reduced. Moreover, the proposed method was successfully applied to simulate porous bleed systems in a mixed-compression supersonic inlet. This illustrates that the proposed method is expected to be a useful engineering tool for designing the bleed system of the supersonic inlets.},

This new method is implemented in a practical, unstructured-grid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver and applied to viscous-kernel computations that include evaluations of mean flow viscous fluxes, turbulence-model diffusion terms, and the corresponding Jacobian contributions. The EBV method uses an efficient loop over edges and features a compact discretization stencil based on nearest neighbors. This study verifies the EBV method by comparing its accuracy and iterative convergence with those of a well-established method based on a cell-based approach to discretization of viscous fluxes. Multifold efficiency gains for all viscous-kernel computations on tetrahedral grids are reported, leading to a significant reduction of the overall time to solution.},

  abstract     = {Structural subgrid stress models for large-eddy simulation often allow for backscatter of energy from unresolved to resolved turbulent scales, but excessive model backscatter can eventually result in numerical instability. A commonly employed strategy to overcome this issue is to set predicted subgrid stresses to zero in regions of model backscatter. This clipping procedure improves the stability of structural models, however, at the cost of reduced correlation between the predicted subgrid stresses and the exact subgrid stresses. In this paper, we propose an alternative strategy that removes model backscatter from model predictions through the solution of a constrained minimization problem. This procedure, which we refer to as optimal clipping, results in a parameter-free mixed model, and it yields predicted subgrid stresses in higher correlation with the exact subgrid stresses as compared with those attained with the traditional clipping procedure. We perform a series of a priori and a posteriori tests to investigate the impact of applying the traditional and optimal clipping procedures to Clark’s gradient subgrid stress model, and we observe that optimal clipping leads to a significant improvement in model predictions as compared to the traditional clipping procedure.},

  abstract     = {The present study addresses a multiscale and stochastic design approach for polycrystalline microstructures to achieve a zone of isotropic elastic properties to improve the predictability of the performance of aerospace components. The microstructures are modeled with Orientation Distribution Function (ODF), which is related to the volume densities of crystallographic orientations in a microstructure. The microstructures can have inherent uncertainty due to the variations arising from thermomechanical processing that can alter the component performance. Example design problems are solved for titanium (Ti), aluminum (Al), and galfenol, which are either widely used or have potential applications in the aerospace industry. The level of isotropy for the materials is measured using the available anisotropy index formulas. The optimum microstructure designs are found to provide equivalent stiffness and Young’s modulus values in different directions. Next, property closures for stiffness parameters are generated to demonstrate the ranges of their anisotropy. The closures show that multiple microstructure designs can provide quasi-isotropic elastic properties and the range of material anisotropy is larger for galfenol compared to Ti and Al. Additionally, the stochastic analysis is performed using Gaussian process regression, which is validated with Monte Carlo Simulation. The results show that 10\% uncertainty in the ODFs, due to variations in the thermomechanical processing steps, can cause 1.44, 0.44, and 1.02 GPa of standard deviations from the mean values of Young’s modulus for Ti, Al, and galfenol, respectively. However, the effects of the uncertainty are found to be negligibly small for the anisotropy ratio.},

High-order equivalent-single-layer shell theories based on the through-the-thickness expansion of the covariant components of the displacement field are employed. The novelty of the formulation regards the governing equations solution via implicit-mesh discontinuous Galerkin method. It is a high-order accurate numerical technique based on a discontinuous representation of the solution among the mesh elements and on the use of suitably defined boundary integrals to enforce the continuity of the solution at the inter-element interfaces as well as the boundary conditions. Owing to its discontinuous nature, it can be naturally employed with nonconventional meshes. In this work, it is combined with the implicitly defined mesh technique, whereby the mesh of the shell modeling domain is constructed by intersecting an easy-to-generate background grid and a level set function implicitly representing the cutouts. Several numerical examples are considered for the buckling loads of plates and shells modeled by different theories and characterized by various materials, geometry, boundary conditions, and cutouts. The obtained results are compared with literature and finite-element solutions, and they demonstrate the accuracy and the robustness of the proposed approach.},

Compared with previous higher-order theories, the proposed NRSHT can more accurately forecast the natural frequencies of CSP-GPL through several numerical and experimental tests. Subsequently, the shape and material distribution design of CSP-GPL are studied with multi-objective optimization. The random forest regression (RFR) is utilized as the high-fidelity surrogate model to construct the objective function in the improved Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II), which can significantly accelerate the integration of NRSHT-IGA and NSGA-II. Finally, the Pareto-optimal solutions, optimizing for fundamental frequency and total mass of CSP-GPL, are obtained from the present platform, which can give effective suggestions for the future designer to meet specific requirements.},

  abstract     = {Time-dependent failure possibility-based design optimization (T-PBDO) can minimize the general cost while meeting the failure possibility requirement of aircraft structure in the service life. The accuracy of the T-PBDO solution obtained by existing efficient methods may be problematic in the case of nonlinear performance functions or multiple minimum performance target points. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a new double-loop method based on the adaptive kriging (AK) model and fuzzy simulation (FS), referred to as DL-AK-FS, is used to efficiently solve T-PBDO. In DL-AK-FS, to replace the real constraint performance function for dealing with the time-dependent failure possibility (TDFP) constraint, the inner loop is to adaptively construct a single-loop kriging model of the constraint performance function in the FS candidate sample pool. The outer loop is to search the optimal design parameters by optimization algorithm. The kriging model is first built in an augmented space that is spanned by design parameters and fuzzy inputs, and then it is adaptively and timely updated during the optimization iteration. Moreover, the strategy of reducing the size of the FS candidate sample pool is adopted to further improve the efficiency of analyzing the inner TDFP while ensuring the accuracy of the optimization solution. The strategy of combining FS with the AK model can extend the engineering applicability of the DL-AK-FS in estimating the inner TDFP, which is not limited by the complexity of the time-dependent performance function. The optimization results show that the proposed DL-AK-FS method in this paper is efficient and accurate for solving T-PBDO.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents new insights into the penetration of the freestream turbulence in a turbulent boundary layer. Experiments evidence an increase in the velocity fluctuations and integral length scale across the boundary layer in addition to an increase of the surface pressure fluctuations close to the airfoil trailing edge. This paper proposes a new empirical model to predict the integral length scale inside the boundary layer at the trailing edge of an airfoil subjected to inflow turbulence. The potential increase of the airfoil trailing noise is discussed. The flow mechanism studied in this paper is relevant to the noise prediction of many applications, including vertical-axis wind turbines subjected to high-inflow turbulence winds, generally observed in urban zones. Experiments performed on a NACA 0012 airfoil subjected to inflow turbulence of 10 and 20\% intensity measured the boundary-layer turbulence and the surface pressure fluctuations close to the airfoil trailing edge. Measurements showed that the high-inflow turbulence penetrates the turbulent boundary layer reaching the inner sublayer. A freestream turbulence of 10\% increases the velocity fluctuations inside the boundary layer caused by the larger turbulent structures, whereas an inflow of 20\% turbulence intensity causes the increase of the velocity fluctuations caused by all turbulent scales. Furthermore, the freestream turbulence significantly increases the surface pressure fluctuations at the trailing edge. For an inflow with 10\% turbulence intensity, the surface pressure spectrum increases by more than 6 dB in the entire frequency range. The increase is above 10 dB if the inflow turbulence intensity is 20\%.},

  abstract     = {This paper experimentally studies the flow interaction and the associated noise between an upstream cylinder and a downstream finite-chord-length flat plate with a blunt trailing edge in an acoustic wind tunnel. The configuration of this cylinder–plate model varies by changing the cylinder diameter and the vertical gap between the cylinder and the flat-plate surface. Aerodynamic noise was measured using far-/near-field microphone arrays. The results show that, as compared to the single flat plate, the trailing-edge noise associated with the vortex shedding from the flat plate is significantly suppressed when the gap is : that is, when the cylinder is vertically close to the flat-plate surface. In addition, the corresponding vortex shedding frequency decreases visibly. The leading-edge interaction noise due to the cylinder wake impingement gradually loses its dominance with the increase of the vertical gap. Compared to the single cylinder, the vortex shedding frequency from the upstream cylinder in the cylinder–plate model is reduced slightly due to the acoustic feedback from the plate leading edge. Flow characteristics were measured using surface microphones and particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques. The pressure fluctuations along the plate surface present the dominant frequencies at the leading edge and the trailing edge, respectively, and verify the changes in the peak frequency and its noise level. The PIV technique clearly shows the variation of the vortex–body interaction at the leading edge and the vortex shedding at the trailing edge, revealing the underlying flow mechanism responsible for the observed noise changes and frequency shifts.},

  abstract     = {The use of conditional generative adversarial networks has become popular with the advancement of computer power, and in particular graphics processing units. Large hardware and software companies such as Google, IBM, and Facebook have been experimenting in this field for over a decade for facial recognition, image classification and pattern recognition, and deep fake facial and object design. One essential key to their success is access to large quantities of tagged and classified images, with millions of images typically being used. In contrast, relatively few similar advances have been seen in the engineering sector, mainly because engineering analyses that produce suitable images are often very expensive processes that absorb a considerable amount of effort to generate. In addition, feeding synthetically generated image data back into traditional engineering workflows is not entirely straightforward. In this paper we show how adversarial networks can be used if order images are available and focused on the problem in hand. In particular we show how such images can then be augmented with histograms and glyphs to enhance the image content with pictorial representations of numerical data. This is shown to significantly assist the network training process on our data when used in contexts where numerical data categorizing individual images are available and numerical performance measures of products must be predicted. Crucially, it allows for follow-on analyses without the need to use artificially generated flow fields.},

The relationship equations of strain and kinetic energy were derived. Then, the stiffness and mass matrices of the PCD mechanism were obtained. Based on Timoshenko beam theory, the modal analysis of the PCD mechanism in cantilever state was conducted.

The test geometry, representative of a compliant control surface, consists of an overhanging plate that extends past the edge of a backward-facing step to create a separated region in the flow. This allowed for the study of recirculation effects and unsteady pressure forcing on the cantilevered plate without shock/boundary-layer interactions that would be present if the plate were inclined to the flow. Rigid and compliant test articles were studied to capture the fluid response with and without structural deformation. Schlieren photography and particle image velocimetry showed that under the unsteady conditions during startup of the wind tunnel the flexible plate exhibited a highly dynamic oscillatory response with frequencies similar to its natural vibration response. Under steady, started supersonic flow conditions, the flexible cantilever exhibited smaller oscillations around a mean deflection of two plate thicknesses. Oil flow visualization revealed nontrivial three-dimensionality of the test section flowfield. Modal decomposition of stereo digital image correlation measurements demonstrated that the distinct frequencies present in the flexible plate’s response consistently correspond to the same mode shapes.},

  abstract     = {This study experimentally investigates the effects of the sweep angle and finite wing on transonic buffet, studying two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional wing configurations. Background-oriented schlieren and stereographic particle image velocimetry (PIV) have been used as measurement techniques, performing experiments on an OAT15A airfoil (clamped to both the side windows of the wind tunnel), an unswept wing, and two swept wings with sweep angles of 15 and 30 deg, respectively. The three wings are also based on the OAT15A airfoil and are clamped at the wind tunnel only at their root (free wingtip). All wings have been tested at a constant normal Mach number with respect to the leading edge. The results show that the buffet oscillations are much stronger for the airfoil than for the three finite-span wings. A large difference in the buffet behavior can be noticed between the airfoil and the unswept wing, as is also seen in oil flow visualizations. This difference is particularly evident in correspondence of the more outboard spanwise locations, suggesting that for the unswept wing, an important role could be played by finite-wing effects: notably, the tip vortex. A spectral analysis has shown that for the swept wings, the classical 2-D buffet peak (occurring at for the present conditions) is substantially attenuated, whereas additional contributions in the range of 450–850 Hz appear. The PIV results showed, for the 30 deg sweep angle wing, a periodical occurrence of a secondary supersonic area downstream of the main shock wave structure, which is absent for the other wing models. The stereographic PIV configuration allowed the reconstruction of the spanwise-oriented velocity component, obtaining, in proximity of the trailing-edge, values of the spanwise velocity component which are in agreement with the spanwise convection of buffet cells observed in the literature in this region.},

A number of important lessons and insight are reported regarding the design of the model, the level of success of commonly used mathematical modeling techniques to capture its behavior, sources of analysis/test correlation discrepancies, multifunction utilization of control surfaces for both system identification and flutter suppression, active flutter suppression testing safety, and techniques for estimating the robustness of closed-loop active aeroservoelastic systems by tests. The new system has made it possible to repeatedly push the actively controlled model, using various flutter suppression control laws (safely), to the actual flutter limit in tests numerous times. This capability is just one of the new experimental capabilities that the new system brings to the aeroelastic active control community.},

  abstract     = {Insect wings and biomimetic wings in flapping-wing micro air vehicles (FWMAVs) are flexible and subject to passive deformations, including spanwise twisting and bending. This raises a typical bilateral fluid–structure interaction (FSI) issue, which is conventionally solved based on combined computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and computational solid dynamics (CSD) methods. To reduce the computational cost of this FSI issue while maintaining a reasonable accuracy, a theoretical model with improved adaptability is proposed here. The improvement results from the consideration of spanwise bending: the distribution of which is formulated by a quadratic polynomial. The aerodynamic force is approximated by a predictive quasi-steady aerodynamic model based on the blade element theory. The FSI iteration at a time step is converged within 0.5 s in our model, whereas a traditional CFD–CSD solution takes about 30 s. Compared to our previous model, the current model can better match the experimental measurements of insect wings. Further analysis reveals that considering spanwise bending affects the stiffness design of flexible flapping wings quantitatively. To maintain a high lift efficiency, the structural stiffness of the wing should be appropriately decreased. Our model provides a refined tool for the wing design in FWMAVs and can promote the development of FWMAVs.},

Conventional solutions to this fluid–structure interaction (FSI) topic require considerable computational resources. In this paper, an efficient FSI model is proposed to calculate the aerodynamic force and passive twisting of FRWs. The passive pitching is regulated by a torsional spring, and the twisting is simplified as a quadratic distribution. A well-verified quasi-steady model is employed to estimate the aerodynamic forces. Our results show that the performance of rigid FRWs is superior to twistable FRWs within an upper limit of the wing-root stiffness , which is around . At higher values, the twistable FRWs generate comparable lift to rigid FRWs at a higher efficiency. An increase in flapping frequency can remarkably reduce the efficiency of twistable FRWs despite the lift enhancement, while a concomitant reduction of flapping amplitude can moderate the loss of efficiency at higher flapping frequencies. Our model provides an efficient tool for the quick estimation of the aeroelastic performance of twistable FRWs and can thus contribute to the wing stiffness design.},

The linear/nonlinear ROM approach was demonstrated against previous work in the field for a 2-DOF system and subsequently extended to a 3-DOF (flapped airfoil) system. Excellent agreement was demonstrated at limit cycle oscillation (LCO) onset (flutter) prediction between computational fluid dynamics, linear ROMs, and nonlinear ROMs. Although linear ROMs were sufficient to predict LCO onset, the nonlinear Volterra correction was required to estimate the amplitude of post-LCOs. Corrections that accounted for more coupling between degrees of freedom predicted the amplitudes more accurately. A study was undertaken to determine the minimal training set required to produce reasonable LCO amplitude estimates of the 3-DOF airfoil. A controller was also implemented in an effort to mitigate LCO onset and flutter divergence and to demonstrate the usefulness and power of leveraging the ROM for control design. A full-state feedback controller, tuned via a linear quadratic regulator (LQR), was shown to be effective in controlling the system below LCO onset. However, beyond LCO onset, this specific linear controller structure was observed to be ineffective in controlling the system. Future work will evaluate nonlinear control methods in which the ROM can be deployed as a part of the control system to update the LQR gains in a fully coupled approach.},

Based on comparisons between numerical and experimental results, we show that, provided that the complex shape of the snowflakes is accounted for, the models initially developed for ice crystal icing can also be used to estimate the drag coefficient of a snowflake.

The blade profiles are equipped with rounded leading and trailing edges. The empirical models offer an easy-to-use tool for preliminary design of low-solidity low-speed blade cascades. By means of the models, the lift-coefficient range of 0–1.3 is covered, associated with the drag coefficient varying between 0.02 and 0.14. The validity ranges of the empirical models are as follows: Reynolds-number between and , relative camber ranging from 0 to 8\%, and angle of attack between 0 and 8 deg. The force coefficients are expressed as a function of relative camber, angle of attack, and Reynolds-number. The models assume linear relationships between the Reynolds-number and the force coefficients, as inspired by the literature and justified by statistical means. The dependence of the force coefficients on the angle of attack and the relative camber is expressed by incorporating second-order polynomials. The trends of force changes with Reynolds-number are analyzed. The cases of apparently extraordinary trends in the Reynolds-number dependence (i.e., increasing drag and decreasing lift with increasing Reynolds-number) are discussed in detail. A method for the determination of the confidence intervals related to the models is presented, and a detailed uncertainty analysis is provided. On this basis, the relative errors of the force coefficients can be quantified in a case-specific, empirical manner.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a methodology to scale the stagnation point plasma conditions of an axially symmetric body to a two-dimensional planar body. The method is required to correlate material samples tested under thermochemical loads combined with aeromechanical loads in order to relate the measurements to actual flight scenarios. The equations governing the boundary-layer and heat transfer equations are introduced and analyzed using the commonly known local heat transfer simulation concept. This technique is then adapted to the given constraints and results in a two-step flight-to-ground scaling approach. Flight conditions are first transformed to axisymmetric ground testing equivalents before being scaled to planar bodies. Thereby, the mass-specific enthalpy, total pressure, and Stanton number stay constant; and the velocity gradient doubles when scaling from axisymmetric to planar. Formulations for the velocity gradient are analyzed for both the sub- and supersonic cases. The results are compared between a theoretical approach and plasma wind-tunnel tests. Three heat flux gauges were tested at two conditions. The planar sensors were evaluated with two independent methods, and the results were scaled to a comparable condition. The results compare very well with the theoretically calculated values. The axisymmetric to planar conversion theory detailed in this paper is therefore considered experimentally verified.},

Detailed measurements of the evolution of the velocity deficit and turbulence within the wake along with surface pressure measurements and flow visualization provided a comprehensive database for code validation and flow physics studies. The measurements in the Laminar Wind Tunnel of the Institute of Aerodynamics and Gas Dynamics were performed at a Reynolds number of and comprised surface pressures, oil flow surface visualizations, and hot-wire measurements of the wake. The results at were used as validation data for a hybrid RANS/LES run at the same flow conditions. It was shown that the Bernoulli-based detached eddy simulation (BDES) model, which uses a shielding function based on a localized Bernoulli formulation, combined with effective gray area mitigation can capture the stall cell pattern and the point of flow separation at an angle of attack of .

Three aspect ratios (, 8, and 16) are explored for wings (NACA 0012 cross section) at chord Reynolds number and freestream Mach number . The wings pitch sinusoidally from initial incidence of 4° to a maximum angle of attack of 22° with reduced frequency over one pitching cycle. The three-dimensional unsteady flowfields show similarity among the three wings through laminar separation bubble formation/bursting. The flow topology during dynamic stall exhibits distinctly different evolutions at the higher aspect ratio relative to the lower, baseline aspect ratio. Rather than evolving into a vortex , the higher-aspect-ratio wings show dramatic three-dimensional deformation of the vortex tube that resembles cellular structures. The vortical structure eventually interacts with the trailing-edge vortex, which contrasts with the lower aspect ratio. Examination of the unsteady loads shows an increase in lift slope, average loads, peak loads, and earlier stall with aspect ratio.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with active separation control in a one-sided diffuser test section using pulsed wall jets. Particular focus is laid on the two timescales defining the periodic forcing signal, which are the pulse duration and the time delay between successive pulses . The latter is addressed in a dedicated type of experiment where forcing is terminated abruptly as the flow is allowed to evolve into its natural, separated state. Lasting for a duration approximately 50 times the convective time , this transient process is largely independent of initial forcing conditions. The onset of reverse flow near the diffuser foot is shown to occur after a characteristic separation time of only for a variety of actuation signals when a mean momentum input of is exceeded. Setting the forcing signal according to these flow-inherent quantities is demonstrated to reliably prevent the recurrence of mean reverse flow throughout the actuation period. For such parameter combinations, a systematic reduction of the required mass flow is feasible by reducing the pulse duration , and thereby the duty cycle. Thus, is associated with an equal or even superior control authority compared to the typically used case in the current setup, although only one-third of the mass flow is required. The results presented in this paper therefore promote significant efficiency gains in active boundary-layer control by optimizing the duty cycle of pulsed-jet actuators.},

  abstract     = {This study numerically investigated the characteristics of unsteady aerodynamic forces around a pitching airfoil in the transonic flow regime. The unsteady Reynolds-averaged compressible Navier–Stokes (URANS) equations were solved using a Spalart–Allmaras (SA) turbulence model. The pitching NACA64A010 airfoil at mean angles of attack of 0, 2, 4, and 6 deg with the amplitude of 1 deg and reduced frequency of 0.2 was parametrically simulated. The study found that the trend of the unsteady aerodynamic characteristics around the pitching airfoil, particularly that of the unsteady lift force, significantly changes with the mean-angle-of-attack conditions. The shock-induced boundary-layer separation and reattachment during the pitching oscillation have a crucial role in determining the trend of the unsteady aerodynamic forces, such as the phase-delayed or phase-advanced features for the variation in the angle of attack. The boundary-layer separation during the oscillation, observed at a high mean angle of attack of 6 deg, produces the phase-advanced feature of the lift force. Because the phase-advanced feature is associated with a positive damping effect, the result indicates that the boundary-layer separation may serve as a stabilizing effect on the pitching airfoil motion. The boundary-layer reattachment from separation during the airfoil oscillation, observed at an intermediate mean angle of attack of 4 deg, generates an unusual shock wave movement, resulting in a unique lift loop for the variation in the angle of attack. The study also demonstrated a good prediction accuracy of the URANS with the SA model for the unsteady aerodynamics around the pitching airfoil with the shock and shock-induced boundary-layer separation.},

Many studies have pointed out that the pressure gain performance is significantly related to the inlet area ratio, whereas no criterion for obtaining positive total pressure gain has been established until now. This study performed a series of numerical simulations to investigate the idealized total pressure gain performance of vapor kerosene/air rotating detonation combustor by varying the inlet area ratios and injection total pressures. A preliminary criterion for obtaining positive total pressure gain in vapor kerosene/air rotating detonation combustor is established and then validated with simulation cases and existing research. The results indicate that the total pressure gain increases with the increase of the inlet area ratio and chamber diameter, whereas it decreases with the increase of the injection total pressure. The established criterion can serve as a reference value for the design of the vapor kerosene/air rotating detonation combustor, above which a positive total pressure gain can be obtained.},

  abstract     = {High entry speeds and exotic planetary gases can result in significant radiative heat loads on space capsules. The mechanism behind the transport of radiative signatures is fundamentally different from the conductive mode of energy transport, and penetration of radiative signatures depends on the radiative coefficients of the thermal protection system (TPS) material that protects the space capsule. The radiative coefficients of carbon-based and silica-based fibrous materials have been computed as functions of wavelength using the photon path length Monte Carlo method by explicitly accounting for the microstructure of the material. Significant variations in the radiative coefficients are observed at wavelengths that are relevant to shock-layer emissions. Although carbon-based fibrous materials exhibit higher absorption coefficients in comparison to silica-based systems, the absorption coefficients of carbon-based material drop by two orders of magnitude in the range of 100–200 nm. The radiative coefficients of carbon-based fibrous material are seen to be dominated by scattering and absorption with minimal transmission. However, the transmission coefficients for the silica system dominated the radiative coefficients in the range of 100–1000 nm, which corresponds to most shock-layer emissions. The radiative coefficients are used to solve the radiative transfer equation using the P-1 approximation to obtain the in-depth radiative heat flux. The total energy equation for decomposing porous TPS materials is solved with the radiative heat flux from the P-1 approximation and the conductive heat flux using the Fourier law. It is observed that peak temperatures inside the material are higher when radiative transport is explicitly accounted for through the P-1 approximation. Small variations in the absorption coefficient of the silica-based materials also affected the in-depth temperature profiles. Additionally, a broader temperature distribution is obtained inside the material with a low absorption coefficient, and the charring density profiles are influenced by the radiative heat flux. This study demonstrates that it is important to include radiative transport in material response solvers, and radiative coefficients must be accurately computed by accounting for the microstructure of the material.},

Analysis indicates two primary modes of sheet breakup: perforation driven and wave driven. While perforation-driven breakup is not seen for the lowest gellant concentration case, 0.10 wt.\%, the wave-driven breakup is present in all cases within the range of investigated jet velocities. Based on the observations, a mechanism involving feedback between the impingement point and the sheet vertex, and a separation front initiated in between the impingement point and the sheet vertex are proposed for the wave-driven breakup.},

  abstract     = {Previous studies have demonstrated that treatments such as a canopy or finlets placed within a boundary layer can shield surfaces from unsteady pressure fluctuations without substantially compromising the aerodynamic performance. This paper describes research into fundamental mechanisms of this phenomenon known as pressure shielding. Unidirectional canopy is an idealized surface treatment which consists of a streamwise array of rods cantilevered at the downstream end, inspired from the downy coating on owls’ wings. Experiments show that such a canopy attenuates the surface pressure in two distinct frequency ranges. At low frequencies associated with convective scales much greater than the canopy height, the attenuation spectra show scaling on the Strouhal number based on canopy height. At high frequencies, associated with convective scales of the order of the canopy height or lower, a dissipation-type frequency scaling appears more appropriate. The ratio of streamwise distance over the height is an important parameter at the low-frequency regions of attenuation, while the open-area ratio controls the broadband magnitude of attenuation spectra. Spatial and temporal correlations further shed light on the effects of the canopy in reducing the larger, energetic turbulent structures associated with the wall jet unsteady surface pressure fluctuations.},

  abstract     = {Optimization of composite laminates requires the satisfaction of constraints where the design ply thicknesses and orientations can only take discrete values prescribed by the manufacturers. Heuristics such as particle swarm or genetic algorithms are inefficient in such cases because they provide suboptimal solutions when the number of design variables is large. They also are computationally expensive in handling the combinatorial nature of the problem. In contrast, with the help of binary decision variables, mixed integer programming can be adopted to optimize such laminates efficiently. This paper presents an approach to reformulate lamination parameters and failure constraints as functions of binary decision variables. The buckling load maximization for a simply supported laminated plate is initially demonstrated using integer linear programming. Next, the laminate weight is minimized by varying the number of plies for a given external bi-axial compressive load and subjected to buckling and material failure constraints. A variation of laminate weight minimization is demonstrated by fixing the number of plies and assuming discrete changes in ply thicknesses. This is achieved using a sequential two-level optimization for laminates having uniform ply thickness. Finally, a scalability study is performed to evaluate the performance of mixed integer programming for different problem sizes. It is demonstrated that all three formulations with integer programming achieve significant performance gain and robustness over standard heuristic solvers.},

This work carries complete novelty research on the strength analysis of the CMC guide vane based on bimodulus constitutive relation, including structural design, temperature computation, advanced constitutive equation application, and stress analysis. Based on tensile and compressive tests, the bimodulus properties of two-dimensional CMC material was given, and a novelty bimodulus constitutive model was defined by stress or strain: both of which were developed to achieve a finite element method. Applying the bimodulus constitutive model in a uniaxis compressive test and beam bending model, the different forms of constitutive equations were compared. Then, the bimodulus constitutive equation was used to analyze the stress of the guide vane. Considering the weaving technique of preforms and manufacturing processes, this study discussed the manufacturing feasibility of the CMC guide vane, where the detailed structures were totally duplicated by a metal guide vane. After giving the weaving structure of the guide vane, a new algorithm and plug-in were developed to achieve the assignment of the material’s coordinate system in the guide vane finite element model. By computing the temperature field with a coupling fluid and flow transfer model, the accurate temperature was considered as an important premise for accurate stress analysis. The results indicated that the connection region between the platform and airfoil was vulnerable as a result of stress concentration. Stress analysis by nonlinear constitutive model and guide vane thermal load test got similar conclusion to verify the applicability of bimodulus consititutive equation.},

In this study, a novel uncoupled static aeroelastic analysis method is demonstrated for determination of the aeroelastic response of three-dimensional wings for the first time. The results indicate that this uncoupled static aeroelastic analysis method is capable of accurately predicting the pressure and displacement fields of a flexible wing, exhibiting at most a 2\% error relative to traditional coupled aeroelastic analysis results and a 2.3\% error relative to experimental results. Additionally, because the fluid and structural solvers are uncoupled, it is herein demonstrated that the uncoupled static aeroelastic analysis method is capable of reusing a single computationally expensive fluid data set to evaluate multiple internal wing structural configurations across a range of angles of attack while maintaining similar levels of accuracy, thereby reducing the total computational expense by as much as 70\%. Furthermore, it is also demonstrated that the uncoupled static aeroelastic analysis method is suitable for preliminary design optimization of the internal structure of wings, which may experience either simple (bending only) or complex (bending and twisting) deformation.},

To extend the algorithm to multistage applications, a robust mixing-plane technique and its fully implicit treatment are crucial. In this work, a mixing-plane approach featuring 1) flux conservation, 2) implicitness, 3) one-dimensional nonreflectiveness, and 4) robustness in handling reserve flow is proposed and incorporated into the existing Newton–Krylov turbomachinery computational fluid dynamics solver. Following a flux-based approach that ensures exact flux conservation, the algorithm of the proposed mixing-plane method is first rigorously derived, and implementation details into the existing single-row RANS solver are then discussed, with emphasis on the fully implicit treatment of the mixing-plane fluxes. Finally, the fully implicit multistage flow solution capability is extended to the corresponding adjoint solver. The resulting algorithms are tested on a subsonic and a transonic compressor to validate the flow solution accuracy, verify the adjoint sensitivity, and demonstrate its robustness in handling reverse flows.},

Accordingly, this approach proposes an analytical strategy to investigate the exact effect of using three-dimensional (3D)-RACS in order to determine the sound transmission loss (STL) coefficient of a sandwich panel. Therefore, the dynamic equations of fluid–structure interaction are extracted using 3D stress distribution, and then the obtained equations are solved analytically based on the state vector method. The reliability and precision of the outcomes are checked according to previous works. The results obtained are significant because the designed sandwich model seems to improve the sound characteristics of the system based on the STL comparisons between the current approach and the single-layer plates as well as sandwich panels with other core geometries. The achievements of this study can provide novel insights into the STL of 3D-RACS sandwich systems with a complex core model.},

Improved attenuation of fan noise with acoustic liners and the reduction of fan noise at the source remain key technology challenges for civil aviation in the foreseeable future. Over-tip-rotor (OTR) acoustic treatments have been investigated experimentally during the last decade, and significant fan noise reductions have been measured, most recently using a single rotor and multiple lined circumferential grooves. This paper describes an analytical OTR prediction model in which the fan noise is modeled with point or distributed, static or rotating monopole and dipole sources based on Green’s functions for infinite hard or lined cylindrical ducts containing uniform mean flow; these are combined with an anechoic or unflanged inlet termination and an embedded finite length lined section in which the rotor-alone source is located with its OTR liner. OTR liner insertion loss predictions are obtained for comparison with data from the W-8 NASA experimental rig. These yield peak broadband in-duct noise reductions of up to 4 dB, in line with the measurements.},

  abstract     = {High-fidelity large-eddy simulations (LESs) are performed to investigate aeroacoustic characteristics of jets issuing from twin rectangular nozzles with an aspect ratio of 2:1 at two overexpanded conditions and the design condition. For all three jet conditions simulated, LES predicts qualitatively similar near-field flow statistics to those measured at the University of Cincinnati. Using the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings method, LES captures the fundamental screech tone and its harmonics fairly well at multiple observer locations in the far-field. Intense jet flapping motions in the near field along the minor axis, which are influenced by jet-to-jet interactions, are found to correspond to those frequencies. Moreover, the predicted overall sound pressure levels are within 1–2 dB of the experimental measurements. However, the screech tones appear to be intermittent, as the twin-jet interaction pattern varies irregularly. To extract dominant flow structures at the screech frequencies and identify the twin-jet coupling modes, spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) analysis is used. SPOD analysis recovers energetic peaks at the screech frequencies, and the corresponding leading modes indicate strong upstream radiation originating from the fifth/sixth shock cells. For the two overexpanded conditions, the leading modes show antisymmetric coupling in the minor axis at the fundamental screech frequencies. In contrast, the two jets behave symmetrically with respect to each other in the major axis, in line with the absence of jet flapping in this direction. Furthermore, the leading SPOD eigenvalues turn out to be, at least, two orders of magnitude larger than higher-order eigenvalues, suggesting potential of reduced-order models for the twin-jet screech.},

The spatial distribution and magnitude of the modeled body force applied in the simulation are calibrated to an experimental dataset for both steady and unsteady flows. When the actuator forcing undergoes a step change from off to on, it is found that the flow response downstream of the actuators is initially inverted in terms of the streamwise vorticity, disturbance velocity, and wall shear stress before approaching the steady-state behavior. This behavior to a step change in actuator forcing, known as a nonminimum phase response, is consistent with the experimental data. At planes downstream of the actuators, the peak streamwise vorticity propagates toward the wall after the actuators are activated, which is consistent with a tilted structure in the boundary layer. Between the locations where the vorticity enters the downstream plane and the wall, a region of secondary streamwise vorticity of the opposite sense is found. This secondary streamwise vorticity causes the inverted disturbance velocity and shear during the off-to-on portion of the cycle. In addition, a starting vortex, which is generated above the steady wall jets produced by the actuators, leads to a peak output in the intensity of the streamwise vortices generated when the actuators are activated.},

First, the large-scale structures associated with the phase-locked modal velocity field obtained from spatial input–output analysis are shown to closely match those computed based on hot-wire measurements. The approach is then used to further investigate the response of the boundary layer to the synthetically generated large-scale structures. A quadrant trajectory analysis indicates that the spatial input–output response produces shear stress distributions consistent with those in canonical wall-bounded turbulent flows in terms of both the order and types of events observed. The expected correspondence between the dominance of different quadrant behavior and actuation frequency is also observed.

  abstract     = {Self-sustained shock wave oscillations on airfoils, commonly defined as shock buffet, can occur under certain combinations of transonic Mach numbers and angles of attack (AoAs) due to the interaction between the shock and the separated boundary layer. To improve the understanding of this complex phenomenon, the flow over a supercritical profile (OAT15A) was experimentally investigated for a fixed Reynolds number of and numerous aerodynamic conditions within the ranges of and . Deformation and force measurements were used to assess the actual rigidity of the model and its interaction with the flow. The tracking of the shock location by means of background-oriented schlieren allowed for studying the shock features and the frequency content of the buffet flows. Furthermore, the inversion of shock motion and buffet onset, which are referred to as buffet boundaries, were estimated. The inversion of shock motion proved to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for buffet onset. The trends of the results showed a good agreement with the relevant literature cases. However, the buffet amplitude was smaller, and buffet onset occurred at considerably higher AoAs. The comparison of the literature results also revealed a general sensitivity of buffet features to both numerical and experimental parameters. For this reason, the influence of the boundary-layer suction at the vertical walls and the gap flow at the side windows on the buffet features was examined. The buffet frequencies and amplitudes were slightly affected, but the buffet boundaries appeared to be virtually insensitive to these factors. Given the large number of investigated aerodynamic conditions, these results are valuable for validation purposes of computational fluid dynamics simulations.},

  abstract     = {In supersonic-combustion ramjets (scramjets), fuel is injected, which should mix rapidly with the supersonic crossflow to minimize the length of the scramjet. Tandem dual-jet injection has shown improved mixing performance over single-jet injection. However, experiments on tandem dual-jet injection have not addressed the jet shear layer, in which the mixing occurs, yet. The present study investigates the jet shear layer, as well as the bow shocks in front of the jets, in a continuous air-indraft supersonic wind tunnel at Mach number 1.55. A schlieren setup has been used for visualizing the flow features. A largely automated algorithm for processing schlieren images has been developed to determine the location of the upper boundary of the jet shear layer. The penetration of the jet is studied as a function of 1) , the ratio of the momentum of the jet and that of the crossflow, and 2) the dimensionless distance between the dual-jets. An empirical similarity relation has been established for the time-averaged location of the jet upper shear layer as function of and , covering the investigated conditions (, ). This empirical similarity relation provides , the spacing for maximal penetration of the jets as function of .},

The shock wave system was controlled by changing the location of the conical centerbody. Depending on the blockage condition at the center, the shock wave over the cone exhibited either a weak or strong solution; moreover, in the intermediate condition, a dual-solution domain was observed. In a critical condition, the strong shock solution of the dual-solution domain could transition into a weak shock solution even after the entry of a single thermal bubble with an energy of 5.1 mJ. In other conditions, the transition was realized only by repetitively supplying thermal bubbles with an appropriate repetition frequency. At a center, e.g., the strong-to-weak transition was achieved with a repetition frequency of 30 kHz. However, at a frequency of 50 kHz, unfavorable interactions among the thermal bubbles resulted in unsuccessful transition.},

  abstract     = {The phenomenon of a shock train experiencing rapid forward movement when climbing upstream in a conventional rectangular isolator with incident shocks has recently been investigated. Although several studies have concentrated on the modeling of this phenomenon, few works have focused on methods to alleviate the problems caused by it. Therefore, a distributed fluidic control method is proposed herein, which combines distributed slot injections at the isolator walls and boundary-layer suctions at the corners of the downstream part of the isolator through return pipes. The control effect of the concept is verified by experiments in a Mach 3 test section. First, a rectangular isolator with incident shocks is tested to reproduce the phenomenon of a shock train accelerating suddenly when surmounting a reflection point in the background waves. Then, different fluidic control methods are proposed to demonstrate that the rapid movement of the shock train in a rectangular isolator can be effectively controlled through distributed slot injections, employing a closed flow cycle built by return pipes. According to the experimental results, when the shock train forms and climbs upstream in the isolator, the secondary flows are ejected toward the core flow from the distributed slots at the upstream part of the shock train, which increases the boundary-layer momentum and decreases the pressure gradient of the shock train head. The distributed injections induced compression similar to that induced at a compression surface. The shape of the slip line changes gradually as the backpressure increases. Moreover, the maximum sustainable backpressure is less affected.},

Budget analysis shows that pressure–dilatation and dissipation dominate the transport of the transverse stresses, which are further analyzed in the context of linear analysis. Data suggest that amplification factors for transverse stresses follow -scaling in both wrinkled and broken regimes. Unlike the amplification of streamwise stresses, no transition is observed to a regime where transverse stresses depend solely on the mean Mach number, at least for the conditions studied here.

  abstract     = {A compressibility correction for models is proposed, and it explicitly takes the effects of high Mach numbers and wall-cooling into account. The correction is validated by a recent set of direct numerical simulation databases with and without pressure gradient. The proposed compressibility correction is based on the correspondence between eddy viscosity in compressible and incompressible turbulence, which shows that the standard models estimate incorrect values of eddy viscosity in the near-wall region of a hypersonic turbulent boundary layer with a cold wall. For a range of Mach numbers between 2.5 and 14, and wall-to-recovery temperature ratios between 0.18 and 1, the correction collapses the eddy viscosity profiles on the incompressible data and predicts significantly improved velocity, temperature, skin friction, and wall heat transfer coefficient profiles. The present approach is independent of the eddy viscosity definition and Reynolds stress model, and it can be implemented easily in any model by modifying the closure coefficients of the production and destruction in the equation. Furthermore, the formulation is completely local and is disabled as the effects of compressibility disappear.},

Linear stability theory is applied on the cone base flow with both smooth and wavy surfaces first.

The development of instabilities is then characterized using surface flush-mounted pressure sensors and focused laser differential interferometer (FLDI). The FLDI measurement is conducted within the wavy wall zone both at troughs and at crests. Good agreement is found between the surface pressure measurement and computation, except that instability waves are invisible shortly downstream of the wavy wall. Additionally, bispectral analysis indicates that the nonlinear interaction of instability waves downstream of the wavy wall region is suppressed. FLDI measurement along the streamwise direction shows that the second mode instability waves disappear in the wavy wall region, and the boundary-layer transition process is delayed. Spatial measurement with FLDI of boundary layer identifies various types of disturbance at the troughs and crests; moreover, the co-existence of low-frequency and high-frequency disturbances is observed off the wall surface downstream of the wavy wall.},

Its aim is to accelerate the numerical exploration of geometrically nonlinear aeroelastic systems over large design spaces or multiple flight conditions. The parametric reduced-order models are obtained from high-dimensional models by Krylov-subspace projection. They are subsequently interpolated to acquire realizations inexpensively anywhere in the parameter space, where having the state space as opposed to interpolating an output metric permits the use of linear analysis tools. The interpolation scheme is heavily conditioned by the available training points; thus, a novel methodology based on adaptive sampling and a combinatorial use of the available true-systems knowledge is presented, whereby we reuse all known data of the true models as different combinations of training and testing data to build statistical surrogates of the interpolation error across the parameter space and refine the sampling in those regions that need it. This minimizes the number of costly to evaluate function calls and ensures that parameter space regions are sampled according to the underlying system dynamics. The initial implementation of this adaptive sampling strategy is demonstrated on a very flexible wing with a complex stability envelope.},

In high-dimensional nonlinear problems of fluid dynamics, data representation often greatly affects the performance and interpretability of machine learning algorithms. With the increasing application of machine learning in fluid dynamics studies, the need for physically explainable models continues to grow. This paper proposes a feature learning algorithm based on variational autoencoders, which can assign physical features to some latent variables of the variational autoencoder. It is theoretically proved that the remaining latent variables are independent of the physical features. The proposed algorithm is trained to include shock wave features in its latent variables for the reconstruction of supercritical wall Mach number distributions. The reconstruction accuracy and disentanglement are compared with those of other variational autoencoders. Then, the proposed algorithm is used for the inverse design of supercritical airfoils. The proposed algorithm demonstrates the ability to manipulate certain physical features of an airfoil without changing the others, as well as the ability to generate different airfoils with the same physical features by sampling the disentangled latent variables.},

  abstract     = {For engineering design optimization, the full-space formulation offers the potential for greater efficiency than the more commonly used reduced-space formulation. This potential is greater when the numerical model involves discretized partial differential equations or coupled disciplines. However, the full-space formulation results in a larger optimization problem with at least a factor of two increase in the number of optimization variables and equality constraints. Using Newton-type methods to solve such problems involves solving a large-scale and, often, ill-conditioned Karush–Kuhn–Tucker linear system at each optimization iteration. This can be time-consuming to solve even with a Krylov solver. If the number of iterations is reduced, the full-space formulation could be applied to a broader class of problems. This paper presents an inexact quasi-Newton algorithm with an adaptive extension for solving large-scale equality-constrained optimization problems. The new algorithm inexactly solves the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker system using new inexactness criteria that are derived to ensure a descent direction. The adaptive extension chooses the stopping condition of the Krylov solver by also taking its convergence rate into account. The paper presents results of numerical experiments applying this algorithm to three types of problems: six constrained optimization problems from the widely used CUTEst test suite, a bar thickness optimization problem, and a two-dimensional topology optimization problem. For all problems, the new algorithm consistently shows a roughly 50\% reduction in the total number of Krylov solver iterations and a minimum of roughly 15\% reduction in the optimization time. Moreover, the proposed approach for selecting the Krylov solver tolerance shows an improvement in all cases, whereas the existing forcing-parameter approach shows an increase in the number of Krylov iterations in some cases. These results indicate that this new method for selecting solver tolerances is effective and robust, and a good choice in algorithms that use a Krylov solver for solving the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker linear system.},

  abstract     = {In this work, optimization-under-uncertainty (OUU) is treated by simultaneously minimizing the mean of the objective and its variance due to variability of design variables and/or parameters in a multi-objective setting, while simultaneously ensuring that the minimal probability of constraint failure is met. This allows the designer to choose its robustness level without the need to repeat the optimization as typically encountered when formulated as a single objective and ensuring that the system will not fail with a prescribed probability. To account for the computational cost that is often encountered in OUU problems, the problem is fitted in a Bayesian optimization framework. The use of surrogate modeling techniques to efficiently solve problems under uncertainty has effectively found its way in the optimization community leading to surrogate-assisted OUU schemes. The surrogates are often considered cheap-to-sample black-boxes and are sampled to obtain the desired quantities of interest. However, since the analytical formulation of the surrogates is known, the mean square predictive error of the quantities of interest can be derived. To obtain these quantities without sampling, an analytical uncertainty propagation and reliability analysis through the surrogate is presented. The multi-objective Bayesian optimization framework and the analytical uncertainty propagation and reliability analysis are linked together through the formulation of the reliability-based robust expected improvement. To further enhance the efficiency of the approach, the Bayesian optimization method is solved in an asynchronous manner. In doing so the novel Surrogate-assisted Asynchronous Multi-objective optimization under Uncertainty framework for Robust and reliable solutions to Applications in Industry (SAMURAI) scheme is defined. The method is applied to a number of case studies and the design of a low- airfoil for blended-wing–bodies, which proves the effectiveness of the novel methodology.},

  abstract     = {With the increase in air traffic over the past decades, the reduction of aircraft noise is one of the major challenges facing stakeholders. Flight operating conditions that decrease noise may possibly increase the fuel consumption of aircraft, which is an important factor in airline cost management. In this paper, we propose a methodology to support flight path planning with the aim of optimizing both perceived noise and fuel consumption. We decompose an aircraft flight trajectory into surface and altitude paths to model relevant air transportation constraints. The shortest path for the surface projection is found using Dubins path method and an improved algorithm, which considers guide points according to the flight destination, runway angles, spatial separation of aircraft near the airport, population distribution, and steering motion. The altitude path is optimized for low-perceived noise and low-fuel consumption, which is determined by solving the longitudinal governing equations of motion of flight using the distance computed from this surface path. A modified nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II for discrete optimization is developed to obtain Pareto fronts of the optimum altitude paths with reduced computational effort. The methodology is demonstrated by simulating flights departing from Hong Kong International Airport to two compulsory air-traffic-service reporting points. The results are then compared with Quick Access Recorder data and Standard Instrument Departure (SID) tracks. Although certain factors in air transportation that affect departure path planning, such as weather patterns and air traffic mix, are not considered in this method, the resulting surface path exhibits a close similarity with SID tracks. The resulting Pareto fronts of the altitude path exhibit reductions in fuel consumption and perceived noise levels. The tradeoffs between fuel consumption and perceived noise levels are also discussed based on the relevant flight physics for the different routes.},

  abstract     = {A method of controlling vibration and harvesting energy for whole spacecraft is proposed by designing a device integrating lever-type nonlinear energy sink (LNES) and giant magnetostrictive material (GMM), which is installed in a whole-spacecraft system model. The amplitude and voltage data of the whole-spacecraft structure under sine sweeping excitation are captured using Simcenter Testlab (LMS) software and an oscilloscope. The experimental model is modeled as a two-degree-of-freedom main system with a nonlinear system. The magnetostrictive effect of the GMM is examined using the Jiles–Atherton model. The experimental results (that is, the transmissibilities, formant frequencies, and voltages) confirm that this device can achieve efficient vibration control and harvesting energy under different working conditions. Moreover, appropriate parameter selection can enhance its performance, which is consistent with our theoretical analysis. In summary, the theoretical and experimental results suggest that a LNES–GMM device can reduce amplitude and generate electrical energy without significantly changing the natural frequency of the whole-spacecraft system.},

  abstract     = {The effect of varying submergence on the transonic flow past canonical wall-mounted hemispheres is investigated at a freestream Mach number using delayed detached eddy simulations. Four submergence levels are considered, ranging from a full hemisphere (100\% exposed) to a highly submerged case where the equator is well below the waterline (40\% exposed). Analysis of the mean and unsteady features indicates that the shock foot and line of surface separation move downstream with submergence. However, the frequency associated with the streamwise motion of the shock remains consistent between the cases in terms of a suitably nondimensionalized Strouhal number . Proper orthogonal decomposition is used to isolate and rank the different modes; as the hemisphere is submerged, there is an evident change in prominence from the asymmetric “shifting” to the symmetric “breathing” mode. Dynamic mode decomposition was used to investigate the spectral content of these modes; the results show that the breathing mode collapses at a frequency of for all cases, while the shifting mode extends over a broad frequency range of between 0.13 and 0.21. Aero-optic analysis shows that the distortion for the more submerged hemisphere cases is associated primarily with the breathing mode, while for the fully exposed hemisphere the shifting mode is dominant.},

  abstract     = {Thermal aberrations are the main impediments for high-energy transverse multimode lasers to achieve high brightness and beam qualities. To address this issue using adaptive optics, traditional wavefront sensing methods have great limitations for aberration correction in high-energy transverse multimode lasers, because these lasers are no longer point sources. The general extended-object wavefront sensor (GEWFS) invented by the authors can work with extended sources in real time, and it is highly suitable to solve this problem. The application of the GEWFS into the compensation of thermal aberrations in a high-energy laser is preliminarily investigated by means of a simulation experiment. In this simulation experiment, a transverse multimode laser diode simulates a high-energy laser, a and phase plate thermal aberrations, which is compensated by a closed-loop adaptive optics system mainly composed of the GEWFS and a membrane deformable mirror. Simulation experimental results show that the peak intensity of the laser beam image is improved about 2.35 times, and the approximate Strehl ratio of the laser system attained 0.90. The results indicate that the GEWFS is simple and accurate enough for wavefront sensing from extended sources, and it will greatly expand the application fields of adaptive optics.},

  abstract     = {Modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) plays a key role in the development of all systems, but especially so in the development and integration of electro-optical (EO) subsystems and lasers for precision strike applications or counter measures that require precise pointing control. Since the development of the first EO and laser systems, the directed energy community has pursued an evolving modeling and design (M&amp;D) approach to support the development of these systems to provide the data and insights needed for the acquisition process. M&amp;D is the lower-level detailed engineering models that are used to define and perfect the design (mechanical, optical, electrical, software), whereas M&amp;S is typically the higher-level engagement models embedded in the mission and war game simulations. When the M&amp;S is closely tied to the M&amp;D, the M&amp;S will accurately represent the system capabilities and limitations. This paper presents an M&amp;D methodology that has matured over the past years and continues to be applied on current EO and laser programs. Similar to other development methodologies utilized by government agencies and industry, the M&amp;D methodology is critical for airborne EO-laser systems, where the operating environment is especially hostile to achieving microradian pointing accuracy and jitter stability in the optical line of sight. Applying the M&amp;D methodology early and often throughout the development process in conjunction with the model-based systems engineering approach, the M&amp;S can fully integrate into the life cycle of EO-laser programs from the development of requirements, the verification of design, the prediction and verification of performance, and the defining of system capabilities and limitations, to the maintenance and upgrades to the system. This disciplined connectivity of M&amp;S to the M&amp;D will lead to cost-effective EO-laser systems.},

The results demonstrate that the characteristic frequencies of bending–torsional coupling vibration are the combined frequency of the high-pressure (HP) and low-pressure (LP) rotor. The response mechanism of the bending–torsional coupling vibration under the coupling action is explained by reconstructing excitation signals at different rotational speed ratios of the HP and LP. The bending–torsional coupling experiments of the dual-rotor system under the conditions of the fixed and variable speed ratios are carried out by using the dual-rotor test rig. The characteristic frequencies of the bending–torsional coupling are verified, which provides a theoretical basis for the determination of the bending–torsional coupling vibration of the dual-rotor system.},

Toward the same, we employ multiscale detrended partial cross-correlation analysis to evaluate the interdependencies and cross-correlation structure between various thermomechanical variables and tracked order vibration across multiple time scales. We leverage the understanding of complex correlation structures and subsequently use them to model tracked order vibrations.

  abstract     = {Excessive vibration during high-speed flights is a critical issue in modern rotorcraft. The aeroelastic design of the composite rotor blades can relieve the hub vibratory loads of the rotor that are a dominant source of these vibrations. However, it has many technical problems, such as a high-dimensional design space, narrow and discontinuous feasible regions, and highly nonlinear design indices. Although the surrogate-based design is known to improve the design results, the conventional surrogate models have an insufficient capacity to represent the nonlinearity of aeroelastic responses. Because the inaccuracy of the surrogate model is combined with the discontinuity of feasible regions during the optimization process, it is likely to converge to local optima. Cluster kriging could accurately represent the complicated physical relations using machine learning techniques, such as soft clustering and classification algorithms. The accurate surrogate model results in a global optimization with 56\% vibration reduction, whereas the global approximation using a single kriging yields local optima with 39\% vibration reduction. Furthermore, a comprehensive design analysis, conducted to investigate the underlying physics of the vibration reduction, confirms the global optimization. The proposed design method can fully use the multidisciplinary nature of aeroelastic responses, which is not considered in conventional design methods.},

The compatibility conditions at the interface are weakly imposed using either Nitsche’s method or Lagrange multipliers, and results are benchmarked against interface-fitted discretizations. Nitsche’s method shows a direct dependence on a penalty parameter, and the Lagrange multiplier method requires additional degrees of freedom but yields robustness. The convergence rate of the discretized forms is computationally determined and shown to be optimal for eigenvalue analysis of both Timoshenko beams and Mindlin plates.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this work is to propose an innovative global/local approach for the failure onset analysis of deployable composite thin and ultrathin structures. The adoption of this technique allows for overcoming the weaknesses related to the commercial calculation codes, which make use of three-dimensional finite elements to capture the local stress field arising within the booms. In this framework, the proposed approach leads to a reduction of computational cost while keeping a high level of accuracy. This is possible thanks to the Carrera unified formulation, which allows for the modeling of higher-order plate elements for the analysis of local critical regions of complex composite assemblies. To show the potentialities of the global/local approach, particular attention is given to the problems that mostly characterize composites, among which are those related to the free edge, the failure concept, and the interlaminar continuity of the displacements and shear stresses. The analyzed booms are the triangular, rollable, and collapsible; a tape-spring hinge; and a telescopic tubular mast. The results show a perfect accuracy of the in-plane stress components and an accurate description of the out-of-plane components, which is essential for a reliable design of these components in terms of free-edge debonding and failure phenomena.},

  abstract     = {Composite tape-spring hinge (CTSH) is a simple yet elegant mechanical component for various deployable space structures. This paper formulates and addresses cut-out shape optimization of a CTSH, which is seldom touched upon in literature. Both the maximum strain energy stored during the folding process as well as the maximum bending moment during deployment were maximized in a concurrent way, and the multi-objective optimization problem was realized by merging data-driven surrogate modeling and shape optimization. Four different surrogate modeling techniques (radial basis function, kriging, Gaussian process regression, and artificial neural network) are evaluated and compared. The maximum stored strain energy at the fully folded state and the maximum bending moment during deployment for the optimal CTSH are increased by 50 and 35\%, respectively, compared to the initial design under a previously developed composite failure criterion as constraint. To ensure reproducibility and foster future research, we publicly share our full implementation with the source codes and trained models with the community.},

To achieve high surface accuracy of the deployable structure in the presence of model parameter uncertainties caused by manufacturing and assembly errors as well as complicated space environments, an active surface adjustment method for a space deployable structure based on interval model updating and the kriging model is proposed. First, the initial finite element model is modified by the interval model updating based on the universal gray number to reveal the inherent relationship between the adjustment amount and surface accuracy. Second, based on the updated model, the sensitivity analysis of the adjusting rod is carried out to reveal the influence degree of the adjusting rod on the displacement of the surface measuring point so as to determine the position of the adjusting rod quickly. Then, the interval optimization model of the surface accuracy adjustment is established. Next, the optimal adjustment amount is determined through optimization iteration combined with the kriging model. Finally, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed active adjustment method.},

Therefore, here we compile a table of roughness correlations with unified notation, in chronological order, listing the parameter ranges and the roughness types used in their development, noting idiosyncrasies. Overall, the table shows that tested roughness types have increased in generality from regular roughness features to random surface elevations, and that the independent parameters of primary importance measure size (e.g., height), frontal area (e.g., slope), and coverage (e.g., skewness). In addition to the need for more data to populate the parameter space, outstanding questions facing practitioners are filtering and sampling of multiscale surfaces, and the treatment of heterogeneous surfaces, with answers appearing on the horizon.},

  abstract     = {Swirling flows are widely used to increase fuel mixing in air propulsion systems, and the swirl intensity affects combustion efficiency significantly. We propose a novel one-dimensional model to predict the swirl number and directional Mach numbers for compressible swirling flows inside annular nozzles. Limitations of previous models are addressed via asymmetric wall shear stress, compressible friction factor for boundary-layer thickening, turbulent viscosity, wall heat transfer model, and so on. The proposed model is validated for turbulent flows inside convergent–divergent (CD) and straight annular nozzles. Compared to inviscid modeling, significantly improved predictions are observed. While the effects of compressible friction factor and wall heat transfer model are significant, the effect of turbulent viscosity decreases as inlet Mach number increases. The present model is applied to parametric studies to examine physical effects. For CD annular nozzles, the viscous effects on discharge coefficient and thrust efficiency are examined, and consistent results with previous studies are observed. For straight annular nozzles, the effects of primary parameters are examined. In both subsonic and supersonic cases, the axial changes of azimuthal Mach number depends mainly on the wall shear stress. In a subsonic case, the swirl number decreases to the downstream, and an optimal ratio of inner and outer radii minimizing the swirl decay rate exists. In a supersonic case, however, the swirl number keeps increasing, and the slope increases monotonically over Gamma.},

A single database of high-fidelity lattice Boltzmann simulations is employed in the training of the network, achieving accurate predictions for long simulation times for a variety of test cases representative of bounded and unbounded configurations. The capacity of the network to extrapolate outside the manifold of examples seen during the training phase is demonstrated by obtaining accurate acoustic predictions for relevant applications, such as the scattering of acoustic waves on an airfoil trailing edge, an engine nacelle, or an in-duct propagation. The study focuses on the influence of three main design parameters that allow rolling out accurate and stable long-term predictions: 1) the choice of a dataset-related characteristic time, 2) the normalization of the input data, and 3) the number of input temporal frames into the neural network. The results show that for the optimum choice of design parameters, the presented data-driven model is able to systematically obtain low-error prediction at a lower computational cost than the reference high-fidelity computational code.},

It is well known that they influence the boundary-layer transition and its development. However, their influence on aeroacoustic quantities (in particular, on the airfoil trailing-edge noise) is not yet fully understood. This paper discusses the relationship between the trip height and the boundary-layer development and radiated trailing-edge noise. Wind-tunnel experiments were performed with zigzag strips and grit elements placed on the surface of a NACA 0012 airfoil. The roughness trip heights ranged from 17 to 214\% of the undisturbed boundary-layer thickness at the trip location. The chord-based Reynolds number varied from to . This paper shows that trip heights within 50 to 105\% of have little influence on the near field and the trailing-edge noise. However, trips with increase the spectra of velocity and pressure fluctuations in the low-frequency range up to 2.5 and 3 dB, respectively, resulting in an increase of the trailing-edge radiated noise up to 4 dB in a similar frequency range. In summary, this paper shows the importance of carefully defining the roughness trip used to trigger a laminar–turbulent transition in aeroacoustic and aerodynamic measurements.},

  abstract     = {When characterizing spatial coherence properties of turbulent boundary-layer surface pressure fluctuation data, it is important to determine the local flow direction first. Without flow direction, it is very easy to introduce errors due to misalignment between sensors and the flow. For cases with two-dimensional microphone distributions, a method of determining flow direction from the orientation of the coherent pressure in spatial domain was introduced recently. If the data are analyzed in wavenumber domain, flow information can be obtained by the position and orientation of the convective ridge. In this publication, flow directions determined from a revised spatial domain approach and from two wavenumber domain approaches are considered. It was found that the result from the spatial domain approach and the result from the orientation of the convective ridge are similar for most frequencies, while the result based on the position of the convective ridge differs in the lower frequency range. Tilted convection of coherent structures in the turbulent boundary layer is discussed as a possible cause of these observations. A modification of the analytical model for surface pressure coherence is derived that takes the findings into account.},

We devised a statistical objective function that minimizes the uncertainty of estimates using a novel, linear formulation of absorption tomography with velocimetry (LATV). Beam arrangements that minimize the uncertainty of LATV reconstructions consequently maximize confidence in mass flow rate estimates; such arrangements are identified, subject to physical constraints on the pitch and catch optics.

Surface pressure fluctuation is an important source of information about the nature of the dynamic environment of an aircraft and its airborne store during flight. The research effort reported herein focuses on developing a capability to estimate dynamic loads at subsonic flight. The wall pressure was acquired in a captive flight test during straight and level flight. The captive flight store was instrumented to measure surface pressure in flight. A methodology that considers the prediction of wall pressure levels and power spectra for the attached turbulent boundary layer in captive flight environment is presented. Empirical formulas to model the wall pressure spectra are evaluated and tested. Although the model was developed to evaluate the pressure spectra of free-flight missiles, it seems to also provide good estimation of the wall pressure during subsonic captive flight. The spectral analysis of the pressure fluctuations shows results consistent with the available theoretical and experimental data. This research is primarily intended for applications related to noise generation from structures exposed to high-speed subsonic flow.},

The key to obtaining successful multifidelity models lies in properly capturing the correlation between low-fidelity and high-fidelity data. In this work, we propose to apply transfer learning to discover representative features that better correlate the multifidelity data to improve the accuracy in multifidelity flow reconstruction. Essentially, transfer learning facilitates the modeling task through transferring the knowledge learned in a related task, thus improving model performance in multifidelity problems. In particular, a typical class of transfer learning based on domain adaptation is introduced to discover domain-invariant features from the flow data of multiple sources. Two transfer learning frameworks via either the transfer component analysis or the geodesic flow kernel are established, providing different concepts to match transferred features between multifidelity data. Thereafter, the transferred features can be used as inputs to build the bridge function between low-fidelity and high-fidelity data for flow reconstruction. The proposed transfer learning methods are tested by various cases with increasing complexity, including heat convection, the Burgers equation, and transonic flows past a NACA0012 airfoil and an ONERA M6 wing. Advantages of the proposed transfer learning method to obtain better feature representations and to help construct more accurate multifidelity models for flow reconstruction are presented.},

Many deep learning models have been used for the rapid prediction of flowfields. However, the prediction accuracy may be insufficient, and the model generalization ability is questionable. Because a computational fluid dynamic evaluation of the cruise condition is usually necessary and affordable in industrial design, a novel deep learning model is proposed to use the cruise flowfield as a prior reference for the off-design condition prediction. A prior variational autoencoder is developed to extract features from the cruise flowfield and to generate new flowfields under other operation conditions. Physical-based loss functions based on aerodynamic force and conservation of mass are derived to minimize the prediction error. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can reduce the prediction error on test airfoils by 30\% as compared to traditional models. The physical-based loss function can further reduce the prediction error by 4\%. The proposed model illustrates a better balance between time cost and fidelity requirements as well as better generalization ability, which makes the model more feasible for industrial applications.},

Near-field decomposition, on the other hand, has been neglected due to the failure to divide pressure drag directly into its contributions to both form and wave drag. The work presented in this paper is an extension of previous research conducted into partial pressure fields that allow such a near-field drag decomposition. In particular, the current paper proposes a new partial pressure field that captures wave drag sources in two-dimensional compressible viscous flow. Pressure decompositions are performed on the conventional NACA0012 and RAE2822 airfoils, and the results are compared to those obtained by classical far-field decomposition, with reference data from previous studies providing a means of verification. Finally, the slotted natural laminar-flow airfoil, the S207, is analyzed to test the applicability of the decomposition method on multielement airfoils that are considered for next-generation aircraft design. It is demonstrated that an adjusted compressible pressure field captures wave drag as a reliable near-field method that correlates closely with the traditional far-field methods, particularly for typical transonic cases.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the extension of the Kutta–Joukowski theorem to unsteady linear aerodynamics. Starting from the formulation developed by Theodorsen for the solution of the velocity potential for circulatory flows around thin, rectilinear airfoils, the frequency response function between bound circulation and circulatory lift is derived. To provide a formulation suitable for time-domain applications, two finite-state approximations of the Kutta–Joukowski frequency response function, with different degrees of complexity and accuracy, are also proposed. The validity of the derived unsteady Kutta–Joukowski theorem is verified by correlation with numerical predictions of the circulatory lift given by a validated boundary-element-method solver for potential flows. Furthermore, the proposed finite-state approximations of the unsteady Kutta–Joukowski theorem are applied to problems concerning the circulatory lift response to damped oscillatory airfoil motion and gust perturbation. The higher-accuracy finite-state model provides predictions that correspond perfectly to those obtained by the convolution integrals of the step responses given by the theories of Wagner and Küssner. The results given by the simpler finite-state model derived from the linear approximation of the frequency response function are satisfactory for low-frequency problems, and are compared with those provided by a widely used approximate unsteady version of the Kutta–Joukowski theorem available in the literature.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates, for the first time, the effects of compounding transient airfoil motions and the predictive capability of the linear superposition principle in vortex dominated flows. Significant increases in the peak lift and nose-down pitching moment were observed during the second of two transient plunging motions at a poststall angle of attack. The load response of the second motion was estimated through linear superposition of the first motion response with a surprising level of accuracy. Flowfield measurements revealed this performance to coincide with a constructive merging of leading-edge vortices (LEVs). LEV merging showed sensitivity to motion timing. Breakdown of the linear superposition prediction coincided with LEV detachment and trailing-edge vortex formation, which disrupted constructive LEV merging. The amplitude of the second motion showed no discernible effect on LEV merging, and subsequently the accuracy of the linear superposition prediction. An extension to periodic motion was investigated, where linear superposition of a single sinusoidal cycle was compared with the true periodic response. This was found to capture the mean lift increase for low to moderate reduced frequencies. Lift amplitude, however, was captured with reasonable accuracy across the range of reduced frequencies and amplitudes tested.},

  abstract     = {An unstructured, pressure-based algorithm, IRK-SIMPLER, is developed for simulating two-dimensional incompressible flows over moving bodies. The Navier–Stokes equations in the arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian form are discretized using collocated, median-dual control volumes with a flux correction method. The semidiscrete form is integrated in time using a diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta method. The unstructured discretization of the spatial computational domain is composed of a circular body-fitted grid, a rectangular patch grid, and a background grid. The motion of the bodies is decomposed into a series of rotations and translations. Rotation is achieved by rotating the body-fitted grid along with the body and flipping the edges of the appropriate cells. Translation is achieved by morphing the patch grid as the body moves. For large translational displacements, the rectangular patch grid is moved with the body and rematched with the background grid to obtain a new conforming grid. The algorithm is validated for multiple incompressible flow cases.},

  abstract     = {This study aims to quantify suction velocities for hybrid laminar flow control of a vertical fin by taking data and model uncertainties into account. Because suction velocities cannot be measured directly, they are calculated using the Darcy–Forchheimer model, which needs the pressure distribution and porosity characteristics as input. Uncertainties in the pressure distribution are characterized using a novel data fusion method incorporating wind-tunnel and numerical data. Furthermore, geometrical uncertainties of the airfoil that alter the pressure distribution are considered. Two methods are proposed to model the porosity characteristics of the surface: one of which uses a local representation, and the other a global representation. In addition, the modeling error of the Darcy–Forchheimer model is estimated. These input uncertainties are quantified and propagated by Monte Carlo sampling through the Darcy–Forchheimer model. It reveals that local information on the porosity characteristics is essential for accurate suction velocity estimates for this specific application. A sensitivity study shows that the most influential contribution to the variance of suction velocities is the uncertainty in the porosity characteristics, followed by uncertainties in the pressure distribution. The model error and uncertainties in the reference pressure are shown to have a negligible influence.},

This solver composes a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based flow solver with dynamic mesh techniques, a one- degree-of-freedom structural solver for a pitching airfoil, and a time-delayed proportional–differential controller that actuates the nonlinear camber morphing of the airfoil. The modules of the structural solver and the controller are both implanted into the CFD-based flow solver OpenFOAM. The proposed solver is first validated with the aerodynamic stall and stall-flutter experimental results, and then it is used for investigating the stall-flutter suppression performance in the time domain with nonlinear camber morphing. The numerical results with various time delays in the active control suggest that the time delay significantly impacts the response suppression effect of the stall flutter. The closed-loop controls with time delays ranging from 0.01 to 0.15 s can suppress stall flutter. The suppression effect reaches the best when as it reduces the amplitude of the limit-cycle response by 60\%. The active control mechanism of the time-delayed camber morphing is analyzed in terms of the flow pattern and energy transfer in depth.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a time-domain feedforward control scheme for alleviating gust response by using a seamless wing morphing technique. The morphing device is composed of a variable cambered trailing edge flap and two symmetrically disposed seamless transition structures. The former is explicated by spatiotemporal polynomial surface fitting, which maintains the medium camber’s length. The gust response of the elastic wing is calculated by a modal superposition-based fluid–structure interaction method, and its accuracy is verified with wind tunnel experiments’ results. Afterward, the effect of the time delay on gust response is investigated. The influence of freestream velocity and gust amplitude on the time delay is revealed for an optimal feedforward controller. The results demonstrate that the freestream velocity affects the phase offset between the sinusoidal gust and the wing-morphing motion, and the phase offset of 0 deg corresponds to the optimum time delay. Furthermore, an attached leading-edge vortex arises in the case of a large-amplitude gust, but it does not significantly affect the time delay. The vorticity and pressure distributions in the flowfield indicate that the wing morphing influences the attached leading-edge vortex’s spanwise size and changes the aerodynamic distribution, thereby affecting the gust response.},

  abstract     = {Supersonic multistream engines with single-expansion ramp nozzles use splitter plates to separate the core from bypass streams. The resulting shear-layer instability imposes unsteady loading on proximal surfaces and generates acoustic tones. The present work develops a passive control strategy to alleviate these effects. The thick splitter plate subcomponent of the full configuration is isolated, and Mach 1.6 and sonic boundary layers are allowed to develop on either side to form the shear layer. Instability mechanisms and optimal forcing-response characteristics are identified from linear analysis of time-averaged large-eddy simulations (LESs). These results are then used to guide splitter plate trailing-edge modifications with different wave numbers and amplitudes to interfere with the internal forcing mechanism. LESs of the altered configurations at small wave numbers reveal a diamond-grid-like pattern of cells and dislocations, similar to those observed in low-speed active control studies. Modal decomposition displays an increase in rank behavior, with the dominant mode in good agreement with linear predictions. At large wave numbers and amplitudes, where nonlinear effects are stronger, LESs show that control introduces streamwise vorticity into the wake, reduces coherent structure size (streamwise correlation length) and inhibits the tonal content. These effects are confirmed in companion experiments.},

  abstract     = {One technique for capturing shocks with high-order methods is through artificial viscosity. The key considerations of this approach are 1) deciding the amount of artificial viscosity to add; 2) maintaining stability and efficiency of the nonlinear solver; and 3) ensuring accuracy of the resulting solutions, particularly in the presence of strong shocks. To address consideration 1, we test a switch based on intraelement solution variation as well as one based on the difference between the solution and its low-order projection. To address consideration 2, we forego a complete linearization of the artificial-viscosity contribution to the residual in order to keep the residual Jacobian stencil compact. To address consideration 3, we introduce the viscosity in a piecewise-continuous fashion to avoid spurious entropy production. Furthermore, we use output-based error estimation and mesh optimization on the drag and the total enthalpy error, as well as with entropy variables, to minimize the output error. We test the shock capturing method coupled with mesh optimization on aerodynamic flow applications ranging from transonic to supersonic, which are discretized using the standard discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and hybridized DG methods. One of our findings is that the mesh optimization through error sampling and synthesis algorithm does not always generate the ideal mesh in the presence of strong shocks.},

Thus, three key modifications based on the physical mechanisms and multiple unstable modes, which involve the addition of source term in the transport equation, reconstruction of pretransitional viscosity, and reformulation of the control function of effective turbulence viscosity, are constructed to make it possible to predict the hypersonic transition process. Numerous validation test cases are chosen to adequately access the prediction accuracy of the current transition model, including flat plates and blunt cones with different Reynolds numbers, a double ramp, an inlet model with composite shock interference flow, and three-dimensional X-51A forebody model. The flow structures and heat transfer distributions predicted by the numerical simulation are well consistent with experimental data, which demonstrate the capability of improved V-SST transition model in accurately predicting hypersonic transition behavior and reasonably reflecting the influence of freestream unit Reynolds number. It needs to further investigate the performance of the current model in capturing unusual transition phenomenon such as heat transfer overshoot, and consider more physical influence factors on boundary-layer transition.},

The model geometry and the flow conditions are selected to match the experiments conducted in the Boeing/AFOSR Mach 6 Quiet Tunnel at Purdue University. The geometry consists of a nominally sharp 5 deg half-angle cone, followed by a cylindrical segment, and then a 10 deg flare. Additionally, flare half angles equal to 8 and 12 deg and nosetip radii equal to 0.1, 1, and 5 mm are studied. An axisymmetric separation bubble is generated as a result of the laminar shock–boundary-layer interaction in the cylinder–flare region. The comparison of the laminar flow solution and the schlieren images shows a remarkable agreement between the respective locations of both the boundary-layer edge and the reattachment shock. The linear amplification of first and second Mack mode instabilities that begin to amplify in the cone region are computed with a combination of the parabolized stability equations and the harmonic linearized Navier–Stokes equations. The predicted frequency spectra of the surface pressure fluctuations associated with both planar and oblique instability waves capture the distinct lobes within the disturbance amplification spectra measured with PCB® and Kulite sensors. To our knowledge, this represents the first successful comparison between convective instability analysis and measured surface pressure fluctuations for a hypersonic configuration with a separation bubble. Finally, the global instability analysis shows that the laminar flow becomes supercritical for flare half angles larger than 8 deg.},

Supercooled droplet icing tends to occur at the front of the engine, and ice crystal icing tends to occur inside the engine (engine core region). The risk associated with engine icing to flight airworthiness and safety has been confirmed with several reported inflight incidents, especially for ice crystal icing. This includes ice accretion on critical components of an engine, followed in some instances by ingestion into the combustor, where engine icing can problematically cause flow blockage, surge/stall, or flameout. This comprehensive survey on engine icing provides a broad discussion of the environmental conditions that cause engine icing, including the atmospheric water phase (supercooled droplets vs ice crystals icing) and the aero-thermal-fluid physics that cause specific types of ice accretion (rime, glaze, etc.). The engine components that are most susceptible to each type of icing and the associated engine icing problems (mechanical, operational, etc.) are also identified, along with key recent developments in understanding the physics and characteristics of ice crystal icing.},

  abstract     = {A common issue with morphing structures is that the actuators must work against significant structural and aerodynamic stiffness. The concept of passive energy balancing (PEB) aims to ameliorate this, and thereby reduces system mass, by connecting negative stiffness elements to the actuated degrees of freedom. However, these devices can be complex to design and will also add their own mass to the system. It is therefore difficult to determine the potential for system-level mass saving without significant detailed design effort. This work treats a PEB device as essentially a local energy storage mechanism. This framework leads to an approach to optimization that will deliver a lightweight PEB mechanism in addition to reducing actuator requirements. It also allows a high-level method to obtain an approximate evaluation of system-level benefits with only basic information about the application being considered, by comparing general properties of the actuators used to the energy storage properties of the underlying materials used in the PEB device. The work concludes with a case study that shows how the PEB can potentially reduce system mass both through reduced energy consumption requirements and actuator mass savings, and can work particularly well for actuators with nonideal stroke/force profiles.},

By matching different refinements in different cross sections, it is able to apply higher-order beam theories in highly deformed regions, to capture complex buckling and postbuckling behavior, whilst retaining the computational efficiency offered by lower refinements elsewhere. The exemplar structure for this paper is the tape spring—a commonly proposed component of deployable structures with ability to combine self-deployment, via a release of stored strain energy, with locking into a relatively stiff geometric configuration with a curved cross section. To simulate localized folds due to a flattening of the cross section, the arc-length method with an automatic increment technique is employed.},

A sensitivity study presents the effects of different solution parameters, such as the number of modes and sensors used and the measurement noise. The method is then applied to an experimental test case of the Pazy wing that undergoes very large deformations of 50\% span. The wing is equipped with fiber optic strain sensors and a motion-tracking camera system that provides the reference displacement data. The modal data are extracted experimentally, and the scheme is validated using data from a structural loading test. The method is used in a wind tunnel test to map the wing’s deformations from measured strain data. Results are compared to those of a linear modal strain-to-displacement transformation method and to displacements computed by direct integration of the measured strains. The process is shown to yield superior results in cases of large deformations.},

  abstract     = {The buckling and postbuckling behavior of two composite tow-steered shells with cutouts of different sizes is assessed using nonlinear finite element analysis and compared to experimental measurements. The cylindrical shells are manufactured using an automated fiber placement system, where the shells’ fiber orientation angles vary continuously around the shell circumference from on the crown and keel to on the sides. One shell features thickness variations due to tow overlaps that result from application of all 24 tows during each pass of the fiber placement system. The second shell uses the system’s tow drop/add capability to achieve a more uniform wall thickness without overlaps. Unreinforced cutouts of two different sizes—the first smaller cutout representing a passenger door on a commercial aircraft and the second larger cutout a cargo door—were machined into each of the two cylinders resulting in a total of four test cases. These cylinders were tested in axial compression and buckled elastically in previous work and are now analyzed using nonlinear finite element models to compare bifurcation buckling loads as well as the load–displacement response in the prebuckling and postbuckling regimes. For all four shells analyzed, the prebuckling stiffness, buckling load, and deformation mode sequence throughout the loading–unloading cycle is accurately reproduced by the models. In particular, the shells first buckle locally around the cutouts in a stable (supercritical) manner with only a slight decrease in axial stiffness, which occurs due to the favorable load redistribution facilitated by tow steering. The shells then buckle globally in an unstable (subcritical) manner with diamond-shaped buckles forming to the left and right (circumferential direction) of the cutouts. The buckling load of all shells with cutouts is at least 82\% of the buckling load of the pristine shells without cutouts. Overall, the ability to sustain local buckling phenomena, and the relatively small reductions in global buckling load compared to pristine shells without cutouts, demonstrates the great potential of using tow steering to mitigate the adverse effects of cutouts in axially compressed shell structures.},

Thus, its nonlinear effect due to high SPL is studied in this paper. A jet simulation of mesh orifices (two-dimensional slits) is conducted. It reveals that an approximation to the nonlinear loss in an existing model (“A Model for the Acoustic Impedance of Linear Suppressor Materials Bonded on Perforated Plate,” AIAA Paper 1981-1999, Oct. 1981) includes implicitly linear loss and neglects the effect of the orifice distribution uniformity, and so the nonlinearity of distributed micro-orifices is overestimated. This accords with the experimental result in an impedance tube that the high-SPL resistance is overestimated for a fine mesh. Meanwhile, it is indicated that the discharge coefficient is overestimated in the existing model for neglecting the vena contracta at least at the maximum jet of a coarse mesh, and so the high-SPL resistance is underestimated. Therefore, the nonlinear loss factor is defined herein to exclude the linear loss and avoid the deviation from the jet contracta of the mesh, which presents a better prediction. Finally, an empirical relation of considering the orifice diameter and a correction to the reactance are given experimentally, and thus, a more accurate impedance model of the wire mesh liner is established.},

The framework is based on the semidiscrete modeling approach that can be seen as a good compromise between continuum and discrete methods. The enhanced semidiscrete damage model (ESD2M) tool set comprises a smart meshing strategy with failure mode separation, a new version of the enhanced Schapery theory with a novel generalized mixed-mode law, and a novel probabilistic modeling strategy. These three joined components make the model efficient in capturing failure modes such as matrix cracks, fiber tensile failure, and delamination, as well as their interactions with high fidelity, while taking material nonuniformities into account. The model capabilities are demonstrated using single-edge notched tensile cross-ply laminates as an example. The ESD2M was not only capable of capturing the complex damage progression but also provided insights and explanations for some of the failure events observed in the laboratory. The presented framework efficiently integrates failure mode predictions with probabilistic modeling and enables Monte Carlo simulations to predict the ultimate failure strength with good accuracy, as well as its scatter.},

  abstract     = {A linear geometrical stiffening model is developed for a rotating beam with an asymmetric cross section undergoing coupled stretch–bending–torsion motion. The model is verified for a twisted and tapered Timoshenko beam mounted on a rotating hub with a presetting angle. The floating frame of reference formulation is adopted where the configuration of the deformable beam is described by using different coordinate systems. Three coordinate systems, viz., inertial reference frame attached to the center of the rigid hub, local reference frame attached to an arbitrary point on the elastic axis of the undeformed beam, and body reference frame attached to the point on the elastic axis of the deformed beam, are defined. The global position vector of an arbitrary point on the beam is specified using a coupled set of reference and elastic coordinates. Reference coordinates define the location and orientation of a body reference frame, and elastic coordinates describe the beam deformation about the body reference frame. For a rotating beam problem, reference and elastic coordinates give the angular displacements of the hub and elastic deformations of the beam, respectively. The expressions for the kinetic and strain energy of the deformable beam are derived. The inertial coupling between the reference and elastic coordinates in the kinetic energy expression is identified as a gyroscopic coupling term. Further, the inertial mass matrix, spin softening matrix, and centrifugal stiffening matrix are obtained from kinetic energy expression. The elastic stiffness matrices, which are independent of elastic coordinates, are derived from strain energy expression. According to the Rayleigh–Ritz method, the elastic coordinates are expressed using a series of admissible functions that satisfy the geometric boundary conditions of a fixed-free beam. The ordinary differential equations of motion are then derived using Lagrange’s equations. A set of dimensionless parameters is identified after the nondimensionalization of the equations of motion. Due to the skew-symmetric nature of the gyroscopic coupling matrix, the eigenvalue problem is not amenable to classical modal analysis. Therefore, a complex modal analysis method is used to determine the modal characteristics. The results from the present model are verified with those available in the literature. The results are also compared with those obtained from the three-dimensional finite element method using ANSYS. The effect of these dimensionless parameters on the modal characteristics of a rotating blade is studied.},

Then, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism is introduced by constructing the ET condition based on the control input directly, saving the signal transmission resource from the controller to the AECS. Next, a switching law with sampling is developed, economizing the signal transmission resource from the switching law to the AECS. Furthermore, based on the ET mechanism and switching law, an antidisturbance controller is designed to compensate for or suppress the influence of the multiple disturbances on the AECS. Also, under the ETAD control approach, relative theoretical conditions are established to save the signal transmission resource and to suppress or compensate multiple disturbances. Finally, using a hardware-in-loop platform with a switched aeroengine model inserted, a simulation is implemented to validate how the established ETAD control strategy is effectively applied to the AECS.},

The wing encountered LCO when the wingtip deformation was approximately 25\% of the span. The onset velocity, frequency, and mode shape varied, depending on the test’s AoA. The paper first focuses on the onset of the oscillations, where the onset velocity and oscillation mode-shapes are analyzed. The paper then continues to investigate the LCO characteristics and the nonlinear behavior of the wing. The wing models and experimental data are publicly available through the Third Aeroelastic Prediction Workshop.**},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a method for estimating flutter bifurcation diagrams of systems described by time-domain state-space models. The method estimates the bifurcation diagram by quantifying changes in the recovery rate in the preflutter regime. The recovery rate is approximated from the state velocity, overcoming the need for transient output data in existing methods that use this quantity. Demonstration examples involve an analytical system and a typical section with smooth nonlinearities in the pitch degree of freedom. The proposed method captures the bifurcation type and the amplitude trend of the bifurcation diagram without transient or iterative calculations, and with no assumed knowledge of the postflutter dynamics. These features ease applications that involve flutter bifurcation analyses for many parameter choices and in automated processes, from design space exploration to optimization.},

The aim of this concept is to take advantage of passive vibration of an elastic membrane in the air to enhance mixing, which energizes the flow near the blade surface. As a result, flow separation on blades can be delayed or even suppressed, widening the usable range of angles of attack for a general-purpose airfoil having a wide range of applications. During the experiment, the blade model was connected to a rotary table with an attached stepper motor, which allowed the angle of attack to vary. A two-component balance was used to measure the lift and drag forces on models, and a smoke-wire technique was adopted to visualize the flowfield around the tested airfoil. Influences of geometric parameters of the PDMS on the effectiveness of flow separation control over the airfoil were systematically analyzed. The results suggested that with the appropriate thickness and Young’s modulus the airfoil having the leading-edge membrane displayed better aerodynamic characteristics such as a delay in dynamic stall angle and higher lift-to-drag ratio at relatively large angles of attack compared to its conventional counterpart. As PDMS is an inexpensive, durable, and readily available material, the present study therefore provides a potentially feasible approach for passive flow separation control in numerous aeronautical and turbomachine applications.},

Specifically, we investigate the resulting impacts on aeroelastic stability. In the primary analysis presented, we assess a wall-mounted configuration for an airfoil section of a two-dimensional wing. This morphing-wing system comprises a torsional spring at the trailing-edge flap hinge, which induces the morphing phenomenon. The behavior of this system is studied within the context of divergence and reversal. The analysis following this examines a highly flexible flying-wing configuration, subject to a transient morphing scheme. The geometries corresponding to the unmorphed and morphed configurations are acquired from a physical morphing trailing-edge wing prototype, and the structural modeling and cross-sectional properties are obtained using the Gmsh tool and variational asymptotic beam sectional analysis. Furthermore, we evaluate the effects of the geometric variations on the aeroelastic stability through leveraging the computer program, NATASHA (which stands for nonlinear aeroelastic trim and stability analysis of high-altitude long-endurance aircraft). The results obtained from this analysis insinuate the favorable impact on the aeroelastic stability of the system, namely, in terms of flutter characteristics.},

Then, the problem for identification of parameters of the nonsmooth aeroelastic system is modeled as a nonlinear least-squares problem between the measured data and the calculated response. A new strategy that can obtain the nonsmooth parameters sensitivity matrix accurately is proposed, and then the parameters are identified through the enhanced response sensitivity approach.

  abstract     = {The turbulent wake generated by a rotor interacting with outlet guide vanes (OGVs) is one of the dominant broadband noise sources in a turbofan engine. An accurate representation of the rotor wake turbulence is therefore important for the reliable prediction of the rotor–OGV interaction noise. This paper presents a turbulence synthesis method based on a spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) representation of the turbulent wake that aims to reproduce the desired velocity cross-spectrum along the OGV leading edges where noise is emitted due to turbulence–OGV interaction. The method is first developed in the frequency domain based on a superposition of vortical modes with the appropriate amplitudes. Fourier modes and POD modes are proposed to represent the two-point velocity spectrum. The POD modes will be shown to be highly efficient in reconstructing the flowfield near the tip region where a large-scale coherent structure is present. An extension of the POD synthetic turbulence method to the time domain is also presented by means of a white noise filtering technique to allow the generation of time-varying velocity signals with the desired cross-spectral characteristics. The results show that both the one- and two-point statistics can be closely reproduced. The proposed frequency-domain POD synthetic turbulence method for fan broadband noise prediction for a realistic fan–OGV configuration is illustrated by the use of a frequency-domain linearized Navier–Stokes solver to predict the sound power radiation due to each vortical mode. Overall sound power levels at a number of discrete frequencies are predicted and compared against measured noise data. Agreement is found to be within the uncertainty of the noise sound power measurement.},

The flow behavior on the blade surface and around the propeller is investigated with oil-flow visualizations and particle image velocimetry. At and 0.6, vortex shedding from the LSB causes high-frequency noise that appears as a hump in the far-field noise spectra. Forcing the location of the boundary-layer transition suppresses the LSB and, consequently, the hump, reducing the noise emission of about 5 and 10 dB at and 0.6, respectively. The fact that the hump is caused by LSB vortex shedding noise is further assessed by using a semi-empirical noise model; it shows that the hump is constituted by tones of different amplitudes and frequencies, emitted at different spanwise sections along the blade.},

Nonflat-plate serrated trailing edge can suppress the broadband trailing-edge noise at high frequencies, while the overall noise reduction is compromised by low-frequency narrowband bluntness-induced noise at the sawtooth root. In this paper, a nonflat-plate transition-serrated trailing edge is proposed to reduce the bluntness-induced noise. The configuration uses a wedge-shaped transition structure within the sawtooth gap to eliminate the bluntness noise. Firstly, the appropriate parameters of the transition structure are determined by numerical simulation. Then, optimal configuration is employed for test verification. Finally, the noise reduction mechanism of the configuration with the best noise reduction is analyzed. Simulation results indicate that the configuration can accelerate the fragmentation of large-scale spanwise vortices at sawtooth root, weakening the vortex shedding noise. Moreover, compared with the nonflat-plate serrated trailing edge, it forms counter-rotating oblique vortices at a position further forward within the sawtooth gap, promoting transverse flow, thereby reducing broadband noise over most frequencies. Experimental results show that the configuration with an appropriate transition structure can afford the highest reduction of 27.2 dB for the bluntness-induced noise and 5.7 dB for the trailing-edge noise.},

The ICD was built using flexible honeycomb covered on both sides with a thin wire mesh to ensure maximum turbulence reduction. The performance of the ICD was assessed both aerodynamically by means of hot-wire and total pressure rakes, and the fan noise emission was recorded by a microphone array. The ICD established a homogeneous inflow in terms of both turbulence intensity and the mean axial flow velocity. Both the turbulence intensity and the integral length scale profile along the radial direction were fully characterized. Turbulence levels of around 0.1\% were achieved in the freestream when the ICD was installed on the inlet. Acoustic measurements revealed more stable rotor-coherent tones, along with a strong reduction of narrowband components around the blade passing frequencies.

In this paper, a numerical investigation is conducted to study the feasibility of a fixed plate in the chord-dominated static ground effect experiment. The incompressible Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations and shear stress transport turbulence model are solved. The feasibility of a fixed plate is determined by the camber effect, the blocking effect, and the boundary-layer effect. The camber effect dominates the suction distribution on the airfoil upper surface, and the blocking and boundary-layer effects together govern the pressure distribution on the lower surface. With the decreasing plate length, the modeling ability of camber effect decreases slightly first and then sharply; and the modeling ability of the blocking effect gradually restores due to the gradually weakened boundary-layer effect. A fixed plate can reproduce the lift and pitching moment accurately due to the accurate duplication of pressure distribution, but it fails in drag due to the inaccurate modeling of shear stress distribution. The optimal fixed plate configurations for different angles of attack and ride heights are given for ground effect wind-tunnel experiments.},

  abstract     = {Wings can experience a large increase in lift when subjected to a high-amplitude transverse gust, which may adversely affect their controllability. This study analyzes the capability of airfoil pitch motions to mitigate such lift spikes. The mitigation pitch kinematics are calculated preemptively from gust velocity measurements using two approaches. First, a simple quasi-steady model of the lift force is used to counteract the gust-induced angle of attack. Second, the classical unsteady theories of Wagner and Küssner are utilized to account for the effects of trailing-edge vorticity and noncirculatory forces. Experimental force and flow measurements are analyzed for gust ratios from 0.25 to 1.5. Results show that the motions predicted by the quasi-steady model achieve a lift peak alleviation of 70\%, whereas the unsteady pitch profile results in a superior 90\% alleviation. This accurate mitigation for high-amplitude gusts is analyzed by comparing the flow development with the main assumptions in the models, like small angle of attack and no shedding from the leading edge. Further analysis includes experiments where the wing experiences only the gust or only the pitch motion. Ultimately, the outcome of this work can be used to improve the control mechanisms on board of flying vehicles.},

A wing of aspect ratio and NACA 0012 section is considered at freestream Mach number and chord Reynolds number . The wing undergoes an oscillatory pitching motion with reduced frequency and angle of attack between and 22 deg, resulting in deep dynamic tip stall for the uncontrolled case. Spanwise uniform low-amplitude pulsed forcing is imparted through a zero-net mass flow blowing/suction slot located on the wing lower surface near the leading edge using both moderate and high frequencies, and 50, respectively. The imposed small fluctuations are amplified through the natural receptivity of the laminar separation bubble (LSB) and, in the case of the highest frequency, completely inhibit its bursting along the wing, which precludes outboard flow separation and subsequent dynamic tip stall. The lower-frequency forcing cannot overcome eventual bursting of the LSB near the wingtip; however, the resulting separation is localized to the tip region unlike the full outboard unloading of the uncontrolled case. Conditioning of the leading-edge flow through targeted manipulation of the LSB and its inherent dynamics maintained or enhanced the effectively attached flow throughout the pitching cycle, resulting in significant reductions in the cycle-averaged drag and in the force and moment excursions.},

Simulating a multitude of different flow conditions with high-fidelity methods as required for loads analysis or aerodynamic shape optimization is still prohibitive. Within the past few years, the application of machine learning methods has been proposed as a potential way to overcome these shortcomings. This is leading toward a new data-driven paradigm for the modeling of physical problems. The objective of this paper is the development of a deep-learning methodology for the prediction of aircraft surface pressure distributions and the rigorous comparison with existing state-of-the-art nonintrusive reduced-order models. Bayesian optimization techniques are employed to efficiently determine optimal hyperparameters for all deep neural networks. Three data-driven methods which are Gaussian processes, proper orthogonal decomposition combined with an interpolation technique, and deep learning are investigated. The results are compared for a two-dimensional airfoil case and the NASA Common Research Model transport aircraft as a relevant three-dimensional case. Results show that all methods are able to properly predict the surface pressure distribution at subsonic conditions. In transonic flow, when shock waves and separation lead to nonlinearities, deep-learning methods outperform the others by also capturing the shock wave location and strength accurately.},

  abstract     = {The shock instability, notably the disastrous carbuncle phenomenon, has plagued many low-dissipation Godunov-type numerical schemes in calculations of high Mach flows. In the current work, two popular stability analysis tools and corresponding numerical experiments are used to investigate the root cause of shock instability of the low-dissipation Harten, Lax, and van Leer with contact (HLLC) scheme. The local linear stability analysis reveals that the HLLC flux could attenuate all perturbations in the streamwise direction but not perturbations of density and shear velocity in the transverse direction. Numerical results also indicate that the shock instability of the HLLC scheme is only related to the transverse flux. The viscosity terms of entropy wave and shear wave are introduced into the transverse flux, and the stability analysis shows that with the help of additional viscosities the shock instability of the HLLC scheme is cured. To preserve the capability of resolving contact discontinuities and shear waves, a pressure-based switching function is incorporated into the expressions of viscosity terms so that the additional viscosities are activated only when calculating the transverse flux in the shock layer. A series of numerical experiments give evidence of the robustness and accuracy of the proposed scheme, and the strategy adopted here can be easily applied to cure shock instabilities of other low-dissipation numerical schemes, e.g., the Roe scheme and the AUSM+ scheme.},

  abstract     = {A joint experimental and computational study is performed to quantify the effects of various expansion ratios on the flowfields and acoustic properties of a jet, issuing from a diamond-shaped nozzle. Three expansion ratios are studied corresponding to perfectly expanded, overexpanded, and underexpanded regimes, which progressively increase the far-field acoustic impact. Nozzle asymmetry leads to distinct mean flow properties across the two principal (major/minor) axes of the jets, with the potential core and shock-expansion cells exhibiting a faster collapse on the major axis plane. Asymmetry is also observed in the computed near-field pressure spectra, which exhibits higher amplitudes in the minor axis plane, consistent with the higher far-field sound levels experimentally measured on this plane for all three jets. Near-field spectra also identify three specific bands, corresponding to broadband shock-associated noise (BBSAN), mixing noise, and that associated with nonradiating subsonic convecting eddies. Further analysis of noise mechanisms through the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budget shows enhanced levels of TKE on the minor axis plane, resulting from correlations between fluctuations in streamwise and cross-stream velocities, and gradients across the shear layers. Fourier analysis of near-field coherent structures in pressure identified axisymmetric features in the most energetic modes, followed by the first helical mode, which was enhanced in the presence of shock-expansion cells in the imperfectly expanded jets. The most energetic modes in the overexpanded shock-expansion cells have a strong harmonic nature to it, corresponding to the peak frequencies of its near-field BBSAN component.},

  abstract     = {Supersonic inlets with a wide operating Mach number range can regulate the internal contraction ratio (defined as the area ratio of the duct entrance and throat, denoted as ICR) to improve the critical total pressure recovery performance and flight condition adaptability. To elucidate the association between the downstream throttling characteristics and the ICR, a rectangular supersonic inlet with a variable ICR (ranging from 1.21 to 2.04) was designed. Using a high-speed schlieren and dynamic pressure acquisition system, a series of experimental studies was carried out in a supersonic wind tunnel at a freestream Mach number of 2.9. The results indicate that the downstream-throttling unstart modes of the inlet at different ICRs can be divided into two classes, namely, a “steadily changing” mode and an “abruptly changing” mode. As the ICR increases, the inlet substantially improves its compression and throttling performances by sacrificing a small amount of mass flow. Moreover, the inlet’s throttling characteristics at different ICRs are dominated by the flow loss of the terminal shock train. Then, the influence mechanism of the ICR on the inlet’s downstream throttling characteristics is revealed, and a throttling characteristic prediction model for rectangular supersonic variable inlets is established.},

Here, the measure of a strong Mach reflection is the total pressure loss of the shock reflection system. A corresponding classification chart provides a method to directly characterize the regions of the strong Mach reflection. An analytical model is proposed for predicting the Mach stem height in an explicit function. The theoretical results are in good agreement with the numerical simulations. Assumptions supporting the analytical model are thus validated. A linear relationship is found between the dimensionless Mach stem height and the dimensionless wedge length, which is validated with both analytical and numerical results. Taking advantage of this feature, a generalized method to determine the domain regarding the dimensionless wedge length in the strong Mach reflection is created. The analytical method provides a quick and precise prediction of boundaries for more detailed simulations and experiments.},

A modification of Stainback and Wagner’s theory, incorporating recent numerical results from Chaudhry et al., is used to interpret the pitot data, while a new inversion algorithm is applied to the FLDI data. These methods of interpretation make the assumption that the tunnel freestream disturbance environment is dominated by the acoustic Kovásznay mode, in line with the theoretical and experimental evidence.

The method is modular in the sense that it works with multiple variable-property scaling formulas (or “transformations”), velocity–temperature relationships, viscosity–temperature relationships, and equations-of-state. The method is validated against multiple Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) cases and was found to predict the skin friction and wall heat flux to within 8 and 11\% compared to the current state-of-the-art (the Van Driest II method), which is within 16 and 13\% for the same data.},

  abstract     = {The present study investigates a novel control strategy to create a sweeping oscillatory jet using fluidic actuation principle. A supersonic underexpanded primary jet issued into a suddenly expanding duct is oscillated by giving cyclic pulsed secondary jet blowing in the top and bottom step regions of the suddenly expanding duct. The current study employs the bistable nature of jet expansion seen in a suddenly expanding duct for the jet oscillation. The cyclic perturbations (pulsed secondary jet blowing) given in the streamwise direction switch the direction of the asymmetric jet expansion of the underexpanded primary supersonic jet to the top and bottom wall alternatively, thereby creating an oscillatory supersonic jet. It is found that the switching of the direction of the primary jet to any one wall is caused by the Coanda effect produced by the secondary jet issued in the corresponding wall side. The results show that the primary jet quickly responds to the secondary jet perturbations and that the supersonic primary jet oscillation frequency nearly matches secondary jet perturbation frequency. A parametric study to investigate the jet oscillation characteristics with various secondary jet oscillation frequencies and mass flow rate ratios are also being carried out in the present study. It is found that the jet oscillation frequency increases with increase in the secondary jet pulsation frequency. The jet deflection is found to increase with increase in the secondary jet to primary jet mass flow ratio (blowing ratio) up to a critical limit, after which the increment in jet deflection ceases due to the restrictions imposed by the duct geometry.},

The response of the boundary layer was characterized in ensemble-averaged measurements of the mean velocity and Reynolds stresses. The streamwise development of the mechanical distortions introduced by the diamond-shaped roughness was also explored through observation of roughness-generated shock waves and changes in the boundary-layer profile. Measurements acquired at three streamwise locations are consistent with the trends observed in other studies when scaled by the roughness friction velocity. Ensemble-averaged outer-scaled streamwise velocity profiles showed a velocity deficit in the near-wall region. Inner-scaled boundary-layer profiles showed a downward vertical shift in the scaled velocities of 4.5 and 3 for the diamond roughness and nonuniform/realistic roughness topologies, respectively. These values show similar responses to the results seen in the literature for similar test conditions. The roughness effects were shown to increase in magnitude along the streamwise distance.},

The streamwise velocity and pressure fluctuations are processed according to their energy and frequency, respectively. As is the case of planar shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions, fluctuations in some bands of frequencies are more energetic downstream of the flow separation zone. The energetic low-frequency modes of the streamwise velocity fluctuations are reminiscent of Görtler-like vortices, whereas those of pressure fluctuations are connected with the “breathing” motion of the separation bubble. Higher-frequency modes, on the other hand, are related to wrinkling of the impinging conical shock. Although they bear resemblance with those in planar shock/turbulent boundary-layer interactions, it was found that the flow structures herein are less coherent owing to spanwise inhomogeneity of the impinging shock strength. The POD and DMD results of CSBLI support the notion that Görtler-like vortices might be an intrinsic mechanism of the interaction zone, which is probably responsible for the low-frequency unsteadiness of CSBLI. The present results may serve as a basic guidance for the design of fluidic control strategies of shock-induced flow separation.},

Comparison with available direct numerical simulation and experimental data shows that RANS is capable of predicting the main features of SBLI, namely, typical size and distribution of the wall properties. A large number of flow cases were computed to examine the scaling of the global flow parameters over a wide range of wall temperatures and Reynolds numbers. As expected, the interaction zone is reduced as the wall is cooled, and as the Reynolds number is increased. A modified form of the scaling originally introduced by Souverein et al.

It is shown that, by utilizing a sigmoid fitting of the turbulence index profile, the transition onset location can be accurately predicted in a differentiable and smooth fashion, which is essential to the adjoint-based sensitivity analysis of the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver. Subsequently, the results of these calibration studies are used for obtaining a new relation via a high-order polynomial regression model relating the critical amplification factor to the freestream turbulence intensity. Finally, the prediction capability of the calibrated relation is tested for natural transitional flows past NLF(1)-0416 and S809 airfoils.

In the mathematical developments, special care is given to the presence of shock wave discontinuities within the flowfield. The equivalence between the new definition, the Kutta–Joukowski lift theorem, Maskell’s lift-induced drag formula (“Progress Towards a Method for the Measurement of the Components of the Drag of a Wing of Finite Span,” Procurement Executive, Ministry of Defence, Royal Aircraft Establishment TR 72232, Farnborough, England, U.K., 1972) and Betz’s profile drag formula (“A Method for the Direct Determination of Wing-Section Drag,” NACA TM 337, 1925) are emphasized. The revised formulation also presents several practical advantages: the decomposition is naturally invariant to the reference point chosen for the calculation of moment transformations, and the computation can be performed in a fine part of the grid, close to the body skin. The formulation is finally tested on the NASA Common Research Model wing–fuselage configuration in cruise flight conditions.},

  abstract     = {The installation of a propulsion device in space missions requires the thrust vector to be in line with the centroid of the satellite platform. If the installation is eccentric, interference torque occurs on the satellite body, which is not conducive for the attitude control of the whole satellite. In this paper, a method for calculating the thrust vector eccentricity angle by Gaussian surface fitting is proposed, which is suitable for a class of electric thrusters, for which the plume is conformed to point source distribution. For the cylindrical-shaped plume that cannot be regarded as a point source, a new weight function is proposed. A Hall thruster is considered an example to experimentally verify the method. Error analysis shows that the calculation accuracy in most of the cases is within 10\%. To obtain the result of a small error, a preprocessing procedure is proposed before applying the method for optimization. Moreover, considering the contribution of the ion energy distributed along the angle, the calculation method is corrected and improved; and it is found that the thrust vector eccentricity angle of the Hall thruster is overestimated by about 20–30\% when the angular distribution of the ion energy is not considered.},

  abstract     = {A set of experiments was conducted with the aim of evaluating total heat flux mitigation using magnetohydrodynamic flow control over ionized shock layers surrounding planetary entry vehicles. The University of Queensland’s X2 expansion tube was used to generate a flow condition representative of a Mars return trajectory. Spherical permanent magnets were fitted into a scaled test model based on NASA’s Stardust capsule. Thermocouples located at the stagnation point and shoulder of the test model, as well as thin-film heat transfer gauges located in the aft section, measured total heat flux for both magnetic and nonmagnetic experiments. High-speed imaging of the shock layer showed a significant increase in shock standoff when using the magnet, and polynomial fits were derived, describing standoff distance along the model’s forebody. Despite significant noise affecting the heat flux gauges signals for the magnetic experiments, a simple methodology allowed to compare heat flux during the useful test time. It was found that the applied magnetic field significantly reduces total heat flux at the stagnation point and shoulder of the test model, although heat flux to the aft section was found to significantly increase. Reasonable agreement with the numerical predictions was found for the aft section of the test model, but discrepancies were observed at the other locations.},

  abstract     = {Aerooptical aberrations along the spanwise direction of a canonical subsonic turbulent boundary layer were measured and studied nonintrusively using a Shack–Hartmann wave front sensor. It was demonstrated that in this case some important fluidic statistics in the wall-normal direction, like the mean velocity profiles, the local skin friction, and the spanwise integral scales, can be directly extracted from aerooptical aberrations. To avoid various spectral contamination in optical data at low frequencies, a model function for the deflection angle autospectral density at low frequencies was proposed. The spectral cross-correlation method and the dispersion method were used to extract the local convective velocities, and the dispersion analysis was demonstrated to be most accurate in computing the velocities. It was shown that it is possible to reconstruct the spectra above the Nyquist frequencies through the newly proposed stacking method. Convective velocities in the log region of the turbulent boundary layer were found to agree well with the direct measurements using a single hot wire. From the convective velocities, the local wall shear stress was nonintrusively extracted, using the Clauser method. Using corrected deflection angle spectra and the convective velocity, the local values of aerooptical aberrations were reconstructed. Finally, using the strong Reynold’s analogy, a wall-normal profile of the spanwise density correlation length was estimated and shown to be in good qualitative agreement with velocity-based spanwise length scales observed in the literature.},

  abstract     = {In the process of spacecraft launching, maneuvering, rendezvous, and docking, the liquid fuel may slosh violently due to the action of inertia force and gravity, and the additional sloshing force will have an important impact on the spacecraft. To meet the requirement of high-fidelity real-time simulation of an on-board computer, in this paper, an equivalent dynamic model for large-amplitude liquid sloshing is studied and validated. First, the moving pulsating ball model (MPBM) of liquid large-amplitude sloshing motion is extended to the gravity environment, and the gravity is added to the dynamic equation of the pulsating ball to derive the normal force of the MPBM. At the same time, the equivalent model of the liquid that does not participate in sloshing is introduced, which makes the calculation of the center of mass of the liquid more accurate. The validity of the improved MPBM (IMPBM) in cases of small-amplitude sloshing, large amplitude sloshing and zero momentum maneuvers is verified by three examples. Finally, an experimental platform is designed and built to verify the numerical simulation results. It is shown that the IMPBM can well reflect the reactive force for liquid sloshing in both spherical and nonspherical tanks.},

  abstract     = {Facing diversified launch needs, it is uneconomical to redevelop new rockets from scratch. The concept of combining legacy modules into a new launcher has become attractive. However, these mature modules may not adapt to new flight profiles due to differences in factors such as the propulsion system configuration, payloads, and trajectories. Thus, structural load relief measures play a key role in module integration. A comprehensive load relief strategy applied in the Long March 8 (LM-8) rocket is introduced, including the inflight load reduction by engine throttling, wind biasing trajectory, and onboard load relief control techniques. A unified analysis process for the elastic loads caused by gusts and fluctuating pressures was proposed, and an integral optimization problem for simultaneous planning with complicated constraints (such as the maximum dynamic pressure, wind biasing, and throttling level and time) is discussed. A real-time load relief technology based on an extended state observer, which predicts the angular acceleration caused by the wind, is proposed. Its efficiency, adaptability, influence on the stability and control accuracy, and application in the LM-8 maiden flight are studied. The proposed scheme expands the launch probability of LM-8 and provides a systematic solution for the load relief design and control of in-service rockets.},

  abstract     = {Micron-sized particles suspended in planetary atmospheres can damage thermal protection systems (TPS) during entry of space capsules into planetary bodies. TPS materials are complex heterogeneous carbon composites, where the microstructure of the composite can play a pivotal role in the propagation of damage caused by the impact. Here, we present the application of a novel computational technique called the lattice particle method to understand the initiation and growth of craters formed on TPS materials upon impact by particles. The simulations are initially compared against experiments that used borosilicate as the impacting particle and fused silica as the target surface. The simulations reproduce the damage profiles, diameters, and depths of the craters being formed on the target silica surface. A parametric study is then performed by varying the fracture strength of the target surface and the impacting particle. It is found that the profiles of the damaged region on the silica surface primarily depend on the fracture strength of the silica surface, and not the impacting particle. The simulations are extended to model the damage of porous carbon composites that are used as TPS materials. Microstructures of carbon composites are generated using an in-house code that has been shown to reproduce features of the real material in past studies. While the crater depth on the fused silica surface was within 38\% irrespective of the fracture strength of the particle, the damaged depth changes by at least an order of magnitude when a carbon composite surface is used and the fracture strength of the impacting particle is varied. Finally, the influence of damage on the effective permeability is computed using the direct simulation Monte Carlo technique. The maximum increase in the permeability force for the damaged microstructures is found to be 22\%, which is within the statistical variability of the material properties observed for the TPS material that is under investigation.},

The electron backscatter diffraction samples of Ti-7Al in small-scales are used to reconstruct the alloy microstructures in larger domains. The reconstruction provides a statistically equivalent synthetic representation to the small-scale test samples while introducing epistemic uncertainty on microstructural features. Here, the grain topology of the polycrystalline microstructures is quantified using shape moment invariants. These invariant parameters can capture the shapes of physical objects with a numerical representation, and they are invariant to shape transformations. To quantify the effects of the uncertainties on the homogenized properties of the microstructures, a surrogate model is developed as a function of shape moment invariants with Gaussian process regression by utilizing the experiments and crystal plasticity simulations for training data.},

To this end, we describe the constraint equation using the vector variables of the absolute nodal coordinate formulation that exhibits a velocity-transformation relationship with the strain-based formulation. Subsequently, we divide the Jacobian of the constraint equation into two terms. One term is equivalent to the velocity transformation matrix that is currently implemented in the existing strain-based analysis framework. The other term is a simple constant or linear Jacobian defined based on the orthonormal vectors of the absolute nodal coordinate formulation. This simple Jacobian description integrates the strain-based beam formulation with multibody dynamic theories to handle open- and closed-loop joints.

Although existing studies have analyzed the released shape of a creased membrane by considering the elasto-plastic properties, the shape did not agree with the experimental results when the membrane was tightly creased. To examine the released shape of the membrane, creasing and releasing experiments are first conducted. The experimental results indicate that the opening angle of the crease increases with increasing elapsed time after the release due to stress relaxation. The stress relaxation behavior is predicted using finite element analysis (FEA) by considering the visco-elasto-plastic material properties. In addition, an analytical model of the releasing and deploying membrane has been proposed here. The results of the FEA and the analytical model indicate that the released angles are in good agreement with those in the experimental results. Thus, the effects of viscosity are considered important for predicting the releasing behavior of the space membrane.},

  abstract     = {The non-ordinary state-based peridynamics theory combines non-local dynamic techniques with a desirable correspondence material principle, allowing for the use of continuum mechanics constitutive models. Such an approach presents a unique capability for solving problems involving discontinuities (e.g., fracture and crack propagation). However, the correspondence-based peridynamics models often suffer from zero-energy mode instabilities in numerical implementation, primarily due to the weak integral formulation in non-local approximations of the deformation gradient tensor. This paper focuses on a computational scheme for eliminating the zero-energy mode oscillations using a choice of influence functions that improve the truncation error in a higher-order Taylor series expansion of the deformation gradient. The novelty here is a tensor-based derivation of the linear constraint equations, which can be used to systematically identify the particle interaction weight functions for various user-specified horizon radii. In this paper, the higher-order stabilization scheme is demonstrated for multi-dimensional examples involving polycrystalline and composite microstructures, along with comparisons against conventional finite element methods. The proposed stabilization scheme is shown to be highly effective in suppressing the spurious zero-energy mode oscillations in all of the numerical examples.},

In the present work, fretting fatigue crack growth of a nickel-based superalloy was experimentally and computationally investigated. Fretting fatigue experiments of dovetail joints were conducted under loading ratio , and the results revealed that the fretting fatigue cracks nucleated in multiple sites on the contact edge, which was accompanied by oxide wear debris and propagated with a single through-thickness crack. The crack growth rate was determined based on the variation of applied loading ratio in the experiments. With the help of the maximum tensile stress criterion, the friction coefficient of the fretting pair was determined from simulations of the fretting fatigue crack propagation. With the increasing friction coefficient, the kinking angle of the fretting crack approaches a stable value. The stress was verified to have significant effects on the short crack kinking and implemented in the maximum tensile stress criterion. A methodology based on fracture mechanics was proposed to identify the friction coefficient on the fretting surfaces.},

  abstract     = {This work presents an integrated damage diagnostics–prognostics framework for remaining useful life (RUL) estimation in the adhesively bonded joints under fatigue loading. A matching pursuit algorithm is proposed as the diagnostics technique for estimating the damage extent followed by the fatigue damage growth (FDG) simulator as the predictive model for simulating fatigue degradation. The framework calibrates the FDG simulator by quantifying uncertainties in fatigue model parameters using the damage extent data. Bayesian inference via the Markov chain Monte Carlo method is used to quantify uncertainties and estimate the probabilistic RUL from the quantified uncertainties. The FDG simulator encompasses a physics-based fatigue damage degradation model with an artificial neural network-based hybrid machine-learning model for tracing the damage progression. In the diagnostic technique, ultrasonic guided waves are excited into the structure using a pair of piezoelectric wafers, and the damage extent is quantified by reconstructing the reflected signal from the bond region. The proposed diagnostic technique is verified using the ultrasonic signal obtained from the finite element simulations. The damage prognostics part of the integrated framework is verified by estimating RUL in a mixed-mode failure joint specimen using the experimental fatigue damage progression data. In addition, the integrated framework is then verified by estimating RUL in two adhesively bonded joints: a single lap joint and a tapered single lap joint using Gaussian noise added synthetic data and diagnostic damage extent data.},

  abstract     = {The popular axial momentum theory relies on the steady, incompressible, axisymmetric, and inviscid flow through a so-called actuator disk. The most important result of this theory is the famous Betz–Joukowsky limit, stating that the maximum power coefficient achievable by an open disk is limited to 16/27. Generally, this value is obtained assuming a priori that the disk is radially uniformly-loaded and the flow is axially one-dimensional. This, however, does not prove that the uniform type is the optimal load, or else that it returns the maximum value of the extracted power. For this reason, this paper preliminary shows that 16/27 is the exact value of the maximum power coefficient of a uniformly loaded disk, even if the flow is not assumed as one-dimensional. Then, it proves, using a calculus of variation approach, that the radially uniform load is optimal. The proof refers to an approximate classical local form of the axial momentum equation. Finally, the paper points out that, since the proof of the Betz–Joukowsky limit relies on this simplifying assumption, the exact evaluation of the optimal radial distribution of the disk load, leading to the maximum value of the power coefficient, is still an open question.},

Firstly, an improved Hilbert–Huang transform time-frequency analysis algorithm is proposed to get the Hilbert spectrum of the windowed signals in real time. The surge-precursor intensity (SPI) is characterized by counting the signal amplitude in the low-frequency range. The surge early warning signal is judged according to whether the SPI crosses the threshold. Then, this paper handles the misjudgment problem caused by the endpoint effect phenomenon in the detection algorithm by adding data segments at the beginning and end of the analysis signal. Finally, to prevent the possible real-time jump phenomenon of the surge warning signal during the detection process, a judgment logic module is added. The verification results of multiple sets of experimental data showed that the warning time margin is . This paper also established an antisurge control system. The results verified that the detection method is effective, and the time margin of the early warning signal judged meets the response time requirements of the control system.},

The cascade is composed of eight 4\%-thick modified circular-arc blades with a 254 mm chord and a 235 mm spacing. The chord-based Reynolds number is , and the Mach number is 0.07. The gap considered in this study is 4.0 mm (1.6\% chord). An aerodynamic analysis of the tip-leakage flow coupled with a Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings analogy to compute the noise in the far field allows identifying the main tip-noise mechanisms. The acoustic contribution of the tip-leakage flow is highlighted by comparison with the trailing-edge noise contribution obtained with a 25 mm slice configuration at midspan without tip gap. This small-span configuration is also simulated using large-eddy simulation and allows computing the blade trailing-edge noise. A dynamic mode decomposition performed on the full configuration close to the tip highlights the main noise source, located around 75\% chord with a propagation frequency between 5 and 6 kHz. The acoustic waves propagate mostly downstream of the cascade and on the pressure side. This study provides the first high-fidelity wall-resolved compressible simulation of a linear compressor cascade comprising a comprehensive investigation of the tip-leakage noise sources, which is a necessary first step toward fan tip-noise prediction.},

The current effort is a follow-up campaign employing high-speed digital schlieren and single camera particle image velocimetry to measure the flowfield produced by the same stacked rotor. Particle image velocimetry measurements quantify the evolutionary behavior of the upper and lower blade tip vortices, and their interactions for various index angles and wake ages for a given rotor speed. Vortex tracking methods quantify the anisotropic wandering motions of the blade tip vortices and reveal patterns that are unique to both the upper and lower rotors. The findings reinforce the notion that the optimal index angle for the thrust produced by a coaxial, corotating rotor is one where the blade tip vortices produced by the upper rotor graze the low-pressure side of the lower rotor. If the miss distance is too small, collisions between the upper rotor vortex and the lower rotor ensue so that any gains in thrust are compounded by blade-vortex-interaction noise penalties.},

The wing has an aspect ratio of with a NACA 0012 section, a rounded tip, and a sweep angle of ; it operates at a Reynolds number of and a Mach number of . Equivalent pure-pitch and pure-plunge motions at two different reduced frequencies are considered to assess pitch-induced apparent camber on the wing and its effects on the three-dimensional flow structure, surface topology, and aerodynamic loading. Regardless of the motion type or rate, the wing undergoes dynamic tip stall that is initiated through the outboard separation of a dynamic stall vortex as it lifts off the surface and forms into an arch vortex before ejecting into the wake. The pitching cases exhibit an advanced development and evolution in time of these features that are observed as variable amplifications of the aerodynamic loading, which is due predominantly to an apparent camber effect. Corrections to the total and sectional lift and moment coefficients are explored by extending steady thin-airfoil theory to pitching swept wings. Remarkably, the corrected plunge-equivalent histories provide a full collapse of the force and moment responses between the pitching and plunging cases, despite the delayed behavior of the flow structure. This equivalence and the similar process of dynamic stall should facilitate the comparison of experiments and/or simulations employing different motion types, even for finite-aspect-ratio and swept wings.},

  abstract     = {Transonic buffet is undesirable because it causes vibration, and constraining buffet is crucial in transonic wing design. However, there is still a lack of accurate and efficient buffet formulation to impose the constraint. This work proposes a physics-based data-driven buffet analysis model generalizable for airfoil and wing shapes. The model is trained with data obtained from two-dimensional airfoils in a physics-based manner to extend it to buffet analyses of three-dimensional wings. Specifically, the model takes the pressure and friction distributions as inputs to discover the key physics (shock waves and flow separation) of transonic buffeting, rather than using shape and flow parameters as the input. High-quality sample airfoils are used and a mixture model of convolutional neural networks is proposed to improve accuracy. The model exhibits a mean absolute error of 0.05 deg in buffet factor prediction of 14,886 unseen testing data. Buffet boundary predictions using the model compare well with the reference results (a lift-curve break method) for various airfoils and wings. Wing shape optimization using the model appropriately considers buffet constraints, leading to an optimized wing with lower drag (by 1.7 counts) than that obtained by the state-of-the-art method. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed physics-based data-driven buffet analysis approach. The proposed method is a promising alternative to address other complex off-design constraints in aircraft design.},

  abstract     = {Aircraft environmental performance metrics including fuel burn, takeoff and landing noise, and gaseous emissions are increasingly driving the design and optimization of modern aircraft engines. Gradient-based methods can significantly reduce the computational resources required during their multidisciplinary optimizations. However, current state-of-the art noise modeling tools do not allow for effective computation of sensitivities of acoustic metrics with respect to engine design and control variables, and therefore cannot be easily integrated into multidisciplinary optimization tools. This paper presents the utility of the python Noise Assessment tool (known as pyNA): an aircraft noise estimation model providing sensitivities of acoustic metrics, enabling multidisciplinary optimization and optimal control of engines for low-noise aircraft. The model is used to assess the trades of environmental performance metrics in the clean-sheet engine design for the NASA supersonic technology concept airplane. For the engine examined, if the fan diameter is allowed to change while technology levels are held constant, the takeoff noise levels and emissions are found to be most sensitive to the design fan pressure ratio. For an engine with a fixed fan diameter, takeoff noise levels are found to be insensitive to design variables; whereas nitrogen oxide emissions and cruise thrust-specific fuel consumption are most sensitive to the engine fan and high-pressure compressor pressure ratios.},

  abstract     = {The evolution of turbofan engines has led to designs with larger fan diameters, shorter inlets, and thinner nacelle walls. This has forced the acoustic liners used therein to be placed closer to engine components that undergo significant thermal heating. This experimental study investigates the combined effects of important thermal gradients, grazing flow, and acoustic level on liners applied to the Long Elastic Open Neck Acoustic Resonator (LEONAR) liner concept. Previous studies have shown that a coupling between these three effects can exist. The objective is to compare such a liner concept to a classical equivalent single-degree-of-freedom liner and to highlight differences in this coupling behavior. Experiments are conducted in the grazing flow duct at ONERA (B2A), where the flow temperature can be accurately regulated and several types of acoustic excitation can be provided. A test section with a heating or cooling device is used to obtain a thermal gradient between the backplate and the perforated plate of the liner sample, and infrared thermography is used to measure the temperature distribution on the perforated plate. The measurement is conducted on several configurations to assess the behaviors of the LEONAR liner concept in the context of combined influence of grazing flow, thermal gradients, and high sound levels.},

  abstract     = {An experimental investigation is made of smooth wall turbulent boundary layers under a family of continually varying streamwise pressure gradient distributions. In general, the effects of these pressure gradient cases on the boundary layer are found to be nonlocal and dependent on upstream history effects. However, the friction Reynolds number grows independent of applied pressure gradient and appears to be dependent only on the origin of the turbulent boundary layer. Special attention is paid to the statistics of the fluctuating pressure on the immersed surface, and it is found that there is a spectral-region-dependent relationship between pressure gradient and the fluctuating wall pressure, indicating the lack of a universal overlap region and providing insight into the impact of pressure gradient history on turbulence evolution. The classical viscous inner scaling of the pressure spectra appears universal as does a proposed mixed variable low-frequency scaling. The impact of the pressure gradients on the pressure space-time correlations and convection velocities is more locally dependent. The implications of these observations on our understanding of nonequilibrium flows are explored, and it is postulated that such flows may be describable as a three-dimensional space governing the mean growth, pressure gradient effect, and nonequilibrium effect, respectively.},

The discharge of the plasma actuator is mainly involved in the streamer discharge and the glowlike discharge during one sinusoidal AC period. It is found that the acoustic streaming flow generated by the plasma actuator lifts the airflow, and the body force generated by the plasma actuator pushes the airflow, during the streamer discharge stage. In addition, the airflow is drawn by the entrainment and pushed by the induced body force, respectively, during the glowlike discharge stage. Based on the body force and acoustic streaming flow, the influences of the plasma actuator on quiescent air are summarized as lift–push–push behavior.},

  abstract     = {Previous efforts determined a set of calibrated, optimal model parameter values for Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) simulations of a compressible jet in crossflow (JIC) using a turbulence model. These parameters were derived by comparing simulation results to particle image velocimetry (PIV) data of a complementary JIC experiment under a limited set of flow conditions. Here, a model using both nominal and calibrated parameters is validated against PIV data acquired from a much wider variety of JIC cases, including a realistic flight vehicle. The results from the simulations using the calibrated model parameters showed considerable improvements over those using the nominal values, even for cases that were not used in the calibration procedure that defined the optimal parameters. This improvement is demonstrated using a number of quality metrics that test the spatial alignment of the jet core, the magnitudes of multiple flow variables, and the location and strengths of vortices in the counter-rotating vortex cores on the PIV planes. These results suggest that the calibrated parameters have applicability well outside the specific flow case used in defining them and that with the right model parameters, RANS solutions for the JIC can be improved significantly over those obtained from the nominal model.},

  abstract     = {Circulation control (CC) is an airfoil lift augmentation technique that replaces mechanical structures by means of aerodynamic flaps generated by high-speed jets. In view of the high air consumption for the conventional steady jet to drive the circulation control wing (CCW), the emerging sweeping jet is proposed herein as an alternative excitation method and compared with continuous and discrete steady jets. Four dimensionless parameters characterizing the jet blowing intensity are used to comprehensively evaluate the lift augmentation capacity of the three types of jet. In terms of the velocity ratio and the momentum coefficient, the continuous steady jet is the most efficient to enhance the lift. On the other hand, with respect to the mass flow coefficient, the sweeping jet can reduce the air consumption by 48\% compared to the continuous steady jet. Therefore, in the light of this contradiction, a more comprehensive indicator, namely, the energy coefficient, is used to quantify the energy expenditure. The accordingly plotted curves of the lift coefficient versus the energy coefficient for continuous steady jets and sweeping jets almost overlap each other, which indicates that the sweeping jets reduce the air consumption by virtue of higher jet velocities at the expense of higher pressure loss. Besides, compared to the discrete steady jets with the same jet spacing, the sweeping jets boast a notably higher lift generation performance, verifying that the unsteady lateral oscillation of the sweeping jet is also critical to the lift augmentation. Then, a new index, namely, the energy coefficient-based lift augmentation ratio, is proposed as the indicator to quantitatively compare the lift augmentation efficiencies of the CCWs driven by different jet actuators. The sweeping jet is proved to have a lift augmentation efficiency that is not at all inferior to that of the traditional steady slot jet.},

The relationships between resonance intensity and the geometry of the dual sweeping-jet controllers (SJCs) and mass ratio of the jet flow to mainstream flow were established by the wall-pressure measurements. The system with dual SJCs at two upstream channel–branch intersections with spanwise jet sweeping achieved the best control performance at the low mass ratio of . Through complementary simulations, self-sustained unsteady flow dynamics within dual SJCs, strong flow–acoustic resonance within the channel–branch system and complete suppression of the aeroacoustic field by the most efficient dual SJCs were demonstrated. The simulation results were first validated in terms of the frequency and amplitude information of the experimentally measured wall-pressure fluctuations. Subsequently, a proper orthogonal decomposition analysis was conducted and a large-scale synchronous sweeping behavior was observed when the jet flow proceeded from the fluidic oscillators to the free space. Thereafter, SAS results revealed the dual SJCs could remarkably attenuate velocity fluctuations, shear-layer momentum thickness, and Reynolds and Lighthill stresses. These improvements were achieved by completely suppressing the large-scale shear-layer vortex shedding into a series of horseshoe vortices.},

Flow visualization, surface variable comparison with experiment, and analysis of unsteady flow statistics were carried out. Reasonable agreement between prediction and measurement was obtained for time-averaged surface pressure and heat flux. Unsteady analysis of these quantities revealed spectra dominated by low-frequency energy content throughout the interaction region. A correlation analysis indicated coupling of the unsteady motions of the shear layer, shock wave, separation vortex, and flow reattachment.

  abstract     = {Increasing the internal contraction ratio (defined as the area ratio of the duct entrance and throat, denoted as ICR) can improve the operating performance of a variable geometry supersonic inlet, however, excessive ICR typically will bring the inlet into an unstarted state with oscillation. To uncover the underlying mechanism of a large ICR-induced oscillatory-unstarted phenomenon, we employed a high-speed schlieren and dynamic pressure acquisition system, and experimentally examined the flowfields of a rectangular supersonic inlet with different ICRs of 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 in the wind tunnel at a freestream Mach number of 2.9. The inlet stayed unstarted while the ICR ranged from 2.0 to 3.0, and the flowfield had three features. First, the inlet flowfields showed high- and broadband-frequency oscillations, whose dominant frequency and oscillatory amplitude increased with ICR. Second, the inlet flowfields revealed similar oscillatory flow structures, which contained the periodic variation of the ramp-side boundary layer separation, cowl-side flow spillage, and shock train in the internal contraction part. Third, the unstarted flow structure and oscillatory phenomenon mainly occurred upstream of the inlet geometric throat, downstream of which the main flowfield was supersonic. To characterize these three features, we proposed a self-excited oscillatory model consisting of a disturbing source, a disturbing feedback terminal, and a signal feedback loop. Practically, the disturbing source is a scale variation of the entrance separation, the disturbing feedback terminal is an aerodynamic throat near the geometric throat, and the signal feedback loop is composed of communication pathways of shock train motion, acoustic waves, and convection waves. With this model, we explained the underlying mechanism of the high- and broadband-frequency characteristics of the oscillation caused by large ICR, and the ICR’s influence on the flow oscillation.},

Computations use a three-dimensional unsteady shear-stress transport delayed detached-eddy simulation method. Four different one-step chemical kinetic rates are simulated on the resolved scale to determine the effect of the burning rate. Application of kinetic rates on the resolved scale give faster rates than expected with turbulent combustion where the final mixing and chemical reaction in the cascade occurs on the smallest scales; thus, reduction of the kinetic rate is examined here. When the normalized kinetic rate is 1, implying the nominal Westbrook–Dryer rate, only the longitudinal-mode instability is observed. As the kinetic rate decreases, less of the combustion occurs upstream near the longitudinal-mode pressure antinode, the longitudinal-mode instability becomes weak, and the first-tangential-mode instability emerges, which fits better with experiment. The proximity of the domain of major heat release to the longitudinal mode pressure antinode is found to be critical. Evidence is presented for the need for an improved combustion model that will provide a more accurate and lower burning rate.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an improved three-dimensional conservation element and solution element method with chemical source terms is developed and applied to investigate the effects of different divergence inlet patterns on vapor kerosene/air rotating detonation engines. A two-step kerosene/air chemistry model is adopted and solved by a third-order Runge–Kutta method. A series of cases with varying the slot inlet width, in other words, 6, 4, and 2 mm, and divergence section length, in other words, 4, 6, and 10 mm, are simulated. The simulation results indicate the supersonic injection generated by the divergence section is helpful to decrease the disturbance from the downstream flow. Affected by the divergence section, the detonation front is divided into two sections, in other words, the main detonation front and the banded detonation front. For the main detonation front, the detonation strength on the outer wall is significantly stronger than that on the inner wall, while it is not for the banded detonation front. The total pressure loss caused by the inlet normal shock significantly increases with the decrease of slot inlet width. A declining deflagration surface will appear when a small slot inlet width of 2 mm is used. The rotating detonation engine (RDE) performance analysis shows that the slot inlet width has a significant impact on the thrust, specific impulse, total pressure gain, and outlet Mach number. A bigger slot inlet area ratio contributes to a higher total pressure gain. The simulation results can get insight into rotating detonation behaviors and guide the development of the kerosene/air RDE.},

  abstract     = {Simulations of both inert mixing and sustained combustion are analyzed for a cavity flameholder based on corresponding experiments. An round ethylene jet fuels a cavity with length-to-depth ratio and a 45° inclined downstream wall. Oxidizer mixes into the cavity from the core flow. The simulations reproduce shock angles and wall pressures of the corresponding experiment. The effects that cavity combustion has on the core-flow gas dynamics and cavity entrainment are analyzed in detail. Relative to the inert case, heat release leads to a complex core flow, with upstream boundary layers transiently separating and highly unsteady shocks over the cavity. Their collective effect is the formation of a virtual throat, which decreases the core flow to above the cavity. Lagrangian trajectories assess the roles that turbulence, combustion, and three-dimensional side-wall boundary layers have on oxidizer entrainment into the cavity. Overall, sustained cavity combustion suppresses entrainment by a factor of about 2.},

  abstract     = {In this study, combustion processes in a cavity-based scramjet combustor are experimentally studied based on the inflow conditions of different stagnation pressures (, 1.3, and 1.6 MPa), which correspond to a Mach 6 flight at trajectories of different dynamic pressures of 0.25, 0.34, 0.43 atm, respectively. Three combustion modes are identified according to flame distribution, flowfield structure, and wall pressure. Cases at the same equivalence ratio and combustion mode with different inflow stagnation pressures are selected to compare flame characteristics. For each inflow condition, flame structure, combustion intensity, and coherence between upstream and downstream flames are analyzed based on CH* chemiluminescence and schlieren imaging measurements. Combustion instability is examined according to statistical results, frequency domain and spatial distribution. It is found that the linearly increased inflow stagnation pressure causes irregularity variance in the combustion oscillation spectra, indicating the quasi-linearly enhanced combustion induces complicated aerodynamic and thermodynamic variances. Chaos of the combustion oscillation is quantitatively evaluated by a classical nonlinear analysis. The dynamic mode decomposition analysis presents that the high-frequency oscillation induced by the self-sustaining shear-layer instability exist mainly in the combustor upper region while the low-frequency oscillation that could be caused by the injector–flame feedback is predominant in the cavity region. In addition, thermo-acoustic couplings, which are in connection with these two kinds of oscillations, have been analyzed. It is further revealed that the variance of the shock waves caused by the backpressure destroys the existing thermo-acoustic feedback related to the high-frequency oscillation, which is the main reason for the chaotic phenomena shown in the transitional state between the scramjet mode and the ramjet mode.},

The vorticity and its influencing factors are analyzed to understand the transport behaviors in the scramjet. Multiple mechanisms contribute to vorticity simultaneously but unequally in different regions. A large part of the flowfield is full of the supersonic airstream with small vorticity. In the mixing region, the averaged vorticity magnitude decreases gradually along the chamber length, and vortex stretch is the leading mechanism of vorticity transport within this region. The baroclinic torque effect is strengthened dramatically by combustion, but is weakened by the incoming flow with higher stagnation enthalpy. Although the near-wall region is small, the averaged vorticity magnitude in this region is extremely large due to the confinement and viscosity effects. Diffusion is the leading mechanism in the near-wall region, but dilatation can dominate vorticity transport due to shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction and pressure rise resulting from combustion.},

  abstract     = {Shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction (SWBLI) is a fundamental scientific problem that restricts the breakthrough of high-speed flight technology. Owing to the complex shock structure and boundary-layer separation in the interaction region, the widely used eddy-viscosity turbulence models have large uncertainties and model errors in the simulation of such flows. To make more reasonable aerodynamic/aerothermal predictions and identify the critical parameters affecting the prediction results, Bayesian uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis are conducted for the three turbulence models [Spalart–Allmaras (SA), SA with quadratic constitutive relation (SA-QCR), and shear-stress transport (SST) models] and the hypersonic SWBLI cases. First, the prior variances and Sobol indices are calculated to obtain a preliminary understanding of the parameter variability for turbulence models. Then, the posterior distributions of the model closure coefficients and posterior uncertainties of the wall pressure and thermal flux are systematically analyzed and compared. The results indicate that the prediction performances of the three models can be effectively enhanced by Bayesian estimation. The peak of the posterior uncertainty of the SST model is the largest among the three models, whereas that of the SA-QCR model is the smallest. The results of the Bayesian model evaluation demonstrate that the SA-QCR model has the highest reliability.},

Boundary-layer disturbances were measured via focused laser differential interferometry, surface-mounted pressure sensors, and high-speed schlieren videography at unit Reynolds numbers ranging from to . Three primary disturbance structures were observed that were dependent on ogive radius and nose bluntness. Each disturbance structure exhibits unique characteristics that are closely tied to the leading-edge geometry of the model. The addition of nose bluntness is shown to have an overall delay in transition onset, and a possible blunt nose transition reversal is observed as bluntness is further increased. It is also shown that the effects of the ogive radius in addition to nose bluntness alter the flow instability disturbance and transition behaviors and are likely tied to a modification of the entropy layer structure. A novel curvature-based Reynolds number is proposed that successfully correlates the effects of multiple leading-edge radii of curvature to dominant downstream boundary-layer disturbances and transition onset locations.},

The model geometry and conditions are selected to match experiments conducted in the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Mach 6 Ludwieg Tube. Specifically, five forebodies of interest consisting of sharp and blunt ogives of 4 and 2 caliber and a hemispherical shape are studied at a freestream unit Reynolds number of . Boundary-layer-edge properties and wall-normal profiles of velocity and temperature are compared across streamwise locations past the ogive-cylinder junction. Modal stability analysis is used to characterize the most amplified frequencies corresponding to Mack’s first and second modes and those are found to agree with experimental results for the sharp forebodies. The entropy layer induced by blunt forebodies envelopes the boundary layer and stabilizes modal disturbances. Nonmodal analysis revealed a broadband set of disturbances present for the blunter forebodies, in agreement with experimental observations. Flow perturbation contours of most amplified planar and oblique disturbances are shown to qualitatively match wind tunnel schlieren images, with a switch from rope-like to elongated structures, i.e., from high-frequency Mack’s second modes to low-frequency Mack’s first modes, as the forebody angle for the sharp tip is increased, and from boundary-layer to entropy-layer disturbances as the bluntness is increased.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel methodology for designing the flight control system of a micro aerial vehicle (MAV); it allows the MAV to learn how to fly by itself, without the risk of damage. The proposed methodology uses a magnetic levitation–based safety-guaranteed flight test environment and deep reinforcement learning techniques to avoid the current problems in flight control system design procedures, such as the reality gap issue of simulations, and the safety issues inherent to real flight testing. The safety-guaranteed flight test environment was achieved using a developed magnetic suspension and balance system, which dynamically adjusts magnetic forces interacting with a magnetically levitated MAV. As a result, the MAV can perform in either a free-flight condition for reinforcement learning or can be constrained for safety. This learning environment was developed to permit safe reinforcement learning of MAV, since trial-and-error-based learning typically makes the MAV unstable. In this regard, the MAV can learn to fly by itself based on trial and error, by interacting with the emulated free-flight test environment. Notably, the entire learning process can be conducted without numerical models for both the MAV itself and the flight environment, and the safety of the MAV is guaranteed, even when attempting undesirable actions that might cause the model to become unstable. By avoiding the modeling errors typical of computational simulations and preventing the risk of damage in real flight tests, this approach could enhance the use of reinforcement learning in the development of advanced flight control systems.},

The framework combines the linear dynamic derivative model and the fuzzy neural network model, which can achieve higher prediction accuracy under sparse experimental states. A series of wind-tunnel tests was carried out for the pitching motions of NASA Common Research Model at high angles of attack, to obtain steady and unsteady aerodynamic loads. These experimental data are used to verify the prediction accuracy of the unsteady model in a wide range of oscillation amplitude, frequencies, and mean angles of attack. The results show that the method has good generalization capability for the parameters of interest. At the same time, the comparison with the prediction results only from high-fidelity data shows that the proposed method can effectively reduce the amount of data required for the model of training and improve the modeling robustness to different types of motions.},

  abstract     = {Wind-tunnel experiment plays a critical role in the design and development phases of modern aircraft, which is always limited by prohibitive cost. In contrast, numerical simulation, as an important alternative research paradigm, mimics complex flow behaviors but is less accurate compared to experiments. This leads to the recent development and emerging interest in applying data fusion for aerodynamic prediction. In particular, the accurate prediction of aerodynamics with lower computational cost can be achieved by fusing experimental (high-fidelity) and computational (low-fidelity) aerodynamic data. Currently, existing works on aerodynamic models using data fusion mainly concern integrated data, like lift, drag, etc. In this paper, a multifidelity aerodynamic model based on deep neural network (DNN) is developed for aerodynamic distribution over the wing surface, where both numerical and experimental data are introduced in the loss function with a proper weighting factor to balance the overall accuracy. The proposed approach is illustrated by modeling the surface pressure distribution of the ONERA M6 wing in transonic flow, including different scenarios where the flow condition varies or a small number of high-fidelity data are available. The results demonstrate that the proposed model trained based on a decent number of low-fidelity data and a few high-fidelity data can accurately predict the surface pressure distribution on the transonic wing. The outperformance of the proposed model over other DNNs with a single fidelity has been reported.},

The Fourier series is parameterized by the Fourier coefficients specified by users. Within the frame of linearized aerodynamic theory, the first three Fourier coefficients are determined by the angle of attack, lift coefficient, and pitching moment coefficient, naturally providing three aerodynamic performance parameters. Then, the airfoil shape parameterization is completed by further parameterizing the thickness distribution by either the Class-Shape-Transformation method or the B-splines, depending on the specific applications. The test results show that the proposed shape parameterization has the same ability of fitting the existing airfoils as the traditional Class-Shape-Transformation method, but providing more aerodynamic performance parameters that are proved to be highly useful in applications.},

  abstract     = {High-order accurate methods provide significant accuracy/cost benefits for well-resolved and geometrically simple scale-resolving turbulent flow simulations. However, the benefit on under-resolved unstructured grids for complex industrial geometries is unclear. The purpose of this work is to contribute to understanding of the benefit of high-order schemes for large-eddy simulations (LES) in practical applications. A crucial requirement is a high-order solver that supports hybrid unstructured grids. In this context, accuracy and cost of a high-order spectral/ Nektar++ solver and a standard second-order finite-volume OpenFoam solver are systematically compared for performing LES (with subgrid scale treatments) on two configurations. The first configuration is Taylor–Green vortex, which shows that the accuracy benefit of fifth-order LES depends upon the mesh type and the level of under-resolution. The second configuration is geometrically more complex and represents the dilution port flows of gas turbine combustors. Specifically, the flow consists of crossflow radial jets impinging onto each other, providing a rich variety of features and thus making the case challenging. It is found that, for a given cost, fifth-order LES reproduces the unsteady flow features significantly better and offers moderate improvements in the mean quantities. Moreover, results from a finer more costly OpenFoam simulation suggest that, for a similar accuracy, fifth-order LES could be cheaper.},

The composite manufacturing optimization problem is explored from a holistic perspective that integrates the material constitutive parameters at different scales with the corresponding physics at every processing phase. To efficiently solve the manufacturing optimization problem in high dimensions, a physics-informed neural network surrogate is developed based on the governing first-principles physics. Focus is placed on training a neural network model that spans across all the different scales and physics at each manufacturing phase of the lightweight composite problem such that subsequent optimization results reflect the integrated, multiscale, and multiphysical aspects of the system. A holistic manufacturing optimization paradigm is formulated to discover optimal design vectors embedded in a parameter space of around 70 dimensions. Various objective functions that reflect different design preferences in the manufacturing problem are explored. In one optimization formulation, the final weight (i.e., density) of the composite design is reduced by 8.9\% with respect to the nominal design. An accurate and efficient manufacturing optimization paradigm for composites is essential for lightweight and ultralightweight applications, whereby any weight savings in the composite structure translate into increased system efficiency.},

Galvanic corrosion of a steel fastener/aluminum plate assembly was investigated assuming the presence of cracks in the aluminum plates, whose growth will be monitored in situ with a digital microscope throughout the fatigue process. The cold expansion treatment improved the fatigue life fourfold under a corrosive environment, and 11.3 times in a clean environment when compared to a plain hole. Corrosion revealed the possibility of a location shift in critical stress intensity factor, causing growth of the critical crack to happen outside of the region where the benefits of cold expansion can be achieved. The benefits of cold work expansion could be applied for precracked materials for an improved inspection interval but also calls for reevaluation of the inspection area to prevent secondary crack initiation that could lead to the ultimate failure of the structural component.},

  abstract     = {Although several velocity transformations for compressible zero-pressure-gradient boundary layers have been proposed in the past decades, their performance for noncanonical compressible wall-bounded turbulent flows has not been systematically investigated. This work assesses several popular transformations for the velocity profile through their application to several types of noncanonical compressible wall-bounded turbulent flows. Specifically, this work explores direct numerical simulation databases of high-enthalpy boundary layers with dissociation and vibrational excitation, supercritical channel and boundary-layer flows, and adiabatic boundary layers with pressure gradients. The transformations considered include the van Driest (“Turbulent Boundary Layer in Compressible Fluids,” Journal of the Aeronautical Sciences, Vol. 18, No. 3, 1951, pp. 145–216), Zhang et al. (“Mach-Number-Invariant Mean-Velocity Profile of Compressible Turbulent Boundary Layers,” Physical Review Letters, Vol. 109, No. 5, 2012, Paper 054502), Trettel and Larsson (“Mean Velocity Scaling for Compressible Wall Turbulence with Heat Transfer,” Physics of Fluids, Vol. 28, No. 2, 2016, Paper 026102), data-driven (Volpiani et al., “Data-Driven Compressibility Transformation for Turbulent Wall Layers,” Physical Review Fluids, Vol. 5, No. 5, 2020, Paper 052602), and total-stress-based (Griffin et al., “Velocity Transformation for Compressible Wall-Bounded Turbulent Flows with and Without Heat Transfer,” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 118, No. 34, 2021, Paper e2111144118) transformations. The Trettel–Larsson transformation collapses velocity profiles of high-enthalpy temporal boundary layers but not the spatial boundary layers considered. For supercritical channel flows, the Trettel–Larsson transformation also performs well over the entire inner layer. None of the aforementioned transformations work for supercritical boundary layers. For all the considered methods, the transformed velocity profiles of boundary layers with weak pressure gradients coincide well with the universal incompressible law of the wall. In summary, all these popular methods fail to deliver uniform performance for noncanonical compressible wall-bounded flows in the logarithmic region, and a more sophisticated version, which accounts for these different physics, is needed. The data-driven and total-stress-based transformations perform well in the viscous sublayer for all the considered flows. Nevertheless, the present assessment provides a useful guideline on the deployment of these transformations on various noncanonical flows.},

A few shock/boundary-layer interaction (SBLI) cases are examined in some detail, and model modifications are proposed to overcome identified deficiencies. It is shown that using WMLES the low-frequency characteristics of SBLI at high Reynolds number can be quantitatively captured. A dynamically switched version of the equilibrium model is proposed; this shows promise for relatively inexpensive simulations at these conditions.},

In contrast to creating the equivalent system firstly, a novel strategy based on the transfer matrix method is developed, which can directly obtain the equation of motion according to the system topology figure. Actually, any kind of topology of the system, e.g., geared branch or geared closed-loop systems, can be decoupled into a combination of a series of independent chain systems via introducing the virtual branched-gear transfer matrix. The overall transfer equation of the system can be efficiently obtained because the transfer matrix method of a chain system is simply matrix multiplication. The transfer matrices of typical gear types, e.g., reduction gear and planetary gear, are derived. In particular, a simple and aesthetic transfer matrix of rotating beam is derived to solve the rotor blade flapping or lead-lag vibration problems. A dimension reduction strategy is also introduced to address the dimension unmatched issue, further reducing the scale of the overall transfer matrix of the system. At last, an application on modeling an analysis of the coupled flexible rotor blade/engine/tail rotor/drive train system of a helicopter is presented.},

The tangent stiffness matrix of a three-node triangular membrane element is presented. With the modified bimodulus constitutive law, a wrinkling model is constructed for determination of the status of element (tension, wrinkled, or slack). To improve the rate of convergence, a consistent tangent material stiffness matrix is embedded into the local coordinate system. Numerical results are in good agreement with the existing experimental data. In some case, the proposed method can obtain more accurate deflection of inflatable beams than the postbuckling analysis of thin shells.

The experiments are performed using three-dimensional large-scale volumetric velocimetry with helium-filled soap bubbles as tracers, tracked by the particle motion analysis technique “Shake-The-Box.” The mean velocity field reveals the wake deflection due to the ground plane and the formation of toroidal-shape regions of separated flow below each rotor. The interaction of the wall jets formed by slipstream deflection results in a separation line with the flow emerging from the wall in a fountain-like pattern. Regimes of flow re-ingestion occur when the rotors are sufficiently far apart. The flowfield exhibits the tendency toward asymmetric states, during which the fountain flow column and the domain of re-ingestion shift closer to one of the rotors. A generic classification of flow regimes is proposed in relation to the behavior of two rotors in ground effect.},

While they are smooth at zero angle, the boundaries become irregular, and additional isolated regions of stability and instability appear when increasing the yaw angle. This irregularity occurs due to the interaction of multiple spanwise modes, which takes place at nonzero yaw angle due to their aerodynamic coupling.},

A projection-based model order reduction approach is used to create an aerodynamic reduced-order model (ROM), which is coupled to a structural model to create an aeroelastic ROM. The governing aerodynamic equations are the linearized semidiscrete Euler equations. Flutter analysis is conducted by analyzing the eigenvalues of the aeroelastic ROM. A dual-weighted residual-based error estimator is presented which approximates the error in the eigenvalues obtained from the reduced eigenproblem relative to the eigenvalues from the high-dimensional aeroelastic model. The error estimator thus allows for the construction of aeroelastic ROMs with select eigenvalues that satisfy a user-prescribed accuracy. The aerodynamic ROM is constructed using approximate high-dimensional aeroelastic eigenvectors computed using the two-sided Jacobi–Davidson algorithm. Dynamic aeroelastic analyses are presented for the NACA 64A010 Isogai case, the AGARD 445.6 wing model, and a NACA 0012 benchmark case. The error estimator is shown to have good agreement with the exact error. For the test cases presented in this work, the cost of computing the flutter point at a given Mach number is equivalent to the cost of approximately 5 to 12 steady nonlinear flow evaluations of the high-dimensional Euler equations.},

The two narrow spacings show steep control authority gradients in the transition between boundary-layer control and circulation control. The time-averaged flowfields from spanwise stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV) vary significantly between the presented spacings, but the circulation normalized by mass flow rate per jet remains constant for a given momentum input in the boundary-layer control regime. When the spacing is too small for a given oscillator design, the introduced vorticity is unorganized and actuation is less effective for a given momentum input. Once the flow is attached, the circulation reduces for larger momentum inputs (circulation control). This indicates a connection between increased control authority and decreased circulation in the circulation control regime. These findings are supported by novel circulation metrics that describe the level of organization in the flowfield.},

To drastically reduce the computing time, the discharge pulses are artificially damped. Two approximate models for photoionization are implemented and compared. This numerical algorithm is an attempt to compromise two approaches previously proposed: full plasma models, requiring prohibitively long computing time, and phenomenological models, which were based on inadequate physics. The electrical and mechanical characteristics of the electrohydrodynamics flow generated by the discharge are presented and validated by comparing with the experimental data, proving satisfactory accuracy of the model.},

  abstract     = {A fluidic oscillator is a device capable of transforming a steady input flow into an oscillatory output using solely fluid dynamic principles and without requiring any moving components. Although the basic operation principles of fluidic oscillator are known to some extent, the unsteady and turbulent nature of its internal flow remains difficult to understand. The current study aims to further clarify the complicated flow physics involved in fluidic oscillators by investigating a device based on the fluid diverter principle. Spatiotemporally resolved velocity and pressure data obtained from a large-eddy simulation of the internal flow are decomposed into the proper orthogonal modes. The finite-time Lyapunov exponents are computed on the flowfield reconstructed using the proper orthogonal modes to perform a Lagrangian analysis of the switching mechanism. It is found that four dominant modes are sufficient to describe the jet switching. Strong coherent structures are found to separate the flow going through the oscillator from secondary flows through the feedback tube. The deflection of the jet inside the device is found to depend only on the pressure difference across the control ports, whereas the change of this pressure difference is mediated by the flows in the feedback tube.},

  abstract     = {Two-camera plenoptic particle image velocimetry is used to study a three-dimensional (3-D) shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction (SBLI) generated by a single unswept fin. The SBLI considered was the swept interaction induced by a sharp fin at an angle of attack of 15 deg in Mach 2 flow. The fin generates an oblique shock with a wave angle of approximately 45 deg that interacts with the boundary layer on the incident flat plate. As an extension of previous work, these experiments were conducted to examine the effects of momentum-based flow actuation on the 3-D flowfield, as well as reduce the data uncertainty and improve the overall data quality via addition of a second camera. The following three cases are presented for this work: 1) the baseline interaction with the presence of the inactive microjet actuators (physical insert present), 2) the mean SBLI flowfield under the influence of microjet actuation upstream of the oblique shock, and 3) the mean flowfields corresponding to phase-locked images captured at four different phases of the actuator pressure cavity signal. The results show good correlation with the literature of the SBLI with actuation, including a possible shift or rotation of the shock feature during actuation, and an increased velocity deficit and boundary-layer height. The resonance-enhanced microjet actuation also had a notable impact on the low-speed flow region near the fin. This work presents one of the first 3-D measurements of a fin-generated SBLI influenced by flow actuation.},

  abstract     = {This work studies the effectiveness of several machine-learning techniques for predicting extreme events occurring in the flow around an airfoil at low Reynolds. For certain Reynolds numbers, the aerodynamic forces exhibit intermittent fluctuations caused by changes in the behavior of vortices in the airfoil wake. Such events are prototypical of the unsteady behavior observed in airfoils at low Reynolds, and their prediction is extremely challenging due to their intermittency and the chaotic nature of the flow. We seek to forecast these fluctuations in advance of their occurrence by a specified length of time. We assume knowledge only of the pressure at a discrete set of points on the surface of the airfoil, as well as offline knowledge of the state of the flow. Methods include direct prediction from historical pressure measurements, flow reconstruction followed by forward integration using a full-order solver, and data-driven dynamic models in various low-dimensional quantities. Methods are compared using several criteria tailored for extreme event prediction. We show that methods using data-driven models of low-order dynamic variables outperform those without dynamic models and that, unlike previous works, low-dimensional initializations do not accurately predict observables with extreme events such as drag.},

The current state-of-the-art is to rely on user expertise when choosing where to place this modeling interface, whether this choice is tied to the grid or not. This paper presents a postprocessing algorithm that determines the exchange location systematically. The algorithm is based on a model for the error in the predicted wall shear stress and a model for the computational cost, and then finds the exchange location that minimizes a combination of the two. The algorithm is tested both a priori and a posteriori using an equilibrium wall model for the flow over a wall-mounted hump, a boundary layer in an adverse pressure gradient, and a shock/boundary-layer interaction. The algorithm produces exchange locations that mostly agree with what an experienced user would suggest, with thinner wall-modeled layers in nonequilibrium flow regions and thicker wall-modeled layers where the boundary layer is closer to equilibrium. This suggests that the algorithm should be useful in simulations of realistic and highly complex geometries.},

We apply the -factor method based on the linear amplification of boundary-layer instabilities to laminar two-dimensional basic states. -factor correlations that rely on quasi-parallel linear stability theory (LST), the parabolized stability equations, and the harmonic linearized Navier–Stokes equations (HLNSE) yield good agreement with the experimental data, except if the onset of transition occurs slightly downstream of the BFS. For LST, the neglect of nonparallel flow effects results in transition locations that are further upstream compared to HLNSE. In contrast, models that use auxiliary transport equations and transition correlations based on local parameters fail to capture the physics associated with a BFS for moderate step heights. Specifically, the results obtained with the model indicate that it is unable to account for the flow history effects. Results show the amplification-factor-transport model also fails to capture the BFS effects in spite of accounting for the basic-state distortion near the step.},

The model is modified and recalibrated to better match experimental results. The local turbulent intensity is replaced with a more consistent turbulent fluctuation representation to avoid nonphysical solutions at the stagnation point that would contaminate the downstream boundary-layer predictions. A calibration is devised by customizing several constants involved in the equation for the intermittency and the destruction term for the turbulent kinetic energy . An optimization algorithm is thus employed to facilitate the calibration on well-known two-dimensional test cases, such as the flat plates of the T3 series and of Schubauer and Klebanoff (“Contributions on the Mechanics of Boundary-Layer Transition,” NACA TN 3489, 1955), as well as the NACA 0012 airfoil.

  abstract     = {A new stability-based transition transport modeling framework for unstructured computational fluid dynamics is introduced. Based on a four-equation model published recently by the authors of this paper, new model formulations are derived being Galilean invariant and fully local. Moreover, the complexity of the four-equation model is reduced, yielding a one-equation model that is based on a local pressure-gradient parameter and a three-equation model that is based on an averaged pressure-gradient parameter considering convection (history) effects. Since the model versions are identical except the pressure-gradient parameter, the implementation effort is reduced. To be able to compute test cases in adverse pressure gradient flow regions at low Reynolds numbers, a method was developed to accelerate the turbulence production (downstream of the point of transition onset) that can also be used inside laminar separation bubbles. The models were implemented into the DLR TAU code, the unstructured compressible finite-volume flow solver of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) for external flows. For verification and validation purposes different test cases are shown capturing a wide range of parameters and flow conditions. This includes a test case verifying that the model yields identical results with and without uniform motion (Galilean invariance). Additionally, industrially relevant three-dimensional test cases were computed. This includes a helicopter rotor in vertical flight.},

For jet mixing enhancement control, the laser pulses at frequencies ranging from 5 to 25 kHz are introduced inside the jet. The experimental results show that laser pulses significantly improve the jet mixing with jet width increased by 30\% seen from the averaged schlieren images. Three-dimensional unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations are solved, and the numerical results further reveal that the jet mixing enhancement is strongly associated with large-scale vortex rings stimulated by the laser pulses interacting with shock waves. These large-scale vortices prompt the jet cross-sectional area and mixing efficiency two times larger. However, the total pressure recovery coefficient is reduced by 0.16\% downstream. Meanwhile, the turbulent kinetic energy of jet flow is significantly increased and favorable for the jet mixing.},

The subject of the present study is the experimental investigation of the effect of porous coatings on the noise generated by such a tandem cylinder configuration. This was done by performing acoustic and flow measurements in a small aeroacoustic wind tunnel at Reynolds numbers (based on cylinder diameter) between 30,000 and 130,000. It is found that the porous coatings lead to a decrease of both the tonal noise and the broadband noise and to a notable shift of the resulting tonal noise peak toward lower frequencies. The noise reduction is mainly caused by the stabilizing effect of the coating of the upstream cylinder on the wake flow and the absorption of turbulence by the coating of the downstream cylinder. The observed shift of the frequency is most likely due to the mean velocity reduction in the wake of the porous coated upstream cylinder and the interaction of the turbulent flow with the porous coating of the downstream cylinder.},

The derivative skewness is more sensitive to the presence of the largest and steepest shocks, whereas the average steepening factor and shock energy fraction tend to emphasize aggregate behavior of the entire waveform. These metrics are applied at various engine conditions, over a wide range of angles and distances, to assess the growth and decay of shock waves. This paper represents the first time that the development of these metrics is shown from the near field to the far field, out to 305 m. The responses of these metrics point to significant shock formation occurring through nonlinear propagation out to 76 m from the microphone array reference position. Although these strongest shocks decay past 35 m, continued shock formation and atmospheric absorption can make the steepened nature of the waveform more prominent out to 305 m.},

  abstract     = {Open-jet, hard-wall, and hybrid test section configurations are typically used in wind tunnel tests, aiming to represent the ideal free-flight condition. Each test section type requires special adaptations of the experimental hardware and specific correction methodologies that account for systematic measurement errors. Differently from previous research, this paper investigates the comparability of measurements performed in three test section configurations in the same wind tunnel. With this approach, systematic errors related to the facility or boundary-layer tripping methodology are minimized. Basic 2D aerodynamic boundary corrections are evaluated using a DU97W300 airfoil. The corrected lift curve collapsed well while differences in stall behavior and distribution at larger angles of attack are nonnegligible. The trailing-edge noise produced by a NACA-0012, NACA-0018, and NACA-63018 served as reference aeroacoustic sources in this comparability analysis. Moreover, the noise reduction from trailing-edge serrations served as an additional reference for the comparability of relative noise levels. The chord-based Reynolds number of the experiments ranged from 260,000 to 660,000. Unsteady wall pressure measurements performed near the trailing-edge provided a reference for the aeroacoustic noise source terms, demonstrating a negligible change between the different test section types. The applied experimental hardware and acoustic corrections yielded aeroacoustic sources of comparable absolute far-field noise level in the three test section types within . The relative noise levels are comparable within . These results show that aeroacoustic measurements of trailing-edge noise performed in different test section configurations are equivalent, provided that adequate experimental and postprocessing methodologies are systematically implemented.},

  abstract     = {Transient energy growth of flow perturbations is an important mechanism for laminar-to-turbulent transition that can be mitigated with feedback control. Linear quadratic optimal control strategies have shown some success in reducing transient energy growth and suppressing transition, but acceptable worst-case performance can be difficult to achieve using sensor-based output feedback control. In this study, we investigate static output feedback controllers for reducing transient energy growth of flow perturbations within linear and nonlinear simulations of a subcritical channel flow. A static output feedback linear quadratic regulator (SOF-LQR) is designed to reduce the worst-case transient energy growth due to flow perturbations. The controller directly uses wall-based measurements to optimally regulate the flow with wall-normal blowing and suction from the upper and lower channel walls. We show that SOF-LQR controllers can reduce the worst-case transient energy growth of flow perturbations. Our results also indicate that SOF-LQR controllers exhibit robustness to Reynolds number variations. Further, direct numerical simulations show that the designed SOF-LQR controllers increase laminar-to-turbulent transition thresholds under streamwise disturbances and delay transition under spanwise disturbances. The results of this study highlight the advantages of SOF-LQR controllers and create opportunities for realizing improved transition control strategies in the future.},

Limiting the multiquantum jumps of vibration–vibration–translation (VVT) transitions to three in both and can accurately simulate the nonequilibrium nozzle flow. The reduction of VVT transitions to vibration–translation transitions works well. State-to-state modeling of an actual expansion tunnel nozzle condition yielded agreement with the measured static pressure. A study on the influence of different thermochemical excitations in the freestream at the test section shows that the postshock radiation emissions can differ by more than 50\%. However, the non-Boltzmann distributions in the freestream have no influence. An evaluation of the discrepancy between the two-temperature and state-to-state models shows that the former generally predicts a faster thermochemical relaxation. Furthermore, the state-to-state results indicate that, in general, the molecular species all have a different vibrational temperature.},

We developed and tested a rotating detonation engine (RDE) without a throat and with a diverging channel (constant diverging angle ). Gaseous and were used as the propellants, and the mass flow rate ranged from 62 to in the combustion tests under low back-pressure conditions. We measured pressure and thrust, as well as high-speed imaging of self-luminescence of the combustion and imaging of the exhaust plume. The pressure at the exit was less than one-fifth of the maximum pressure in the RDE, significantly below the value for a sonic flow. The results suggested that the exhaust flow was supersonic, with values up to Mach 1.7, without the need of a converging section within the engine. In addition to the estimated Mach number from the measured pressure, the exhaust plume images coherently indicated the existence of supersonic exhaust.},

The results showed that once the flame stabilization changes, the pressure and thrust will meet the abrupt change simultaneously, while three typical flame stabilization and two types of transformation processes were found. One is the switching between the jet-wake flame and the cavity shear-layer flame directly, accompanied by one abrupt change. The other is the switching of the first two flame stabilizations, combined with the cavity shear-layer/recirculation flame, accompanied by two abrupt changes. The reduction in the range of the equivalence ratio and the process of increasing the Mach number will promote the appearance of the second type with two abrupt changes, and the process of increasing equivalence ratio and decreasing Mach number makes the first type with only one abrupt change more likely to occur. In other words, the characteristics of the abrupt change during the flame stabilization transition process are determined by the combined effect of the changing paths of the incoming flow condition and the equivalence ratio. The actual process of Mach- number variation has an obvious historical effect on the flame stabilization transition.},

  abstract     = {To improve the operation efficiency of conventional Ludwieg tube tunnel, a fast-acting valve is usually deployed between the storage tube and Laval nozzle in order to separate the high- and low-pressure air. However, the disturbance produced by the fast-acting valve as well as the nonuniform heating of storage tube affects the flow quality of the hypersonic Ludwieg tube. Stimulated by the motivation of overcoming the mentioned problems, the feasibility of a novel configuration of hypersonic Ludwieg tube is explored in this research. Upon this study, we introduced an additional Laval nozzle and settling chamber to the conventional Ludwieg tube tunnel, while the cross-section area of the main Laval nozzle is smaller than that of the introduced Laval nozzle. To begin with, the flow evolution along the dual-throat Ludwieg tube was analyzed theoretically; subsequently, numerical simulations were conducted to study the starting process of the dual-throat Ludwieg tube tunnel, and emphasis was placed on the influence of different throat area ratios and settling chamber lengths upon the startup time of wind tunnel. Lastly, the flowfield of the dual-throat Ludwieg tunnel was characterized by measuring the Mach number distribution and pitot pressure fluctuation in the test section as well as the pressures along the overall tunnel. The results show that this novel configuration of Ludwieg tube is applicable and it offers the opportunity for flow quality improvement for conventional Ludwieg tubes with small penalty of reducing the tunnel’s efficient running time.},

Central in ensuring reliable numerical prediction of loads is the adoption of meshes that ensure grid independence and minimize the misalignment between the directional flow features and the grid cell interfaces, a situation that is known to give rise to nonphysical behaviors and spurious oscillations. The use of anisotropic unstructured grid adaptation is here presented as a means to ensure appropriate grid resolution and alignment with directional flow features for cases where the use of structured grids is not always possible or practical. Results highlight the effectiveness and reliability of anisotropic mesh adaptation in successfully predicting the location of shock discontinuities as well as surface aerothermodynamic quantities, while providing results comparable with established approaches relying on structured meshes. Results are presented for single- and multiple-body cases through comparison with experimental data and reference numerical solutions.},

  abstract     = {Martian conditions present various challenges when designing rotorcraft. Specifically, the thin atmosphere and low sound speed require Martian rotor blades to operate in a low-Reynolds-number (1000–10,000) compressible regime, for which conventional airfoils are not designed. Here, we use PyFR to undertake high-order direct numerical simulations (DNS) of flow over a triangular airfoil at a Mach number of 0.15 and Reynolds number of 3000. Initially, spanwise periodic DNS are undertaken. Extending the domain-span-to-chord ratio from 0.3 to 0.6 leads to better agreement with wind-tunnel data at higher angles of attack, when the flow is separated. This is because smaller domain spans artificially suppress three-dimensional breakdown of coherent structures above the suction surface of the airfoil. Subsequently, full-span DNS in a virtual wind tunnel are undertaken, including all wind-tunnel walls. These capture blockage and wall boundary-layer effects, leading to better agreement with wind-tunnel data for all angles of attack compared to spanwise periodic DNS. The results are important in terms of understanding discrepancies between previous spanwise periodic DNS and wind-tunnel data. They also demonstrate the utility of high-order DNS as a tool for accurately resolving flow over triangular airfoils under Martian conditions.},

In this study, a high-precision probabilistic imaging method of EMI for the debonding monitoring of the SRM case–insulator interface is proposed. In this method, the Gaussian window function is used to describe the variation of debonding damage index with the position. In addition, an experimental procedure based on simulated damage is presented to determine the parameter in the Gaussian window function. Finite element models of the steel case–insulator structure based on Rayleigh damping are established to analyze the effects of debonding and simulated damage on EMI signals. An experiment is conducted to verify the proposed probabilistic imaging method and the finite element analysis results. It is proved that the proposed probability method can achieve high-precision imaging of debonding of SRM case–insulator, even after several months of storage.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have seen a growing interest in large electric multirotor aircraft for urban air mobility, commercial package delivery, cargo, and military applications. This has led to efforts that aim to model the interactional aerodynamics of rotors operating in close proximity and its impact on performance. While computational fluid dynamics can accurately characterize the physics of multirotor interaction, in most cases it is too computationally demanding for performing studies over a range of parameters. On the other hand, lower-fidelity models approximate the underlying physics and are computationally inexpensive, but are often imprecise in predicting the fields of interest. In this study, we present a multifidelity approach that inherits the accuracy of a high-fidelity method, while retaining the computational efficiency of a low-fidelity model. With this approach, the low-fidelity model is used to span the entire space of parameters and identify key parameter values to perform high-fidelity simulations. A few selected high-fidelity simulations performed at these parameter values are then used in a lifting procedure to determine multifidelity solutions at other parameter values. In this paper we apply this strategy to determine the lift and drag distributions of a two-rotor assembly as a function of the longitudinal and vertical distance between them. We conclude that this strategy can substantially improve upon the low-fidelity results.},

  abstract     = {Intentional mistuning is a well-known factor affecting the vibration of the blisk. This paper mainly focuses on the intentional mistuning effect on the aerodynamic damping and forced response of an axial compressor blisk with random mistuning, and the intentional mistuning types involved in this paper include alternating mistuning, single mistuning, and sector mistuning. The aerodynamic damping of the blisk and its composition are calculated based on the fundamental model of mistuning and influence coefficient method. Under the influence of intentional mistuning, the aerodynamic damping and weight coefficient of each blade in the blisk vary with the modal amplitude and phase. Then, the forced response of the blisk is calculated by the modal superposition method, and the results indicate that intentional mistuning can reduce the increase of forced response caused by random mistuning in two ways: reducing the sensitivity of the blisk to random mistuning and improving the aerodynamic damping of the blisk. Finally, it is found that sector mistuning is better in reducing the sensitivity of the blisk to random mistuning, whereas alternating mistuning is better in improving the aerodynamic damping of the blisk.},

For large-scale, expensive facilities or testing campaigns, such as engine testing, access points can be limited and must be chosen with great care amongst a host of other competing instrumentation and operational needs. This paper introduces a methodology to determine the optimal sensor locations, defined as the locations that minimize the variance of the estimated amplitude of azimuthal eigenmodes, for a given number of sensors and candidate acoustic modes . Given that access may not always be possible at these optimal locations, the same formulation also quantifies the tradeoffs with nonoptimal sensor locations. We present explicit results for optimal sensor locations for identifying a single mode, as well as illustrative computed results for optimal locations to identify multiple modes. For identifying a single mode, it is shown that the optimal placements decrease the uncertainty of the estimated wave amplitudes by and that of the estimated pressure by . We also present a table summarizing optimal locations for and various combinations of the first three azimuthal modes.},

  abstract     = {Many industrial applications, such as gas turbines or aeroengines, are subject to thermoacoustic instability, especially in the lean combustion regime. In this paper, the linearized Navier–Stokes equations (LNSEs) framework is applied to predict the acoustic liner damping effects with real geometry and different bias flow velocities. The results show that the LNSEs can capture the tilt angle effect of the orifice or grazing and bias flow coupling phenomenon. The forced large-eddy simulation results of premixed methane flame present the same trend in gain and phase of the flame transfer function with the equation. Then, the flame response model is coupled into the Helmholtz and LNSE solvers. The mean flow from Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes calculation is used in the LNSEs, and no assumption of liner geometry is made. The linear stability analysis reveals that the velocity fluctuation in the combustion is also damped when a stable acoustic mode is achieved with the acoustic liner. The flame dynamic, the hydrodynamic, and the acoustic phenomena can all be considered when using the LNSEs. This indicates that the LNSEs may allow us to consider a more complex mechanism that can affect the thermoacoustic inability in the combustor system and help us to design better dampers to control.},

The dispersion-relation equation is obtained between dimensionless growth rate and wave number. Because of the axial velocity oscillation of gas, there are more than one instability regions, including Kelvin–Helmholtz (K–H) instability region and parametric instability region. The results suggest that increasing gas swirling strength stabilizes the liquid jet in axisymmetric mode, while it enhances the instability in nonaxisymmetric modes. And the gas viscosity has a destabilizing effect. In addition, increasing the forcing frequency enhances instability in the K–H instability region. However, it has a stabilizing effect in the parametric instability region. Furthermore, increasing oscillation amplitude enhances instability in both the K–H instability region and the parametric instability region. Because of the competition between the parametric and K–H instabilities, the location of dominant wave number is uncertain.},

After modeling a test waveguide, a bivariate curve fit was created to model these stress concentrations, based on four configurations for a single slot length, then refined into a trivariate form based on an expanded eight cases across two slot lengths. Once properly formatted, the integration of the bivariate function into an optimization allowed stress concentration to be estimated at the slot corners within a coarse low-fidelity model, rather than the high-fidelity model otherwise required, following the expected behavior and acting as a verification case. Implementation of the full trivariate form into a design optimization enabled use of the concentration factor to estimate the critical stress.

  abstract     = {Using energetic boron particle as an additive to hydrocarbon gel fuels is an effective method to improve the performance of a scramjet/ramjet system. To evaluate the combustion characteristics and application performances of boron-containing gel fuel in an airbreathing scramjet, a comprehensive experimental study was carried out on the injection, atomization, combustion, solid deposition, and wall heat flux of JP-10 wt\% B gel fuel and JP-10 gel fuel in a directly connected scramjet combustor. The simulated air entered the combustor at a Mach number of 2 and a total temperature of 1700 K, while the gel-fuel equivalence ratio varied between 0.6 and 1.0. The results demonstrated that the volume-controlled fuel supply system driven by electric motor and gas-assisted injector can realize the stable injection and efficient atomization of highly viscous non-Newtonian gel fuels. Two optical diagnostic methods proved that the boron-containing gel fuel is capable of achieving stable combustion in the scramjet combustor with single-cavity configuration. Based on the measurement of wall pressure along the flowpath, the combustion efficiency of the two gel fuels at different equivalence ratios was calculated using the one-dimensional impulse analysis method. The combustion efficiency of the JP-10 + B gel fuel is 3.51\% higher than that of the JP-10 gel fuel, while the addition of boron particles increases the density specific impulse of gel fuel by 8.42\%. These results indicated that the addition of boron particles indeed showed a positive effect on combustion characteristics and engine performance. Finally, the wall deposition phenomenon found in the combustion of boron-containing gel fuel was introduced, and the reason for about 22\% increase in wall heat flux caused by the addition of boron particles was simply analyzed.},

This controller can identify the characteristics of oscillating combustion, achieve adaptive output, and extend the applicability and expansibility. Results show that multiple neural network controller can suppress the pressure oscillation in different oscillating stages using fuel valve or loudspeaker as actuators. When the exact mathematical model of the controlled object is difficult to obtain, it is effective to take a zero-dimensional simplified model with similar oscillating characteristics for prototype controller, and then actively control the real controlled object through parameter migration. It is further demonstrated that this controller is insensitive to noise.

High-speed OH chemiluminescence imaging was employed to understand the transient behavior of the flame in both conditions, with and without RGA, and also to study the process of flame restabilization by the assistance of the RGA. A flame kernel, initiated around the RGA channel, was observed to play an important role in the restabilizing process of the flame.

We successfully incorporate the two essential factors for the evaporating liquid film, droplet entrainment and three-dimensional film architecture, allowing for the physically consistent straightforward formulation. The validity of the present model is conveyed by reproducing combustion test results conducted for two types of flight-model bipropellant thrusters, in which the film length or dryout point shortens approximately inversely proportional to the combustion pressure. The underlying scenario to determine the film length is revealed. The gas flow initiates the originally smooth liquid film to be destabilized by Kelvin–Helmholtz instability in the axial direction and accelerates the wave crests leading to Rayleigh–Taylor instability in the transverse direction. Superposing the two types of waves produces three-dimensional cusps on the film as roots of entrained droplets. The convective heat transfer evaporating the liquid film is enhanced by the entrainment, reducing the net film flow rate, and by the cusp structure, enlarging the area of liquid/gas interface along the transverse direction in particular.},

The water wave is treated by both two-phase-flow wavy water and rigid moving wavy ground, with a specific goal to clarify whether the water wave can be substituted by rigid wavy ground. Results show that for large ground clearance , the aerodynamic forces and flow structures of the near-field airfoil are basically dominated by the passage shape between airfoil and wave surface where the wavy water can be replaced by means of using wavy ground. However, it is different for small ground clearance that the airfoil-induced airflow has a strong relative speed to the water flow and subsequently creates a strong shear force on the forthcoming wave to eject water spray from wave crest. The spray has a sufficient influence on the flow topology and consequently leads to a distinct aerodynamic behavior. Particularly, the strong upstream shear on the wave resulted from the stagnation region at a positive angle of attack induces upwind spray, which can be elevated to hit onto the airfoil with larger density and momentum than airflow causing extraordinarily high pressure on the lower surface as well as unstable aerodynamic forces.},

Recently, a passive leading-edge protuberance control method, inspired by the fin of a humpback whale, has demonstrated obvious advantages in improving airfoil stall. Hence, this study experimentally and numerically investigates the aerodynamic characteristics of an airfoil with twin protuberances at the leading edge. First, the aerodynamic characteristics were investigated for six Reynolds numbers via wind-tunnel experiments, obtaining the hysteresis caused by the test sequence. Then, numerical simulations were performed using a transition shear stress transport turbulence model, and the numerical accuracy was verified. Finally, the influence of structural parameters on stall behavior was revealed by changing the amplitude of the protuberance. The results indicate that the twin-protuberance airfoil produces step-by-step and one-side stall phenomena. The influence of vortices on the movement of separation bubbles on the lower surface is presented. The critical angle of attack for stall increases with increasing Reynolds number; its value for deep stall increases by more than 2 deg. As the protuberance amplitude is reduced, the influence on the airfoil flow is weakened, and the first stall angle increases.},

  abstract     = {Flow unsteadiness in supersonic impinging jets due to the aeroacoustic feedback can lead to practical problems like ground erosion in short takeoff and vertical landing aircraft, high noise levels, and high unsteady structural loading. The shear-layer instabilities of the jet play an important role in the flow dynamics. A full study of these instabilities requires time-resolved measurements of the flow velocity field. However, experimentally obtaining time-resolved velocity fields, derived from particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques, has its challenges in high-speed flow applications due to the simultaneous requirement of high spatial and temporal resolution. A novel approach is presented in this paper, which uses time-unresolved dual-time digital PIV coupled with dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) analysis (DT–DPIV–DMD) of the velocity field pairs and applies it to study the dynamics of the shear-layer instabilities in supersonic impinging jets. DT–DPIV–DMD involves the acquisition of a pair of instantaneous velocity fields separated by a small time delay using two covisual PIV systems. The time delay must be sufficiently small to provide the necessary bandwidth to capture all the relevant dynamics of the flow being investigated. This is followed by DMD analysis of all acquired digital PIV velocity field pairs. A large-eddy simulation of an underexpanded impinging jet at Reynolds number 60,000, with nozzle-to-wall distance was first used to investigate the required measurement scales for the application of DT–DPIV–DMD. Using the optimum measurement scales, the technique was then experimentally demonstrated using DT–DPIV–DMD for two supersonic impinging jets cases and validated with acoustic measurements.},

  abstract     = {Numerical simulations are performed to study the effect of backpressure disturbances on a shock train. The basic problem consists of a shock train within a constant-area channel with an inflow and backpressure applied to the outlet. By subjecting the shock train to different fixed backpressures, it is shown that the shock train length varies linearly with backpressure, while the shock spacing is conserved. Through backpressure step forcing, it is shown that the response of the shocks, after an initial lag, is largely determined by the magnitude of the step change. Step increases in backpressure cause upstream shock movements with higher shock pressures. The opposite response occurs with backpressure decreases. With sinusoidal backpressure forcing, the shock train oscillates at the applied forcing frequency. The forcing propagates disturbances upstream, and therefore there is a noticeable forcing-response lag. Higher frequency disturbances are filtered as they travel upstream through the shock train while lower frequencies induce larger shock oscillations and produce upstream offsets in the shock positions. Further examination of the flow reveals a region of low-frequency motion below the leading shock, which becomes strongly amplified by the lowest backpressure forcing frequency.},

  abstract     = {Kiel probes have the potential to be a versatile tool for determining stagnation pressure gain in rotating detonation combustors (RDCs), accompanying the commonly used equivalent available pressure method. Although average pressure gain values determined with Kiel probes are comparable to those from thrust stand experiments, one can expect several sources of measurement error from the unsteady trans- and supersonic environment. This work investigates the response of a Kiel probe in highly unsteady flow, similar to what would be encountered in an RDC. The probe is subjected to an underexpanded starting jet behind an incident shock with Mach numbers of 1.6–2.7, emanating from a shock tube with a reservoir ratio of about 394. The incidence angle of the probe is varied between 0 and 90 deg, as is the probe’s axial location with respect to the tube’s exit plane. High-speed schlieren images reveal the Mach number of the moving shock wave and the structure of the detached bow shock at the Kiel head, which is similar to that of a bluff body. It is shown that the measured stagnation pressure signal is independent of inflow angle over a range of , and that signal attenuation is caused by gas processing through the bow shock and viscous losses in the probe’s capillary. The frequency response of the Kiel probe to sinusoidal, small-amplitude pressure fluctuations is determined in an acoustic calibration facility up to 5500 Hz, confirming linear behavior and that no unwanted resonance is present in the probe. A Berg–Tijdeman representation delivers amplitude ratio and phase lag of comparable magnitude. An assessment of representative boundary conditions reveals that the average stagnation pressure measurement error is of the order of 1\%.},

A rotating antenna of 63 nonuniformly distributed remote microphones enables a fine spatial resolution, down to 1 mm. The focus is put on the convective velocity, coherence scales, and two-dimensional wavenumber–frequency spectra. The convective velocity is increased by adverse pressure gradients, with values up to 14\% higher than without gradient, which goes against the trend reported in previous studies. Both anisotropy and wall friction are increased by a favorable pressure gradient. In the subconvective region of the wavenumber–frequency spectra, classical models fail to match the data in terms of both levels and decay rates. Finally, the aspect ratio of these spectra’s convective ridges is increased from adverse to zero, and then favorable pressure gradients. These results are discussed in light of the literature on coherent motion in boundary layers and how it is affected by pressure gradients.

Depending on the polarity of dc voltage, the tri-electrode plasma actuator can be operating in three discharge modes: traditional DBD discharge, extended discharge, and sliding discharge. The characteristics of three discharge modes are revealed and analyzed. The evolution of vortices induced by the tri-electrode plasma actuator under burst-mode actuation is investigated by particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurement and schlieren visualization. Results show that in DBD discharge mode, the vortices induced by the tri-electrode plasma actuator is symmetrical and a vertical synthetic jet forms. However, a deflected synthetic jet forms due to the asymmetrical vortices induced by extended discharge and sliding discharge. The deflection mechanism is analyzed from the viewpoint of body force induced by the tri-electrode plasma actuator. The deflected angle of the synthetic jet is identified from PIV measurement and schlieren visualization and found to be nearly linear with , which probably will be a promising result for further flow control applications.},

  abstract     = {Transitory control and regulation of the aerodynamic loads on a static and dynamically pitching VR-12 airfoil is investigated in wind tunnel experiments. Actuation is enabled by a spanwise array of integrated combustion-based actuators that are triggered intermittently relative to the airfoil’s motion, producing high-impulse actuation jets on characteristic time scales that are an order of magnitude shorter than the airfoil’s convective time scale. Poststall transitory actuation leads to a momentary reattachment of the flow over the airfoil, and the effects of sequencing of actuation pulses on the aerodynamic characteristics of the airfoil are assessed using time-resolved measurements of the lift force and pitching moment coupled with particle image velocimetry that is acquired phased-locked to the airfoil motion. The present investigations show that the aerodynamic loading can be significantly altered by a number of actuation programs using strategically timed bursts during the pitch cycle. While actuation during the upstroke primarily affects the formation, evolution, and advection of the dynamic stall vortex, actuation during the downstroke accelerates flow reattachment. Superposition of such actuation programs can lead to enhancement of cycle lift and pitch stability, and reduced cycle hysteresis.},

The highly efficient UHBR engines are characterized by a large diameter that interferes with the flow around the wing, especially with slats deflected, degrading its performance. An innovative AFC device, creating steady suction and pulsed blowing (PB), was installed in the leading-edge region of the wing, above the nacelle, and its performance was experimentally evaluated. The effects of the suction and PB mechanisms were examined individually and simultaneously using relevant normalized parameters to pave the way to a full-scale wind-tunnel test. It was shown that the AFC actuators increased lift by up to 3\%, redirected the flow to the desired downstream direction, and reduced the size of the separation zone created due to the implementation of the UHBR nacelle. The next step is validating the small-scale results of this study in a full-scale wind-tunnel tests that would be the last step before the technology is flight test ready.},

A multipole impedance model is converted into the time domain and used for enforcing an impedance boundary condition over a wide range of frequencies. Discretization of the coupled system is described. In particular, the time-domain impedance boundary condition is discretized by the third-order implicit backward difference scheme.

Two custom-made rigs were used to quantify the transmission loss (TL) and self-noise of all fabrics. The pores were found to serve as a low-resistance gateway for sound to pass through, hence enabling a low TL. The TL was found to increase with decreasing open area ratio (OAR), whereas other fabric properties had a minor impact on TL. The thread density was found to be a primary factor in determining the frequency range of porous fabrics’ self-noise, with the OAR potentially playing a secondary role in the self-noise levels. Fabrics with irregular pore distribution showed a more broadband self-noise signature associated with lower frequencies compared to fabrics with periodic pore patterns. Overall, fabrics with an irregular pore distribution or fabrics with increased thread density were identified as two potential ways to obtain superior aeroacoustic behavior compared to commonly used Kevlar fabrics.},

  abstract     = {Vortex–body interaction noise from a rod–airfoil model has been investigated experimentally in an aeroacoustic wind tunnel. The model configuration varies by changing either the rod cross section (circular, square, rhombic, and elliptical) or the install angle of the airfoil at three directions (attack angle , sweep angle , and lean angle ) independently. This paper aims to assess the effects of these parameters on the characteristics of vortex–body interaction noise. A near-field microphone array was applied to locate the noise sources on the rod–airfoil model, and a far-field microphone array determined the noise level and radiation directivity. The results suggest that, in the test range, both the elliptical rod cross section and the change of the airfoil install angles can visibly reduce vortex–body interaction noise compared to the baseline rod–airfoil containing the circular rod and the airfoil at zero angles. The interaction noise level decreases with the increase of the eccentricity of the elliptical rod. Of the angles, the most effective way is the change of the sweep angle , which can achieve a noise reduction of 8 dB when reaches 20 deg, but the attack angle has more influence in reducing the vortex shedding frequency. In addition, the noise source distribution of different frequencies also changes with the variation of rod–airfoil configurations. Flow visualization using particle image velocimetry was conducted to analyze the noise change mechanism. The findings from this study are beneficial for engineers in designing low-noise components in several aeronautical and industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {The present work is dedicated to the modeling of the low-frequency part of the jet installation noise (JIN) in flight conditions. It is known that the properties of JIN can be predicted based on the characteristics of the near field of an isolated jet. Unlike the static case, in the presence of a coflow, it is difficult to directly measure the structure of the pressure perturbations in the jet near field. To overcome this problem, we propose a technique based on hot-wire measurements on the jet axis, suitable both for static and flight conditions. The well-known agreement between a parabolized stability equations (PSEs) model and experimentally measured velocity fluctuations on the jet axis allows using the PSE approach for the reconstruction of the axisymmetric pressure fluctuations in the vicinity of the wing trailing-edge location. The first helical mode, which is also important for the jet installation noise prediction, is approximately reconstructed based on the fact that its properties are close to those of the axisymmetric mode. These pressure characteristics are then used as input in an analytical jet installation noise model. To confirm this approach, acoustic measurements of JIN in static and flight conditions are conducted for a laboratory subsonic jet installed near a flat plate simulating a wing. It is shown that the analytical model informed by the PSE-reconstructed pressure field is capable of capturing the main features of the low-frequency jet–plate interaction noise both in static conditions and in the presence of coflow.},

A low-noise geometry is examined along with the reference profile on a rectilinear seven-vane cascade rig using a hybrid computational fluid dynamics/computational aeroacoustics method. Numerically assessed noise reductions from the serrated airfoils are favorably compared with an analytical solution and a semi-empirical law. An overall sound power-level reduction around 4 to 6 dB is obtained at three acoustic certification points.

This configuration can be susceptible to nonlinear feedback phenomena due to the mutual coupling between the aerodynamic and acoustic fields in the proximity of the slit.

The response of the Helmholtz resonator to an incident acoustic field is analyzed using a two-port characterization technique. The onset of the aeroacoustic instabilities is investigated by applying an acoustic energy criterion based on the scattering matrix formulation. The Nyquist stability diagram is studied to determine the system stability and identify the whistling occurrence. The two- and three-dimensional numerical results are compared to experimental data obtained from a dedicated measurement campaign. The comparison between the numerical and experimental data demonstrates a very good agreement, highlighting the potential of the applied numerical approach for the investigation of the aeroacoustic instabilities.

  abstract     = {Noise pollution caused by inflow turbulence is a major problem in many applications, e.g., propellers and fans. The Amiet leading-edge noise prediction model is widely applied in the design of silent propellers and fans, strongly relying on the accuracy of the inflow turbulence spectrum. The von Kármán energy spectrum accurately models the energy-containing range and inertial subrange of the turbulence spectrum. However, this model does not incorporate the dissipation range of the turbulent energy and leads to incorrect far-field noise estimates in the high-frequency range. In this study, empirical formulations are presented for the dissipation frequency and the dissipation range based on experimental data. Two passive grids were used to generate nearly isotropic inflow turbulence, which was characterized by hot-wire anemometry. These results showed that the dissipation frequency depends on the intensity of the velocity fluctuations and on the freestream velocity. The expressions proposed to predict the dissipation frequency and the dissipation range had a fairly good agreement with the measured data in this research and with experimental data from the literature. The predicted leading-edge noise is significantly affected by the dissipation range, causing a decrease in level of up to 17 dB for the highest frequencies.},

  abstract     = {The use of transition models in Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solvers is usually accompanied by high values of the eddy viscosity at the inlet, due to the role of this quantity in controlling the decay of freestream turbulence, a critical factor in the behavior of these models. This paper presents a new approach to control the decay of freestream turbulence that avoids setting high values for the inlet eddy viscosity. The proposed method is based on the modification of the dissipation term of the turbulence model only in the freestream, ensuring that the original formulation of the model is retained in regions where viscous effects are significant. The new technique is tested on the flow over a flat plate and around a NACA 0012 airfoil and a prolate spheroid, using the model. The results show that the method allows for reductions of up to three orders of magnitude of the inlet eddy viscosity, without disturbing the solution of the original model for cases with low or moderate turbulence intensity. The method requires the Kato–Launder stagnation point correction to be used in the underlying turbulence model, due to the strong influence of the turbulence production limiter on the location of transition.},

  abstract     = {The velocity field associated with the deflection of a laser beam passing through a heated incompressible boundary layer in the wall-normal direction was studied using variants of the classical proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) technique. Due to the heating of the boundary layer, temperature, density, and index of refraction fields were variable in the boundary layer and were instantaneously affected by turbulent coherent structures. The time-varying index of refraction field led to a time-varying beam path of a laser traversing the boundary layer; the final angle of the laser beam was measured simultaneously with particle image velocimetry. The relationship between coherent structures in the velocity field and the final beam angle was studied using conditional POD and space-time POD. Conditional POD was performed on the wall-normal velocity field using conditions of large upstream and downstream laser deflections. The modes from conditional POD were compared to modes from POD without conditions. Physical features within some conditional POD modes were found to be shifted in the streamwise direction compared to unconditioned modes, suggesting that the streamwise position of velocity features was correlated to laser deflection. Space-time POD resulted in the same modes as the conditional POD and showed the modes convecting in the streamwise direction without a significant change in the size of the structures. This suggested a hypothesis that the laser deflects when coherent structures reach particular positions relative to the laser position as the structures convect, aligning the largest local velocity and density gradients with the laser beam path.},

  abstract     = {Adjoint methods for aerodynamic design optimization have been a considerable area of research in computational fluid dynamics. Several approaches have been developed to fully couple the flow, adjoint, and design equations for steady flows. However, only limited attempts have been made to apply those to unsteady flows using a monolithic approach. This study aims to fully couple the primal, adjoint, and design equations based on a harmonic balance technique allowing the unsteady flow optimization to be performed in a single monolithic computation. The harmonic balance is the appropriate method for such problems as it reformulates unsteady time-periodic problems as “mathematically steady,” where one does not need to store the entire time history of the primal solution. The novel unsteady technique will be applied to a time-periodic lid-driven cavity. Here, the Reynolds number is taken to be the design variable so as to match a target vorticity distribution at the first subtime level of the time-spectral (harmonic balance) solution. Finally, mean drag minimization of a rotationally oscillating cylinder in crossflow is performed. In all cases, it is shown that the proposed method is quite efficient, requiring less than a couple of hundred total iterations to identify the “optimum” conditions.},

  abstract     = {The surrogate model-based sampling method has been an active area of research due to its evident efficiency over direct sampling method. The fusion of the adaptive kriging (AK) model with the adaptive radial-based importance sampling (ARBIS) method is developed as an improvement of the AK model combined with Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method especially for estimating the small failure probabilities. In the AK–ARBIS method, the number of candidate samples in each updating process of the kriging model is reduced through partitioning the whole MCS sample domain into different subdomains and removing the samples inside the last subdomain from the participating candidate sampling pool, which can avoid the time-consuming matrix operation involved in kriging predictions in order to find the best training sample in each updating step. In the existing AK–ARBIS method, kriging model stops updating according to the learning function-based stopping criterion, which cannot directly reflect the error of the estimated failure probability. In this regard, this paper proposes the error-based stopping criterion (ESC) enhanced AK–ARBIS method, where the processes of finding the optimal hypersphere and accurately identifying the sign of candidate samples are decoupled in order to successfully embed the ESC. In addition to embedding the ESC into the AK–ARBIS method, two target-oriented candidate sampling reduction strategies are investigated, respectively, to improve the efficiency of finding the optimal hypersphere and accurately identifying the sign of the participating candidate samples. Based on the candidate sampling pool reduction strategies and ESC, both the computational time and the required number of calls to the real limit state function are reduced over the existing AK–ARBIS method. Three case studies are analyzed to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed enhanced AK–ARBIS method, especially for estimating the small failure probabilities.},

  abstract     = {Turbine performance in modern aeroengines is heavily affected by the nonuniform temperature distribution generated in the combustor. The conventional method to study the effect of nonuniform boundary conditions (BCs) is to compare flowfields and performance metrics with the nonuniformity at several typical positions. A much more efficient and intuitive method to analyze the BC sensitivity is proposed in this paper. An inlet guide vane is analyzed as a demonstration. The sensitivity analysis is achieved by pointwise derivatives of objectives with respect to inlet BCs, which are obtained by discrete adjoint method. Furthermore, to study the variation of gradients, a random sampling method that is based on the Gaussian process is proposed to explore the high-dimensional parameter space. When the gradient is invariant within the parameter space, the relationship between objectives and BCs is linear, and the effect of any perturbation of BCs can be directly predicted. In this case, the computational cost of the sensitivity analysis is drastically reduced to one computational fluid dynamics and one adjoint simulation. Interestingly, some gradients are nearly invariant across the parameter space. When the gradient varies, the active subspace method is introduced to reduce the number of dimensions. Then, several models, including the kriging, gradient-enhanced kriging (GEK), and Taylor expansions, are compared to predict objectives. The ordinary kriging model is recommended for its accuracy and stability. The GEK model can also predict the gradient and is a good choice for small BC variations. The method presented here offers a paradigm that extends the gradient-based sensitivity analysis to the global sense, which is suitable for high-dimensional problems such as BCs and spatially varying model parameters.},

  abstract     = {The Bayesian uncertainty quantification technique has become well-established in turbulence modeling over the past few years. However, it is computationally expensive to construct a globally accurate surrogate model for Bayesian inference in a high-dimensional design space, which limits uncertainty quantification for complex flow configurations. Borrowing ideas from stratified sampling and inherited sampling, an adaptive model refinement approach is proposed in this work, which concentrates on asymptotically improving the local accuracy of the surrogate model in the high-posterior-density region by adaptively appending model evaluation points. To achieve this goal, a modification of inherited Latin hypercube sampling is proposed and then integrated into the Bayesian framework. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach are demonstrated through a two-dimensional heat source inversion problem and its extension to a high-dimensional design space. Compared with the prior-based method, the adaptive model refinement approach has the ability to obtain more reliable inference results using fewer evaluation points. Finally, the approach is applied to parametric uncertainty quantification of the Menter shear-stress transport turbulence model for an axisymmetric transonic bump flow and provides convincing numerical results.},

  abstract     = {A nonlinear two-equation model has been implemented in the OpenFOAM framework and has been assessed for the computation of hypersonic flows with shock-wave boundary-layer interactions (SWBLIs), together with two other linear, low-Reynolds number models, namely the Launder–Sharma model and the shear stress transport model. Supersonic and hypersonic flow computations resulting from the use of these three models have been compared with experimental benchmark cases over a range of conditions. The three original models tested do generally return reasonable predictions of wall pressure in most cases, with the nonlinear model resulting in the best capability among the three in predicting flow separation. The wall heat flux in the interaction region, however, is overpredicted, in most cases by all three models (sometimes showing quite a dramatic overprediction). While the overall wall heat flux predictions of the nonlinear model are closer to the measured values, it is nevertheless evident that there is a need for further improvement. To address this need, the inclusion of a new source term in the dissipation rate equation is proposed, which aims to restrict the turbulent length scales in the shock-wave boundary-layer interaction region. This is inactive in incompressible flows and exerts only a minor influence in supersonic SWBLI cases. Computations of a range of supersonic and hypersonic flows with SWBLI show that this inclusion of the proposed source term in the dissipation rate equation, of both the nonlinear and the linear models, has significant effects only in hypersonic flows. These effects are mainly confined to the thermal predictions of these models. In the nonlinear model predictions, the overestimation of the wall heat flux in the SWBLI region is largely eliminated, while, in the corresponding predictions of the linear model, the overestimation is substantially reduced. The cubic nonlinear model tested, with the proposed new source term to the dissipation rate equation, is thus shown to be a very reliable and cost-effective tool for the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes modeling of supersonic and hypersonic flows.},

The boundary-layer profile of the rms pressure fluctuation scaled by the mean shear stress at the wall is found to be in good agreement with prior flat-plate calculations at similar conditions. However, the normalized rms pressure fluctuation within the freestream region is significantly higher than that in the unconfined case, by a factor that is approximately equal to . The application of two different compressibility transformations to the computed mean velocity profiles indicates that, in comparison with the van Driest transformation, the Trettel and Larsson transformation provides a better collapse with flat-plate simulations over a broad range of Mach numbers. The DNS data also reveal that, in spite of displaying a strongly non-Gaussian behavior inside the boundary layer, the radiated acoustic fluctuations in all thermodynamic variables have a skewness of approximately 0.3, indicating a minor deviation with respect to Gaussian behavior. Surface pressure fluctuations along the nozzle walls are not significantly impacted by the acoustic waves radiating from the opposite wall.},

Mesh deformation using radial basis functions (RBF) with only a subset of surface points is popular due to the efficiency and mesh quality produced by the technique. However, this technique can reduce the rate of convergence of the coupled-adjoint and even prevent the coupled-adjoint equations from converging. This paper proposes a hybrid mesh-deformation strategy to improve the efficiency of coupled-adjoint optimizations: use the RBF method with a data-reduction algorithm when deforming the mesh within FSI simulations but use the Delaunay graph mapping (DGM) method in the coupled-adjoint procedure. The DGM method increases the rate of convergence of the coupled-adjoint matrix, relative to the RBF approach with a data-reduction algorithm, with the additional benefit of being a faster method. Using this hybrid approach, an optimization in which lift and pitching-moment constraints are satisfied within the FSI simulation is performed. The results of the optimization, and the effects of the hybrid approach, are presented.},

  abstract     = {Supersonic and hypersonic vehicles experience significant aerothermal loads from the exterior flowfield and/or their propulsion system. Thus, reliable prediction of aerothermal heating is important for the design of such vehicles. However, even modest temperature changes can lead to buckling of mechanically constraint lightweight structures. This deformation changes the flowfield, which can lead to locally amplified heating, which in turn increases deformation and temperature even further. Thus, fluid–structure coupled modeling of such problems is crucial for the reliable prediction of the resulting temperatures. To investigate these phenomena numerically, we conducted a three-dimensional thermomechanical simulation of fluid–structure interaction (FSI) for thermal buckling. It is necessary to use a thermomechanically coupled model because the temperature and deformation distributions across the panel are highly nonlinear and dependent on both the flowfield and the state of the structure. Due to the high temperatures in the metallic panel and the constrains, which allow no uniform expansion, the stresses exceed the yield stress, and plasticity occurs. A strong two-way coupled FSI simulation was set up and split into a thermal solid, a mechanical solid, and a fluid computation. The simulated temperature and displacement distribution were compared to experiments conducted in the arc-heated wind tunnel L3K at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). We obtained good agreement between the simulation and experimental results. The observed deformation of the structure was found to locally increase the wall heat flux by up to 40\%.},

  abstract     = {In the present study, free vibration analyses of porous functionally graded material (FGM) sandwich plates are carried out in thermal environment. Two types of sandwich plates such as sandwich with FGM face sheets and homogeneous core and sandwich with homogeneous face sheets and FGM core are considered for free vibration analysis with nonlinear temperature variation over the thickness direction. The metal and ceramic components are assumed to be temperature dependent. The higher-order layerwise theory is adopted with an eight-noded rectangular element to build a finite element model for free vibration analysis. A radial basis function network (RBFN) based surrogate model is developed to investigate the stochastic frequency response due to the uncertain material properties. The accuracy and the efficiency of the RBFN model are established by comparing the results with that of Monte Carlo simulation. Further, the developed surrogate model is implemented to perform various parametric studies and sensitivity analyses. The influence of the volume fraction index, types of porosity, and thermal gradient on the stochastic frequency response are analyzed. Though the influence of different stochastic input parameters is strongly dependent on the volume fraction index, the mass density of metal is found to be the most sensitive parameter for the sandwich plate with FGM face sheets and homogeneous core.},

The elastic foundation analysis used here is comprehensive and includes the deformation of the substrate part (core and the bottom face) and is done for generally asymmetric sandwich construction. To capture the transverse shear effects, the Timoshenko beam theory is used, which introduces an additional degree of freedom. A finite length sandwich is treated as having a debonded section, where the debonded top face and the substrate are free, and a bonded section, where an elastic foundation is used between the face and the substrate. The interaction between the face and the substrate in the bonded section is modeled using both normal and shear spring distributions. A double-cantilever beam specimen with applied external moments and shearing forces is chosen to demonstrate the procedure. The energy release rate is obtained by use of the J-integral. A mode partitioning measure in terms of the crack flank opening and shearing displacements is used. The results are compared with finite element results and show very good agreement.},

The Eulerian data show that compositional structure at axial location ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 has two branches, the unburnt branch and the burning branch. To reveal the underlying physics of the compositional structure, the statistics of leading point are analyzed and show that there are Gaussian-like and non-Gaussian probability density function (PDF) distributions upstream and downstream of about . Further analysis of the flow–leading point interaction shows that the region of ranging from 0.25 and 0.5 is where the instability of the outer shear layer occurs. Two different interaction patterns exist upstream and downstream of corresponding to Gaussian-like and non-Gaussian PDFs, respectively.

  abstract     = {Advances in wind-plant control have often focused on more effectively balancing power between neighboring turbines. Wake steering is one such method that provides control-based improvements in a quasi-static way, but this does little to fundamentally change the wake recovery process, and thus, it has limited potential. This study investigates use of another control paradigm known as dynamic wake control (DWC) to excite the mutual inductance instability between adjacent tip-vortex structures, thereby accelerating the breakdown of the structures. The current work carries this approach beyond the hypothetical by applying the excitation via turbine control vectors that already exist on all modern wind turbines: blade pitch and rotor speed control. The investigation leverages a free-vortex wake method (FVWM) that allows a thorough exploration of relevant frequencies and amplitudes of harmonic forcing for each control vector (as well as the phase difference between the vectors for a tandem configuration) while still capturing the essential tip-vortex dynamics. The FVWM output feeds into a Fourier stability analysis working to pinpoint candidate DWC strategies suggesting fastest wake recovery. Near-wake length reductions of are demonstrated, although without considering inflow turbulence. Analysis is provided to interpret these predictions considering the presence of turbulence in a real atmospheric inflow.},

This work experimentally examines the internal and external flow behavior of porous UHTC made of zirconium diboride for the purpose of transpiration cooling. A dedicated ISO standard permeability test rig was built. The outflow velocity distribution was acquired employing miniature hot-wire anemometry. The data obtained for the pressure loss across the porous samples agree with the Darcy–Forchheimer model for flow in porous media; respective Darcy and Forchheimer permeability coefficients are calculated and reported. Cleaning the surface of the samples using sandpaper or an ultrasonic bath raised the permeability coefficient by up to 19\%. The outflow velocity maps exhibit a good flow uniformity with an average standard deviation of 25.1\% with respect to the mean value. Individual jets are absent, and the velocity varies within the same order of magnitude.},

  abstract     = {This paper numerically investigates the energy expenditure of the coflow wall jet for separation control by analyzing the widely studied NASA hump with two-dimensional unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes equations. The coflow wall jet is shown to be effective in both adverse and favorable pressure gradients but is more efficient in adverse pressure gradients due to lower velocity, lower entropy increase, and more enhanced mixing. An energy-efficient way to devise a coflow wall jet flow control is twofold: 1) place the injection near the separation onset point at a slightly downstream location, and 2) place the suction slot further downstream with sufficiently long distance in adverse pressure gradient region for a thorough mixing and energy transfer. The vanishing of the counterclockwise wall jet vorticity appears to indicate a sufficient mixing distance. In that case, the injection plays the dominant role. The suction makes a small contribution with a weak coupling effect but primarily serves as the flow source for the mass conservation of the zero-net-mass-flux flow control, which is essential to be energy efficient. The coflow wall jet is also compared with the injection-only and suction-only flow controls, which are effective if the slots are placed at the desirable position slightly downstream of the separation onset point. But if they are not placed near the separation onset locations, the coflow wall jet is much more efficient and effective than the injection-only or suction-only flow controls due to the coupling effect between the injection and suction.},

In SADE-KTS, a novel knowledge-transfer-based sampling method is integrated with the differential evolution framework to generate promising initial sample points. In this way, a least-squares support vector machine classifier is constructed based on the prior optimization knowledge database to calibrate the initial sample points adaptively, which improves the exploration performance via transferring the existed optimization efforts to the current optimization task. Moreover, the radial basis function and kriging surrogates are employed to replace the expensive simulation models for evolutionary operations, where the tailored differential evolution operators are cooperated with the sequential quadratic programming optimizer to lead the search to the global optimum efficiently. A number of numerical benchmarks are tested to illustrate the optimization capacity of SADE-KTS compared with several competitive optimization algorithms. Finally, SADE-KTS is applied to an airfoil aerodynamic knowledge-based optimization problem considering the existed optimization knowledge, which demonstrates the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed SADE-KTS in engineering practices.},

  abstract     = {A novel two-dimension sampling optimization method (2DSO) is proposed for the stacking sequence design of composite laminates. The concept of using lamination parameters (LPs) to characterize distances of different stacking sequences is introduced. The first step involves using the boundary vertices and boundary lines of the LPs to yield randomly and uniformly distributed continuous variables in the LP design space. In the second step, stacking sequences are generated randomly and evaluated with a dynamic distance constraint to ensure their LPs are close to previous continuous variables. Following this, objective values are computed for these feasible points; and several best point candidates are identified. Next, the local sampling optimization is performed by generating new stacking sequences in the vicinity of the aforementioned best point candidates. The preceding two steps are repeated until the best objective converges. Lastly, a sequential permutation search (SPS) serves as a local optimization solver to target the global optimum. Because design optimization is always conducted in the stacking sequence design domain and the LP is employed to measure the distances of distinct stacking sequences and ensure uniform distribution of initial points, no feasible constraint is needed for LP; therefore, the optimal vortices are captured efficiently. The 2DSO method is used to optimize the fundamental frequency and buckling load of composite plates and shells, and the results are compared to a layerwise optimization approach (LOA), the SPS, and a genetic algorithm (GA). The results demonstrate that 2DSO outperforms LOA and SPS, and it has similar robustness to GA while being significantly more efficient.},

Applied electric field excitation expands the dielectric elastomer in the in-plane direction by compressing it into the thickness direction, which causes a change in the tension and ultimately affects the dynamic behavior of the elastomer. This study outlines the modal characteristics and fluid-structural dynamic behavior of the very high bond 4910 membrane, a type of dielectric elastomer, especially in an abrupt flow environment. An experimental shaker arrangement along with the digital image correlation system is used for experimental vibration testing. A finite element model is developed to study the modal characteristics and validate the experimental results. A fluid–structure interaction model of the electroactive membrane and its surrounding airflow is also developed to investigate the aerodynamic responses of the structure. Gust environments are predicted using the von Kármán and Dryden gust models, and the effect of different gust velocities on the aerodynamic lift and drag are obtained from the numerical fluid–structure interaction models. A wind tunnel, equipped with a data acquisition system, is used to study the aerodynamic responses and validate the numerical results experimentally. The modal analysis shows that the resonance frequencies decreased as the applied electric field excitation is increased. The coefficients of lift and drag fluctuate with the stochastic gust distribution, and the effects of von Kármán and Dryden gust profiles on aerodynamic characteristics are comparable. The values of the coefficients of lift and drag increase with the increase of applied voltage. The numerical results for the modal and aerodynamic responses show a good agreement with their corresponding experimental findings.},

A baseline model for a corrugated flapping wing is constructed such that the balance among the aerodynamic, elastic, and inertial forces acting on the wing matches that acting on insect wings in accordance with the measured material properties of insect wings. The thickness of the corrugated airfoil and the amplitude of corrugation are systematically varied around the baseline to modulate both the natural frequencies and mode shapes. Unsteady aeroelastic simulation based on three-dimensional Naiver–Stokes equations is conducted for the corrugated flapping wings. The numerical simulation is validated by measuring the natural frequency and mean lift of corrugated flapping wings. The results indicate that the corrugation of insect flapping wings is aeroelastically effective in providing both an appropriate passive deformation and a lightweight wing. To maximize the hovering efficiency, the optimal amplitude of corrugation is 1.7 to 2.6\% of the chord length, the wing mass ratio is 0.7 to 1.5, and the natural frequency is 2.1 to 2.6 times as large as the input flapping frequency. These optimal design parameters are close to (but slightly smaller than) those of insect wings.},

The aerodynamic model is directly built using the continuous-time state-space unsteady vortex lattice method. The coupling relationship between structural and aerodynamics models is proposed innovatively with interpolation between structural generalized coordinates and incremental normal vectors on the collocation points of aerodynamic panels. The resulting aeroelastic model with the state-space equation can be used for flutter and dynamic response analysis by considering a rapid folding/unfolding process. The analysis results show that the folding and unfolding processes have opposite effects on both the aerodynamic load and aeroelastic characteristics.

This study investigates the effects of local geometric nonlinearities on the dynamic stability, postflutter behavior and gust response of floating wing tips. A multibody formulation is introduced to account for finite rotations of rigid folding wing tips attached through hinges on a flexible airframe structure including also aerodynamic follower forces for the folding wing tip components. It is found that the postflutter behavior is characterized by super-critical limit cycle oscillations and no subcritical instability was observed for the analyzed cases.

The notable advantage is that the bilinear nonlinearity in hinge joints and the variation of morphing configuration is modeled theoretically using a parameterized fictitious mode approach. The nonlinear, parameter-varying aeroservoelastic system is represented by piecewise-linear modal-based aeroservoelastic equations according to the different combinations of nonlinear parameters in hinge joints. The proposed nonlinear aeroservoelastic modeling methodology can efficiently investigate aeroservoelastic frequency responses, nonlinear aeroservoelastic vibration, and closed-loop stability because the nonlinear aeroservoelastic model is built via the parameterized fictitious modal coordinates, which can represent the bilinear structural stiffness and variation of morphing parameter simultaneously. To demonstrate the modeling accuracy and efficiency of the present method, a folding wing with two bilinear stiffnesses due to backlash in inboard and outboard hinge joints is selected as a test case. The numerical results show that the open-loop and closed-loop nonlinear behaviors of the morphing wing at different folding configurations can be efficiently investigated.

  abstract     = {Grid fin is widely used in the field of aerospace because of its unique advantages in the aerodynamic and structural performance. Meanwhile, the aerodynamic and structural characteristics of the grid fin are quite different from those of the conventional rudder. Deep understanding of the aeroelastic characteristics and mechanism of the grid fin is of great reference value for the fine design of grid fin. In this paper, an efficient reduction-order-method-based aeroelastic analysis method is established, and the method is verified by the flutter case of AGARD 445.6 wing. Finally, based on this method, the flowfield characteristics and the variation of flutter characteristics with Mach number are studied in detail. The results show that in the subsonic region, the transonic flutter “dip” of the grid fin occurs earlier than that of the conventional wing due to the acceleration effect of the grid fin on the airflow. In the transonic region, when the flowfield is characterized by a bow shock wave, the critical flutter speed increases slightly with the increase of Mach number. However, in the supersonic region, when the flowfield is characterized by an oblique shock wave, the flutter critical velocity increases substantially with the increase of Mach number. It is found that the variation law of the flutter boundary with Mach number is very similar to that of the normal force and the pitching moment with Mach number, and there is a close relationship between them. The ratio of flutter speed of the grid fin to the freestream velocity will reach the minimum value near . At the same time, it is discovered that the flutter instability of the grid fin is mainly caused by the coupling of the bending mode and torsional mode of the grid fin, and the instability mode is the torsional mode. Meanwhile, it should be noted that the flutter coupling characteristics of the grid fin differ greatly from those of the conventional rudder surface due to the great difference in structural characteristics and unsteady aerodynamic characteristics.},

Given the time series of the lift coefficient at different angles of attack for the OAT15A supercritical profile, the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) technique is used to extract a parameterized, interpretable, and minimal-order description of this dynamics. For all the operating conditions considered, SINDy infers that the dynamics in the lift-coefficient time series can be modeled by a simple parameterized Stuart–Landau oscillator, reducing the computation time from hundreds of core hours to seconds. The identified models are then supplemented with equally parameterized low-dimensional dynamic mode decomposition based state observers enabling real-time estimation of the whole flowfield from the predicted lift. The value of this simple model is in the possibility of enriching sparse data sets in the buffet regime for new geometries. Only a few unsteady simulations need to be performed to adjust the coefficients of the identified model and then supplement the data set with new cases. Simplicity, accuracy, and interpretability make the identified model an attractive tool toward the construction of real-time systems to be used during the design, certification, and operational phases of the aircraft life cycle.},

We propose a Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov method to solve nonlinear systems arising from the discretization of the Navier–Stokes equations. The method successfully predicts the buffet onset, the buffet frequency, and turbulence statistics owing to the high-order DG discretization and an efficient mesh refinement for the laminar and turbulent boundary layers. A number of physical phenomena present in the experiment are captured in our simulation, including periodical low-frequency oscillations of shock wave in the streamwise direction, strong shear layer detached from the shock wave due to shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction and small-scale structures broken down by the shear-layer instability in the transition region, and shock-induced flow separation. The pressure coefficient, the root mean square of the fluctuating pressure, and the streamwise range of the shock wave oscillation agree well with the experimental data. The results suggest that the proposed method can accurately predict the onset of turbulence and buffet phenomena at high Reynolds numbers without a subgrid scale model or a wall model.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a new design methodology guaranteeing optimal performance and constraint satisfaction with acceptable risks is presented. This methodology is particularly tailored to conceptual design, wherein variability stemming from modifications that will inevitably occur in downstream design phases must be taken into account. Based on second-order Taylor expansions, a new method allowing the transformation of this robust-optimal design problem with acceptable risks into an equivalent deterministic quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem is provided and then applied to an example problem for validation. Hence, all the available QCQP optimizers can be used to find a robust-optimal solution. The proposed methodology is applied to the blended-wing/body (BWB) at the conceptual design phase, where robust drag minimization is sought under a pitching moment constraint. Numerical results show the impacts on both the BWB optimal planform parameters and guaranteed drag as a function of the acceptable risk levels taken. The study shows that two of the six planform shape variables are significantly affected by the risk level, namely, the kink parameter and the outer wing span. Variations of almost 20\% are obtained on these two variables for a risk level of 0.1\% as compared to a standard deterministic optimization.},

  abstract     = {The airfoil design problem, in which an engineer seeks a shape with desired performance characteristics, is fundamental to aerodynamics. Design workflows traditionally rely on iterative optimization methods using low-fidelity integral boundary-layer methods as higher-fidelity adjoint-based computational fluid dynamics methods are computationally expensive. Surrogate-based approaches can accelerate the design process but still rely on some iterative inverse design procedure. In this work, we leverage emerging invertible neural network (INN) tools to enable the rapid inverse design of airfoil shapes for wind turbines. INNs are specialized deep-learning models with well-defined inverse mappings. When trained appropriately, INN surrogate models are capable of forward prediction of aerodynamic and structural quantities for a given airfoil shape as well as inverse recovery of airfoil shapes with specified aerodynamic and structural characteristics. The INN approach offers a roughly 100 times speed-up compared to adjoint-based methods for inverse design. We demonstrate the INN tool for inverse design on three test cases of 100 airfoils each that satisfy the performance characteristics close to those of airfoils used in wind-turbine blades. All generated shapes satisfy the desired aerodynamic characteristics, demonstrating the success of the INN approach for inverse design of airfoils.},

These tools have to incorporate simulation of aircraft noise generation at the source (i.e., emission) and account for prevailing sound propagation effects to ultimately predict noise levels as received on the ground. Obviously, understanding the associated uncertainties is crucial when aiming at a reliable and meaningful assessment. It also becomes essential when comparing different technologies, mixing experimental and numerical data, or using simulation methods of different fidelity (e.g., semi-empirical and first-order methods). This research focuses on quantifying uncertainties in the first step in aircraft noise simulation (i.e., the prediction of the emission situation). The quantified uncertainties reflect imperfections of models for different aircraft noise sources and variability of model input parameters at different operating conditions. A general framework is presented, which also accounts for limited knowledge of the underlying data distributions, and quantitative comparisons of different uncertainty methods are provided. In particular, the first-order second-moment analysis is compared to higher-order polynomial chaos methods, and the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods are discussed.},

Additionally, a variable fidelity paradigm is adopted with the ability to model one-, two-, and four-way coupling between the dispersed and carrier phases depending on the desired levels of physical realism. Particle mesh-localization is performed using mesh-connectivity information, which also simplifies boundary conditions enforcement, parallelization, and the backcoupling of particle-induced source terms to the carrier fluid.

This paper investigates these issues by implementing a variety of blending functions in the NASA OVERFLOW computational fluid dynamics solver and comparing them with the existing length-scale blending models. Scenarios considered include a zero pressure gradient flat plate, subcritical flow around a cylinder, and a supersonic reattaching shear layer. Overall, the eddy-viscosity blending methods produce results similar, if not improved, to their length-scale blending counterparts. In particular, it was found that the entropy function gave more control and stability during the transition from RANS to LES.},

We establish spectral convergence of errors for Kovasznay flow. We then validate the definition of the stabilization parameter for Couette flow, flat plate, and compression corner problems. In a later example, we solve the flow past a cylinder and benchmark results with previously published results obtained with low-order methods and other approaches in compressible flow computations. We further solve hypersonic flow past a wedge and supersonic flow past a Flight Investigation of Re-Entry program (FIRE) entry capsule.

Self-propelled inviscid simulations and previously published experimental data are used to validate the scaling laws over a wide range of motion amplitudes, Strouhal numbers, heave ratios, aspect ratios, and pitch axis locations. The scaling laws are shown to predict inviscid numerical and experimental data well, within and of the thrust and power data, respectively. It reveals that both the circulatory and added mass forces are important when considering a wide range of motion amplitudes and that nonlinear corrections to the classic linear theory are essential to modeling the power performance across a wide amplitude and aspect ratio range. By using the scaling laws as a tool, it is obtained that peak efficiency occurs when dimensionless amplitude and for these large-amplitude motions there is an optimal nondimensional heave ratio , where the efficiency maximizes in the narrow range of . Finally, the scaling laws show that to further improve efficiency in this high-efficiency regime, the aspect ratio and dimensionless amplitude should be increased, whereas the Lighthill number should be decreased (lower drag and/or a larger propulsor planform area to wetted surface area ratio), and the pitch axis should be located behind the leading edge.

Accurately predicting the aerodynamic performance of the high-lift configuration, especially the stall behavior, is important for aircraft design. However, the complex flow phenomena of high-lift configurations pose substantial difficulties to current turbulence models. In this paper, an eddy-viscosity turbulence model is used to compute the stall behavior of high-lift configurations. A separated shear layer fixed function is implemented in the turbulence model to better capture the nonequilibrium characteristics of turbulence. Different high-lift configurations, including the two-dimensional multi-element NLR7301 and Omar airfoils and a complex full-configuration model (JAXA Standard Model), are numerically tested. The simulations show engineering accurate results and indicate that the effect of the nonequilibrium characteristics of turbulence is significant in the free shear layer, which is key to accurately predicting the stall behavior of high-lift devices. The modified shear layer fixed model is more accurate in predicting stall behavior than the Spalart–Allmaras, shear stress transport, and original models for the full high-lift configuration. The relative errors in the predicted maximum lift coefficients are within 3\% of the experimental data.},

A reduced frequency, based on laminar separation bubble shedding, was enlisted to explain the differences between the two results. Under conditions of dynamic pitching, evidence of a dynamic stall vortex was absent, due to its interaction with the strong tip vortices, consistent with prior experimental and numerical investigations. As a general rule, performance benefits produced by excitation under quasi-static conditions were reproduced under harmonic pitching. Low-order dynamic stall and dynamic stall control models, based on a modified version of the Goman–Khrabrov delta-wing concept, were evaluated. Model constants were obtained from quasi-static data sets, and a single baseline dynamic case was employed to determine the time constants. The model produced excellent results for both baseline and controlled cases, which was attributed to similar lift and stall mechanisms exhibited by delta and rectangular low-aspect-ratio planforms.},

In the present paper, we examine its role in destabilizing stationary and travelling crossflow vortices in the boundary layers over the NLF(2)-0415 swept wing, for which experiments found that micrometer-sized roughness caused earlier transition. Our analysis shows that the generalized resonance mechanism operates in a swept-wing boundary layer. Under the assumption that roughness consists of all spectral components, a crossflow mode with a fixed-dimensional frequency and wavelength resonates at each chordwise location with one or more other modes. We derive the amplitude equations for the interacting modes. The calculations show that the resonance is highly effective, especially when the roughness elements are near the leading edge. Importantly, it is found that the wave numbers of the roughness spectra participating in the most effective resonant interactions are very close to those of the right-branch neutral stationary eigenmode. As a result, micrometer-sized distributed roughness generates a perturbation of much larger amplitude, which alters, through the resonant interactions, the local growth rates of the crossflow vortices by an amount for both stationary and travelling vortices. We also traced the chordwise development of crossflow vortices with fixed-dimensional frequencies and spanwise wave numbers by integrating the local growth rate, or by solving the initial-value problem of the amplitude equations, for roughness without and with chordwise modulation. For roughness with a height of , the accumulated effect of the dominant resonances, whether acting alone or simultaneously, leads to a significant correction to the amplification factor of stationary and travelling vortices.},

The height and depth of the throat of the nozzle were 500 and 150 μm, respectively. A plenum chamber was added to the inlet of the supersonic nozzle and a reservoir was connected to the outlet of the test section to ensure a steady pressure condition during experiments. The microsupersonic wind tunnel was fabricated through microelectromechanical lithography, and a pressure-sensitive paint (PSP) was applied to acquire the pressure contours inside the microsupersonic wind tunnel at various pressure conditions. A divergent angle of 4 deg was added to the test section to resolve the viscous layer growing from the side walls and to ensure a steady flow during the measurements. A flow speed of Mach 1.6 was achieved with inlet and outlet pressures of 100 and 20 kPa, respectively. A circular cylinder model with a diameter of 50 μm was positioned at the exit of the test section to examine the flowfield. Because of the viscous effect, the shock wave cannot be identified but local high- and low-pressure regions could still be observed through PSP measurements.},

  abstract     = {An impinging jet produces a highly unsteady flowfield which results in very high noise levels, harmful structural vibrations, and significant loss of lift and stability in applications such as the short takeoff and vertical landing aircraft. An understanding of the flowfield and implementation of an effective flow control technique are necessary to reduce these adverse effects. The presence of multiple impinging jets leads to the generation of a fountain flow, which further adds to the complexity of the flowfield dynamics. In the present study, flowfields of a single supersonic round jet (Mach 1.5) and dual impinging jets (consisting of a Mach 1.5 supersonic jet and an additional sonic jet) are explored. A microjet-based control method is applied to attenuate flow unsteadiness by modifying shear layer instability characteristics of the supersonic jet. Passive and active influence of the microjet hardware on acoustics are examined over a range of impingement distances (2.25D–10D) with a fine resolution (D/16) to obtain detailed resonance characteristics. Based on the resonance tone behavior as a function of impingement distances, detailed flowfield characteristics at certain impingement distances are investigated with the help of schlieren visualization, near-field acoustics, and unsteady surface pressure measurements. The effectiveness of the microjet flow control method in reducing noise is also evaluated in the flowfield of single and dual impinging jets. For single and dual impinging jets configuration, relative to their respective baseline cases, the microjet control on dual impinging jets shows better noise attenuation of overall sound pressure level within short impingement distances .},

The experiments were performed at supercritical, critical, and subcritical operating conditions and at 0 deg angle of attack and angle of side slip. The results showed that the present DSI had an acceptable performance at its design condition. A symmetric supersonic flow pattern was observed at both supercritical and critical operating conditions. At low subcritical operating conditions, the supersonic flow pattern remained symmetric too. However, at high subcritical operating conditions, an asymmetric supersonic flow pattern was observed at both 0 deg angle of attack and sideslip angle. Moreover, an asymmetric pressure ratio distribution inside both diffusers, left and right, were observed. This asymmetric flow behavior in a perfectly symmetric Y-shaped DSI inlet seems to have not been noticed by the previous researchers, but if it has, the result has not been published yet. The performance curve of the current DSI presented at both symmetric and asymmetric flow patterns reveal a significant reduction in its performance characteristics at high subcritical operating conditions that is believed to be caused by the asymmetric flow patterns. In addition, symmetric and asymmetric secondary normal shock- wave patterns were further observed during both supercritical and high subcritical operating conditions. It is observed that the flow asymmetry in this inlet happened when the inlet exit area had blocked more than 50\% of the aerodynamic interface plane.},

The flowfield prediction model is trained and validated using independent experimental data. The proposed model’s prediction performance under different prediction spans is discussed in depth. The results demonstrate that the predicted flowfield is in good agreement with the ground truth, and the background wave and shock train structure are basically restored, even when the shock train leading edge changes intermittently.

  abstract     = {A recombination reaction model for high-temperature chemical kinetics is analytically derived from ab initio simulation data. When atoms recombine, the kinetic rate model shows that product molecules favor high vibrational energy states. In this manner, recombination repopulates high vibrational energy states depleted by dissociation, in a high-temperature reacting gas. Coupling of internal energy relaxation, dissociation, and recombination results in depleted or overpopulated (relative to a corresponding Boltzmann distribution) vibrational energy distributions. Through a simple model, we show that non-Boltzmann behavior, in other words, depletion or overpopulation of high-energy states, is not only linked to thermal nonequilibrium but also chemical nonequilibrium. The mathematical derivation also indicates that the conventional approach for modeling recombination rates, where shock-tube dissociation rate measurements are combined with the principle of detailed balance, is incorrect. The complete analytical dissociation/recombination model embeds all relevant kinetic processes, including specific terms for translation/rotation/vibration/chemistry coupling, anharmonic and quasi-bound effects, and non-Boltzmann depletion and overpopulation effects. The model is a multitemperature model that can be used within computational fluid dynamics simulations with no appreciable increase in computational expense. Finally, because the model is analytical, containing separate terms for various physical effects, further model simplification could be performed depending on the flow conditions of interest.},

The U-shaped waveforms predicted by this method are in good agreement with measured data. The effects of atmospheric turbulence are also considered by replacing one-dimensional analysis using augmented Burgers equation with multidimensional wave propagation analysis near the ground surface. Results with the atmospheric turbulence effects show better agreement with measured U-shaped waveform than ones without such effects.

It could be demonstrated that a concave bump designed for a given flow-deflection angle is capable of significantly reducing the size of the separation bubble as well as the total pressure losses throughout the Mach number range investigated. The achievable gains depend on the Mach number, the flow-deflection angle, and the relative impingement position of the incident shock front on the bump. The highest values of separation-length reduction (up to 100\%), momentum thickness reduction (up to 31\%), and pressure recovery factor increase (up to 33\%) were obtained at the optimum shock impingement position for the largest deflection angle studied.

  abstract     = {Shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions (SWBLIs) are critical phenomena in the design of high-speed vehicles as they exhibit inherent unsteadiness that can damage airframes and lead to engine unstart. This paper presents a novel characterization of the unsteady dynamics of cylinder-induced SWBLIs at Reynolds numbers of and using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). Data sets analyzed in this paper were obtained from experiments conducted in the NASA Langley Research Center’s 20-Inch Mach 6 blowdown wind tunnel. The experiments used a cylinder protuberance model mounted on a 10° half-angle wedge to create the interaction. The lower-Reynolds-number case was observed to have a transitional incoming boundary layer, whereas a swept ramp array trip was used in the higher-Reynolds-number case to generate a turbulent incoming boundary layer. The POD analysis from both cases helped isolate spatial regions in the separation bubble that contained the highest percentage of energy for each case, which correlate to the dominant structures in the flow. A power spectral density analysis on the POD temporal components of the highest-energy POD mode (mode 1) revealed a frequency spectrum with a distinct peak at in the lower-Reynolds-number case and a band of high-energy peaks in the range of 0.05–0.2 for the tripped SWBLI case. Through the DMD analysis, an unsteadiness mode was isolated at and an asymmetric motion of the forward lambda shock was identified in the lower-Reynolds-number case. This dynamic asymmetry was not detected in the higher-Reynolds-number case, suggesting that the asymmetric effect may be unique to interactions in transitional incoming boundary layers. Additional spectral-kernel-based POD analysis identified primary unsteadiness frequencies that were in agreement with the DMD findings. A low-frequency mode at , exhibiting relatively high energy, was obtained for the lower-Reynolds-number (transitional) case, whereas a broadband “bump” with increased energy over a frequency range of was observed for the higher-Reynolds-number (tripped) case. Through these analysis techniques, a mode, likely connected to a shock-breathing mechanism, was identified at . In the assessment of the structural motion occurring in the shock-breathing mode, the phenomenon in the lower-Reynolds-number case was found to traverse a longer upstream distance and compress to a larger degree when compared with the breathing behavior in the higher-Reynolds-number case.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new detumbling strategy for non-cooperative tumbling targets using a low-thrust device. The device with a harpoon on the front is released from the servicing satellite and embedded in the target. Then, the device’s thrusters are used to reduce the target’s angular velocity. In this paper, an impact model between the target and the device is established based on the conservative principle of linear and angular momentum. The dynamic equation of the combined system after impact is derived based on the principle of virtual power. A detumbling control scheme combining the linear quadratic regulator (LQR), pulse-width pulse-frequency (PWPF) modulation, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is developed. The continuous optimal control signal obtained by LQR is transformed into a series of pulse signals by a PWPF modulator. To improve the performance of the detumbling controller, the weighting matrices of LQR are optimized by PSO, and two constrained optimization problems are studied. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed strategy are verified by numerical simulations.},

This paper presents an effective topology optimization method for PMSMs to seek excellent working performances based on the material-field series-expansion model. This model represents the motor topology by using a reduced series-expansion of the material field, which leads to a significant reduction in the design variables. The optimization problem of PMSMs is solved using the Kriging-based programming to avoid the tedious sensitivity analysis and difficulties presented by local minima. Complex objective functions involving the nonlinear electromagnetic field and ferromagnetic materials can easily be handled in the optimization procedure. Numerical examples, including the total magnetic potential energy minimization problem and the torque maximization problem for PMSMs, are given to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Eigenvalue and eigenvectors are essential metrics to characterize dynamic system behavior and stability. When performing gradient-based design optimization, derivatives of these metrics are required. Analytic forward algorithmic differentiation (FAD) for a self-adjoint generalized eigenproblem has been a useful technique. However, reverse algorithmic differentiation (RAD) is preferred over FAD because it scales more favorably with the number of design variables. We propose two RAD formulas based on their mode-based FAD counterparts that project the derivative onto a reduced eigenvector space. One challenge for the mode-based derivative is that the reduced eigenvectors yield inexact gradient results. An approximation technique mitigates this issue. We verify the proposed methods by implementing a reverse Lanczos iteration and the adjoint of an Euler–Bernoulli beam test case.},

The surface reconfiguration of the cable net reflector is the essential precondition for active shape adjustment of mesh antennas. In this paper, we proposed a surface reconfiguration method based on the modal theory and transfer learning method. The proposed surface reconfiguration method was divided into three steps. The first step is that the axial error distributions of preselected points of the cable net reflector is derived analytically by the electromechanical coupling method together with far-field mapping. The second step uses a modal theory to predict axial mechanical deformations of discrete nodes of cable net reflectors by the derived axial errors of preselected points. In the last step, the transfer learning theory together with the deep learning algorithm is adopted to predict radial mechanical deformations of discrete nodes of cable net reflectors. Simulation and comparative results show the proposed surface reconfiguration method can accurately predict displacement deformations of mesh antennas.},

The manually generated meshes are the result of a systematic study of the influence of a range of meshing parameters on solution accuracy. Using the adapted meshes generally leads to a reduction of more than one order of magnitude in lift and drag error relative to the manually generated meshes of a comparable node count for all of the computational fluid dynamics solvers. Alternatively, the node counts of the adapted meshes are more than an order of magnitude smaller than the manually generated meshes for a given lift and drag error level. The improved accuracy in lift and drag computed with the adapted meshes can partially be attributed increased resolution around the stagnation points and trailing edges of the airfoil elements relative to the manually generated meshes. Notably, the adapted meshes provide accurate results despite having values generally significantly larger than one.},

The method uses a generalized spatial-domain gust response function in the place of the Sears function that differentiates the strip experiencing the gust and the strip producing force. This generalized gust response function is computed with an incompressible unsteady vortex lattice method. The vortex lattice operates in the time-domain to simulate the development and relaxation of the wake to steady state and then switches to a frequency-domain approach to evaluate the gust response. The total wing response to homogenous isotropic turbulent inflows is numerically integrated to produce stochastic turbulent lift spectra. The numerically generated transfer functions are compared to the Sears and Filotas gust response functions. The effects of finite span and sweep on both the transfer functions and lift spectra are investigated.},

The flutter phenomena and limit cycle oscillation correspond to two different types of self-induced instabilities, which happen at a Mach number, freestream velocity, and angle of attack combination for which the airfoil or control surface attains a stable oscillation. Gust acts as an external force to an aerostructural system. The airfoil shows a beating pattern under a periodic gust when the gust frequency coincides with the flutter frequency. However, this pattern evident at flutter velocity is absent when the periodic gust encounters an aeroelastic system at limit cycle oscillation velocity. The present work also shows the impact of periodic gust front on the shock/boundary-layer interaction modifying the coefficient of pressure and coefficient of skin friction distribution and leading to a multiple-frequency and multiple-amplitude aeroelastic motion. Fast Fourier transform is applied to the structural response to explore the frequency content corresponding to the structural response and dominant fluid modes for different flow Mach number regimes under the influence of the periodic gust. These frequency characteristics of the structural responses and flowfield in inviscid and viscous flowfield are distinct for different test cases and reveal the underlying physics of several multiple-frequency and multiple-amplitude aeroelastic motions, frequency coalescence, generation of a new frequency, and so on, as shown in this study.},

  abstract     = {Complex computations and analyses on massive data sets can be impractical or infeasible. Data reduction is a crucial problem in the era of big data to obtain a reduced representation of the data set to facilitate more efficient yet accurate analyses. To best preserve the integrity of the original data set, a reduced representation aims to best maintain the same data distribution, referred to as a probabilistically representative subset. This paper considers the problem of reducing a large data set to very small such subsets at which random sampling does not perform well enough. We propose a data mining approach called Probabilistic Representatives Mining (PREM) to tackle this challenge. PREM uses balanced clustering to prevent undersampling and oversampling issues and multistage computing strategy to achieve better scalability and consistency. Numerical experiments on typical probability distributions and real-world data sets in the field of aeronautics and astronautics demonstrate PREM’s superiority over the baselines. An uncertainty quantification case study from aviation environmental impact modeling further shows PREM’s effectiveness and accuracy in generating probabilistically representative small samples for costly computations. Potential limitations and extensions of the method are also discussed in the paper.},

As stated by the unified uncertainty analysis based on the first-order reliability method (FORM-UUA), it is possible to merge the probability and evidence theory to quantify the belief and plausibility of a specific performance function under mixed uncertainty. When the number of evidence variables and the number of intervals increase, the number of evaluations grows dramatically. As a result, if the hybrid reliability analysis is included in an optimization problem, usually referred to as nested hybrid reliability-based design optimization (HRBDO), it becomes unmanageable due to its high computational cost. The strategy proposed allows to avoid the computation of the subplausibilities for each focal element as required in the FORM-UUA. This strategy decouples the nested HRBDO into an iterative process with a deterministic optimization and a reliability analysis phase consisting of two separate but connected reliability analyses that handle separately the random and evidence variables. Then, the optimum design obtained is checked and adjusted through the FORM-UUA method. One analytical and one numerical problem are presented to validate the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {To deploy the airframe digital twin or to conduct probabilistic evaluations of the remaining life of a structural component, a (near) real-time crack-growth simulation method is critical. In this paper, a reduced-order simulation approach is developed to achieve this goal by leveraging two methods. On the one hand, the symmetric Galerkin boundary element method–finite element method (SGBEM-FEM) coupling method is combined with parametric modeling to generate the database of computed stress intensity factors for cracks with various sizes/shapes in a complex structural component, by which hundreds of samples are automatically simulated within a day. On the other hand, machine learning methods are applied to establish the relation between crack sizes/shapes and crack-front stress intensity factors. By combining the reduced-order computational model with load inputs and fatigue growth laws, a real-time prediction of probabilistic crack growth in complex structures with minimum computational burden is realized. In an example of a round-robin helicopter component, even though the fatigue crack growth is simulated cycle by cycle, the simulation is faster than real-time (as compared with the physical test). The proposed approach is a key simulation technology toward realizing the digital twin of complex structures, which further requires fusion of model predictions with flight/inspection/monitoring data.},

  abstract     = {The partial differential equations of a circular truss beam–ring structure with antenna extended and locked are studied. The differential quadrature method is used to discretize the differential equations and boundary conditions in a spatial domain. The method of equation substitution and the method of boundary conditions are directly substituted into the internal discrete equations and are used to deal with the boundary conditions. The natural frequency of the beam–ring structure is calculated and verified by the natural frequency obtained by Galerkin’s method in paper (Wu et al., “Vibration Frequency Analysis of Beam–Ring Structure for Circular Deployable Truss Antenna,” International Journal of Structural Stability and Dynamics, Vol. 19, No. 2, 2019, Paper 1950012). To solve the problem when there are multiple mixed boundary conditions at a point, the method of replacing the internal discrete equation with boundary conditions is not unique and the solution accuracy is low, so the differential algebraic equations are used to replace the boundary conditions directly into the internal discrete equation, and the iterative scheme is established. Finally, the fourth-order-Runge–Kutta method is used to solve the problem. Based on the numerical results, the two methods are compared by using a 200s time history diagram, 10,000s displacement constraint diagram, 10,000s velocity constraint diagram, etc. The results show that the mixed boundary conditions can be solved more accurately by using differential algebraic equations, and the stability of constraints can be maintained under long-time simulation.},

The flow is modeled based on a potential theory for thick and thin airfoils considering the coupled interference effect. Coupled aeroelastic equations of motion are formulated in a state-space form and solved explicitly using a predictor–corrector scheme. The numerical analyses are presented for airfoils in proximity with and without structural coupling. It is shown that the airfoils in proximity oscillate out of the phase and destabilized the airfoils at lower speeds. The closer the airfoils are, the lower the speed at which flutter instability occurs. Also, the interference effect becomes more significant on reducing the flutter speed for thick airfoils in proximity. For structurally coupled airfoils, the flutter instability occurs at lower speeds for the lower coupling stiffness value. It is further worsened in the presence of aerodynamic interference. Although, for a larger stiffness value, the flutter instability could be delayed in the presence of aerodynamic interference. This study finds that the lifting surfaces in proximity without structural coupling can become unfavorable in the aeroelastic design. The results provide preliminary insights into the coupled structural and aerodynamic interference effects on the flutter instability for a multiple lifting surface configuration.},

Recent developments in synthetic techniques for porous metals have made it possible to produce them for specific applications, which are intended to provide increased sound absorption. However, if a porous metal is employed in the presence of grazing flow, it is difficult to predict its sound absorption properties. In this study, the acoustic properties of two well-known types of stainless-steel porous materials with different porosities, that is, sintered fiber and cellular foam, were investigated using impedance tube and flow duct experiments. The impedance in flow duct experiments in the absence of flow is almost the same as that in impedance tube experiments, except for the cellular foam sample with high porosity, which may not be a locally reacting material. Furthermore, the effects of grazing flow on the impedance of the porous sample can be separated into those due to the average flow velocity and those due to the flow velocity gradient in the wall-normal direction. Both effects depend on the pore structure and porosity of the porous samples.},

Parametric investigations show that this treatment reduces scattered noise near resonance frequencies.

To gain a deep understanding of flow behavior, four configurations are evaluated, both experimentally and numerically, in which one of the rotors will be in windmilling or locked mode while the other is in powered mode. The spanwise distribution of the loading coefficient and flow angles at different streamwise positions reveals the details of the flow development across the rotors. The windmilling rotor depicts the existence of a “neutral radius,” where compressor and turbine behaviors coexist. When rotor-2 is windmilling, the neutral radius is identified closer to the tip of the blade. In contrast, when rotor-1 is windmilling, the neutral radius is identified closer to the hub of the blade. The flow coefficient has a significant effect on the position of the neutral radius. Results from numerical simulations imply that the flow separates from the pressure surface in the span regions where the rotor behaves as a turbine and from the suction surface in the span regions where the rotor behaves as a fan.},

By viewing the interstage flow as the so-called spiral-Poiseuille flow, linear stability analysis of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations reveals two distinct instability regimes at the Reynolds numbers up to : The first mode excites disturbances over wide frequencies, including the rotor speed, and forms wavepacket-like structures above the outer-wall boundary layer. The second mode evolves inside the outer-wall boundary layer with slower velocity and possesses much smaller axial wavenumbers. We extract these modes using an approach analogous to dynamic mode decomposition from a database of our improved–delayed–detached eddy simulation solving NASA’s turbofan-rig test at low speed. The dynamic mode decomposition technique successfully visualizes these two instability modes even at , and their dispersion relations approximately agree with the characteristics predicted by the linear stability analysis. These analyses suggest that the instabilities amplify coherent disturbances in the rotor wakes and vortices near the tip until they interact with the stator; moreover, coherent structures associated with the second instability may act as stationary objects, possibly resulting in an additional fan-noise source.},

In addition, near-field acoustic measurements were performed in two different directions relative to the nozzle exit, and the velocity field was measured using planar particle image velocimetry. The results indicate that changing the internozzle spacing alters the fountain-flow strength, while the jet impingement characteristics remain relatively unchanged. The broadband and discrete high-amplitude tones are a function of nozzle spacing and show unique directivity.

In this work, the ensemble Kalman filter-based acoustic inversion method is introduced to reduce uncertainties in the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate based on the far-field noise and the axial centerline velocity data. The results show that jet noise data are more effective from which to infer turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate compared to velocity data. Moreover, the inferred noise source is able to improve the estimation of the turbulent flowfield and the far-field noise at unobserved locations. Further, the noise model parameters are also considered uncertain quantities, demonstrating the ability of the proposed framework to reduce uncertainties in both the RANS and noise models. Finally, one realistic case with experimental data is investigated to show the practicality of the proposed framework. The method opens up the possibility for the inverse modeling of jet noise sources by incorporating far-field noise data that are relatively straightforward to be measured compared to the velocity field.},

  abstract     = {A generalized acoustic analogy model is implemented for the hot and cold static high-speed jet cases corresponding to conditions of the Strategic Investment in Low-carbon Engine Technology (SILOET) experiment performed by QinetiQ. The model is statistical and based on the covariance of fluctuating Reynolds stresses and enthalpy source terms in accordance with Goldstein’s theory. These quantities are obtained from a solution of the validated large-eddy simulation accelerated on graphics processing units. The covariance of fluctuating enthalpy terms is represented by the Khavaran and Bridges model, which involves the velocity autocorrelation function and temperature gradient in the jet. The velocity autocorrelation function and the covariance of fluctuating Reynolds stresses are approximated by an analytical Gaussian-exponential function. The input parameters of the acoustic model include single-point quantities such as the time-averaged local streamwise velocity, sound speed, temperature, vorticity magnitude, turbulent kinetic energy, and dissipation rate. Modeling choices for the acoustic length and time scales based on either the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate or mean flow vorticity are discussed. In each case, the model involves two dimensionless parameters associated with the acoustic correlation length and time scale. These two parameters are calibrated based on the far-field noise data at 90° observer angle. The sensitivity of the calibration coefficients to the jet type, cold versus hot, is investigated. Furthermore, the same acoustic model without recalibration is applied for far-field noise predictions of two NASA Small Hot Jet Acoustic Rig jets for acoustic Mach numbers 0.5 and 0.9. To probe the sensitivity of the acoustic model to the input flow data, Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solutions of the same jet cases are considered along with the large-eddy-simulation solutions.

  abstract     = {The target of reducing the environmental footprint of the aviation industry has continually driven the need to design more efficient and quieter aircraft engines. In this paper, the aeroacoustic adjoint formulization for low-shock tone noise fan blade design is first proposed and combined with the aerodynamic adjoint analysis to develop an adjoint-based, multi-objective design optimization process for transonic fan blade design. High-fidelity numerical simulations are employed in the optimization loop to predict aeroacoustic and aerodynamic objectives and gradients. Aeroacoustic and aerodynamic design optimizations of an industrial transonic research fan are conducted using the proposed adjoint-based approach, demonstrating that the noise performance and the efficiency of the fan can be improved simultaneously. Results indicate that the significant reduction in the sound power level of the fan shock-associated tone noise is achieved by a compound leading-edge sweep pattern generated by the optimizations. Flowfields and acoustic results of the optimized blades are then analyzed to understand the noise reduction mechanism.},

  abstract     = {An experimental facility was recently developed at the Georgia Tech Research Institute to measure the acoustic scattering coefficients of a test article under mean flow, high-temperature, high-amplitude, and higher-order mode propagation conditions. The experimental facility acts like a two-sided impedance tube, in which the measurement section is a circular duct with 16 acoustic drivers and 16 microphones mounted on each side of the test article. Such a facility can be configured for grazing and bias flow measurements of acoustic liners with sound traveling in and against the direction of the flow. The new facility is designed to maximize the accuracy of acoustic measurements of higher-order modes in heated flows. The influence of experimental uncertainties on the acoustic measurements is analyzed using a Monte Carlo method. Measurements of half-wave resonators in quiescent air and heated flows demonstrate that the experimental uncertainty decreases as the absorption coefficient increases. High-sensitivity microphones produce extremely low uncertainty, and even lower-sensitivity pressure transducers are sufficiently accurate for many applications. This paper is intended to serve as a reference for designing and analyzing an experimental facility to measure the acoustic scattering coefficients in heated-flow and higher-order mode propagation conditions.},

A predictive method that combines an empirical wall-pressure spectrum model and an acoustic diffraction model is used to predict airfoil turbulent boundary-layer trailing-edge noise. In this study, a NACA 0012 airfoil and a NACA 64-618 airfoil are used to analyze the effects of the design parameters on airfoil aerodynamic performance and trailing-edge noise.

At low to intermediate angles, thrust generally decreases with airspeed, as with the axial propeller, whereas an opposite trend is observed at high angles, resembling wings. However, an explicit determination of the transition from propeller to wing-like behaviors is lacking. Such transition characteristics are investigated, under the scope of the axial and wing-equivalent components of the propeller’s thrust, which have been demonstrated to comprise total thrust, in a previous paper. For this, wind tunnel experiments are conducted at incidence angles up to 90° on four small-scale fixed-pitch propellers, with blade angles up to 23°. At the angle of thrust behavioral inversion , opposite sensitivities to advance ratio are observed for each thrust component, annulling the sensitivity of the thrust coefficient. At angles higher than , as grows, the wing component positive sensitivity is dominant, and the wing component itself largely exceeds the axial term, causing the propeller to behave like a wing. Consequently, is defined as the propeller’s transition angle from axial-dominant to wing-like behavior. The tests showed occurring at lower angles for higher pitch propellers.},

Data were compiled from previous measurements for three two-dimensional airfoils in the Virginia Tech Stability Wind Tunnel with similar experimental arrangements. Measurements included the surface pressure distribution about the airfoil, total pressure distribution in the airfoil wake, static pressure in the wake, angle of attack, freestream velocity, flow temperature, and ambient pressure. These data were used to train the PCA scheme through an eigendecomposition of the measurement covariance matrix. A low-order reconstruction of this covariance matrix was then used to assess whether new measurements not included in the training set were anomalous by comparing predictions of the expected result with measured values. Results show that the method is very good at detecting anomalies in data from airfoils included in the training set as well as an additional airfoil outside of this set. Predictions of a particular measurement can be further improved by biasing the data used to construct the covariance matrix with observations that are more similar to the measurement of interest. However, this biasing reduces the ability of the method to predict results and therefore detect anomalies for experimental conditions outside of the range of the input data.},

Results are presented for rectangular wings of various aspect ratios, undergoing pitch and heave kinematics. Computational fluid dynamics is used to test the effectiveness of the method in the Euler and low-Reynolds-number regimes.

  abstract     = {Natural laminar-flow (NLF) wings and hybrid laminar-flow control (HLFC) wings are efficient drag reduction technologies. It is vital to develop robust laminar-flow wings to research the stochastic characteristics of both NLF and HLFC wings and reveal the generation mechanism for differences in their statistical responses. Wing-glove flight experiments and deterministic numerical simulations using the method with a suction-velocity model are performed, which are in good agreement. Uncertainty and correlation analyses based on nonintrusive polynomial chaos expansion are then performed to evaluate the influence of operational and geometric uncertainties. The simulations indicate that operational condition uncertainties have a greater impact on their statistical responses. Pressure coefficients near the leading edge and end region of the favorable pressure gradient are the most sensitive to disturbances in the angle of attack (AOA) and Mach number, respectively. Whereas HLFC wings significantly delay the laminar–turbulent transition, NLF wings may have better robustness against disturbances if the development of Tollmien–Schlichting (TS) waves is not completely suppressed in the suction region. This is because disturbances affect statistical responses of HLFC wings by changing both the local pressure gradients and suction coefficient distributions. Positive correlations between the AOA, local pressure gradients, and suction coefficients amplify the influence of AOA disturbances. Meanwhile, Mach-number disturbances have negative and positive correlations with local pressure gradients and suction coefficients, respectively. The opposite correlation weakens the influence of Mach-number disturbances.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we summarize our recently developed viscous unsteady theory, which couples potential flow with the triple-deck boundary-layer theory. This approach provides a viscous extension of potential-flow unsteady aerodynamics. As such, a Reynolds-number-dependent transfer function is determined for unsteady lift. We then use the Wiener–Hammerstein structure to develop a finite-dimensional approximation of such an infinite-dimensional theory, presenting it in a state-space model. This novel nonlinear state-space model of viscous unsteady aerodynamic loads is expected to serve aerodynamicists better than the classical Theodorsen’s model because it captures viscous effects (that is, Reynolds number dependence) as well as nonlinearity and additional lag in the lift dynamics; it also allows simulation of arbitrary time-varying airfoil motions (not necessarily harmonic). Moreover, being in a state-space form makes it quite convenient for simulation and coupling with structural dynamics to perform aeroelasticity, flight dynamics analysis, and control design. We then develop a linearization of such a model, which enables analytical results. Subsequently, we derive an analytical representation of the viscous lift frequency response function: an explicit function of both the frequency and Reynolds number. We also develop a state-space model of the linearized response. We finally simulate the nonlinear and linear models to a nonharmonic small-amplitude pitching maneuver at a Reynolds number of 100,000 and compare the resulting lift and pitching moment with those obtained from potential flow; this is in reference to relatively higher-fidelity computations of the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations.},

To investigate the effect of UB on friction drag, velocity profiles in the boundary layer on the pressure surface are measured using a hot-wire anemometer, and it is confirmed that the velocity profiles shift away from the airfoil surface by UB. The local friction drag reduction rate is quantitatively evaluated by using the law of the wall, and about 50\% local friction drag reduction is confirmed by UB at 0.33\% of the freestream velocity at the chord Reynolds number . Besides, the pressure distribution in the wake is measured with a pitot tube to investigate the effect of UB on the total drag. The measurement result indicates that the total drag is reduced by UB about 5\%, although the measurement uncertainty is estimated to be on the same order.},

After a straight translation at a constant speed, the F13 model in only wing configuration is decelerated at a constant rate to a complete stop to cease the lift production. After the beginning of the deceleration and the halt of the wing, two different disturbances are observed that travel through the cores of the wake vortices. These disturbances and their influence on tangential and axial flows in the wake vortices are investigated using conventional 2-D and stereo particle image velocimetry setups. First, wakelike axial flow is observed in the vortex core, then switching to jetlike axial flow, initiated by the first of the two disturbances (vortex bursting). After the first disturbance, the jetlike flow prevails and increases in magnitude until the second disturbance arrives (helical-like). The spatial–temporal behavior of the disturbances, including their propagation velocities, is presented and discussed.},

The airfoils were also tested with two micro-vortex generator configurations to show a fully attached recovery process across shorter distances than the Stratford limit.

Using the duct connecting the leading- and trailing-edge slots formed by the inner and outer airfoils, eight plasma actuators are arranged in the duct and synchronously driven by two high-voltage alternating-current sources to realize the plasma coflow jet (PCFJ) flow control technique. The test angle of attack range is 8–30°, and the Reynolds number is 68,000. The induced airflow characteristics were studied, and the flow control mechanism of the PCFJ airfoil was explored using the detailed two-component particle image velocimetry technique. The results in the quiescent air show that in addition to the injection at the leading-edge slot and the suction at the trailing-edge slot, the actuators on the upper surface of the inner airfoil provide local flow acceleration and momentum injection. The results in the wind tunnel show that the PCFJ airfoil has a better performance in delaying flow separation, and its time-averaged flow separation position is delayed by 46\% compared with the baseline airfoil. The mixing shear layer that becomes turbulent in advance and the subsequent coherent vortex structures, the injection at the leading edge and suction at the trailing edge, and local flow acceleration and momentum injection of the plasma actuators are the key factors for the mechanism of separation delaying of the PCFJ flow control technique.},

  abstract     = {An experimental investigation was conducted on the aerodynamics of an NACA0012 airfoil wing with triangular planform geometry undergoing steady and axial accelerations at as a model of an unmanned combat air vehicles encountering unsteady environments at pre- and poststall angles of attack (Marzanek, M., and Rival, D., “Separation Mechanics of Non-Slender Delta Wings During Streamwise Gusts,” Journal of Fluids and Structures, Vol. 90, Oct. 2019, pp. 286–296.). Ensemble-averaged flowfields, forces, moments, and surface-pressure distributions were measured in the Optical Towing Tank for Energetics Research facility at Queen’s University. To characterize the evolution of the flowfield coherent structures around a wing under axial gusts or accelerations, a Lagrangian flowfield analysis including the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) was conducted. Results indicate that axial acceleration can induce a dynamic flow reattachment at the poststall angle of attack, and clear FTLE ridges extend from the wing surface and travel down the chord as reattachment progresses. A distinct signature in the surface-pressure distribution tracks closely with the location where the FTLE ridges meet the wing. The timing of how this surface-pressure distribution moves aft is shown to correlate with the relatively large-scale fluctuation in the pitching moment. The current work reveals the correlation between FTLE and surface pressure, which further hints at a potential approach of dynamic estimation by using Lagrangian coherent structures.},

  abstract     = {The application of the inverse Abel transformation to statistically axisymmetric data is described in this work. The general theory of Abel inversion tomography is discussed, and it is shown that in order to properly apply the Abel inversion, an ensemble operator must be axisymmetric and commute with path integration. For statistically axisymmetric data where the individual realizations are asymmetric (such as turbulent flows issuing from circular nozzles), only the planar mean can be properly recovered. Higher-order moments, such as the standard deviation (root mean square) cannot be recovered because path integration is not commutative with the statistical moment operators. It is further shown that the Abel transformation cannot be used to recover the one-sided Fourier spectrum for the same reason. For the mean, the Abel inversion can be applied to the ensemble quantity, or the ensemble operator can be applied to the Abel inversion of individual asymmetric realizations. These findings are rigorously verified with numerical simulations and demonstrated on experimental data by comparing planar particle image velocimetry data to path-averaged schlieren image velocimetry results from a turbulent jet of issuing into ambient air.},

The model is based on the low-frequency mean velocity defect scaling [1] and the high-frequency shear friction velocity scaling [2]. This model satisfactorily predicts surface pressure spectra measured over a wide range of roughness configurations in high Reynolds number flows free of transitional effects. These data also provide insights into the characteristics of the turbulent scales which are on the order of the roughness size and comprise the mid-frequency region. The slope of this region is highly dependent on roughness element density and element-relative measurement location. This contradicts the premise of an overlap region with slope . An evanescent pressure decay model provides evidence that the slope changes are due to a roughness-dependent pressure decay within the interstitial flow and suggests that a traditional mid-frequency similarity law may not be possible.},

  abstract     = {Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) is used to investigate the low-frequency behavior of a pressure-induced turbulent separation bubble (TSB) generated on a one-sided diffuser at a nominal velocity of 20 m/s. The input to the decomposition is the unsteady wall shear stress determined experimentally with an array of novel calorimetric shear-stress sensors. The SPOD spectrum indicates low-rank behavior for frequencies below 10 Hz, which correspond to Strouhal numbers when built with the average TSB length and the nominal incoming velocity. A low-order model constructed with only the first SPOD mode at each frequency up to 10 Hz reveals that the TSB is contracting and expanding in a manner reminiscent of the low-frequency breathing motion recently documented in other TSBs. A comparison between SPOD and space-only proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) indicates that both decompositions are able to capture the low-frequency breathing motion as long as space-only POD is applied on signals previously low-pass filtered at 10 Hz. However, the superiority of SPOD is revealed by its inherent capacity to express the frequency range amenable to low-rank behavior. In addition to offering new insights into the low-frequency dynamics of TSBs, the present results also demonstrate the usefulness of calorimetric shear-stress sensors for the study of turbulent separating and reattaching flows.},

A fourth-order spatially accurate flow solver is employed to perform the simulation, using 10.2 billion grid points for a Reynolds number of 170,000 based on the bump height. The key findings from the simulation are reported in the acceleration and deceleration flow regions associated with the bump shape. Significant anisotropy in the normal Reynolds stresses, along both the wall-normal and streamwise directions, is observed within the acceleration region. The ratio between the Reynolds shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy in that region also experiences significant deviations from the norms of a zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer. The chosen Reynolds number generates strong flow separation in the adverse pressure gradient region, which is in contrast with a previous simulation at half the Reynolds number that only indicated incipient separation. An internal layer generated in the acceleration region evolves into a free shear layer that develops in the deceleration region and separates. Proper modeling of this inner layer appears crucial to predict the flow separation. Surface curvature effects on the attached flow development are also discussed.},

To understand the Mach disk and predict its height, two-dimensional supersonic underexpanded jets are analyzed and a theoretical model is proposed in this work. First, through analyses of the viscous term in the Navier–Stokes equation, the dominance of an inviscid mechanism is verified upstream of the Mach disk. The pressure downstream of the Mach disk is a primary parameter to the prediction of the Mach-disk height. Then, the region dominated by the inviscid mechanism is divided into the following three regions: homogeneous, simple, and nonsimple by contour lines of the Riemann invariants. Analytical description of the simple region is achieved through analyses of the characteristic curves. Fan-shaped approximation to the nonsimple region is deducted based on analyses of expansion fans. Finally, a theoretical prediction of the Mach-disk height is developed based on the pressure downstream of the Mach disk. For either the freejet or the lateral jet interaction, it is feasible to obtain prediction with errors below 10\%, which is much better than existing empirical models, especially for supersonic underexpanded jets.},

Although there was no significant difference with the presence of synthetic inflow turbulence in the mean and root-mean-square fluctuations of the flow primitive variables, differences in the unsteady shock statistics were observed. With synthetic inflow turbulence, the length of the region of intermittent wall pressure fluctuations and the maximum shock zero-crossing frequency were increased. The results were suggestive of a slight increase of the frequency corresponding to peak spectral power of the low-frequency shock position and wall pressure fluctuations. Analysis of cross-correlations and conditional averages showed that the unsteadiness of the downstream separation bubble size was a significant driver of the low-frequency separation shock motion. With synthetic inflow turbulence, the shape of the upstream boundary-layer velocity profile had a significant effect on the high-frequency shock motion. Nevertheless, the results showed some influence of the upstream and downstream flow instabilities on the low- and high-frequency shock unsteadiness, respectively.},

The results indicate that the structures of wing/body-shock interactions vary significantly with test conditions. Four types of shock interaction patterns were observed: interaction-free, type I regular, type II regular, and Mach interactions. Once the flowfield of the shock interactions had been established, aerodynamic heating loads of the wing and body were affected by the flowfield structures. Wing/body-shock interactions produced uneven heat flux distributions on the surface and caused an abnormally high heat flux at a localized position. Five profiles of the distribution of heat flux were extracted to describe its characteristics on the surface according to the position and magnitude of the peaks of the localized heat flux. Induction-related factors that led to the peaks were classified into three types: reflected shock/boundary-layer interaction, contact surface impinging, and contact surface grazing.},

The effect of the wings with positive and negative dihedral angles, namely, the wing dihedral and anhedral, on the longitudinal, lateral, and directional stability was also studied. Results show that both the dihedral and anhedral made nearly no difference to the wave-riding performance, and hence a high lift-to-drag ratio was maintained in hypersonic state. However, compared with the configuration without wing dihedral and the configuration with a ventral fin, the effects of wing dihedral and anhedral on stabilities were different: wing dihedral reduced the longitudinal stability and improved the lateral and directional stability; wing anhedral improved the longitudinal and directional stability but reduced the lateral stability. Lateral–directional dynamic stability was also predicted. This research proposes an idea to promote the engineering application of waveriders when considering the stability requirements.},

The influence of initial nozzle flow conditions on the duration of the start-up is investigated based on various simulated experiments, and it is verified that the shortest establishment time is obtained for the lowest initial pressure. The applicability of the numerical scheme is proved through a comparison of the inlet and outlet total and static conditions against experimental results at relevant conditions. Besides, the right running and left running shocks constituting the start-up shock system are tracked through the nozzle, and their propagation velocities are reported. Momentum and thermal boundary-layer establishment times are reported based on the temperature and velocity profiles predicted at the nozzle exit. Finally, the flow establishment time is compared against several criteria available in the literature. Additionally, new establishment and quasi-steady behavior criteria are presented, derived from the freestream static pressure and temperature evolution.},

  abstract     = {The ability to accurately predict melt-dominated ablation of meteoritic materials is important for risk assessment of near-Earth asteroids and survivability of reentering space debris. Despite previous computational studies that involve melt ablation for glassy materials, the application of incompressible gas boundary-layer theory to melt/vapor formation has largely been applied to limited surface heating rates and vapor-dominated regimes. A melt ablation formulation near stagnation regions, for crystalline and glassy materials, is implemented here and validated with ground experiments performed for iron under hypersonic flow conditions. The mathematical model does not neglect temperature gradients in the molten layer or assume domination of either melt or vapor formation. The implementation of this comprehensive melt/vapor ablation numerical model helps provide domain-independent engineering recession estimates. By using computational fluid dynamic-driven surface properties and radial basis function interpolation-driven dynamic meshes to predict stagnation-point melt ablation, it is shown that melt initiation is predicted within 10\% of pyrometer data and that simulated recession is dominated by melt flow contributions at the extreme operating limits of a hypersonic arc-jet test facility. The melt thickness shows a strong parabolic dependence on heat transfer coefficient variation. Shape change validation results of test articles accounting for this variation are discussed.},

  abstract     = {A reliable control of current orientation of a spacecraft is a critical task in aerospace engineering, as the loss of the spacecraft’s attitude can endanger the whole mission. This makes it important to elaborate on a reliable and robust attitude control system of a spacecraft, which can extend its lifetime. It must have a simple design, and low mass and power consumption. To develop it, we use various conditions of radiative heating at the surface of the spacecraft’s elements with different directions to the Sun and a planet that a satellite orbits to estimate their angular position. In the case of slow angular velocity of a spacecraft, temperature measurements can be used to estimate integral (over the spectrum) radiative flux using specially designed thermal sensors at different convex surfaces of a spacecraft. Then the estimated heat fluxes can be used to determine the attitude of a spacecraft. To provide this approach, it is essential to consider two inverse problems of heat transfer. Thus, the authors aim to solve these problems, which are challenging. This paper is dedicated to the solution of the second inverse problem. It was shown that one can obtain sufficiently accurate results on the basis of a constrained set of relatively simple temperature measurements.},

  abstract     = {This paper analyzes the buckling and postbuckling behavior of ultralight ladder-type coilable structures, called strips, composed of thin-shell longerons connected by thin rods. Based on recent research on the stability of cylindrical and spherical shells, the stability of strip structures loaded by normal pressure is studied by applying controlled perturbations through localized probing. A plot of these disturbances for increasing pressure is the stability landscape for the structure, which gives insight into the structure’s buckling, postbuckling, and sensitivity to disturbances. The probing technique is generalized to higher-order bifurcations along the postbuckling path, and low-energy escape paths into buckling that cannot be predicted by a classical eigenvalue formulation are identified. It is shown that the stability landscape for a pressure-loaded strip is similar to the landscape for classical shells, such as the axially loaded cylinder and the pressure-loaded sphere. Similarly to classical shells, the stability landscape for the strip shows that an early transition into buckling can be triggered by small disturbances; however, while classical shell structures buckle catastrophically, strip structures feature a large stable postbuckling range.},

Simulations of an axial-flight ducted propeller and a rotor/wing test case are first presented to validate the in-house Helicopter Multi-Block 3 solver and to assess the actuator disk/line models for the simplified main rotor modeling. The actuator disk/line models are then used to represent the main rotor for simulations of a generalized rotor/propeller combination. The propeller performance is analyzed in detail, and large variations are observed in the single blade loading due to the main rotor wake. A simplified model for the rotor/propeller interaction simulation is also put forward, and an inflow distortion metric is proposed to quantify the aerodynamic interactions. With the help of a kriging surrogate model and the inflow distortion metric, aerodynamic interferences through the propeller disk are quantitatively visualized with variations in the propeller position, propeller thrust, and main rotor advance ratio. Optimization of the propeller position under the main rotor for minimized interference with rolling/pitching moment constraints is also attempted using both gradient-based (adjoint) and gradient-free (efficient global optimization) approaches. The optimization results are verified using blade resolved simulations, and fluctuations of the propeller single blade loading were effectively reduced due to the optimization. The work is a first step toward high-fidelity methods for vehicle and configuration optimization.},

To improve the resilience of a rotorcraft to safely complete a mission, the rotorcraft’s maneuvers can be designed to minimize the stress experienced by critical mechanical components. This paper discusses a methodology to optimize rotorcraft flight parameters to minimize stress on critical mechanical components based on their current and predicted states while satisfying the operational constraints. A digital twin approach is pursued to support probabilistic diagnosis, prognosis, and optimization. Comprehensive rotorcraft analysis and finite element models are used to predict the stress in the rotorcraft component under different flight conditions. Diagnostic information is used to estimate the health state and prognosis model error after every flight. Surrogate models are constructed for diagnosis and prognosis to increase the efficiency of the uncertainty and optimization analyses. The flight parameters are optimized for a future mission using the updated prognosis model by minimizing the stress in the component under uncertainty. The proposed methodology is demonstrated with a synthetic experiment for a simple flight path.},

To reduce the anticipated computational cost, a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-based reduced-order modeling (ROM) combined with hyper-reduction is applied. To efficiently perform computations during the online stage, three hyper-reduction techniques were employed to approximate the nonlinear finite-element matrices: discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), Gauss–Newton with approximated tensors (GNAT), and energy-conserving sampling and weighting (ECSW). The present frameworks are applied to the time-transient simulation of a propeller, including parametric variations. Compared with the DEIM method, the GNAT and ECSW methods exhibited better enhancement of the accuracy and robustness of the reduced-order representation. Additionally, the computational efficiency of the ECSW method was improved significantly compared with that of other POD-based ROM approaches.},

However, when there are large dynamic modeling errors of a control system, the effectiveness of active vibration control may decrease, or even the control may diverge by using the existing harmonic control algorithms. Large modeling errors will result in inaccurate frequency response functions in the control system. In this paper, a new frequency response function updating-harmonic identification algorithm and its convergence condition have been proposed for effective active vibration control of a helicopter fuselage with large modeling errors through identifying the frequency response function of the control system in real time. In addition, to improve the accuracy of identifying frequency response function and further improve the effect of active vibration control, a dynamic harmonic control weight matrix algorithm is also proposed in this paper. The active vibration control simulations and experimental validation on a dynamically similar and geometrically scaled structure of a helicopter fuselage verify that the proposed algorithm in this paper can achieve faster speed of convergence and better effect of vibration control when there are large dynamic modeling errors over the existing harmonic control algorithms.},

However, this type of complicated blisk had never been studied previously. In this paper, a graded modeling method is presented to model the blisks with coating-geometric mistuning, blade-substrate multi-mistuning, and coating-material nonlinearity, where three reduction steps and a modified subspace iterative (MSI) method are developed to improve computational efficiency and accuracy. Several numerical analyses are performed to validate the developed models. The results indicate that for coated blisks with the aforementioned mistuning factors and material nonlinearity, the MSI-based reduced-order models (ROMs) have higher computational efficiency than the Craig–Bampton-based ROMs and full models, and they have higher computational accuracy than the frequency-based ROMs.},

The locally exact homogenization theory is first introduced to generate stiffness degeneration coefficients with matrix crack and fiber fracture failure, which is compared with previous literature and good agreements are obtained. And 1° finite element representative model is then established considering spiral filament winding, and progressive damage analysis is finally conducted based on Hashin and Maximum stress criteria complied with ANSYS Parametric Design Language. In addition, the thermodynamic analysis is demonstrated by considering the integrated design structure with a corrugated sandwich cylindrical shell under multiple physical fields.

  abstract     = {The geometrically nonlinear random vibration response of stiffened laminated plates under acoustic excitation is carried out by using the equivalent linearization (EL) technique combined with the reduced-order model and the finite element method. The nonlinear equations of motion of stiffened laminated plates are obtained based on large deflection finite element formulation. The proper orthogonal decomposition technique is used to select the modal basis, and a reduced-order model of the structures is established. Based on the force error minimization approach, the EL formulation for solving nonlinear random vibration response is derived. Then the EL technique is incorporated into finite element software NASTRAN by the direct matrix abstraction program, and the direct matrix abstraction program also realizes the iterative process of determining the modal equivalent linear stiffness matrix. Then, the statistical dynamic response results obtained by EL and linear method are compared and analyzed. It is verified that the proposed method has high accuracy and efficiency, and it can be applied to the geometric nonlinear random vibration response analysis of stiffened laminated plates. The results show that geometric nonlinearity plays an important role in the vibration response of stiffened laminated plates, especially under high sound pressure loads.},

  abstract     = {Flexible jointed-panel structures play a significant role in the entire service cycle of spacecraft, but they also bring serious vibration problems to the spacecraft orbit control. The bidirectional flexible jointed-panel structure installed on the large-scale spacecraft considered in this paper may produce large-amplitude vibration. To investigate the nonlinear vibration of such a flexible structure, a nonlinear dynamic model with a lower degree of freedom should be established analytically. Thus, the global mode functions of such a complex structure should be extracted first. Taking the eigenfunctions of beams as basis functions, the Rayleigh–Ritz method is developed to extract the analytic global mode functions for bidirectional flexible jointed-panel structures. As a typical example, the cruciform flexible jointed-panel structures made up of six isotropic rectangular panels are investigated, and the dynamic model for the transverse vibration of the structure is established. Numerical results are conducted to illustrate the validation of the proposed modeling process by comparing the natural frequency and global modes obtained by the developed approach with those obtained from the finite element method. Then, the influence of parameters on the inherent properties of the structure is discussed, and an effective method to increase the fundamental frequency of the structure is proposed.},

  abstract     = {A preliminary version of this paper was presented at the AIAA Aviation 2020 forum (Paper 2020-2525).This paper provides an insight into the grid generated turbulence for aeroacoustic studies. Several passive grids of square bars were tested in the open-jet aeroacoustic facility at the University of Bristol. The geometric properties of the grids and their position within the tunnel contraction nozzle were varied to quantify their influence on the average and statistical flow properties as well as the generated self-noise. Moreover, case studies involving turbulence interaction noise generation with a NACA0012 airfoil and cylinder were conducted. Turbulence intensity, integral length scale, and the anisotropy of the flow generated by each grid were characterized by hot-wire measurements, and the associated far-field noise was measured by a far-field microphone array. The grid turbulence results show that the downstream evolution of the turbulence intensity and integral length scale was comparable to results of closed test-section wind-tunnel studies for the first hydraulic diameter downstream of the contraction nozzle exit. However, beyond the first hydraulic diameter, the turbulence intensity plateaus and the integral length scales show rapid growth. Moreover, the results show that grids positioned closest to the contraction nozzle exit produced turbulence closest to isotropy with high levels of turbulence intensity, but the measured noise spectra suffered from the contamination from the grids self-noise. The grids located farthest from the contraction nozzle exit performed best in terms of noise contamination and could generate almost the same level of turbulence properties as the grids closest to the contraction nozzle exit.},

  abstract     = {Aeroacoustic signals, as typically returned by recordings of pressure fluctuations generated by rotating machines, often exhibit a strong contribution of broadband components. Separate analysis of the various sources of broadband noise is important from an engineering point of view, as they relate to different physical mechanisms. It is yet technically difficult to achieve, as the corresponding signals overlap in both time and frequency. A solution is proposed based on the angle–time cyclostationary property of broadband noise produced by rotating sources. Cyclostationary broadband components can thus be extracted, resynthesized in the time domain, and analyzed individually as if they were measured alone with all other interfering sources switched off. A special effort is made to render the methodology as stand-alone as possible by providing criteria for automatically setting up the leading parameters. The methodology is illustrated in counter-rotating open rotor data, where cyclostationary broadband contributions from the rear and front rotors and their interaction are individually extracted.},

  abstract     = {A numerical approach to predict broadband trailing-edge noise for low Mach number flows is presented. It is based on the combination of a Helmholtz solver to propagate sound waves with a sound source term computed stochastically. The sound propagation is performed in the frequency domain using a high-order finite element solver. The stochastic approach is based on a random particle-mesh method. The performance of this numerical approach is first examined for a Gaussian source. The numerical approach is then applied to a NACA0012 airfoil for flow Mach numbers of 0.11 and 0.16 and to a controlled-diffusion airfoil for a Mach number of 0.047. The predicted sound levels are compared with experimental data and acoustic results obtained from the acoustic perturbations equations. The mean flow does not significantly modify the acoustic propagation. Using a no-flow propagation model like the Helmholtz equation is therefore a valid approach for low Mach numbers. The reduced computational cost of a Helmholtz calculation, together with the speed of the random-particle mesh turbulence synthesis, allows for fast predictions. While this approach provides relative assessments between different configurations (in particular the spectrum shape), it often requires the inclusion of calibration factors determined from reference measurement or numerical data.},

However, there are concerns surrounding their acoustic emissions. In the work presented, the authors investigated the noise sources for a range of CROR configurations for a general aviation class aircraft. Numerical models are used to compute the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performance of these configurations. Further dissection of the various CROR noise sources is then carried out in order to better understand their contribution to CROR noise, and to direct the design of future low-noise CRORs. Noise reductions were observed when the rotor–rotor spacing was increased. Increased contraction of the wake requires the need for increased clipping to reduce the tip vortex interaction source. Noise reductions were also observed in the case of asynchronous rotational speeds. However, this was accompanied by a reduction in propulsive efficiency. Analysis of the CROR in nonaxial flight demonstrated the need to evaluate noise-reducing strategies at off-design conditions. Although the analysis proved the ability to reduce various CROR noise sources, it highlighted that tradeoffs with aerodynamic performance is necessary.},

  abstract     = {The paper presents the design, analyses, and testing of the Pazy wing, a very flexible wing model that was designed to study aeroelastic phenomena associated with geometrically nonlinear deflections and to provide data for validation of nonlinear aeroelastic simulation models. The Pazy wing is made of a main thin aluminum spar and a Nylon 12 printed ribs chassis providing the NACA0018 aerodynamic airfoil shape. The wing was covered entirely with a polyester film that serves as the skin. Static loading tests were used for model adaptation and to assure that the wing can deform to over 50\% of its span without failing. Ground vibration tests were also used for model adaptation. Because there are uncertainties in the characteristics of the polyester skin under loads, both the static and ground vibration tests were used to asses the contribution of the skin to the wing’s stiffness and determine the stiffness bound with and without the skin. Wind-tunnel tests were conducted at conditions that lead to static and unsteady structural responses. The wing deformations were tracked by a motion recovery system, and the strains over the wingspan were recorded with a Bragg-grating fiber-optics system. In the static wind-tunnel tests, the aerodynamic loads were recorded by a force balance. The wind-tunnel tests included angle-of-attack sweeps in constant airspeed and velocity sweeps in fixed angle of attack. The largest wing-tip static deformation recorded in test was of 50\% span. In the velocity-sweep tests, the wing showed strong oscillations at a velocity at which the wing-tip deformation was approximately 25\% of the span and became stable again at higher speeds. The wing models and test data are publicly available through the 3rd Aeroelastic Prediction Workshop (https://nescacademy.nasa.gov/workshops/AePW3/public).},

However, the deflection also occurs randomly when the secondary jet is stopped. To avoid it, the second throat is widened to 1.50 times the cross-sectional area of the first throat (nozzle B), and it is observed that the thrust deflection is nearly zero for all cases without secondary jet injection. However, the thrust deflection is only about 5° when the secondary jet is injected near the first throat of nozzle B.

  abstract     = {Small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming increasingly popular as low-cost observation and research platforms. However, these aircraft operate low in the atmosphere, exposed to the turbulent wakes of man-made and natural roughness features. As such, it is important to estimate their unsteady aerodynamic performance. The leading-edge suction parameter (LESP) is one criterion used in vortex methods for predicting flow separation, which can arise in both steady and unsteady flows. The critical LESP represents the maximum suction supported in the leading-edge region, equivalent to the flat-plate behavior of thin airfoil theory. This parameter was investigated at low pitch rates for a NACA0012 airfoil at Reynolds numbers applicable to small UAVs, to examine the hypothesis of a constant critical value existing for an arbitrary motion. It is seen that the critical LESP shows a strong dependence on pitch rate, with a piecewise linear fit being obtained. A higher pitch rate induces a greater pressure-field lag, promoting a higher peak LESP for flow separation, and a lower value for reattachment. These peaks in the LESP agree well with the instances of separation and reattachment. Raising the Reynolds number also acts to raise the critical LESP for a given reduced pitch rate.},

These effects are dominated by the tip vortex and an associated suction zone, which results in a supplementary “vortex lift” that is not captured by conventional vortex lattice methods (VLMs). Although many augmented VLMs have addressed such free-vortical flows on the leading edges of delta wings and even wingtips, they do not account for the portion of the vorticity that may be supported by the attached flow at the tip. The current work consists of an augmented VLM designed to capture the geometry and strength of the free tip vortex along the wingtip, and it is distinguished from prior models by the capability to allocate vorticity between the bound wingtip flow and the free tip-vortex flow at each chordwise position. This paper presents the model and its predictions of tip-vortex positions, as well as forces and moments on low-aspect-ratio wings. The model demonstrates lift distributions typical of vortex lift, promising agreement with forces and moments from experimental work as well as modulation of the forces and moments by selection of the maximum allowable bound vorticity along the tips.},

While it plays a fundamental role in the development and application of unsteady aerodynamic methods, explicit expressions for this function are difficult to obtain. This has led to numerous proposed approximations that facilitate convenient and rapid computations. While these approximations can be sufficient for many purposes, their behavior is often noticeably different from the true Wagner function, especially for long-time asymptotic behavior. In particular, while many approximations have small maximum absolute error across all times, the relative error of the asymptotic behavior can be substantial. Here, we propose an alternative approximation methodology that is accurate for all times, for a variety of accuracy measures. This methodology casts the Wagner function as the solution of a nonlinear scalar ordinary differential equation, which is identified using a variant of the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics algorithm. We show that this approach yields accurate approximations using either first- or second-order differential equations. We additionally demonstrate that this method can be applied to model the lift response for a more realistic aerodynamic system, featuring a finite thickness airfoil and nonplanar wake.},

Although the power factor can be improved by maintaining a turbulent boundary layer over the wing, this is challenging to achieve at Reynolds numbers below 50,000. We present a design strategy combining high airfoil camber and a cavity carved into the suction side of the airfoil to generate a turbulent, attached flow. The camber of a low-Reynolds-number AG14 airfoil is increased from 2 to 7\%; whereas the cavity position, length, and depth are derived based on spatial linear stability theory of the separated shear layer over the cavity. Lift and power factors of the modified airfoils are characterized computationally using XFOIL. The higher camber cavity airfoils show a 100\% gain in power factor over a smooth AG14 at Reynolds numbers of 30,000 and 10,000. Wind-tunnel testing of wings with the cavity airfoils showed power factor improvements of 30 and 80\% at Reynolds numbers of 30,000 and 10,000, and hot-wire measurements confirmed that the cavity triggers a turbulent boundary layer. Finally, it is suggested that flow control may be required to avoid laminar reattachment of the shear layer and to extend the use of the cavity design to even lower Reynolds numbers.},

Our framework offers a simple method to determine the memory depth of the system, clearly separates the linear and the nonlinear (NL) contributions, and significantly reduces the effort required to generate a model for a wide range of reduced frequencies. The generated models use step-response data in the linear and the NL ranges, thus separating the model generation from any specific input signal or a particular reduced frequency. The models were compared against and validated using the computational fluid dynamics results of an oscillating two-dimensional NACA 0012 airfoil.},

A transformation of the length-scale determining variable is suggested for improving the numerical robustness of the model. Results obtained with different unstructured flow solvers on different sets of grids show very good agreement, except for velocity and Reynolds-stress profiles in the vicinity of the predicted separation region. A recently developed length-scale correction and, particularly, prescribing transition on the fuselage and wing increase the predicted size of the separation region, where the variation is on the order of the experimental uncertainty. Detailed comparison of velocity and Reynolds-stress profiles with experimental data reveal a general deficiency of the model in predicting the peak of the streamwise normal stress and the distribution of all Reynolds stresses in the vicinity of the separation region. However, all predicted sizes of the separation region are in fair agreement with the experimental data.},

  abstract     = {Boundary-layer ingestion (BLI) has been proposed as one of the novel airframe–engine integration technologies to reduce aircraft fuel consumption. The current numerical analysis involves the evaluation of the effect of fuselage design on the power consumption of a boundary-layer ingesting propulsor modeled as an actuator volume without nacelle. An axisymmetric fuselage model is used as a canonical case to study BLI in transonic flight conditions. The flowfield is investigated through the power balance and the exergy analysis methods. Results show that the fuselage geometry and flight conditions only have a minor effect on the BLI power saving benefit when compared to the effect on the drag power of the fuselage. This indicates that, for the range of fuselage geometries and flight conditions studied, the isolated fuselage drag can be used for a qualitative performance assessment of different fuselage designs even for BLI configurations. Also, the power saving results obtained based on the power balance and the exergy analysis methods show similar qualitative trends for the fuselage geometries and flight conditions considered. Furthermore, the BLI propulsor has a negligible effect on the upstream anergy generation rate. Turbulence and temperature gradients within the flow are the important reasons for the deterioration of the BLI propulsor performance as expected.},

The jet is calculated by large-eddy simulation (LES), which enables the computation of two-point space–time correlations throughout the jet and its near-acoustic field. Time, length, and convective-velocity scales are examined on the surface of peak Reynolds stress (SPS), representing the location of the most energetic eddies, and on a “radiator surface” at the boundary between the rotational and irrotational fields. The nature of the space–time correlations is different for axial velocity fluctuations and pressure fluctuations. Velocity-based correlations appear to capture localized turbulent events, whereas pressure-based correlations appear dominated by the interaction of large eddies with the surrounding potential flow. The correlation length scales are larger on the radiator surface than on the SPS, thus indicating that small-scale eddies do not make a significant imprint on the radiator surface. The scales associated with an emulated RANS solution of the flow are compared to the LES-based scales. Simple relationships are inferred that may aid the development of rapid predictive models.},

Flow over a cube placed in a fully developed turbulent channel flow has long been the preferred problem of investigation for researchers. However, a more relevant practical scenario is flow over a cube placed in a spatially evolving turbulent boundary layer (SETBL). In this work, wall-resolved large-eddy simulations of flow over a wall-mounted cube placed in an SETBL on a flat plate are performed at a Reynolds number of 19,600 based on the mean velocity and the inlet boundary-layer thickness. The incompressible Navier–Stokes equations are solved using a second-order finite-volume approach with a dynamic -equation eddy-viscosity model. At this Reynolds number, the key nondimensional parameter governing this problem is the ratio of cube height to boundary-layer thickness, . This paper investigates the dependence of the turbulence wake characteristics on . Specifically, this paper analyzes the vortical structures and the separation and reattachment lengths. It is further examined how the turbulent kinetic energy budget varies with . It is found that the size of the horseshoe vortex roughly scales with the size of the cube, and that the decay of turbulent kinetic energy per unit area over streamwise distance in the near wake exhibits a power-law behavior.},

A split velocity method was implemented in a three-dimensional Navier–Stokes solver to simulate a rigid flat plate wing at steady velocity and 0° angle of incidence encountering a sudden sharp-edged gust. The gust perturbations in the flow domain were prescribed to the grid points, and source terms were added to the governing equations to account for the full interaction between the wing and the gust. Two sharp-edged gust profiles are considered: 1)  a top-hat profile gust of finite width and 2) a step profile gust of infinite width. The gust amplitude varies from 4 to 120\% of the freestream velocity . The split velocity method was found to be capable of capturing the physical phenomenon of flat plate undergoing sharp-edged gust, and the predicted lift coefficient is found to be in good agreement with that of experiments. The duration and magnitude of the wing–gust interaction were both found to affect the airfoil response. In the step gust encounter, the lift behaves similarly to that predicted by the Küssner’s model for small-amplitude gusts where . The lift buildup is nonlinear for larger gust amplitudes where . Convolution with the computed step gust response shows good agreement with the simulated response during long and large gust encounters.

Analyses of the flow conditions produced in shock tubes typically assume a single, constant shock speed even though the shock speed varies due to driver effects, boundary-layer growth, and diaphragm rupture effects. This paper will investigate the dependence of flow properties upon the entire shock speed history for a 100-mm-diam, 8-m-long shock tube using the FROSST axisymmetric shock tube Navier–Stokes code. A perfect gas is applied to remove the complexity of thermochemistry and allow a focus upon the flow details. Shock speed profiles ranging from accelerating to decelerating are simulated to qualitatively represent different experimental conditions, and the resulting test slugs compared. All shocks reach the test section at the same final shock Mach number of 6.53. Pressure variations caused by the accelerating shock are found to combine with entropy gradients introduced by the changing shock strength, yielding differences in maximum temperature of the test slug by as much as 56\%, and differences in maximum pressure as high as 22\% despite the shared tube-end Mach number. Local temperature and pressure around gas packets in the test slug are found to relax significantly through time in response to changing postshock conditions. Test slug variations due to boundary-layer effects are found to be present, but overwhelmed by the relaxation processes under many conditions.},

  abstract     = {The analysis of complex systems typically requires a large and diverse ensemble of models to confront the richness and complexity of the problem. Nevertheless, a common development and validation process of each individual model can be rigorous and time consuming. Because of limited time and resources, it is sometimes unrealistic to model every individual object in the population to capture the complex phenomena of the system. One such challenge arises in aerospace engineering when only a very limited number of aircraft performance models can be built to cover the aircraft fleet of the world for the environmental impact modeling of air transportation system. This paper considers the problem of selecting a small proportion of representative models to sufficiently cover and represent the population for more efficient and accurate systems analysis. At the intersection of unsupervised data mining and high-dimensional data analysis, the proposed methodology uses minimax and multi-criteria considerations to select a representative model portfolio at each budget level. Applying on the case study of representative aircraft models for environmental impact modeling, the benefits of the proposed method are demonstrated through both data visualization and quantitative metrics in multiple experiments. Potential limitations, extensions, and broader impacts of the method are also thoroughly discussed.},

  abstract     = {In the last decade, the demand for stochastic engineering results has increased substantially. Concurrently, improvements in computing hardware, access to large computing clusters, and efficient statistical methods have made uncertainty quantification studies feasible for complex, computationally expensive simulations such as computational fluid dynamics or finite element methods. In current practice, uncertainty may be quantified at particular locations within a flight envelope or design space, but an ongoing challenge remains to interpolate or extrapolate this information to predict the uncertainty at untested or unsimulated locations. The goal of this paper is to introduce a spatially accurate polynomial chaos method, which can interpolate both aleatory and epistemic uncertainty throughout a flight envelope or design space. An additive correction is also presented, which improves accuracy at a small additional sample cost. Interpolation of polynomial chaos expansion coefficients is achieved using established regression techniques, allowing for a spatially accurate uncertainty propagation method which is agnostic to the characterization of parametric input uncertainties. As a demonstration of the method, results are shown for an analytic test function and for simulations of the NASA Common Research Model. The results indicate that Spatially Accurate Polynomial Chaos and its additive correction can provide accurate interpolated estimates of uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {We conduct large-eddy simulations to investigate the role of thermal nonuniformity on the development of instability modes in the shear layer of supersonic jets. We develop an arbitrary high-order discontinuous Galerkin scheme, build meshes with over 100 million degrees of freedom, and validate the model against particle image velocimetry (PIV) and microphone data. The analysis focuses on both numerical issues (such as convergence against the polynomial order of the mesh), modeling issues (such as the choice of subgrid model), and underlying physics (such as vortex stretching and noise generation). We consider the use of wall models to capture the viscous sublayer at the nozzle. We conclude that the Vreman subgrid-scale model leads to the most accurate predictions of both the near-field velocity and the far-field noise, while the Smagorinsky model is best in the nozzle and near the lip area. Injection in the shear layer is more effective at reducing sound generation in the near field than injection in the core. The difference in effectiveness is less substantial in the far field. Injection in the shear layer creates an unstable three-dimensional structure that leads to loss of coherency and three-dimensional effects in the core. Three-dimensionality in the core supports vortex stretching leading to fast mixing.},

  abstract     = {High-order schemes with larger time-step limits can benefit from using adaptive mesh refinement grids. One-parameter optimal flux reconstruction schemes are obtained by minimizing the error associated with wave propagation over the range of resolvable wavenumbers using a novel objective function that accounts for the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy limit and order of accuracy constraint. The novel schemes are parameterized by the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy limit, which, if chosen properly, leads to the obtained optimal Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy-like well-known schemes. The schemes are obtained by the differential evolution optimization algorithm, which is combined with the flux reconstruction–discontinuous Galerkin scheme to enlarge the time step limit on adaptive mesh refinement grids. Two numerical experiments were performed to investigate the properties of the schemes, including advection of a Gaussian bump and isentropic Euler vortex. The results show that the new schemes are more suitable for adaptive mesh refinement in terms of accuracy, dissipation, and stability.},

This paper clarifies some of these confusions: for example, the U-MUSCL scheme can be third-order accurate in the point-valued solution with on regular grids for linear equations in all dimensions, and it can be third-order accurate with as the QUICK scheme in one dimension. It is shown that the U-MUSCL scheme cannot be third-order accurate for nonlinear equations, except a very special case of on regular simplex-element grids, but it can be an accurate low-dissipation second-order scheme. It is also shown that U-MUSCL extrapolates a quadratic function exactly with on arbitrary grids, provided the gradient is computed by a quadratic least-squares method. Two techniques are discussed, which transform the U-MUSCL scheme into being genuinely third-order accurate on a regular grid: an efficient flux-reconstruction method and a special source-term quadrature formula for .},

  abstract     = {Traditional proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-Galerkin projection for reduced-order models (ROMs) of fluid flows is based on a fixed domain. The current method removes this limitation by considering a single combined domain of fluid and solid, whereas the original solid boundary conditions are reinforced by additional ROM terms. The combined domain requires a new inner product defined in the same combined domain to compute POD modes and the projection of equations. Solid motion is considered first as a continuous motion, then a decomposed motion, represented by a few solid modes to further reduce the computational cost. This new global approach was applied first on a two-dimensional direct numerical simulation (DNS) database of the flow past an oscillatory cylinder, and then on a three-dimensional DNS database of the flow past an oscillatory sphere. Last, the approach was applied on a high-resolution particle image velocimetry database from an experiment at higher Reynolds number of the flow past a pitching-up NACA0012 airfoil. The ROMs derived by the global POD-Galerkin projection approach, for all three moving-boundary cases, have shown adequate accuracy in the reconstruction of flow fields and the prediction of key aerodynamic features while keeping very low computational costs.},

Due to their important application for highly maneuverable aircraft, the physical and aerodynamic understanding related to the vortex flow is of primary relevance. The investigation process is routinely performed with numerical simulations employing Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. As the vortex grows in intensity, the limitation of ordinary models reduces the accuracy grade. Scale-resolving or more complex turbulence models can increase the accuracy, but the computational cost prohibits the application to a large envelope of cases. In the context of this work, the enhancement of a one-equation eddy-viscosity model is employed. The model is improved by formulating additional vortex source terms exclusively active inside the vortex-flow region and by employing a calibration procedure that is integrated into an iterative automated process where experimental data are used as targets for optimizing the model. The accuracy is enhanced for a cluster of cases around the calibration target, and it shows the potential of the application to large datasets that include several geometric and flow condition variations.},

Through an analysis of self-similar solutions for compressible boundary layers, a new correlation for the maximum ratio between the vorticity Reynolds number and the momentum thickness Reynolds number is established. New empirical high-speed transition correlations are then developed that take account of streamwise instability, nose bluntness effects, and crossflow-induced transition. On this basis, an intermittency factor transport equation is constructed using strictly local variables and is coupled with the shear-stress transport turbulence model. The new model is validated through several basic test cases under a wide range of flow conditions, including high-speed flat plates, sharp/blunt cones, HIFiRE-5, and a circular cone at a small angle of attack. The results show that the proposed model is capable of predicting the transition behaviors induced by streamwise and crossflow instabilities, as well as the aeroheating environment on high-speed geometries with reasonable precision. Future work will focus on extending the model to pressure-gradient and wall-temperature effects and to roughness-induced transition, as well as to applications to complex high-speed vehicles.},

By calculating the eddy-viscosity turbulent diffusion term, an exact high-Reynolds-number equation with one production and two dissipation terms is constructed for those flows. One dissipation term is universal, peaks near the wall, and scales mainly with . The second, smaller one, is flow dependent, peaks in the wake, and scales mainly with . The production term is flow dependent, peaks in between, and scales similarly. The universal dissipation term implies a length scale analogous to the von Karman length scale used in the scale-adaptive simulation models of Menter. This length scale also appears in the production term. This confirms the relevance of these length scales. An asymptotic analysis of all terms in the budget in the limit of infinite Reynolds numbers is provided. This yields a test bench of existing Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes models with a similar equation. It is shown that some models, e.g., the one of Spalart and Allmaras, do not respect the flow physics: they display a production peak in the near-wall region. The most promising model, a scale-adaptive simulation model, is modified. As a step forward toward a solution to the wall damping problem, the equation of our model behaves much more correctly in the near-wall region.},

Single-point statistics from several high-fidelity turbulent flow simulation datasets are differentiated into groups using a Gaussian mixture model clustering algorithm. Candidate features are proposed, and a feature selection algorithm is applied to the data in a sequential fashion, flow by flow, to identify a good feature set and an optimal number of clusters for each dataset. Clusters are first identified for plane channel flows, producing results that agree with existing theory and empirical observations. Further clusters are then identified in an incremental fashion for flow over a wavy-walled channel, flow over a bump in a channel, and flow past a square cylinder. Some clusters are closely identified with the anisotropy state of the turbulence, whereas others can be connected to physical phenomena, such as boundary-layer separation and free shear layers. Exemplar points from the clusters, or prototypes, are then identified using a prototype placement method. These exemplars effectively summarize the dataset using a greatly reduced collection of data points. The clusters and their prototypes are used to assess the quality of a training dataset constructed by simply pooling the four flows. We enumerate the dataset’s shortcomings and state the limits of generalizability of any data-driven closure trained on it.},

Stereo-photogrammetry was then used to measure the dynamic crater evolution process at nozzle heights of 25, 40, 55, and 70 nozzle diameters above the sand simulant bed. From the stereo-photogrammetry data, time-resolved three-dimensional reconstructions of the crater geometry were generated, and crater depth, radius, and volume time histories were extracted. Crater depth was observed to grow logarithmically for the two highest nozzle heights, and the depth growth rate for the lower two nozzle heights was more rapid. Crater volume growth was well characterized by a power law fit. The post-nozzle-flow slope of the collapsed crater was found to increase with nozzle height, along with the final crater volume. The results show that stereo-photogrammetry can be used to successfully measure the crater geometry in cases where optical access to the crater is not completely degraded by ejected particles.},

Electron number density along the stagnation streamline was obtained from Stark broadening. The data presented here provide independent measurements for evaluating the reaction schemes for the conditions created. It was found that the experimental data were qualitatively modeled by a contemporary kinetic model. Quantitative agreement between experimental and numerical data was found by adjusting the ionization rate coefficients from an existing reaction scheme by a factor of 25. This updated reaction rate set was also cross-validated with electron number density measurements in NASA’s shock tube tests. The adjusted rates had better agreement than using the original rates, and quantitative agreement can be found in the high-density cases.},

Six group additive schemes were used to estimate the heat of formation of HTPB and analyze the effects of hydroxyl functionalization and curing reactions. Good agreement is observed between the methods for HTPB isomer units, but cumulative differences result in significant disparities for larger, practical polymers. Increased hydroxyl functionality and the curing reaction are predicted to yield nonnegligible decreases in the heat of formation. The heat of formation of propellant-grade, isophorone-diisocayante-cured HTPB R-45M was computed as or . Chemical equilibrium analyses were completed for solid propellants composed of ammonium perchlorate and HTPB, and for hybrid rocket engines based on HTPB burning with liquid oxygen or nitrous oxide, where the heat of formation of HTPB was varied within a reasonable range.

High-frequency transient pyroshock induced by pyrotechnic release devices may cause severe damage to electronic devices and involved systems. To mitigate the pyroshock, phononic crystals, as new artificial constructions with novel properties, are introduced for the first time. In the present study, the pyroshock propagation analysis in periodic composite rods consisting of two different materials is conducted both theoretically and experimentally by considering various geometry parameters. The band gaps, attenuation level, and dynamic responses of periodic rods are investigated by the differential quadrature method, and the simulation results are validated by finite element analysis. Using the established theoretical model and laser-generated shock experimental setups, the effect of geometry on wave propagation behaviors, dynamic responses, shock response spectrums, and pyroshock attenuation in periodic rods are investigated. The experimental and numerical results are in good agreement, demonstrating that effective shock attenuation may be achieved through periodic rods. The corresponding attenuation bands, attenuation trends, and turning points of shock response spectrums can be controlled by designing the geometry of periodic rods. The pyroshock attenuation effects in periodic rods can be predicted quantitatively by wave propagation analysis.},

Results from the two injector geometries are analyzed and compared. One was a flat-faced injector with the element ending at a sudden expansion into the chamber. The other used a truncated cone at the injector exit: a design feature of specific interest that appears in drawings for the RD-170 main-chamber injector. To improve spatial resolution of high-frequency pressure measurements, the model injector was scaled up from RD-170 dimensions to facilitate measurements in the injector and head end of the combustor. Measured pressure spectra of the flat-face combustor showed a well-organized first axial mode and harmonics. The truncated-cone geometry showed a more diffuse spectra with higher-frequency modes, with a reduction in amplitude further upstream in the cone. Intermittency in measured dynamics is characterized via multiscale analysis. Adopting concepts from fractal theory, the stability margin of the injector configurations was quantified using the Hurst exponent of pressure oscillations. Comparatively, a larger range of fractal dimensions with smaller fluctuations in the initial reacting zone were observed for the flat-face injector.},

  abstract     = {Patching is a high-technology repair to preserve damaged jet engine blisks instead of replacing them. The damaged portion of the blade is restored by welding a patch to the blade. Since the extent of defects varies, the optimal repair is initially unknown. This work contributes to the design of patch repairs by employing multiobjective optimization. A multiobjective function is formulated, maximizing high cycle fatigue strength and minimizing the length of the weld. An inequality constraint equation ensures the complete removal of the damaged blade area. The geometry of the patch and the position of the defect are described using parametric models. Optimization results are presented for an exemplary damage scenario. The set of Pareto optimal alternatives is computed using nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II and imposing constraints by using a linear penalty approach. The results demonstrate that designs are found by the optimization that would not intuitively be recognized as optimal by maintenance technicians. Individual designs from the Pareto frontier are selected, and the welding process is analyzed in more detail using thermomechanical simulations. The distribution of residual stresses in the repaired blade is computed, and the influence on fatigue strength is determined. The multiobjective optimization and the finite element simulations implemented in the presented approach thus enable a systematic evaluation of design alternatives and support informed engineering decisions in the repair process.},

  abstract     = {Due to the high Reynolds numbers together with the complex turbulent motions in turbomachinery, selecting a proper turbulence-modeling method is of vital significance in interpreting the real flow physics. In this paper, shear stress transport (SST) as a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes model and scale-adaptive simulation (SAS) and zonal large eddy simulation (ZLES) as two scale-resolving simulation approaches were chosen to simulate the flow in a low-speed axial compressor rotor at three different blade tip clearances (1.3, 2.6, and 4.3\% of chord length). Results of unsteady simulations at the design point were compared to the experimental data. The results prove that the ZLES model performs best in characterizing the experimental data regardless of the blade tip clearance size. The performance of the SST model in capturing the tip flow is close to the measurement data when the blade tip clearance is small, while the deviation from the experimental results increases with the clearance size enlarged. In contrast, the use of the SAS model does not result in any benefits over the SST model for the small tip clearance but demonstrates similar performance with the ZLES model for the configurations with middle and large tip clearance sizes.},

It has been found that the NS DBD plasma actuation can effectively suppress the flow separation and two mechanisms behind the flow control effect have been uncovered. First, the NS DBD plasma actuation can induce distorted flow structure (DFS) within the flowfield, and the induced DFS of plasma actuations located upstream of the flow separation zone can bring the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability of the shear layer between mainstream flow and separated flow froward to the separation point. Then, a large-scale spanwise vortex, which promotes the mixing of the main flow and the separated flow, is induced within the flow separation zone, thus resulting in suppression of the flow separation. Second, the plasma actuation located at the blade leading edge can improve the momentum of the laminar boundary layer, owing to the propagations of compressive waves as well as DFS along the blade surface. The plasma actuation located within the separation zone fails to suppress the boundary-layer flow separation effectively because the induced DFS cannot influence the shear layer between mainstream flow and separated flow.},

  abstract     = {The objective of this paper is to assess the capability of the isothermal lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to correctly capture aerodynamic and acoustic features from a low-speed turbofan. The evaluation is done on the Advanced Noise Control Fan model developed by NASA Glenn Research Center. An extensive comparison of the measured and computed aerodynamic results is presented for the first time on this configuration. The trends are well captured, but quantitative discrepancies are observed for some variables, leading to lower fan performance values in the simulations. This last point was also observed in the previous related studies, but remained unexplained. By validating in parallel the LBM aerodynamic results with a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation provided by the database, a likely uncertainty of the absolute values of some variables in the experimental mean flow data is shown (a result of the intent that experimental data were not acquired with absolute levels as an objective). Direct in-duct and far-field acoustic results are also investigated, taking advantage of the low-dissipative characteristics of the LBM. A good agreement with the measurements in terms of broadband noise is obtained, but the low frequencies tend to be overestimated. For the tonal noise, if the expected acoustic modes are recovered, quantitative differences are observed. Predictions based on a hybrid method, where the acoustic sources computed by the LBM are propagated analytically using Goldstein’s analogy (Aeroacoustics, McGraw–Hill, New York, 1976), are also made and compare well with the direct predictions, thus proving the correct propagation of acoustic waves by the solver.},

These methods have a significant error on remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of aircraft flap control system, which is a typical hybrid system and also vital for flight safety. In response to this problem, this paper proposes a method based on bond graph, which integrates the mode transition information into global analytical redundancy relations. Here, the mode-dependent fault signature matrix is constructed and different degradation models are identified. Finally, simulation experiments are done, and the RUL prediction value of the proposed method is closer to the preset value than that of the method without considering degradation of the idle mode.},

Planar particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurement is conducted in the water channel to capture the time-resolved velocity field above the aerofoil, and the velocity field data are then used for DA. The attack angle is fixed at , and the Reynolds number, based on the inflow velocity and chord length , is . Conventional pressure determination methods that use either integration or a solution of the Poisson equation are applied to compute the instantaneous pressure field from the PIV data. Dynamic detached-eddy simulation (DDES) and Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) simulations using the shear strain transport model are also performed for comparison. The conventional pressure determination methods yield large errors due to the error accumulation and boundary effects, whereas the RANS simulation seriously mispredicts the flow separation, and the DDES also fails due to low mesh resolution. By solving the primary-adjoint equation system and updating the correction for the governing equations at time steps for which observations exist, DA accurately reproduces the instantaneous flowfield in the observational region, which substantially improves the prediction of pressure distribution on the aerofoil surface and the flow in the wake region. Using the observational data in half of the region, DA also improves the flow and pressure prediction in the other half region. The present DA method is therefore able to reproduce the global fields from limited measurement data.},

  abstract     = {The inclusion of transition to turbulence effects in computational fluid dynamics simulations makes it possible to design laminar flow airframes. It also increases the level of physical representations for simulations of standard airframes because laminar flow regions may be present in parts of the aircraft in multiple flight conditions. Modified Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) models that consider transition effects became popular in the last decade and indicated favorable agreement with experimental data. However, these models present more difficult convergence behavior when compared with fully turbulent RANS approaches. To address this issue, an approximate Newton–Krylov solver is leveraged to solve the transitional flow over aeronautical configurations using a flow-stability-based, smooth RANS transition model. The amplification factor transport (AFT) model is modified to create a smooth variant, referred to as AFT-S. Strategies have been developed to obtain representative physical solutions that exhibit good agreement with experimental data. The convergence behavior for the transition RANS model is also addressed, and its impact on the numerical results is assessed. These results constitute the first in-depth investigation on the numerical behavior of an AFT-type transition model.},

  abstract     = {The spatial–temporal evolution of coherent structures generated by an asymmetrical dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuator is an intriguing unsteady process with profound implications for revealing the controlling mechanism of the plasma actuator and promoting the control effect of the DBD plasma actuator at high wind speed and high Reynolds number. In this study, the induced coherent structures of the plasma actuator are studied systematically with a particle image velocimetry for a range of force coefficients . Results indicate that the vortices that shed periodically from the downstream edge of the exposed electrode are a result of the amplification of natural disturbances in the jet shear layer. During later evolution, the adjacent vortices pair up to form a new vortex, leading to a reduction of the dominant frequency in the velocity spectra. Further downstream, the coherent vortical structures decay considerably, correlating with the shear-layer transition process in the plasma wall jet. The vortex shedding frequency is observed to scale with the force coefficient according to , which is of importance to the selection of the dominant frequency by adjusting the actuation parameters of the plasma actuator based on the characteristic frequency of the controlled flowfield and improving the control effect of the plasma actuator. With increasing force coefficient, the propagation speed of the roll-up vortices increases linearly, whereas the streamwise vortex spacing decreases monotonically. It is of great significance that the nondimensional Strouhal number based on the vortex shedding frequency, vortex propagation speed, and streamwise vortex spacing is proposed and varies slightly between 0.045 and 0.065, for all the tested cases, which lays a foundation for promoting the numerical simulation model of the plasma actuator and revealing the controlling mechanism of the flow control using the plasma actuator.},

Steady flows obtained using the selective frequency damping (SFD) technique are used as base states for a global linear stability analysis. The influence of both the angle of attack and the Reynolds number on the most amplified mode characteristics is first investigated in the incompressible regime. Then, the compressibility effects in the subcritical regime are considered. A stabilizing or a destabilizing effect of compressibility is observed depending on the angle of attack and the Reynolds number. For , compressibility has a destabilizing effect close to the critical threshold, which results in an earlier Hopf bifurcation, whereas increasing the Mach number always results in a decrease of the growth rate of the mode well above the critical threshold. Finally, the mode frequency decreases with the Mach number.},

  abstract     = {An extended version of the synthetic eddy method for generation of synthetic turbulence has been developed via a source term formulation and implemented in the open-source cross-platform solver PyFR. The method caters for the full space-dependent anisotropy of the target turbulent length scales, and it is agnostic of the space and time discretization of the underlying solver, which can be incompressible or compressible. Moreover, the method does not require each solution point to communicate with nearest neighbors; thus, it is well suited for modern, massively parallel, high-order unstructured codes which support mixed and possibly curved elements. The method has been applied to two test cases: incompressible plane channel flow at and compressible flow over an SD7003 aerofoil at , and . The channel flow case was run on three topologically different meshes composed of hexahedra, prisms, and a combination of prisms and tetrahedra, respectively. Almost identical results have been obtained on the three meshes. Results also show that taking into account the anisotropy of the turbulent length scales can reduce the development length. For the SD7003 aerofoil case, the injection of synthetic turbulence improves agreement between numerical and experimental results.},

Or else, prestressed cable structures are defined by the joint locations and delicate to external stimuli due to their high flexibility and light weight, and the shape distortion is supposed unacceptable. Consequently, based on the force method, the displacement control through updating coordinates of the structure and optimization on the form of quadratic programming is suggested to attain the nonlinear displacement control (NDC) of the geometrically nonlinear systems (including prestressed cable structures). The technique preserves the prestress level in the structural bar elements to any level required. The proposed method has been compared with other prior NDC techniques corresponding to the requirements. It shows that the computational results of the current approach are in good response with the previous NDC techniques. The method can exactly achieve the target values without any significant errors for the corresponding outcomes. Simultaneously, the technique keeps the prestress level of the structural members to the targeted level. The proposed approach technique also proved to control both small and large displacement without any remarkable error.},

The aircraft structural design process is an iterative one involving computationally expensive simulations. Existing methods simplify the dynamic loads to equivalent static ones and design the structure using shell-based analysis. Other literature approaches use beam models for structural sizing but make assumptions on the geometry, material distribution, or both. In this work, the use of the Variational Asymptotic Method is explored to 1) systematically reduce the three-dimensional (3-D) wingbox to a one-dimensional (1-D) model, 2) solve the 1-D model using a nonlinear beam theory, and 3) recover the stress field on the wingbox. An adjoint-driven gradient-based structural optimization framework is developed to size the structure for dynamic loads subjected to strength-based failure considerations. The proposed structural analysis method is applied to the wingbox structural analysis and sizing of a novel hybrid-electric propulsion aircraft: NASA’s Parallel Electric-Gas Architecture with Synergistic Utilization Scheme (PEGASUS) concept. Results in the paper show that the sizing of aircraft wings for 14 CFR specified maneuvers 2.5 and static maneuvers using the proposed approach produces a 6\% difference in weight compared to a shell-based method but with a speedup of 7.8 times, and it is efficient at sizing the wingbox structure for dynamic loads generated by gust maneuvers.},

In addition, a new damage evolution-based fatigue reliability evaluation method is proposed, and the structural fatigue behavior can be described and predicted. The different failure modes of composite material and their correlations are considered during the damage evolution analysis. The structural possible accidental damage can also be taken into account by applying the global preset damage in design stage. Thus, the static requirement, fatigue requirement, and damage tolerance requirement can all be considered simultaneously during the design process. The structural comprehensive design of composite laminate is conducted by virtue of the two-level optimization method. A case of a notched composite laminate is employed to verify the proposed method. In addition, a case of a civil aircraft wing structure is used to explain the feasibility of the developed method in dealing with structural design problems in engineering.},

The structural deformation behavior under the external loading conditions is derived with a higher-order polynomial without hampering the strain and stress (in-plane and out-of-plane) continuity. The mathematical formulation of the curved structure is derived, and the governing equation order is reduced using nonlinear finite element steps. A generic computer code is prepared using the derived mathematical formulation in conjunction with the isoparametric finite element technique in a MATLAB environment. The final output (that is, the nonlinear deflection and stress data) is predicted using a robust nonlinear solution method (Picard’s iteration). The suitability of full-scale geometrical nonlinearity (Green–Lagrange strain) in the framework of a higher-order displacement field model for the laminated structure is established by comparing the experimental deflection data and published analytical solutions. Furthermore, a series of numerical examples is solved to show the influences of different individual and/or the combined parametric influences on the structural deflections and the normal/shear stress (in-plane and out-of-plane) values, including the variable geometrical shapes.},

The path-average line-of-sight measurements of the temperature and enthalpy were inferred using an electronic atomic oxygen transition near 777 nm. A scanned-DAS sensor was optimized to capture high-add-air and high-pressure conditions that previously had not been measurable, including an increased tuning range that allowed for full absorbance profile resolution at maximum pressure test conditions. Enhanced sensor capabilities confirmed uniform flow and flat temperature profiles immediately upstream of the arcjet’s converging–diverging nozzle inlet. Less uniform and parabolic temperature profiles were observed immediately downstream of add-air injection. Time-resolved enthalpy measurements ranged from 16 to 27 MJ/kg and are in agreement with the IHF’s current measurement methods. Centerline measurements along the MV confirmed a reduction in achievable enthalpy after installation of the MV. The centerline measurements quantified the mixing process for various add-air conditions, indicating an opportunity for enthalpy recapture. Axial locations of sufficient mixing were identified and provide a potential for reduction of the MV length and improved facility performance.},

  abstract     = {Transversal and longitudinal combustion instabilities typically present in gas turbines and rocket engines. It is thus important to investigate the flame responses of the two directional disturbances. When the disturbance level remains weak, the flame response can be considered linear. The flame transfer function (FTF) is typically used, and the global FTF can be easily obtained by superposition of the FTFs at the two-directional forcing. However, when the disturbances arise, the flame response becomes nonlinear due to the nonlinear responses at the two directions and their couplings. The present work thus presents nonlinear analytical models (flame describing function [FDF]) of a two-dimensional laminar premixed slit flame subjected to simultaneously longitudinal and transverse bulk mean flows and disturbances. These nonlinear models are derived based on the asymptotic expansion of the -equation model of the dynamic flame front. A velocity perturbation model is proposed by considering the change of disturbance convection speed with forcing frequency. To analyze the nonlinear coupling effect of the two-directional forcing, a partly FDF is introduced by neglecting the coupling term. By comparing the results from the FDF, partly FDF, and the FTF, the nonlinear effects are investigated. As the flame tip movement plays an important role in the FDFs for the slit flame, the global effects of flame tip movement on the FDFs are also quantified.},

Traditionally, experimental stress–life data of polymers are approximated via a linear double-log Basquin model. Recently, the nonlinear stress–life formulation by Stüssi was found to provide a better fit of the experimental data with a substantially reduced standard deviation. Moreover, a nonlinear constant–life formulation, as proposed by Boerstra, can enhance the representation of the mean stress effect compared with state-of-the-art linear models given by the modified Goodman relation. To this end, Stüssi’s model was incorporated into the Boerstra relation to take account of the mean stress effects of an epoxy. This stress–life formulation was then enhanced with the Weibull probability function. The probabilistic–stress–life model provided a good approximation of the fatigue performance as a function of the stress ratio on the basis of an experimental data set. Finally, a stepwise engineering approach was suggested to derive the permissible stress–life with a view to practical design purposes. The procedure increased the reliability of the fatigue design evaluation compared with the state-of-the-art methodologies.},

The effect of variation of taper ratio, both in width and height of a rectangular cross section, on the nondimensional critical buckling load and the nondimensional natural frequency, is also investigated. A singularity is observed near the taper ratio of unity, which impacts the accuracy of both the finite element and the principle of virtual work results.

The wing structure was evolved by holding fixed the flight condition, mass per unit length, and material type. The results indicate that particular configurations of wing cross sections favor a uniform stress distribution, and therefore aeroelastic stability. The configuration with higher flutter speed is associated with the smoother flow of stresses through the wing structure.},

  abstract     = {The complex wing motion of insects and small birds leads to high lift production in nature. Specific lift-enhancing mechanisms arise from the combination of a horizontal stroke motion and a secondary wing pitching motion. Research around flapping wing nano air vehicles (FWNAVs) copies this wing motion to fly small drones, in an effort to benefit from the same mechanisms. A flapping wing aerodynamic model can predict the force production of the FWNAV and helps to understand the influence of the wing kinematics thereon. This work starts from a quasi-steady model expression for the aerodynamics and proposes a wind-tunnel procedure to identify the force coefficients in the model empirically. The procedure is based on a test case performed by the AVT-202 research team that combines wing translation and wing rotation, imitating the aerodynamic condition of the flapping wing in a simplified setup. Comparison of measurements and model simulations demonstrates that the procedure can be used to update the model parameters for our specific FWNAV configuration, leading to an empirical relation for the force coefficients. Simulations with the updated model using the empirical relations show good agreement with measured force production for a wide range of input variables.},

The model is applied to prescribed kinematics from a previously measured flight of a lesser-nosed, dog-faced fruit bat (Cynopterus brachyotis) in straight and climbing flight. Quasi-steady blade element momentum theory is used to model the aerodynamic forces of the highly articulated wing, and a Lagrangian equation of motion is adopted to describe the overall wing–body dynamics that includes the wing inertia. These two distinct and independent models yield a good prediction of the thrust/drag balance, and are in excellent agreement of lift production. Unique to this approach, the quantitative effect of wing camber was examined within the framework, which contributes as much as 27\% of the cycle-averaged lift, with a smaller price (10\%) paid to drag.},

Thermal images of a preheated surface from the infrared camera were used together with measurements from a fast response infrared sensor to obtain heat flux maps at a hypervelocity condition with flight duplicated enthalpy. Experimental heat flux results have an uncertainty of less than 10\% and agreed with laminar convective theoretical correlations to within 16\%, making thermography suitable for heat transfer measurements in expansion tubes.

The -diameter, three-bladed fixed-pitched rotors are simulated using computational fluid dynamics at a targeted disk loading and 30 kt edgewise freestream. Simulations are performed using the commercial Navier—Stokes solver AcuSolve with a detached eddy simulation model. In addition to an uncanted case, two laterally canted cases (10° advancing sides up and 10° advancing sides down) as well as two longitudinally canted cases (10° inward and 10° outward) are simulated. Aft rotor performance is compared to isolated rotors operating at the same revolutions per minute, speed, and shaft tilt angle in order to quantify the effect of rotor–rotor aerodynamic interaction. For all configurations, the aft rotors experience a lift deficit at the front of the rotor disk, which also results in a nose-down pitching moment relative to an isolated rotor. The lift deficit for the uncanted rotor was around 15\%. Lateral canting only slightly increases the lift deficit (to 16–18\%) but also produces 28–38\% change in roll moments. Change in aft rotor nose-up pitching moments for the uncanted and laterally canted rotors were in the 55–64\% range. Longitudinal canting produces larger changes in the magnitude of the lift deficit and pitching moment, but has minimal effect on roll moments. In particular, canting inward results in a lift deficit as high as 21\% and a 94\% change in pitching moment. Canting outward, on the other hand, reduces the aft rotor lift deficit to 11\% and the pitching moment change to 19\%. The paper explains the changes in the flowfield and the underlying physics for the different cases in detail.},

Noise is measured by means of a microphone array, while aerodynamic forces are measured with load and torque cells. Oil-flow visualizations are used to show the flow patterns on the blade surface, whereas phase-locked stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements are carried out to analyze the flow at 60\% of the blade radius. The pressure field around the blade section has been computed from the PIV velocity data. Results reveal a complex flowfield with the appearance of a laminar separation bubble at the suction side of the blade. The separation bubble moves toward the leading edge and reduces in size as the advance ratio decreases. At an advance ratio equal to 0.6, the flowfield is characterized by a laminar separation without reattachment. This causes vortex shedding responsible for a high-frequency hump in the far-field noise spectra.},

The separate analysis of these constituents is important from an engineering point of view, as they relate to different physical mechanisms. This paper is concerned with the extraction of tonal components. The characteristics of aeroacoustic signals can make this task challenging, because tones are numerous, nonharmonically related, and subjected to random modulations. A solution is proposed based on the theory of angle-time cyclostationarity, which seems flexible enough to deal with these constraints. A special effort is made to render the methodology as standalone as possible. This is achieved by automatically setting up the leading parameters with data-driven strategies. The methodology is illustrated on counter-rotating open rotor data that are known to be challenging.},

For a low Reynolds number flow, the scattering of vortex shedding at the airfoil trailing edge produces tonal noise, while for a moderate Reynolds number case, boundary-layer instabilities scatter at the trailing edge, leading to noise emission at multiple tones superimposed on a broadband hump. Different control setups are investigated, and they are configured to either find an optimal steady actuator intensity or an optimal position for a blowing/suction device. Implementation details are discussed regarding the control modules and design of digital filters. Analyses of physical phenomena as well as of relevant behavior of the actuated plant are conducted to understand how the extremum seeking loop leverages the flow physics to control noise.

Complementary simulations of the actuator are performed using delayed detached eddy simulations to validate the methods and offer explanations for shortcomings in the experiments. Scaling methods are applied to the experimental study of separation control on the suction side of a type II Glauert airfoil, otherwise known as the NASA hump model. An array of fluidic oscillators is located at and used to control separation over a range of Reynolds numbers for various actuator sizes and spacings . Integrated surface pressure measurements are used to determine the suitability of various momentum coefficient definitions for scaling the flow control efficacy. It is found that the momentum coefficients obtained using direct measurements of actuator plenum or throat pressure govern scaling with respect to both Reynolds number and actuator size.

The leading-edge suction parameter (LESP) has been proposed in the literature as a separation criterion. This paper trials the LESP in the erratic high-pitch-rate flow of onset turbulence. Two airfoils, a NACA0012 and NACA4412, have been tested at a Reynolds number of 100,000 and in turbulence intensities from 1.3 to 15\%, replicating small UAV flight conditions. It is seen that, although the peaks in the LESP can indicate vortex shedding, the LESP in itself is not a sufficient criterion. Notably, there is not a critical value corresponding to vortex activity. Furthermore, the LESP does show sensitivity to camber, which is primarily apparent through the angle of the leading-edge suction vector.},

Both, the energy harvesting and the propulsion problems are analyzed. In the first case, energy is harvested at the pivot point through dampers so that the efficiency is obtained once the heaving motion and the input power are computed. In the second problem, the prescribed pitch and the computed heave and deformation yield the thrust as well as the propulsive efficiency with the obtained input power. The present analytical results allow for a general survey of these two physical problems as the multiple governing parameters are varied. It is generally found that the best performance is achieved around the first natural frequency, which is obtained here from a simple algebraic expression.

The objective of this paper is the development and demonstration of a framework for the robust direct design of transonic natural laminar flow wings using state-of-the-art industrial tools such as computational fluid dynamics, linear stability theory, and surrogate models. The deterministic optimization problem, which serves as a baseline, searches for the optimum shape that minimizes drag applying a surrogate based optimization strategy. In that case, crossflow and Tollmien–Schlichting critical factors are fixed according to calibration data. For the robust approach, uncertainties in these critical factors as well as operational conditions are considered to account for situations that could prematurely trigger transition. The framework is able to come up with state-of-the-art natural laminar shapes for a short-haul civil aircraft configuration. The robust configurations are more balanced than the deterministic, as the transition location smoothly moves upstream as the critical factors are reduced. The pressure profiles are more resistant against instabilities, extending the current design envelope of natural laminar flow wings.},

The NASA Juncture Flow is used as representative of an aircraft with trailing-edge smooth-body separation. Two gridding strategies are examined: 1) constant-size grid, in which the near-wall grid size has a constant value and 2) boundary-layer-conforming grid (BL-conforming grid), in which the grid size varies to accommodate the growth of the boundary-layer thickness. Our results are accompanied by a theoretical analysis of the cost and expected error scaling for the mean pressure coefficient and mean velocity profiles. The prediction of is within less than 5\% error for all the grids studied, even when the boundary layers are marginally resolved. The high accuracy in the prediction of is attributed to the outer-layer nature of the mean pressure in attached flows. The errors in the predicted mean velocity profiles exhibit a large variability depending on the location considered, namely, fuselage, wing-body juncture, or separated trailing edge. WMLES performs as expected in regions where the flow resembles a zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer such as the fuselage ( error). However, there is a decline in accuracy of WMLES predictions of mean velocities in the vicinity of wing-body junctions and, more acutely, in separated zones. The impact of the propagation of errors from the underresolved wing leading edge is also investigated. It is shown that BL-conforming grids enable a higher accuracy in wing-body junctions and separated regions due to the more effective distribution of grid points, which in turn diminishes the streamwise propagation of errors.},

  abstract     = {Implicit large-eddy simulations of reflecting shock-wave turbulent boundary-layer interactions at a freestream Mach number of 2.05 were carried out for sweep angles of 0, 20, and 40 deg. The simulation for the unswept interaction reveals the shedding of spanwise coherent structures as well as a low-frequency unsteadiness at separation. Intermittent spanwise deformations of the separation line, also referred to as rippling, are observed with a frequency similar to that of the low-frequency unsteadiness. Interactions with 20 and 40 deg sweep are generated by adding a spanwise approach flow component. Because the inviscid shock system is not affected by the spanwise velocity component, the pressure rise across the impinging shock is the same as for the unswept interaction, and the resulting mean flowfields are similar. This approach, which enforces spanwise periodicity, can be understood as a model for interactions with perfect cylindrical similarity. For the swept interactions, the separated flow regions are enlarged, and the overall level of the pressure fluctuations is increased, although the relative increase of the pressure fluctuations over the interaction is reduced. For the swept cases, the low-frequency unsteadiness is shifted to higher frequencies, and the low-frequency amplitude is reduced compared to the unswept case. For 40 deg sweep, the rippling of the separation line is diminished, and oblique structures are observed downstream of the interaction.},

  abstract     = {This paper examines various methods for phase averaging the flowfield of a sweeping supersonic jet emanating from a scaled fluidic oscillator. Determination of the phase-averaged flowfield is challenging, especially at high oscillation frequencies where there is a jitter in the periodicity caused by its inherent fluid dynamics. Several phase-averaging approaches (including mathematical, signal processing, and phase-lock techniques) applied to time-resolved schlieren images of the flowfield are described. Criteria for evaluation are based on the image distribution per phase bin, the centerline intensity profile of the phase-averaged schlieren image, and the cross correlation of the images with the time-averaged reference image. Examination of the different methods based on the criteria shows that the zero-crossing method is sufficiently accurate and most suitable for the naturally oscillating flowfield investigated in this study. Although the phase-locked approach works well at specific phase angles, overall, it is found unsuitable for the current test conditions. The zero-crossing method applied to a sweeping supersonic jet schlieren reveals shock structure distortion when switching directions in the oscillation cycle. Results indicate that the zero-crossing method described in this study can also be extended to other non-time-resolved quantitative and qualitative flowfield measurement techniques using a simultaneously acquired time-resolved reference signal.},

  abstract     = {Experiments were performed within Rutgers University’s Mach 3.4 wind tunnel to visualize the unsteady flow over a wall-mounted hemisphere using high-speed schlieren imaging and stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (SPIV). The hemisphere was placed within the wind tunnel’s naturally developing turbulent boundary layer, resulting in a boundary-layer thickness-to-radius ratio of 0.43. The hemisphere flowfield demonstrates many features that are characteristic of a traditional shock/boundary-layer interaction, such as unsteady motion associated with the foot of the upstream separation shock and subsequent incipient separation. In addition, a strong reattachment shock emanates from the forward side of the hemisphere where flow reattachment occurs. Cross correlation of the high-speed schlieren data indicates that the upstream shock-dominated flow is not strongly correlated with the downstream wake flow. The upstream shock structure dominates; it wraps around the sides of the hemisphere, leading to a potentially far-reaching influence. The SPIV velocity fields reveal the presence of a highly unsteady wake structure with a separated shear layer and a downstream recompression shock. The observations are consistent with recent studies concluding that the wake flow comprises two recirculating lobes with symmetry along the spanwise centerline. Turbulence statistics of the hemisphere wake and separated shear layer were also analyzed.},

The top wall and side wall array configurations were fixed, and only the bottom wall configuration was changed. It was found that control decreased the axial oscillations but increased the spanwise oscillations of the shock (oscillations in the spanwise length of the normal part of the shock). Among the control cases, as the control on the bottom wall increased, the exit plane stagnation pressure recovery, static pressure recovery across the shock, and area of the normal portion of the normal shock increased and then decreased. However, the attached flow percentage on the bottom wall increased with an increase in control. As the shock moved away from the microvortex generator arrays, the case with no control on any walls gave better results in terms of shock size and exit plane stagnation pressure recovery. Also, as the number of control devices on the bottom wall increased, the extent of flow separation on the bottom wall decreased; however, it had detrimental effects on the duct flow beyond some extent.},

Accurate characterization of the test gas is crucial to understanding experimental results. However, characterization of the flows produced behind the shock wave has historically proven challenging. This paper applies a methodology to calculate the shocked test gas properties using the experimentally recovered shock speed profile. Static pressure, pitot pressure, and heat transfer predictions are found to closely match the experimental data for a range of shock trajectories with both argon and air test gases. Thermochemical variations in the test gases are found to depend strongly on variations in shock speed along the tube. It is shown that characterization of the test gases requires accommodating the influence of wave effects associated with the varying shock speed. Tube diameter is found to influence test time significantly in interaction with a variable shock speed, and also the magnitude of nonuniformities in the test gas. Location and number of shock timing stations in experimental facilities are found to play a vital role in the ability to accurately characterize the test gas of a given experiment.},

Wave effects extracted from shock speed variations are shown to provide all information necessary in order to reconstruct the test slug from any particular experiment. Accurate representation of flow dynamics is initially checked against argon test cases following accelerating and decelerating shock trajectories, each with a tube-end Mach number of 6.5 and a fill pressure of 66.66 Pa in a tube of 100 mm diameter.

  abstract     = {The numerical prediction of in-flight ice accretion generally involves geometry updates and remeshing as the ice builds up. However, the generation of body-fitted meshes around complex ice shapes is not trivial and can be repeated several times to obtain the final ice shape. The use of an immersed boundary method can simplify the mesh generation and help in the automation of the ice accretion process. This paper studies the application of an immersed boundary method to Eulerian droplet impingement simulations. A penalization method is suggested, requiring only the addition of source terms in the continuous form of the equations. The wall boundary condition must be treated with care to avoid droplets reinjection in the computational domain from a solid boundary. This is solved by the introduction of a droplet mask function in addition to the usual solid mask, providing an automatic detection of the wall boundary condition and therefore avoiding droplet reinjection. The approach is tested on canonical cylinder cases and on more realistic NACA0012 airfoil and ice horn cases. The results show that the solution from a body-fitted simulation can be reproduced using the penalization method.},

These data are interpreted to construct a new air–carbon ablation model for use in modeling carbon heat shield ablation. The new model comprises 20 reaction mechanisms describing reactions between impinging O, N, and species with carbon and producing scattered products including desorbed O and N; and molecular nitrogen formed by surface-catalyzed recombination; as well as carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide , and cyano radical (CN). The new model includes surface-coverage-dependent reactions and exhibits a non-Arrhenius reaction probability in agreement with experimental observations. All reaction mechanisms and rate coefficients are described in detail, and each is supported by experimental evidence or theory. The model predicts pressure effects and is tested for a wide range of temperatures and pressures relevant to hypersonic flight.

An expression based on the unsteady Blasius force equation is developed to compute the force response of the foil due to individual, frozen vortices that drift by the foil along mean flow streamlines. Calculations of lift force spectra for NACA 0007-61 foil shapes show 6 and 10 decibels of reduction at reduced frequencies, based on half-chord and freestream speed, of 30 and 50, respectively, relative to a NACA 0007-65 foil shape, thus highlighting the importance of foil leading-edge shape in high-frequency lift response to incident vortices. The lift response for reduced frequencies above 10 is then approximated by the vortex inertia force, and normalization of this high-frequency force term by the thin foil response shows a frequency-dependent exponential relationship that can be merged with thin foil lift response theory to compute the lift spectrum over the broad reduced frequency range between 0.1 and 50.},

Most formulations of the method assume inviscid flow and small amplitudes. Although these assumptions might be suitable for small-amplitude aeroelastic problems at high Reynolds numbers, modern engineering applications increasingly involve lower Reynolds numbers, large-amplitude kinematics, and vortex structures that lead to aerodynamic nonlinearities. This paper establishes that ULLT still provides a useful solution for low-Reynolds-number, large-amplitude kinematics problems, by comparing ULLT results against those of experimentally validated computational fluid dynamics simulations at . Three-dimensional effects stabilize leading-edge vortex (LEV) structures, resulting in a good prediction of whole wing force coefficients by ULLT. Although the inviscid spanwise force distributions are accurate for small-amplitude kinematics, the ULLT cannot model three-dimensional vortical structures, and thus it cannot correctly predict the force distribution due to the LEV. It can, however, predict the shedding of LEVs to a limited extent via the leading-edge suction parameter criterion. This can then be used as an indicator of the usefulness of the force distribution results.},

Owing to the basis of the derivation in physics-based scaling laws, the proposed correlation embeds gas-specific properties and has explicit dependence on the ratio of specific heat capacities. The correlation is applicable for arbitrary particle relative velocity, particle diameter, gas pressure, gas temperature, and surface temperature. Compared with existing drag models, the correlation is shown to more accurately reproduce a wide range of experimental data. Finally, the new correlation is applied to simulate particle trajectories in high-speed dusty flows, relevant to a spacecraft entering the Martian atmosphere.

  abstract     = {Prognostics and health management aim to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of a system and to allow a timely planning of replacement of components, limiting the need for corrective maintenance and the downtime of equipment. A major challenge in system prognostics is the availability of accurate physics-based representations of the faults dynamics. Additionally, the analysis of data acquired during flight operations is traditionally time consuming and expensive. This work proposes a computational method to overcome these limitations through the dynamic adaptation of the state-space model of fault propagation to onboard observations of the system’s health. Our approach aims at enabling real-time assessment of systems’ health and reliability through fast predictions of the remaining useful life that accounts for uncertainty. The strategy combines physics-based knowledge of the system damage propagation rate, machine learning. and real-time measurements of the health status to obtain an accurate estimate of the RUL of aerospace systems. The original method is demonstrated for the RUL prediction of an electromechanical actuator for aircraft flight controls. We observe that the strategy allows us to refine rapid predictions of the RUL in fractions of seconds by progressively learning from onboard acquisitions.},

  abstract     = {Reliable, risk-averse design of complex engineering systems with optimized performance requires dealing with uncertainties. A conventional approach is to add safety margins to a design that was obtained from deterministic optimization. Safer engineering designs require appropriate cost and constraint function definitions that capture the risk associated with unwanted system behavior in the presence of uncertainties. The paper proposes two notions of certifiability. The first is based on accounting for the magnitude of failure to ensure data-informed conservativeness. The second is the ability to provide optimization convergence guarantees by preserving convexity. Satisfying these notions leads to certifiable risk-based design optimization (CRIBDO). In the context of CRIBDO, risk measures based on superquantile (aka conditional value-at-risk) and buffered probability of failure are analyzed. CRIBDO is contrasted with reliability-based design optimization (RBDO), in which uncertainties are accounted for via the probability of failure through a structural and a thermal design problem. A reformulation of the short column structural design problem leading to a convex CRIBDO problem is presented. The CRIBDO formulations capture more information about the problem to assign the appropriate conservativeness, exhibit superior optimization convergence by preserving properties of underlying functions, and alleviate the adverse effects of choosing hard failure thresholds required in RBDO.},

  abstract     = {This paper reviews the development of reliability design technology as well as challenges encountered thus far regarding control systems for long march launch vehicles (LMLVs). Along with the high frequency of space launches, the target of “increasing the success rate by one percentage point” has been proposed by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology for LMLVs. In this context, the features of the representative launchers in the reliability design of control systems are reviewed first, especially from an industrial perspective. Thereafter, the techniques applied by LMLV control systems are presented using a five-level hierarchical architecture: fundamentals, self-repair, multiple module redundancy, fault-tolerant control, and fault-tolerant guidance. This is followed by a detailed discussion on the reliability design in LMLV navigation, guidance, control, and avionics subsystems. Finally, the challenges are addressed, which encompass the cost-oriented reliability design, the fault-tolerant control to suppress out-of-tolerance behaviors, and the fault-tolerant guidance to replan the mission autonomously under critical faults. The techniques under development for LMLVs in these areas are also summarized.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the effects of a porous wall on the development of Tollmien–Schlichting (TS) waves propagating inside a boundary layer. An experimental study performed in a low-speed wind tunnel showed that microperforated panels over hollow chambers could promote laminar–turbulent transition. First, measurements of the streamwise evolution of the TS instabilities reveal that greater amplification occurs over perforated panels compared to a solid wall. This effect was attributed to a wall impedance condition imposed by the perforated panels over the chambers. This setup is somewhat analogous to an acoustic liner for which the wall response is represented by a complex impedance. The impedance of the experimental setup was thus measured in situ. These experimental impedance values were then used as wall boundary conditions of a linear local stability calculation to quantify the influence of the wall impedance condition on TS wave growth. The approach was applied to predict the corresponding transition positions. Comparison between experimental and numerical results shows that the use of impedance boundary conditions is a promising approach to predict transition location, particularly in the case of the panel with the lowest resistance.},

Transition to turbulence improves performance but becomes difficult to achieve at low Reynolds numbers. Experiments at separation Reynolds numbers, with a rounded leading edge and a sharp back-step, were performed to distinguish between the effects of the wall proximity and Reynolds number on the shear layer transition to turbulence. When the shear layer is sufficiently far from the wall , the transition distance, normalized by the model chord, is proportional to the Reynolds number at separation. The growth of instabilities are in good general agreement with both linear stability calculations based on the measured velocity profiles, and the predictions obtained using the computational tool XFOIL. For shape factors larger than 20, high growth rates occur, even for as low as 5. For smaller shape factors, instabilities are greatly reduced or eliminated, and the wall stabilizing effect becomes more significant as the Re number decreases. Guidelines for the design of turbulator devices are discussed.},

The flow separates in the laminar regime, the turbulence developing inside the recirculation region enhances the momentum transport, and the flow can reattach. Models based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations suffer two of main issues: the determination of the transition onset and the level of the pressure recovery downstream of the reattachment of the flow. A model addressing both issues is presented in this paper. It is based on the transition model for the transition detection. The production of the turbulent kinetic energy has been properly enhanced thanks to a correlation found between the necessary boosting of and the intermittency function behavior within the bubble. The low-Mach-number and Reynolds-number flows around the Selig–Donovan 7003, Eppler 387, and NACA 0015 airfoils are analyzed. The results are compared to experimental data and large-eddy simulations available in the literature. The model can be applied to the analysis of an arbitrary airfoil without need of preliminary calculation of the transition point within the bubble.},

  abstract     = {Uncertainty in the microstructures has a significant influence on the material properties. The microstructural uncertainty arises from the fluctuations that occur during thermomechanical processing and can alter the expected material properties and performance by propagating over multiple length scales. It can even lead to the material failure if the deviations in the critical properties exceed a certain limit. We introduce a linear programming (LP) based method to quantify the effects of the microstructure uncertainty on the desired material properties of the titanium–7 wt\% aluminum alloy, which is a candidate material for aerospace applications. The microstructure is represented using the orientation distribution function (ODF) approach. The LP problem solves for the mean values and covariance of the ODFs that maximize a volume-averaged linear material property. However, the analytical procedure is not applicable for maximizing nonlinear material properties where microstructural uncertainties are present. Therefore, an artificial neural network based sampling method is developed to estimate the mean values and covariance of the ODFs that satisfy design constraints and maximize the volume-averaged nonlinear material properties. A couple of other design problems are also illustrated to clarify the applications of the proposed models for both linear and nonlinear properties.},

Consequently, the load carrying capacity and fatigue life of the component are maximized, resulting in less downtime and increased sustainability of the aircraft. A representative component geometry has been selected that is a potential candidate for additive manufacturing in order to enable the enhanced design freedom required of topology optimization approaches. Both linear and nonlinear-static finite element analyses are performed to validate the improved performance of the topologically optimized component, as well as contact analyses to demonstrate that the resulting design cannot be further improved without redesigning the complete assembly. The optimization problem is formulated and solved using a bidirectional evolutionary structural optimization method. The method demonstrates large reductions in maximum stress, leading to significant increases in fatigue life, potentially compensating for the degradation in fatigue properties inherent in additively manufactured metallic structures. The added design flexibility of additive manufacturing combined with topology optimization offer the potential for an anywhere, anytime manufacturing capability that would greatly benefit aircraft sustainability.},

Schlieren visualization using a high-speed camera is applied to provide insights into the flowfields. The results show that at the same mass flow rate of the secondary coflow injection and for Mach numbers of primary flow up to 0.35 SWJ excitation achieves a larger primary flow deflection angle than the SJ excitation does. To examine the flow control mechanisms, clear flow structures are extracted from noisy images by using robust principal component analysis. Moreover, dynamic mode decomposition is applied to investigate the flow dynamics of the primary flow. The SWJ is found to be more capable of enhancing the flow mixing than the SJ is. Furthermore, the SWJ ensures that the primary jet attaches to the nozzle surface and produces a larger deflection angle, which leads to the higher efficiency in coflow vectoring control.},

This work aims at understanding the directional effects of effusion cooling by studying the effectiveness of cooling film as a function of the offset flow angle β between the main flow and effusion cooling jets. The directional effects of effusion cooling on the cooling film effectiveness are investigated at offset angles of 0, 30, 60, and 90 deg. The cooling film effectiveness is determined by invoking the heat/mass transfer analogy using pressure-sensitive paint that is sensitive to the oxygen partial pressure at the paint surface. Experimental results indicate that offset angles have a strong effect on the cooling film effectiveness. At lower coolant mass flow rates, an offset angle increases the uniformness of the cooling film because the flows from each individual hole coalesce together to form the protective film. At higher coolant mass flow rates, the cooling film effectiveness is less sensitive to the offset angles . This is believed to be caused by the coolant flow lifting off the surface and dissipating more easily in the mainstream flow.},

  abstract     = {The present work exploits simplifications arising in weakly exothermic detonations when the postshock conditions are supersonic to investigate the structure of wedge-induced oblique detonations. These simplifications enable the linearized Euler equations (employed here in characteristic form) to be efficiently solved numerically, subject to the linearized Rankine–Hugoniot jump conditions across the leading oblique shock. A first set of computations employs one-step first-order Arrhenius chemistry appropriate for describing detonations when the postshock chemistry exhibits a thermal-explosion character. In that case, the relevant chemical-kinetic parameter of order unity is the product of the heat release and the activation energy divided by the square of the postshock thermal enthalpy. The transition from the shock to the detonation wave is continuous at small , begins to develop spatially decaying oscillations as increases, and develops a singularity at the shock at a critical value of ; above which, the transition must become discontinuous and involve a triple point. Parametric results are presented in a plane of the wedge angle and the incident-flow Mach number: the two important controlling parameters. The triple point is found to develop when the incident-flow Mach number falls below a critical value that exhibits a U-shaped dependence on the wedge angle, becoming large at both high and low wedge angles and reflecting large differences between shock angles with and without heat release in those two extremes. Additional computations are performed for a three-step branched-chain scheme with the heat-release step having zero activation energy and for very fuel-lean hydrogen–air detonations with postshock temperatures above crossover. These cases, for which ignition develops as a chain-branching explosion, do not develop a singularity at the shock; although they display many of the features identified with the Arrhenius chemistry, including oscillations and appearance of a precursor point indicative of criticality. The results suggest a strong potential influence of the chemistry on the transition.},

The flame morphology of a two-dimensional (2-D) non-premixed reactive shock–bubble interaction is first simulated and studied, in which unburned hydrogen is found to prevent efficient combustion. By applying the Lagrangian particle tracking method, most of the unburned hydrogen wrapped into the primary vortex turns out to be initially located upon the symmetry line of the bubble. Motivated by the idea of breaking the primary vortex, this study designs a novel geometry of a concentric bubble, which improves combustion efficiency to 94.4\% in contrast to a solid fuel bubble (74\%) due to multivortex interaction and a thick bridge structure. With the consistency between qualitative and quantitative 2-D and three-dimensional (3-D) flow dynamics, the idea of a 2-D concentric-bubble configuration is effectively extended to a 3-D coaxial jet interacting with oblique shock despite the existence of Kelvin–Helmholtz instability.},

  abstract     = {The oscillation of the mass flow rate of the input propellant in liquid rocket engines may induce a periodic heat energy release within the combustion chamber, resulting in operational instability. Since propellant components are discharged from the injector head, the injectors can play a role as a source of oscillation in the dynamic system of a liquid rocket engine. Prior studies confirmed that if the liquid spray and gas flow intersect by using gas-centered dual-swirl injector with tangential inlet in the gas flow path, droplets are generated with periodicity (fracture frequency). In this study, the characteristics and mechanisms of this periodicity were analyzed using longitudinal cross-section spray images. Since the multiple scattering signal that inhibits clarity is non-modulated components, it can be removed by using two modulated images with a phase difference of 180 deg (two-phase structured laser illumination planar imaging technique). And the dynamic characteristics of the gas–liquid spray were analyzed by applying the fast Fourier transform method. It was confirmed by this method that the fracture frequency was related to the impinging velocity of gas and hydrodynamic feature of liquid film. That is, it can be said that fracture frequency of the liquid film is dependent on the liquid Weber number and gas Weber number as the entrainment effect and impact force by gas flow are applied to the liquid film.},

  abstract     = {The present paper deals with the assessment of the turbulent flow through and the noise radiation of the ACAT1 fan stage, which was tested in the framework of the European project TurbonoiseBB. It aims at analyzing and predicting the broadband noise resulting from the impact of the fan wakes onto the outlet guide vane (OGV) at approach condition. This is achieved via a large-eddy simulation (LES) of the full fan-OGV stage that is in good agreement with the mean flow measurements. Some disparities regarding the turbulent content of the flow are, however, highlighted. The main flow features and the broadband noise sources are examined. The noise is then estimated using two different hybrid approaches: LES-informed analytical models, using Hanson’s and Posson’s cascade models, and a numerical approach coupling the LES with the free-field Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings (FW-H) analogy, and Goldstein’s in-duct acoustic analogy. The shape of the noise spectra provided by the analytical models is relatively similar to that of the sound measurements, whereas some discrepancies on the absolute noise levels may appear depending on the analytical model and the turbulence length scale estimate. The numerical approach reveals that accounting for the duct effect through Goldstein’s analogy provides noise levels much closer to the measurements than those obtained with the free-field analogy, which significantly overestimates the broadband noise. Both the analytical and the numerical approaches suggest that additional significant noise sources might be present in both the experiment and the simulation.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents efficient procedures to model multistage flows using Fourier-based methods. The Favre-averaged nonlinear harmonic method is extended to compute multistage flows by introducing rotor–rotor or stator–stator interactions. A unified treatment to transfer disturbances through blade–row interfaces is also formulated. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated in a multistage compressor and turbine with different levels of flow nonlinearity. The computed solutions using the proposed method matches well with unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) simulations but require far smaller computational resources. A method is proposed to reduce the computational cost of clocking studies even further by building reduced models from existing Fourier modes. The method allows the flowfield for a required clocking position to be constructed by postprocessing the Fourier modes computed for a single arbitrary clocking configuration. This technique is demonstrated by predicting compressor efficiency variation with respect to rotor blade clocking and wall temperature distributions in a turbine hot streak migration problem. Excellent agreement with unsteady RANS simulations is found. The proposed methods become less accurate in the presence of large flow nonuniformity but the produced solutions still show significant improvement over mixing plane solutions.},

  abstract     = {Mode transition (MT) is critical for adaptive cycle engine (ACE) to achieve mission adaptability. There are many constraints for the MT, making the control law difficult to design. At present, most design methods require manual analysis by researchers. When the design parameters of an engine are changed, it takes a lot of time to redesign the control law. What is more, most control laws need to adjust not only the mode selection valve (MSV), but also many other variable geometry components (VGCs) simultaneously, which makes the control system design complex and difficult. In this study, a general design method based on the particle swarm optimization method and the sensitivity calculation method is presented. This method can derive the control law for the MT without manual analysis, improving the efficiency of the design process. At most, one VGC needs to be adjusted during the change of state of the MSV, simplifying the control system. The fluctuation of thrust and airflow is less than 2\%, and the surge margin of the compressors is higher than 10\%, leading to a safe and stable MT. This method can adapt to the adjustment of the cycle parameters of the engine and the deviation of component performance, making it suitable for the engine performance design stage. It can also be applied to the design for other types of ACEs.},

Using expansion of thickness coordinate in the displacement field, the effects of both transverse shear and normal deformations are included. The theory satisfies the zero shear stress conditions on the top and bottom surfaces of sandwich plate. Hence, the shear correction factor is not required, generally associated with the First order shear deformation theory (FSDT). The boundary-value problem of the theory is derived using the principle of virtual work. Transverse shear and normal stresses are recovered from the stress-equilibrium equations of the theory of elasticity, and the continuity condition is satisfied at the interface between layers and stress boundary condition at the external surfaces. In addition, this study provides the effects of transverse normal strain on flexural response of sandwich plate. Closed-form solutions for simply supported sandwich plate subjected to concentrated force are obtained for various side-to-thickness ratios. The results of the present theory are compared with third-order shear and normal deformation theory, first-order shear-deformation theory, and the classical plate theory. The inclusion of the effect of transverse normal strain in the theory showed significant deviations in displacements and stresses.},

The material microstructure (i.e., at the scale of a polycrystalline representative volume element) and underlying microstructural mechanisms are directly incorporated and fully coupled with a structural analysis, concurrently probing the response at the structural scale and the material microscale. The proposed approach was fully calibrated using a series of uniaxial tension tests of Ti-6242S at a wide range of temperatures and two different strain rates. The calibrated model is then adopted to study the response of a generic aircraft skin panel subjected to thermomechanical loading associated with high-speed flight. The analysis focuses on demonstrating the capability of the model to predict not only the structural scale response, but also simultaneously the microscale response, and it further studies the effects of temperature and texture on the response.},

Results of the conditionally sampled statistics, topology, and orientation of TNTI local structures suggest that wake TNTI properties depend more heavily on the degree of vortex shedding and relatively less on the degree of wake symmetry. The present subzone-sampled joint probability density functions of the second and the third invariants of the velocity gradient tensor are compared with existing jet and mixing layer observations, and new insights are extracted. Random relative orientation between the vorticity vector and the TNTI normal is observed in the trough subzone of the present wake TNTIs, which casts doubts on the notion of full vortex structure confinement.

It has been found that the dominant features of the flow at the flap side edges are the double-vortex structures and the far-field noise features as two humps in the noise spectrum. Flap side-edge noise is commonly assumed to be linked to the double-vortex. However, whether the two humps in the noise spectrum are directly related to the double-vortex has not been fully confirmed. In this study, the flap side-edge noise sources are computed and analyzed based on phased microphone arrays. The CLEAN based on Source Coherence method is applied to the airframe noise benchmark test DLR1. It is shown that the acoustic sources have different frequencies and amplitude scaling laws in low- and high-frequency ranges. In contrast to existing studies, this study demonstrates that the high-frequency spectrum follows the Helmholtz number scaling law rather than the Strouhal number scaling law. Furthermore, the source strength distributions indicate that low-frequency noise sources are mainly located on the aft half-chord of the flap side edge, and high-frequency noise sources are located on the forward half-chord. Finally, two subregions at the flap side edge are identified as source locations for the low and high frequencies, respectively. The two-source noise mechanism revealed in this study will aid the establishment of a physics-based flap side-edge noise prediction model.},

At a chord-based Reynolds number of 400,000, the far-field noise measurements show that the finlets are capable of reducing the trailing-edge noise effectively from 1000 to 4000 Hz with up to 6 dB reduction, for effective angles of attack from 0 to 8 deg. By correlating the far-field noise to the boundary-layer measurements, an optimal finlet height to boundary-layer thickness ratio to achieve the highest noise reduction is discussed. Static pressure and dynamic pressure fluctuations are examined, particularly within the finlet-treated area, to capture the flow dynamics through the treatments. The unsteady surface pressure fluctuation spectra show strong reduction at frequencies higher than 1000 Hz in the finlet wake, complying with the far-field measurements. Both the auto- and cross-correlation results of the unsteady surface pressure reveal the formation of large-scale turbulence at the entrance and toward the exit of the finlets. Moreover, they suggest that the formation and subsequent mixing of these large-scale structures with the boundary layer can be beneficial to reducing the unsteady surface pressure fluctuations. The findings will be useful to potential optimization of the finlets.},

The sound radiated by the model is clearly evident in the cross spectra from a pair of flush-mounted microphones. Parameter studies show that, in the normal operating range, speed is the dominant factor. The main source appears to be blade self-noise, although there are also indications of blade–wake interaction in the downstream half of the rotation path. Boundary-layer trips have a significant impact, showing that laminar instability is an important contributor to the self-noise. It will remain a risk at full scale, and its absence should be ensured at the design stage. To minimize the remaining sound radiation (at a given wind speed), configurations with lower tip-speed ratio at maximum power output should be preferred to ones having higher values of this parameter.},

Then the NL-VLM method is applied to the canonical cases of the infinite and the elliptic wing. In this model, the stall cells is represented as a sharp transition between stalled and prestalled wing section, meaning that no wing section effectively sees a negative slope of the lift against angle-of-attack relation. This sharp transition can be smoothed by introducing an artificial dissipation that also results in two separated solutions, without changing the underlying characteristics of the model. The effect of several parameters, like the grid spacing and the relaxation factor, is studied, with little effect on the wavelength of the predicted stall cells. The effect of specific parameters of the lift polar like the magnitude of the negative slope in the stall regime and the trend in the deep stall range is also investigated. It is observed that the slope of the lift versus angle of attack must not stay negative when the angle of attack goes to infinity for the system of equations to have a steady solution. The amplitude of the negative lift-curve slope has an effect on the wavelength of the cells explaining why the stall cells would not be observed for a leading-edge-type stall. Finally rectangular wings are studied for comparison to experimental data and higher-fidelity numerical simulations, showing the predictive capability of the proposed low-order model.},

The laminar to turbulent-transition onset is predicted by the correlation-based Bas–Cakmakcioglu transition model that is coupled with the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model. A discrete adjoint implementation is subsequently developed. Automatic differentiation is utilized to construct the partial derivatives in the discrete adjoint formulation. The turbulence and transition models are fully coupled into the sensitivity derivative evaluations, as well as into the objective function evaluations. The sensitivity derivatives evaluated by the discrete adjoint solver are validated against those of the finite central difference method.

  abstract     = {Vertical-axis wind turbines’ simpler design and low center of gravity make them ideal for floating wind applications. However, efficient design optimization of floating systems requires fast and accurate models. Low-fidelity vertical-axis turbine aerodynamic models, including double multiple streamtube and actuator cylinder theory, were created during the 1980s. Commercial development of vertical-axis turbines all but ceased in the 1990s until around 2010 when interest resurged for floating applications. Despite the age of these models, the original assumptions (2-D, rigid, steady, straight bladed) have not been revisited in full. When the current low-fidelity formulations are applied to modern turbines in the unsteady domain, aerodynamic load errors nearing 50\% are found, consistent with prior literature. However, a set of steady and unsteady modifications that remove the majority of error is identified, limiting it near 5\%. This paper shows how to reformulate the steady models to allow for unsteady inputs including turbulence, deforming blades, and variable rotational speed. A new unsteady approximation that increases numerical speed by is also presented. Combined, these modifications enable full-turbine unsteady simulations with accuracy comparable to higher-fidelity vortex methods, but over faster.},

Convergence quality is investigated with respect to simulation time, grid resolution, and time-step resolution. Solution accuracy is evaluated by comparing to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses. Good agreement was found with CFD results.

  abstract     = {This paper presents the introduction, investigation, and critical assessment of three data-driven methods for rotor failure detection and identification in a multicopter. These methods are based on aircraft attitude signals obtained from forward flight under turbulence and uncertainty. The knowledge-based method exploits the system rigid-body dynamics insight under the different rotor failures to construct a decision tree that detects and identifies the rotor failure simultaneously by how the roll, pitch, and yaw signals violate the statistical confidence limits immediately after failure. For the statistical time-series method, the development of stochastic time-series models and residual-based statistical hypothesis tests are discussed. Here, fault detection in the transient response is followed by identification after the signals reach a stationary state, after controller compensation, with the healthy and the different faulty models, respectively, in a two-step manner. The third method employs the healthy time-series model to extract a useful feature, which is the residual cross correlation, as an input to a neural network trained to achieve simultaneous rotor failure detection and identification. The time-series assisted neural network is capable of making decisions throughout the entire flight with an accuracy of 98.8\%, with minimum computation time (less than 0.03 s) making it the best alternative for real-time monitoring.},

  abstract     = {The recent growing interest in urban air mobility (UAM) worldwide has led to the demand for physical analyses of the aerodynamic performance and aeroacoustic characteristics of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) rotorcraft. In a UAM eVTOL rotorcraft, the smaller vortices generated from multiple propulsors interact with lifting surfaces such as wings, fuselage, and propellers in a complex manner. Therefore, to accurately predict the performance and noise of UAM eVTOL rotorcraft, vortices should be preserved with little dissipation; and their interactions must be modeled precisely. These requirements need a numerical algorithm with a refined resolution than that allowed by conventional schemes. This paper proposes a newly modified enhanced multidimensional limiting process (eMLP) for vorticity conservation (eMLP-VC), which improves the original eMLP by accounting for the fact that most rotorcraft flowfields are vortex dominated and subsonic. For advanced capability in preserving vortices, the distinguishing criterion was modified through vortex profile analysis, and low-Mach-number adjustment was performed by reconstructing the interpolated primitive variables. The proposed scheme was applied to wave propagation, shock discontinuity, double Mach reflection, propeller–wing interaction, and Second Higher-Harmonic Control Aeroacoustic Rotor Test problems. The computed results confirmed that eMLP-VC exhibits superior resolution, numerical stability, and computational time efficiency as compared to the multidimensional limiting process, eMLP, and weighted essentially nonoscillatory methods.},

In addition, the ground effect can also affect helicopter performance during the maneuver. This study aims to use particle image velocimetry in wind tunnel to analyze the airflow generated by a 1:100-scaled helicopter rotor of the Sea King SH-3 navy helicopter isolated and with the presence of a full and a partial ground to consider the ground effect at different heights. Once the rotor has been studied, experimental tests were carried out of the rotor working next to a frigate model during the recovery maneuver. The measured velocity indicates that the flow asymmetry below the rotor can increase with the proximity to a partial ground distance up to 1.39 times. During the study of the rotor for the frigate landing approach, the downwash asymmetry is also important and changes abruptly the tendency during the last phase of the maneuver. It can lead to dangerous instabilities and problems for the helicopter pilot during the hovering over ships.},

The flow control actuators employ pulsed fluidic jets on the pressure side (PS) and suction side (SS) of the airfoil and are installed near the trailing edge of the blades. The flow control region extends over 12\% of the blade span and is centered at the 75\% span location. A reduced-order model (ROM) of the unsteady aerodynamic effects introduced by the actuators is developed. The ROM is trained using data obtained from unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations performed across a broad range of flow conditions representing the rotor environment. The ROM is incorporated in a comprehensive aeroelastic rotor simulation code. Open-loop control, consisting of alternating PS and SS actuation at various frequencies, is applied on a four-blade hingeless rotor resembling the Messerschmitt–Bölkow–Blohm Bo-105 rotor in level flight with an advance ratio of 0.30. The results indicate that the flow control actuators have significant control authority to modify the vibratory loads, with up to 85\% reduction in the four-per-revolution vertical shear force at the rotor hub. The tradeoff between vibratory load reduction and rotor performance is also examined. A 5.3\% increase in rotor power accompanies the vibratory load reduction.},

  abstract     = {This paper represents a new mathematical model for helicopters with flexible fuselages. The theory connects the two commonly separated research areas of flight, dynamics and structural dynamics, by considering all necessary effects of a flexible fuselage on helicopter flight dynamic characteristics. They are rigid-elastic couplings of the flexible fuselage between six rigid-body degrees of freedom and elastic deformations, along with inertial and kinematic couplings between subcomponents and the fuselage. This is achieved by using the floating frame theory and deriving the acceleration coupling matrices of subcomponents analytically. In addition, the obtained formulation is explicitly decoupled such that all unknown absolute accelerations could be obtained in a single step without iterations, which could improve computational efficiency greatly. This model is suited for aeroservoelastic analysis, and is particularly suited for heavy lift helicopters (HLH) because they usually have slower turning rotors and more flexible fuselages due to their larger scale, leading to closer frequency ranges between rigid body motions and high-frequency rotor and structural modes. The model is validated before being applied to a numerical example of a sample HLH with a feedback loop for stability augmentation. The results show that the feedback loop connects actuators, fuselage deformation, and rigid body motion and induces divergent oscillation, which is the aeroservoelastic instability that cannot be predicted without the additional sensor measurements feedback caused by dynamic deformation. Since the 10-second step response could be calculated in three seconds, the presented helicopter mathematical model is expected to be used in real-time simulations or even further in pilot-in-the-loop simulations, ultimately helping with the design of modern helicopters with nonnegligible fuselage flexibility.},

The accuracy of nonlinear subspace identification depends on the accuracy of the nonlinear feedback force that the user chooses. Considering the uncertainties in the selection process of an appropriate nonlinear model, a novel Bayesian probability method calculation framework based on response data is established to improve the accuracy of nonlinear subspace identification. Three implementation steps are introduced: 1) establish the candidate model database; 2) the reconstructed signal can be calculated by nonlinear subspace identification; and 3) the posterior probability of each candidate model is estimated to get the optimal nonlinear model and determine the nonlinear coefficients of the nonlinearities. Two numerical simulations are investigated: a two-degree-of-freedom spring-mass system with nonlinear damping and a cantilever beam with nonlinear stiffness. The influence of the noise on the robustness of the algorithm is considered. The experimental investigation is eventually undertaken considering a device showing elastic and damping nonlinearities. The latter is represented by a friction model depending on both velocity and displacement. Results indicate that the proposed approach can effectively identify the nonlinear system behavior with high accuracy.},

The main original contribution of this work is to propose a multi-output Gaussian process model assisted by gradient information, which can enhance the prediction accuracies of multiple outputs simultaneously. The observed response values, as well as the gradient information of all the outputs, are incorporated in the covariance matrix. In such a structure, not only the observed responses but also the correlation information across different outputs can be fully used. The proposed model is demonstrated with two analytical examples and used for modeling aerodynamic coefficients of a NACA 0012 airfoil. Three other existing Gaussian-process-based models are also tested to compare with the proposed model.

This study investigated the physical interpretation of subdominant multilobe structures in the SPOD modes. A high-speed schlieren movie that exhibited multilobe structures in the SPOD was analyzed using a wavelet-based conditional sampling and averaging (WB-CSA) method. The results of WB-CSA showed spatiotemporally localized wavepackets, which were formed intermittently and convected downstream through growth and decay. Such intermittent convection causes multilobe structures in the SPOD, as illustrated by simple synthetic data that model the results of WB-CSA. Therefore, multilobe structures, together with the most dominant single-lobe wavepackets, can be interpreted as representing the intermittent convection of wavepackets.},

Argon test gas was selected for its relatively simple chemistry, making it well suited to develop experimental test cases for numerical code development. Test models were constructed from either spherical neodymium permanent magnets or steel balls. Ceramic paint was used as an electrically insulating surface boundary condition for experiments where this was required. Finite-rate reacting computational fluid dynamics of the experimental configuration indicates that relatively long duration argon relaxation times lead to a highly nonequilibrium shock layer in which a significant Hall effect arises. This is important because it is expected that future flight vehicles using magnetohydrodynamic aerobraking technology will also be operated at flight conditions where Hall effect is strong. Shock stand-off was measured using high-speed luminosity imaging for various magnetic and nonmagnetic model configurations. Experimental results in this paper support previous numerical studies that found that only an electrically insulated model surface can generate a significant magnetohydrodynamic interaction when Hall effect is strong.},

  abstract     = {The accuracy and sensitivity of plasma generation predicted by several different chemical kinetics models is investigated in the context of weakly ionized hypersonic flowfields around the Radio Attenuation Measurement (RAM-C) vehicle. A computational fluid dynamics analysis is used to examine 13 independent trajectory points along the RAM-C II flight, and an assessment of the chemistry models is made by comparing results to available flight measurements. The limitations of making such comparisons with the raw flight data are established in detail, including the inherent shortcomings associated with interpolating the flight data to assess a single trajectory point. Two separate geometries are evaluated in this study, as the initial RAM-C geometry was altered during flight after its nose cap was pyrotechnically ejected. The blunter post-ejection geometry generates more electrons in the stagnation region. In general, good agreement is found between each chemistry model and flight data from both the electrostatic probe and reflectometer stations above 56 km. An expected sizable gap exists between the simulations and reflectometer data at lower altitudes. The impact of forward reaction rates, equilibrium constants, and number of species varies considerably based on altitude, velocity, and position along the body.},

  abstract     = {In the typical analysis of aero-optical wave-front data, the three lowest-order spatial modes (namely, unsteady piston as well as and tilts) are removed from the experimentally measured wave fronts. These modes are commonly corrupted by mechanical disturbances. In this work, an algorithm called the stitching method was developed that takes advantage of the advective nature of the optical aberrations caused by turbulent structures to recover the unsteady global X-tilt and piston modes from experimental time-resolved wave fronts. One-dimensional modeling and related uncertainty analysis showed that for the wave fronts collected with sufficient sampling frequency, the algorithm is able to correctly recover the aero-optical component of the unsteady X tilt. In this manner, the time series of true wave fronts can be recovered. To further validate the stitching method, spatiotemporal wave-front measurements were conducted on a Mach 0.6/0.1 forced shear layer. The predicted results for the rms of the aero-optical X tilt from the stitching method agree well with the modeled results. Since the stitching method recovers the time series of the aero-optical global X tilt, the global tilt spectra were also computed and presented. This information can be used by system designers to specify the requirements for adaptive-optics system components, such as fast steering mirrors in airborne directed energy systems.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces an ensemble-based field inversion framework to augment the turbulence models by incorporating prior physical knowledge. Different types of prior knowledge such as smoothness, prior values, and sparsity are enforced to improve the inference of the eddy viscosity and laminar–turbulent intermittency. This work first assesses the method on the problems of inferring eddy viscosity in the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equation from the velocity observation data for separated flows over periodic hills. Further, the method is used to infer the intermittency field in the transport equation of turbulent kinetic energy from measurements of the friction coefficient for transitional flows over a plate. The results demonstrate the performance of the regularized ensemble method by enforcing prior knowledge into the inference. The method serves as a useful inverse modeling tool to augment the turbulence model from observation data.},
