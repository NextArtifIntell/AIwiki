The global control formulation enables maneuvering throughout the flight envelope, including uncoordinated flight with sideslip. Differential flatness of the nonlinear tailsitter dynamics with a simplified aerodynamics model is shown. Using the flatness transform, the proposed controller incorporates tracking of the position reference along with its derivatives velocity, acceleration, and jerk, as well as the yaw reference and yaw rate. The inclusion of jerk and yaw rate references through an angular velocity feedforward term improves tracking of trajectories with fast-changing accelerations. The controller does not depend on extensive aerodynamic modeling but instead uses incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion to compute control updates based on only a local input–output relation, resulting in robustness against discrepancies in the simplified aerodynamics equations. Exact inversion of the nonlinear input–output relation is achieved through the derived flatness transform. The resulting control algorithm is extensively evaluated in flight tests, where it demonstrates accurate trajectory tracking and challenging agile maneuvers, such as sideways flight and aggressive transitions while turning.},

The corresponding optimization problem is formulated as a discrete nonlinear optimal control problem where the parameters of the orbit segment are the control variables. A hypothetical asteroid deflection problem is solved numerically using the method of dynamic programming, and it is shown that a gravity tractor can be obtained that is significantly more efficient in terms of deflection attained per unit mass of the spacecraft, as compared to similar gravity tractors in the literature. It is further shown using a numerical approach that the results may be applied to a slowly rotating asteroid that is assumed to have an ellipsoidal shape.},

First, for describing the complex constraint relationship between each body of the multibody system, the dynamic model of flexible spacecraft in the form of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) is established by applying the Lagrange equation of the first kind (augmented Lagrange method). Then, to facilitate numerical integration of the dynamic model and controller design, an independent coordinate method and block matrix operation-based transformation method are proposed to convert DAEs into ordinary differential equations. Based on this model, a two-timescale composite controller is designed by virtue of the singular perturbation theory to attain high-precision attitude control of the FPMS and suppress the vibration of flexible appendages. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted under two mission scenarios to validate the dynamic model and demonstrate that the accurate attitude control can be achieved.},

These are the first complete solutions to Euler’s equations for an asymmetric rigid body subject to nonaxial torques. The antiparallel solution is shown to be the optimal trajectory for spacecraft detumbling subject to a bound on the Euclidean norm of the applied torque. Comparisons to a numerically integrated optimal control law validate the solution for highly asymmetric spacecraft and long maneuver times. Combining the parallel and antiparallel torque solutions allows for the analytical expression of a rest-to-rest reorientation maneuver for any asymmetric spacecraft. This maneuver is completely parameterized by a single body frame angular momentum vector, and is thus termed a momentum-axis maneuver. Comprehensive trade studies indicate that the momentum-axis maneuver is superior in terms of maneuver time to time-optimal eigenaxis maneuvers for large-angle rotations, and generally within of numerically computed true optimum solutions. As these solutions are both analytic and computationally cheaper than either the eigenaxis or true optimum solutions, this approach could have widespread applications for spacecraft attitude control.},

  abstract     = {Deep-space-distributed spacecraft missions continue to gain relevance as real-world missions such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, Mars Sample Return, and others are conceived, designed, and flown. These classes of mission designs continue to challenge state-of-the-art trajectory optimization tools, often requiring significant changes to software and even new problem transcriptions entirely, in order to solve for optimal solutions. Trajectory optimization for multiple-vehicle missions poses all the challenges of the optimization of single-vehicle missions, but with added complexity of increased combinatorial scope due to multiple spacecraft, interspacecraft coordination constraints, and coordinated science objectives, motivating the need for new technical capabilities. The goal of this paper is to apply a multi-objective, multi-agent hybrid optimal control problem transcription, utilizing several new techniques, to optimize a very-long-baseline interferometry mission design. We develop and apply several new techniques in this capability, including a HashMap archive utility to prevent resolving missions, and a null gene transcription to vary both fleet size, and observation multiplicity. Applying these techniques enables efficient exploration the multi-objective nondominated front of a multivehicle design space where the number of spacecraft varies. The HashMap archive utility proves an essential component of this capability as duplicate candidate missions are discovered on average 17\% of the time, and it yields an order of magnitude quicker lookup time compared with a text file analog. Within the resulting nondominated front of solution missions, many interesting solutions appear, including one mission with a fleet of 7 spacecraft that images 16 radio sources.},

This paper formulates an approach to satellite conjunction based on a simple statistical model and discusses inference on the miss distance between the two objects, both when the relative velocity can be taken as known and when its uncertainty must be taken into account. It is pointed out that the usual collision probability estimate can be badly biased, but that highly accurate inference on the miss distance is possible. The ideas are illustrated with case studies and Monte Carlo results that show its excellent performance.},

The error-feedback optimization index is not only a measure of the solution accuracy but also a criterion of convergence. The original single-objective successive convexification optimization problem is transformed into a bi-objective optimization problem, which optimizes both the convexification error and the objective. An efficient and robust convergence strategy is proposed based on a line search filter for the newly obtained optimization problem. The proposed convergence strategy improves the accuracy of the obtained solution and alleviates the potential sensitivity of the successive convexification optimization convergence to the initial guess. The proposed convergence strategy is verified using a universal controllability set approximation method. The numerical experimental results show that the proposed algorithms have good practical potential in aerospace engineering.},

To ensure safe learning of the vehicle dynamics on the fly, this paper presents an adaptive control -based scheme, which actively estimates and compensates for the discrepancy between the intermediately learned dynamics and the actual dynamics. First, to incorporate the periodic update of the learned model within the L2F framework, this paper extends the architecture to handle a switched reference system subject to unknown time-varying parameters and disturbances. The paper also includes analysis of both transient and steady-state performance of the architecture in the presence of nonzero initialization error for the state predictor. Second, the paper presents how the proposed scheme is integrated into the L2F framework, including its interaction with the baseline controller and the real-time modeling module.

  abstract     = {This work introduces a methodology for the generation of an approximate analytical solution to perturbed ordinary differential equations using Schur decomposition. This methodology is based on the use of operator theory to find a linear approximation to the ordinary differential equation in an expanded space of configuration. Once this linearization is performed, the Schur decomposition is used to transform the resultant differential equation into an upper triangular system that can be solved sequentially following the upper triangular structure. Based on these results, a perturbation technique is also proposed to study these problems. Finally, this work provides a set of algorithms to automate all the methodologies presented, with a special focus on polynomial differential equations and the use of Legendre polynomials to represent the dynamical system. Several examples of application are provided, including the Duffing oscillator, the Van der Pol oscillator, and the zonal harmonics problem around the moon.},

  abstract     = {We present a path planning problem for a pursuing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to intercept a target traveling on a circle. The target is cooperative, and its position, heading, and speed are precisely known. The pursuing UAV has nonholonomic motion constraints, and therefore the path traveled must satisfy the minimum turn radius constraints. We consider the class of Dubins paths as candidate solutions, and analyze the characteristics of the six modes of Dubins paths where the final position is restricted to lie on the target circle with heading in the tangential direction of the circle. For each Dubins mode, we derive the feasibility limits, discontinuities, and local extrema. Using this analysis the intercepting paths are found by a systematic bisection search in the feasible regions of each of the Dubins modes. We prove that the algorithm finds the optimal (shortest length) intercepting path if it is a Dubins path. If the shortest intercepting path is not a Dubins path for any given instance, the algorithm finds a tight lower bound and an upper bound to the optimal solution.},

  abstract     = {The paper proposes two linear quadratic guidance laws, which enable target interception while imposing a predetermined terminal intercept angle. Unlike previous solutions, which usually assume constant missile and target speeds, time-dependent known speed profiles of the adversaries are addressed. The guidance laws are derived for linear, arbitrary-order missile and target dynamics using optimal control and differential games theories. Specific closed-form results are provided for ideal missile and target dynamics with constant axial acceleration adversaries. The performance of the proposed guidance laws is investigated using a nonlinear two-dimensional simulation, and the results are compared to two state-of-the-art optimal control and differential-games-based guidance laws that can impose the intercept angle. It is shown that the proposed guidance laws can intercept the target with small miss distances and intercept angle errors and that they have better performance than the compared state-of-the-art guidance laws when the adversaries’ speeds vary. The selection of which guidance law to use depends on the scenario. When the target is predictable, the optimal-control-based guidance law is better suited; whereas when the target is intelligent, the differential-games-based guidance law is a more appropriate choice.},

A general stability analysis proves globally asymptotic stability given a set of conditions that are analogous to those of standard Lyapunov vector fields. A special case of this novel path-planning law (referred to as a cascaded Lyapunov vector field) is closely studied, and a simple set of conditions guaranteeing bounded acceleration commands for perfect tracking are derived. A design procedure is presented. Finally, a full design example for a spacecraft proximity inspection mission is presented. The simulations demonstrate stable behavior while respecting acceleration and path constraints. Furthermore, all constraints are met by judicious design of the path-planning field, without the need for computationally expensive algorithms running in real-time.},

Finite-horizon covariance control, i.e., the steering of a system from an initial probability distribution to a desired one at a prescribed time, is employed to plan an optimal nominal path along with a robust feedback controller that compensates for exogenous in-flight disturbances. A mindful convexification strategy is devised to recast the nonlinear covariance control problem as a deterministic convex optimization problem. The convexification is based on a convenient change of variables that allows for relaxing the covariance matrix discrete-time propagation into a set of semidefinite cone constraints. While featuring a larger feasible space, the relaxed problem shares the same optimal solution as the original one. The lossless property of the relaxation is analytically proven by leveraging optimal control theory and discussed on the basis of numerical experiments. Monte Carlo campaigns are carried out to validate the in-flight performance of the attained control policies.},

  abstract     = {Exploration of small Solar System bodies has traditionally been performed by monolithic spacecraft carrying several science instruments. However, instruments often cannot be operated simultaneously due to requirements including viewing angle, illumination, power, and data constraints. This has motivated interest in architectures in which a swarm of small spacecraft, each carrying one instrument, studies a small body after being deployed by a carrier spacecraft; such architectures hold promise to yield significant improvements in mission efficiency, increased data quality, and reduced mission duration. A key difficulty is the selection of orbits for the spacecraft, which must satisfy not only instrument requirements but also communication and data storage constraints. To address this, we propose a novel gradient-based optimization algorithm that simultaneously optimizes spacecraft orbits, observations, and communications; the approach captures instrument requirements, communication bandwidth, and memory usage, and it accommodates irregular gravity field models and surface geometries. Numerical simulations of a six-spacecraft swarm studying the 433 Eros asteroid show that the approach results in a 67.9\% increase in data returned as compared to a communication-agnostic approach. Collectively, these results enable system designers to quickly assess the end-to-end performance of multispacecraft constellations, and represent a first step toward communication-aware design of multispacecraft missions for small Solar System body exploration.},

A quasi-periodic orbit is an orbit diffeomorphic to a quasi-periodic torus that moves on at least a two-dimensional manifold in phase space and does not repeat itself. Given plans for the future Lunar Gateway, the quasi-halo orbits in the Earth–moon system are of interest. About each periodic halo orbit is a one-parameter family of quasi-halos, and thus across the halo orbit family is a two-parameter family of these orbits. This work surveys the two-parameter family of quasi-halo orbits in the circular restricted three-body problem to provide a global picture of the family. Additionally, the hyperbolic manifolds of these objects are explored, and applications of their uses presented. This work contributes results and analysis of the apses, geometry, and stability of the family to evaluate the use of quasi-halo orbits in the early stages of mission design.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the use of meta-reinforcement learning for the autonomous guidance of a spacecraft during the terminal phase of an impact mission toward a binary asteroid system. The control policy is replaced by a convolutional-recurrent neural network, which is used to map optical observations collected by the onboard camera to the control thrust and thrusting times. The network is trained by a proximal policy optimization algorithm, a family of reinforcement learning methods. The final phase of NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission is used as a test case. The objective is to maneuver the spacecraft to impact the smaller object, Dimorphos, in the Didymos binary system. The spacecraft dynamics are described using the bi-elliptic restricted four-body problem with solar radiation pressure. The initial conditions are randomly scattered according to the actual specifications of the DART mission. A random error on the orbital position of Dimorphos is also considered to reflect uncertainty on the binary system’s characteristics and dynamics. The control system aims at minimizing the error on the final spacecraft position. Numerical results show that the guidance system can correctly drive the spacecraft toward the final impact point in more than 98\% of the 500 test scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Mean orbital elements play a significant role in constellation guidance, orbital maintenance, and transfer strategy design. Hence, research on mean orbital elements estimation flourishes with the development of mega-constellation construction, for instance, the Starlink program. This paper investigates the autonomous on-orbit estimation problem of mean orbital elements under the consideration of real-time mean orbital elements acquisition, reliable mean orbital elements prediction, and extreme condition handling of state jumping caused by protective orbit transfer or nonfatal spacecraft collision. A novel mean orbital elements estimator based on the Savitzky–Golay filter (“Smoothing and Differentiation of Data by Simplified Least Squares Procedures,” Analytical Chemistry, Vol. 36, No. 8, 1964, pp. 1627–1639) with adaptive frame size, maneuvering detector, and multimode switching mechanism is proposed. Adaptive frame size according to the orbital period for completing the Savitzky–Golay process guarantees the estimation efficiency and accuracy of mean orbital elements estimation and prediction. Then, the prediction value is employed to generate the mean orbital elements difference compared with the estimation. Finally, the mean orbital elements difference is adopted to govern the satellite state detector for mode switching. Comparison simulations for both with and without state jumping are conducted, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the mean orbital elements estimator over the direct mapping method and the Savitzky–Golay filter in estimation efficiency, accuracy, and range of application.},

Nonlinear least-squares approaches are also derived for both, which also provide the Cramér–Rao lower bound as a byproduct. All approaches have a sign ambiguity in the angular velocity solutions, which is resolved using a simple linear Kalman filter.

  abstract     = {Lambert’s problem involves solving the orbits connecting two position vectors with a given flight time. When introducing variations to the input of this problem (that is, terminal positions and the flight time), the output terminal velocities vary in response. The higher-order Lambert problem pursues a higher-order Taylor approximation of the output with respect to the input. Instead of finding a real number root, Householder methods are adapted to find a Taylor series solution of the transfer-time equation. By using explicit derivatives of the transfer-time equation, the newly implemented Householder methods converge faster than the general partial inversion method. In applications such as pork-chop plots and orbital admittance maps that require solving a large number of Lambert’s problems, a higher-order Lambert solution can reduce the running time by more than 80\% when compared to solving the original Lambert problems one by one. Furthermore, the investigation of the parameter space of Lambert’s problem yields useful insights to the selection of higher-order expansion points.},

This force updates the virtual dynamics of an admittance controller to execute the desired trajectory of the payload in the direction of the applied force. A centralized payload controller commands quadrotor trajectories to track the admittance controller trajectory. Custom open-source autopilot software tracks user commands by translating each quadrotor to pull on the tethers in a manner that collectively moves the payload according to user input force. Simulation and experimental flight-test results in a netted facility validate the system with a user applying force directly on the slung payload to guide it.},

  abstract     = {As wing designs aim for higher aerodynamic efficiency, the underlying aircraft structure becomes more flexible, requiring additional features to alleviate the loads encountered from gusts and maneuvers. While alleviating loads, it is desirable to minimize the deviations from the original flight trajectory. In this work, a dynamic control allocation method that exploits redundant control effectors for maneuver and gust load alleviation is proposed for flexible aircraft. The control architecture decouples the two objectives of load alleviation and rigid-body trajectory tracking by exploiting the null space between the input and the rigid-body output. A reduced-dimensional null space input is established, which affects the flexible output (but not the rigid-body output) when passed through a null space filter to generate incremental control signals. This null space input is determined by model predictive control to maintain the flexible output of the aircraft within specified values, thereby achieving load alleviation. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the operation of this load alleviation system on nonlinear models. It is shown that the proposed load alleviation system can successfully avoid the violation of load bounds in the presence of both gust disturbances and maneuvers with minimal effect on the trajectory tracking performance.},

Predefined tracking performance requirements are achieved, and, meanwhile, safety and stability are guaranteed. By exploiting the prescribed performance control technique, the proposed NMPC structure is capable of establishing a quantitative relationship between design parameters and certain prespecified performance values. Moreover, the proposed fixed-time neural network disturbance observer shows superiority in the disturbance estimations due to the property of universal approximation and fixed-time convergence. To illustrate the capabilities of our algorithm, comparison simulation tests concerning with prescribed performance and disturbance estimating are presented.

The large convergence radius of the proposed method is robust to bad initial guesses. The geometric guidance is used in a multiple-spacecraft architecture, and a collision avoidance scenario illustrates how the geometric path planner solves constrained path planning problems.

  abstract     = {Singular arcs are a common feature in optimal control problems when the standard necessary conditions fail to reveal a candidate control. In some cases, a singular arc can be proven to be nonoptimal and discarded. In other cases, the solution can be resolved through additional convexity conditions on the Hamiltonian. A less common, but nonetheless interesting, scenario occurs when the singular arc appears with infinite order. This situation becomes apparent when the problem definition lacks sufficient information to identify a unique solution. In this work, we consider conditions under which singular optimal control problems may exhibit indeterminate behavior due to insufficiency of the cost objective and boundary conditions. The resulting problem is shown to be singular, but in a degenerate sense wherein the necessary conditions yield no new information. A relaxation approach is developed to repose the problem with augmented covariance dynamics. The method permits finite-order arcs producing a well-posed problem. The approach has relevance to engineering systems, which are almost always subject to some level of uncertainty in initial states or parameters. Examples are provided based on classical problems in optimal control, as well as aerospace mission design.},

  abstract     = {Understanding and predicting the long-term spin state evolution of defunct satellites and rocket bodies is important for solar radiation pressure modeling, space domain awareness, and active debris removal (ADR). Dynamical modeling and observations indicate that defunct geosynchronous satellite spin states are primarily driven by solar radiation torques via the Yarkovsky–O’Keefe–Radzievskii–Paddack (YORP) effect. In our two recent papers, we uncovered dynamically rich YORP-driven behavior including cycling between uniform rotation and non-principal axis tumbling, angular momentum sun tracking, and tumbling period resonances. These papers only considered the YORP effect. However, tumbling satellites are also subject to energy dissipation from residual fuel slosh and flexure. Gravitational torques and other environmental perturbations may affect long-term evolution as well. In this paper, the third in our series, we develop semi-analytical tumbling-averaged models for internal energy dissipation and gravity gradient torques and combine them with the earlier YORP models. Accounting for YORP and dissipation, we find asymptotically stable tumbling states with constant angular momentum and kinetic energy and a pole fixed in the rotating sun-satellite orbit frame. With gravity gradients, these asymptotic states become stable limit cycles with yearly periodicity. We discuss the implications of these findings for the space debris population, ADR, and satellite decommission procedures.},

  abstract     = {This work presents robust and numerically efficient algorithms for designing low-thrust collision avoidance maneuvers in short-term encounters. The conjunction dynamics are developed in a tridimensional space and then projected onto the B-plane, centered at the secondary object. Energy- and fuel-optimal maneuvers are computed by constraining the collision probability or the miss distance. A fully analytical approach is derived for energy-optimal collision avoidance maneuvers, providing a good guess for the fuel-optimal problem. The proposed methods are validated in terms of efficiency and robustness in a simulated scenario accounting for environmental perturbations.},

Recently, the Koopman operator has emerged as a promising alternative to the geometric perspective for dynamic systems, where the Koopman operator formulates the analysis and dynamic systems in terms of observables. This paper applies the Koopman operator for computing both two-dimensional and three-dimensional periodic orbits near libration points, obtaining the complete spectral analysis of the dynamics with orthogonal polynomials. Further, simulation results show that the Koopman operator provides analytical solutions with high accuracy for both Lyapunov and halo orbits. The Koopman solution is then applied to a station-keeping application, where a new particle filter and a nonlinear model predictive controller are developed.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores expressing the relative state in the close-proximity satellite relative motion problem in terms of fundamental modal solution constants. The nominal uncontrolled relative state can be expressed in terms of a weighted sum of fundamental and geometrically insightful modal motions. These fundamental motions are obtained using the Lyapunov–Floquet theory. In the case that the dynamics are perturbed by the action of a controller or by unmodeled dynamics, the weights on each fundamental solution are allowed to vary as in a variation-of-parameters approach, and in this manner function as state variables. This methodology reveals interesting insights about satellite relative motion and enables elegant control approaches. This approach can be applied in any dynamical environment as long as the chief orbit is periodic, and this is demonstrated with results for relative motion analysis and control in the eccentric Keplerian problem and in the circular restricted three-body problem. Some commentary on the extension of the methodology beyond the periodic chief orbit case is also provided. This is a promising and widely applicable new approach to the close-proximity satellite relative motion problem.},

Comparisons between open-loop and closed-loop numerical simulation results show how the proposed control system attenuates the Dutch-roll response. An aeroservoelastic analysis is made in which it its demonstrated that the control system has small but beneficial effects on aeroelastic stability.

Evidential information fusion is used to estimate the current wildfire state and the resulting heat aura at flight level. This approach accounts for ignorance, which is a result of conflict among sensors operating in a harsh environment and a computational forecasting agent that uses a fire evolution model of inadequate accuracy. An SUAS is employed to visit locations of high conflict to provide additional situational awareness. Flight-level heat aura is modeled as a keepout zone with probabilistic boundaries for SUAS path planning. A novel unsupervised classification algorithm is developed to identify distinct obstacle boundaries within the estimated heat aura. Path planning is posed as a chance-constrained optimal control problem, which is transcribed to a nonlinear program via pseudospectral discretization. The results show that this approach can yield a family of solutions that elicit the risk associated with each mission design, and the appropriate choice of risk can aid in the generation of “keyhole paths.”},

Firstly, the incremental nonlinear control technology is used to simplify the attitude control system into an incremental nominal model with a synthetic uncertainty/fault term that is estimated by a nonsingular terminal sliding mode disturbance observer. Secondly, considering a quadratic performance index, the original fault-tolerant optimal control problem is transformed into a guaranteed performance optimal problem of the nominal model. Benefiting from the simplicity of the incremental model, such a modified optimal control problem is solved online by the modified policy iteration adaptive dynamic programming without any initial stable policy assumption. Finally, the attitude angles of the closed-loop system are proved theoretically to be uniformly ultimately bounded at the desired state by using the Lyapunov methods. Simulation results are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed fault-tolerant optimal attitude control strategy.},

The Bekker terramechanics theory is utilized for calculating the impact force and torque, considering the notable deformable characteristic of the regolith. Deformation of the regolith surfaces is tracked to simulate the formation of the impact crater. Parametric simulations are implemented to verify this method by varying the regolith physical properties and the initial lander state, respectively. The velocity and angular velocity of the lander are utilized as indicators for comparing the hopping dynamics. Energy dissipation is discussed by calculating the restitution coefficients of different contact scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The sizing of a control moment gyro (CMG) cluster is covered sparsely in literature, but it is of considerable interest to a practicing engineer. In this paper, the sizing of a cluster of four control moment gyros is investigated based on the mission angular momentum requirement of a typical agile spacecraft. The CMG skew angle and individual CMG angular momentum are determined as part of the sizing. The work focuses on the sizing of a minimally redundant cluster of four CMGs in a pyramid and roof-type arrangement considering their external angular momentum surfaces. Two approaches are discussed: the first considers maximum angular momentum about individual axis separately, and the second considers the momentum requirement about two axes simultaneously. The internal momentum surfaces of the CMG clusters are analyzed. Gimbal angle desaturation and the fuel consumed for it by the roof-type and pyramid configurations are also examined. Both the four CMG clusters are able to meet the maximum nonspherical angular momentum demanded by a typical mission about each axes. However, using method 1, the cluster is able to generate only 88\% of the two-axis mission demand. The clusters meet the mission demand completely with method 2 using 20\% more angular momentum per CMG and an increase in skew angle by compared to method 1. The 20\% increase in momentum increases power consumption by 11\%. For a typical gimbal angle desaturation, the roof-type cluster uses 8.5\% more fuel than the pyramid arrangement. However, the former has only one major internal singular surface in contrast with seven for the latter. This makes the roof-type arrangement very desirable to keep the singularity avoidance algorithm simple and amenable with the CMGs operating within the momentum capability, and achieve the required spacecraft agility.},

According to Pontryagin’s maximum principle, some optimality conditions for the solutions of the nonlinear optimal interception problem are established; and the structure of the corresponding optimal control is presented. By employing the optimality conditions, we formulate a parameterized system so that its solution space is the same as that of the nonlinear optimal interception problem. As a consequence, a simple propagation of the parameterized system, without using any optimization method, is sufficient to generate enough sampled data for the mapping from the current state and time-to-go to the optimal guidance command. By virtue of the universal approximation theorem, a feedforward neural network, trained by the generated data, is able to represent the mapping from the current state and time-to-go to the optimal guidance command. Therefore, the trained network eventually can generate impact-time-constrained nonlinear optimal guidance within a constant time. Finally, the developed nonlinear optimal guidance is exemplified and studied through simulations, showing that the nonlinear optimal guidance law performs better than existing interception guidance laws.},

More specifically, this study investigates the bias shaping approach, which takes the bias gain function given by a product of factors in range and look angle. The linear feedback and fractional power feedback of impact-angle error are considered for command structures. For each command form, this study examines the conditions that should be satisfied by the gain functions to guarantee mission accomplishment without violation of the constraints. The analysis particularly focuses on estimating the set of feasible initial or final conditions that ensure compliance with the constraints along the trajectory. Numerical simulation is performed for a range of initial and final flight-path angles to verify the analytical results. The findings of this study provide a general foundation for the design of a nonswitching guidance law for impact-angle control with limited look angle through shaping of gain profiles.},

For a swarm of networked femto-spacecraft, relative position determination would be possible by inferring coarse range estimates from the received signal strength indication associated with the communication link between swarm members. This is particularly advantageous for highly resource-constrained devices. In this paper, algorithms for swarm relative positioning using interspacecraft range estimates are presented that can be applied to centralized, decentralized, and distributed network configurations. Relative navigation filters for initial relative orbit determination and state estimation are presented for femto-spacecraft swarm deployment and dispersal scenarios. The algorithms presented could also find use in terrestrial applications, in static and dynamic wireless sensor networks.},

Effectively, this new formulation combines the well-known numerical stability properties of the UD factorized Kalman filter with the enhanced tolerance to high nonlinearities and uncertainties of the partial-update filter. Two versions of the UD partial-update filter are presented: one for sequential measurement processing, delivering the most computationally efficient update, and another for the more convenient but slightly more expensive batch measurement update. Additionally, an implementation of the partial update for the multiplicative extended Kalman filter and the associated quaternion attitude representation is provided. The efficacy of the UD partial-update filter is demonstrated via numerical simulations and hardware experiments; the results show that the combined UD partial-update filter provides a more robust filtering capability than when either component is used individually.},

The higher-order transfer map from initial velocity space to final position space is obtained with the use of differential algebra. An adaptive homotopic scheme is proposed to solve the perturbed BVP, where the transfer map is used to correct the residuals. Then, higher-order expansions of the BVP solution and the Jacobian with respect to the final position are derived, and the debris density inside a spacecraft envelope is calculated with the expansions. The simulation results show that the proposed higher-order method contributes to accelerating the convergence of perturbed BVP solvers. The density transformation method based on the map is validated by Monte Carlo simulations. The effects of perturbations on the collision risk are shown.},

  abstract     = {Asteroid exploration has been attracting more attention in recent years. Nevertheless, we have just visited tens of asteroids, whereas we have discovered more than 1 million bodies. As our current observation and knowledge should be biased, it is essential to explore multiple asteroids directly to better understand the remains of planetary building materials. One of the mission design solutions is utilizing asteroid flyby cycler trajectories with multiple Earth gravity assists. An asteroid flyby cycler trajectory design problem is a subclass of global trajectory optimization problems with multiple flybys, involving a trajectory optimization problem for a given flyby sequence and a combinatorial optimization problem to decide the sequence of the flybys. As the number of flyby bodies grows, the computation time of this optimization problem expands maliciously. This paper presents a new method to design asteroid flyby cycler trajectories utilizing a surrogate model constructed by deep neural networks approximating trajectory optimization results. Because one of the bottlenecks of machine learning approaches is the heavy computation time to generate massive trajectory databases, we propose an efficient database generation strategy by introducing pseudo-asteroids satisfying the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions. The numerical result applied to Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s mission shows that the proposed method is practically applicable to space mission design and can significantly reduce the computational time for searching asteroid flyby sequences.},

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to investigating the fault-tolerant reduced-attitude control problem for boresight reorientation of an uncertain spacecraft subject to pointing and angular velocity constraints. First, the stereographic projection is used to transform this problem to an obstacle avoidance problem on a two-dimensional Euclidean sphere world with circular obstacles. Then, an adaptive fault-tolerant control strategy is proposed to solve the transformed problem, by designing two potential functions for constraint handling in conjunction with a sliding vector containing hyperbolic tangent functions. Stability analysis shows that the derived controller can achieve asymptotic convergence of the gradient of the obstacle avoidance potential and angular velocities, while ensuring the satisfaction of both pointing and angular velocity constraints, despite the presence of unknown time-varying inertia parameters, disturbances, and actuator faults. In particular, benefiting from incorporating the spacecraft principal moments of inertia into the potential field design, the risk of the system losing strong controllability under multiplicative actuator faults is greatly reduced. To accommodate actuator faults under input saturation, the adaptive fault-tolerant controller is further extended to a saturated counterpart, which is capable of making full use of the remaining actuation power to react to actuator faults. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate our theoretical findings.},

To accurately reconstitute and compensate for unmeasurable lumped disturbances, including the effects of unmeasurable tensions and unstable airflows, an estimator-based minimal learning parameter neural network (EMLPNN) is established for each subsystem of the drogue dynamics. Then, an EMLPNN-based prescribed performance controller is proposed to stabilize the aerial-recovery-drogue trajectory with prescribed performance. Moreover, the problem of the actuator constraints is handled by establishing an auxiliary system whose states are employed to compensate for the angular-rate control law. The closed-loop stability is analyzed. Drogue stabilization simulations under airflow disturbances are conducted for verification of the control performance and effectiveness.},

The guidance law consists of a circular guidance term to obtain an exact analytical time-to-go, and a biased term to cooperate different time-to-go values of missiles to reach consensus such that salvo attack can be achieved. The guidance of an individual missile reduces to the circular guidance when the impact time error approaches zero. The convergence of impact time errors among missiles with nonuniform FOV constraints under the proposed cooperative guidance law is proved. Impact time cooperation accuracy is guaranteed owing to the accurate time-to-go calculation of the circular guidance. Based on the same principle of time-to-go cooperation, three similar cooperative guidance laws are also developed with the same structure as the cooperative circular guidance law: a cooperative proportional navigation guidance (PNG) law, a PNG-based sliding mode cooperative guidance law, and a circular guidance-based sliding mode cooperative guidance law. The inherent relationships among these guidance laws are analyzed. Their performances are verified and compared through numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Homing guidance requires maintaining the target lock-on condition within the seeker’s field of view (FOV). This paper aims at developing a unified FOV-limited guidance framework from which a variety of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) guidance laws can be derived. First, the unified method for 2D homing guidance is established by augmenting an arbitrary baseline guidance law with a biased command. To mitigate the effect on the baseline guidance law, this biased command is designed in the admissible range that respects the FOV limit and only takes effect when the lead angle approaches the FOV bound. For more practical relevance, the autopilot dynamic of any order is further considered explicitly in the design with a recursive approach. Then, the unified method for 3D homing guidance with coupling nonlinearity is developed by exploiting the geometric relation among space angles. Unlike existing similar results, the proposed design requires neither switch logic nor numerical algorithms, which allows for continuous guidance command and convenient implementation. With the proposed method, various illustrative guidance laws are derived to demonstrate the significance of the unified framework. Finally, numerical simulations with comparative study are conducted to support the analytical findings and show the superiority of the proposed method.},

An extended Kalman filter is used to improve the noisy relative measurements and estimate the velocity of the moving target. These estimated values are used in the control laws to encircle constant-velocity moving targets. Lyapunov techniques are utilized to show that the vehicle will converge to the desired circular formations. Additionally, cooperating vehicles are shown to converge to a circular formation with equal temporal spacing using each vehicle’s estimate of the target’s velocity to define a common reference frame.

  abstract     = {This study presents an optimal control framework that designs an optimal trajectory while additionally accounting for the stability of a path-deviation error controller that is dependent on the states provided by the optimal trajectory. Thus, instead of designing the controller independent of the trajectory, the stability is enforced as part of the optimization constraints in connection with the optimal trajectory it should follow. This allows to trade off controller and trajectory optimally and thus permits an improved exploitation of the system capabilities. To achieve this goal, the classic trajectory optimization problem formulation is augmented by stability constraints and feedback gains, with the latter being used as optimization parameters. These stabilize the path-following error dynamics by means of gain scheduling and enforce desired response characteristics. Here, the response is shaped, for once, by enforcing limits on the position of the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues as well as by limiting their sensitivity. Especially the latter is a way of robustifying the feedback controller in the time domain. The applicability of the proposed method is shown in an aviation-related scenario by solving a missile guidance problem.},

  abstract     = {This paper demonstrates the extension of the harmonic decomposition methodology, originally developed for rotorcraft applications, to the study of the nonlinear time-periodic dynamics of flapping-wing flight. A harmonic balance algorithm based on harmonic decomposition is applied to find the periodic equilibrium and approximate linear time-invariant dynamics about that equilibrium of the vertical and longitudinal dynamics of a hawk moth. These approximate linearized models are validated through simulations against the original nonlinear time-periodic dynamics. Dynamic stability using the linear models is assessed and compared to that predicted using the averaged dynamics. In addition, modal participation factors are computed to quantify the influence of the higher harmonics on the flight dynamic modes of motion. The study shows that higher harmonics play a key role in the dynamics of flapping-wing flight, inducing a vibrational stabilization mechanism that increases the pitch damping and stiffness while reducing the speed stability. This results in stabilization of the pitch oscillation mode and thus of the longitudinal hovering cubic. In addition, the proposed methodology is used to derive open- and closed-loop control laws for attenuating arbitrary state harmonics and to enhance the dynamic response characteristics.},

The result is a guidance algorithm in the form of a linear combination of (augmented) proportional navigation guidance terms with time-varying weights. Effectively, this is a one-against-many guidance law.

  abstract     = {A robot with large-degree-of-freedom joints is a promising future space robot capable of adapting to various environments and can perform dexterous tasks with multiple manipulators. The attitude dynamics of a free-flying robot shows nonholonomy, which enables the robot to reorient its attitude by moving its body. However, previous studies were not generally able to handle the nonholonomy, especially for robots with large degrees of freedom of joints. In the present study, we analytically investigate a maneuver in which joints are actuated along a parallelogram trajectory in joint angle space and propose an analytical path modification method in joint angle space in order to achieve the target attitude. Parallelogram actuation guarantees that the body configuration is returned to the initial state after one set of maneuvers, and thus the attitude of the robot is independently reoriented to the target maintaining the body configuration. The analytical solution is provided by applying Magnus expansion to the kinematics equation of rotational matrices, and its Lie group structure contributes to concise mathematical expressions. In addition, the analytical solution does not cause numerical difficulties, such as combinatorial explosion, and so can fully make use of the reorientation ability of a robot with large degrees of freedom.},

  abstract     = {Planetary protection in trajectory design aims to assess the impact probability of space-mission-disposed objects based on their initial uncertain conditions, to avoid contaminating other planetary environments. High-precision dynamic models and propagation methods are required to reach high confidence levels on small estimated impact probabilities. These requirements have so far confined planetary protection analyses to robust Monte Carlo–based approaches, using the Cartesian formulation of the full force problem dynamics. This work presents the improvements brought by adopting the Kustaanheimo–Stiefel (KS) formulation of the dynamics. The KS formulation is combined with reference frame switch procedures and adaptive nondimensionalization upon detection of close encounters. The fibration property of the KS space, namely, the parameterizable locus of point arising when mapping to a higher-dimensional space, is exploited to minimize the computational time, because of the minimized numerical stiffness of the system. Impact probability estimation tasks become more efficient than the single-simulation case, since the regularization of the dynamics removes the singularity of gravitational potentials for distances approaching zero. Despite an almost halved computational burden for Monte Carlo analysis, the precision of the single simulations is increased by nearly one order of magnitude, setting a new performance benchmark for planetary protection tasks.},

This paper presents a multi-objective hidden genes genetic algorithm (MOHGGA) for trajectory optimization. The length of the chromosome is selected large enough to enable modeling a given maximum number of swing-bys and maximum number of deep space maneuvers (DSMs). Binary tags are appended to those genes that control the swing-bys and DSMs. These binary tags are used to remove/add swing-bys and DSMs to a trajectory solution, and hence enable optimization among solutions of different sizes (different topologies). The MOHGGA generates Pareto fronts that have solutions of, in general, different number of swing-bys, swing-by planets, launch and arrival dates, and number of DSMs. Two objectives are considered in this paper: the total mission cost and total time of flight. An elitist nondominated sorting genetic algorithm is used. Local optimization is conducted on one objective function, holding the other objective function constant, to further improve the resulting Pareto front. Numerical results of four benchmark test cases for missions to Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Mercury are presented. The results demonstrate the capability of MOHGGA in searching for optimal trajectory topologies while optimizing two objectives.},

The “virtual swarm” optimization technique developed here simultaneously optimizes the nominal spacecraft trajectory along with many recovery trajectories. The objective can be to maximize the MTRM of the nominal trajectory at its weakest point or to constrain the worst-case MTRM to be at or above a desired level while optimizing a different value (e.g., mass, time of flight). The technique is demonstrated for a direct Earth–Mars transfer and for a gravity assist trajectory to the asteroid Psyche. Further, a method for finding the Pareto front of MTRM, arrival mass, and arrival date is presented to address the related multi-objective optimization problem.},

  abstract     = {Aiming at de-tumbling a non-cooperative space target safely and efficiently, an eddy brake approach utilizing multiple high-temperature superconducting (HTS) coils is proposed in this paper. The configuration design criteria of HTS coil are constructed first to guarantee the validity of the eddy brake method. Then, considering that each HTS coil is mounted on a servicing satellite, the desired position and attitude of each servicing satellite is calculated to meet the design criteria. Next, the eddy brake process is analyzed, where how to generate and keep the desired magnetic field is considered, and then the angular velocity decay process of the target is presented. Concretely, a nonlinear control law utilizing the consensus theory is adopted to achieve and keep the desired formation of the multi-satellite system. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to testify the proposed method using different number servicing satellites, and the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Navigation in Global Positioning System–denied environments is notoriously difficult for small unmanned aerial vehicles due to reduction of visible satellites and urban canyon multipath interference. Several existing methods can be used for navigating in a constrained environment, but they often require additional specific sensing hardware for a localization solution or only provide local frame navigation. Autonomous systems often include LiDAR and RGB cameras for mapping, sensing, or obstacle avoidance. Utilizing these sensors for navigation could provide the only or complimentary localization solutions to other Global Positioning System–denied localization methods in a global or local frame, especially in urban canyons where unique landmarks can be identified. Information from scanning LiDAR can be correlated with camera pixel coordinates and used to range unique visual landmarks that have known locations. The present work included surface function fitting to reduce ranging error to spherical landmarks since multiple lasers were able to range each landmark. Simulation and experimental validation of the unique camera–LiDAR modified trilateration process was undertaken using colored light orbs as landmarks with a 16-laser scanning LiDAR and known positions. Position error was computed and verified that the position estimate process was successful at varying landmark configurations and viewing angles in simulation. Experimental results verified the process while also providing higher accuracy than a previous method of using a single point on landmark surfaces, for the tested setup.},

  abstract     = {Inspection or mapping of a target spacecraft in a low Earth orbit using multiple observer spacecraft in stable passive relative orbits (PROs) is a key enabling technology for future space missions. Our guidance and control architecture uses an information gain approach to directly consider the tradeoff between gathered data and fuel/energy cost. The architecture has four components: information estimation, spacecraft’s absolute and relative state estimation, motion planning for relative orbit initialization and reconfiguration, and relative orbit control. The information estimation quantifies the information gain during inspection of a spacecraft, given past and potential future poses of all spacecraft. The estimated information gain is a crucial input to the motion planner, which computes PROs and reconfiguration strategies for each observer to maximize the information gain from distributed observations of the target spacecraft. The resulting motion trajectories jointly consider observational coverage of the target spacecraft and fuel/energy cost. For the PRO trajectories, a fuel-optimal attitude trajectory that minimizes rest-to-rest energy for each observer to inspect the target spacecraft is designed. The validation on a mission simulation to visually inspect the target spacecraft and on a three-degree-of-freedom robotic spacecraft dynamics simulator testbed demonstrates the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.},

The proposed guidance solution is compared with classical approaches and it is shown to take advantage of the characteristics of the natural dynamics of the relative motion to outperform them. In addition, the impact of different input sampling exploration strategies is explored to propose a simple and more robust approach based on subset simulation.},

The first method finds the that ensures that the component of the velocity vector is zero at a plane crossing, whereas the Floquet mode approach finds the that cancels the unstable mode in the Floquet reference frame.

This region is the Minkowski sum of the projections of the objects’ shapes onto the collision plane. The integration is the only step that cannot be done analytically. When the position probability densities are Gaussians, a very fast and accurate algorithm found in the literature can be applied after several transformations have been performed to the integration region.

In support of maximizing LISA’s scientific return, this paper presents an on-orbit excitation and estimation strategy for tilt-to-length coupling noise, a fundamental limitation of the detection sensitivity of spaceborne long-arm interferometers. Tilt-to-length coupling describes the distortion of measurements through the relative attitude jitter of the spacecraft. In operation, inevitable instrument imperfections and misalignments will cause the effect to scale proportionally with the jitter strength, the proportionality factor being referred to as the tilt-to-length coupling factor. For the first time, analytical equations are derived modeling the impact of tilt-to-length coupling on the scientific observations. These equations are shown to define the optimal on-orbit excitation needed to estimate this noise source, enabling the correction of the recorded gravitational wave signals and achievement of LISA’s required detection sensitivity.},

The novel approach uses belief Markov decision processes to reformulate the control problem in terms of uncertainty distributions, called beliefs, rather than the realizations of the system states. This formulation leads to the definition of a belief optimal control problem where the cost function and constraints are functions of the uncertainty distributions. The control formulation encompasses orbit determination arcs as well. The belief optimization is solved with a shooting-like transcription and a nonlinear programming solver to optimize the resulting discretized problem. Both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties are propagated with a nonintrusive polynomial expansion to capture the nonlinearities of the dynamics. Finally, this new approach is applied to the robust optimization of a flyby trajectory of the Europa Clipper mission in a scenario characterized by knowledge, execution, and observation uncertainty.},

A practical identification strategy is presented in this contribution, a procedure that can be easily executed during field trials and that is able to obtain a rapid assessment about the characteristics of the vehicle dynamic model. The developed procedure is designed for small-size-class remotely operated vehicles, characterized by low operative speeds. The vehicle is equipped with proprioceptive sensors in charge of measuring data needed to identify its dynamic model. Building on the proposed practical identification experiments, different vehicle propulsion models are considered and analyzed: the first is a general theoretical model accounting for the vehicle hydrodynamics (standard marine Fossen model); the others are modified models introducing additional terms in the produced thrust (torque), namely, a term proportional to the rate of change of the propeller revolutions per minute (r.p.m.), (where is the revolution rate of the propeller), and a delayed copy of the terms connected to the fluid axial flow velocity. For all considered degrees of freedom, the fitting performance of the proposed models resulted to be superior to the first. Moreover, a control system building on the obtained dynamic characterization is described.},

  abstract     = {Small uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) capable of stable, controlled stalled descent offer the possibility for a wider operating envelope and for precise, steep approaches and landings. However, the aerodynamics of stalled flight are inherently complex and underexplored compared to flight regimes with attached flow. This paper presents a number of advancements in these areas—particularly focusing on pressure sensors for estimating flow states. This paper presents a modular, open-source design for in-wing, flow-based differential pressure sensor arrays for estimating flow states without the requirement of fragile pitot tubes or airflow vanes. An extensive, publicly available set of wind tunnel and flight test results from a small UAV with 24 in-wing pressure sensors is provided. The data contain a wide range of incidence angles, including deep stalled states. This paper also presents data-driven regression models for predicting airflow angles and airspeed using only pressure information. Our results demonstrate predictions for airspeed, angle of attack (AoA), and angle of slip (AoS) with root mean square error (RMSE) of , 0.20°, and 2.83°, respectively, using wind tunnel data and all 24 sensors. Finally, this paper provides a placement analysis to determine the optimal sensor locations for estimating airflow data with fewer pressure sensors. Models trained and validated with real flight data show airspeed, AoA, and AoS predictions with RMSE of , 1.54°, and 4.07°, respectively, using data from only three pressure sensors each.},

  abstract     = {A waypoint-based trajectory planning framework is proposed. The motivation is to allocate capacity-constrained airspace resources for pretactical safe separation in the manned and unmanned aircraft integrated airspace. First, the spatial-temporal related aircraft with high conflict risks are clustered to reduce the scale of the problem induced by increasing traffic volumes. A two-stage optimization is further implemented. In the first stage, trajectories within each group are sequentially planned in order determined by a priority ranking mechanism, where the relative conflict-critical aircraft takes more deconflicting responsibilities. A distributed decision-making architecture is developed to account for aircraft heterogeneity in the sequential deconflicting process. In the second stage, the high-quality solutions of different groups are coupled together to obtain the overall trajectory distribution under system-wide resource capacity constraints. Empirical studies using operational data in China show that the proposed method reduces 95\% of conflicts with low cost and few aircraft disturbance, which demonstrate superiority in deconflicting effectiveness and efficiency. In addition, the distributed decision-making process ensures scalability and flexibility by allowing aircraft to determine the optimal trajectories based on their internal tradeoffs. Several major conclusions and future work are presented based on the current investigation.},

  abstract     = {The problem of optimal trajectory planning with nonconvex collision avoidance constraints is discussed in this paper. The trajectory planning algorithm aims to generate a feasible trajectory with specified performance indexes to reduce collisions of aerospace vehicles in the presence of second-order smooth obstacles. The algorithm design that manages such mission scenarios is challenging because of the stringent avoidance constraints of various nonconvex types, especially considering the requirements of efficient computation. This problem is addressed within the sequential convex programming (SCP) framework by utilizing the characteristics of saturation functions. The introduction of the saturation function is found to significantly improve the convergence of the SCP algorithm by overcoming the drawbacks of potential interruptions from the iteration process and controlling the search directions for successive solutions. Theoretical analyses are performed to guarantee that the original constraints are satisfied and to ensure the iterative solution searches in the directions of the true optimal solution. Under multiple randomly generated test environments, the applications of the proposed approach in highly constrained aircraft path planning problems and spacecraft rendezvous operations are numerically simulated by comparing two representative conventional SCP-based methods to demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and convergence of the proposed methodology.},

This is the injection-constrained state-estimation problem, where the injection of the output error is constrained to a specified subspace of the state space. Unlike full-state output-error injection, which is the dual of static full-state feedback, constrained output-error injection is the dual of static output feedback. To address the injection-constrained state-estimation problem, this paper develops the injection-constrained unscented Kalman filter (IC-UKF) and the injection-constrained retrospective cost filter (IC-RCF). The performance of these filters is evaluated numerically for linear and nonlinear state-estimation problems in order to compare their accuracy and determine their suboptimality relative to full-state output-error injection. As a benchmark test case, IC-UKF and IC-RCF are applied to the viscous Burgers equation for state and parameter estimation.},

  abstract     = {Numerical solutions of flatness-based reformulation of optimal control problems lead to an optimization problem with fewer variables and constraints. However, the expressions for the states and controls in terms of the flat output variables can be highly nonlinear and complicated. Hence, this may lead to expensive function evaluations within the optimization problem, degradation of convexity, and issues with convergence. Thus, a flatness-based reformulation of the optimal control problems may not be a viable alternative for computational guidance and control. Alternatively, a novel flatness-based reduced Hessian sequential quadratic programming algorithm is developed in this paper to solve optimization problems for a six-degree-of-freedom aircraft. An analytical null space basis is derived from the linearized differential constraints, which leads to a reduced-dimensional quadratic program with the discretized flat outputs as decision variables. Unlike flatness-based reformulation of the optimal control problem, the null space/reduced Hessian method does not introduce additional nonlinearity and preserves the convexity of the optimization problem. A nonlinear model predictive control problem is solved to demonstrate the reduced Hessian algorithm. The algorithm is validated and Monte Carlo trials are performed to assess the effectiveness of the approach. Computational studies show that the current approach is faster than methods that directly exploit sparsity up to a factor of five.},

The rotors of the VPQ are assumed to be operating at the same nominal speed, and the thrust variation is achieved by means of variable-pitch actuation. Blade element theory along with momentum theory is used to calculate the thrust and torque as a function of thrust coefficients. The control is designed using a traditional outer and inner loop structure. The effect of unknown disturbances and parametric uncertainties are treated as external bounded disturbances, and this is handled using a robust control design known as a super twisting algorithm. The control design demands knowledge of the disturbance bounds. This work considers five different static control allocation methods, namely, a fixed point iteration, static optimization without yaw dynamics, static optimization with yaw dynamics, nonlinear least squares, and Newton–Raphson, that address the problem of the nonlinear relationship between forces and moments. The five control allocation methods are compared through numerical simulation. The robustness of the control design is also shown through numerical simulation. Furthermore, the inverted flight capability of the VPQ is demonstrated.},

Because both systems used virtually the same control system and aircraft, a comparison was performed to investigate how much of the autonomous maneuvering capability could be recovered using a partial-authority aircraft. This paper describes the control system, its performance, and how it was adapted to a partial-authority EH-60L Black Hawk helicopter. A partial-authority mixing method is described and it was used to integrate the autonomy system using frequency allocation to distribute the control commands to the high- and low-frequency actuation. Flight tests results are presented of the integrated system flying predefined maneuvers that ranged from precision hover maneuvers to moderately aggressive forward flight maneuvers. Results are also presented of the system navigating through mountainous terrain using a reactive obstacle-avoidance algorithm. Tracking performance, actuator usage, and stability results for both systems are shown. The comparison of the partial- and full-authority results showed that the partial-authority mixing system was effective by allowing the partial-authority system to achieve most of the full-authority performance as measured by path tracking error and actuator usage for several autonomous maneuvers.},

A novel real-time algorithm is proposed for selecting the angles of deflection of aerodynamic actuators providing the closest match to the control signal computed by a selected control law. The algorithm is based on a panel method for the computation of the aerodynamic coefficients and relies on approximate environmental parameters estimation and worst-case scenario assumptions for the re-emission properties of space materials. Discussion of results is performed by assuming two representative pointing maneuvers, for which momentum wheels and aerodynamic actuators are used synergistically. A quaternion feedback proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller implemented in discrete time is assumed to determine the control signal at a sampling frequency of 1 Hz. The outcome of a Monte Carlo analysis, performed for a wide range of orbital conditions, shows that the target attitude is successfully achieved for the vast majority of the cases, thus proving the robustness of the approach in the presence of environmental uncertainties and realistic attitude hardware limitations.},

The use of a variable planning horizon is proposed in order to construct an appropriate maneuver plan, within an optimization-based framework. The involved optimization problem is nonconvex and features nonlinear constraints. The main contribution is to show that such problem can be tackled effectively by solving a finite number of linear programs. To this aim, a specifically conceived horizon search algorithm is employed in combination with a polytopic constraint approximation technique. The resulting guidance scheme provides the ability to identify favorable docking configurations, by exploiting the time-varying nature of the optimization problem endpoint.

  abstract     = {This paper develops an integrated path planning and control framework for a specific problem of image-feature-based spacecraft rendezvous with an uncooperative target. For visibility concerns, the chasing spacecraft is required to approach and synchronize with the tumbling target, as well as to retain the target within the camera’s field of view. To this end, an offline path planner is designed by using the gradient of a so-called navigation function to generate a set of desired image trajectories. A novel formulation of the spacecraft relative dynamic model is presented based on current image features and the generated desired ones. To track the desired image trajectories, a robust image-based visual servoing controller is designed via passivity theorem. The stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed using the Lyapunov method. In addition, a hyperbolic tangent function is introduced to cope with the chattering phenomenon caused by the signum function. A scenario of rendezvousing with the defunct Envisat is demonstrated to validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed control scheme. Comparative studies with the conventional image-based and pose-based control schemes are performed through numerical simulations, in order to evaluate the target visibility, control accuracy, and fuel consumption under the proposed control scheme.},

The new point mascon models are intended to be low- to medium-resolution replacements for spherical harmonics models in mission planning applications or onboard flight software. The design space of how to parameterize the mascons is explored. The chosen configuration uses equally weighted point mass potentials and requires the successive solutions to thousands of nonlinear optimization problems that adjust the mascon locations. A database of models that vary in resolution is generated and disseminated as supplementary material, with the highest-fidelity model demonstrating equivalent accuracy and memory footprint to a spherical harmonics truncation. Gravitational acceleration and gravity gradient evaluation runtimes are roughly two to eight times faster for the new mascon models when compared with spherical harmonics models with equivalent error, depending on the model fidelity and the computational environment.},

Increasing operational flexibility and reducing the dependence on external infrastructure are key challenges for future unmanned aircraft. Usually, an aircraft performs the final approach on a straight line. This paper contributes a complete automatic landing controller capable of using three-dimensional curved approach paths all the way until touchdown. The controller consists of a nonlinear guidance law that steers the aircraft along a predefined spline path, various single-input–single-output control loops for rate and attitude control, and a robust multivariable flare controller. This flare controller ensures a three-point landing, i.e., simultaneous touchdown of all three wheels. Further, practical issues such as bumpless mode transfer and anti-windup compensation are considered. The controller is evaluated in multiple flight test experiments. Both the crabbed approach and the sideslip technique are demonstrated on several different approach paths, such as a steep curve and a helix. These paths are particularly challenging, because the flare maneuver is performed while the aircraft is in a turn. The controller is shown to reliably land the aircraft on an unpaved runway with high precision.},

To do so, a novel method is developed for creating a barrier function, which is similar to a Lyapunov function and can be used to ensure that a system can stay safe for all future times. After introducing the general approach, it is shown how to ensure that collision avoidance for two vehicles can be guaranteed for all future times. The construction is then extended to the case of arbitrarily many vehicles by addressing how to satisfy multiple safety objectives simultaneously. This is done while ensuring that output actuator commands are within specified limits. Because this formulation requires communication of control values and may therefore reduce throughput of other important messages, it is then shown how to reformulate the solution without this significant communication overhead while still ensuring that safety is maintained and actuator limits are respected. The theoretical developments of this paper are validated in the simulator SCRIMMAGE with a simulation of 20 UAVs that maintain safe distances from each other even though their nominal paths would otherwise cause a collision.},

First, the 2D cooperative guidance law is derived based on an optimal impact angle control guidance (IACG) law, which is augmented by a cooperative guidance term to ensure consensus of times-to-go in a fixed time before interception. To avoid singularity, an auxiliary function with three candidates is introduced into the cooperative guidance term. Then, coplanar cooperative guidance (CCG) and planar pursuit guidance (PPG) commands are, respectively, derived to construct the 3D cooperative guidance law. The CCG command is based on the coplanar assumption and the 2D cooperative guidance law, whereas the PPG command drives the velocity, line of sight (LOS), and desired impact vectors onto one engagement plane by geometric operations of vectors. Unlike existing 3D cooperative guidance laws, the proposed one does not require missile speed adjustment for salvo attack. The fixed-time stability and effectiveness of the proposed guidance laws are theoretically analyzed. The criteria for selecting all guidance parameters are provided to facilitate the guidance design. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to support the analytical findings.},

  abstract     = {Path planning in an uncertain environment is a key enabler of true vehicle autonomy. Over the past two decades, numerous approaches have been developed to account for errors in the vehicle path while navigating complex and often uncertain environments. An important capability of such planning is the prediction of vehicle dispersion covariances about a candidate path. This work develops a new closed-loop linear covariance (CL-LinCov) framework applicable to a wide range of autonomous system architectures. Important features of the developed framework include 1) separation of high-level guidance from low-level control; 2) support for output-feedback controllers with internal states, dynamics, and output; and 3) multi-use continuous sensors for navigation state propagation, guidance, and feedback control. The closed-loop nature of the framework preserves the important coupling between the system dynamics; exogenous disturbances; and the guidance, navigation, and control algorithms. The developed framework is applied to a simplified model of an unmanned aerial vehicle and validated by comparison via Monte Carlo analysis. The utility of the CL-LinCov information is illustrated by its application to path planning in a static, uncertain obstacle field via a modified version of the rapidly exploring random tree algorithm.},

  abstract     = {An energy depletion guidance algorithm for shallow, high-altitude atmospheric flight, consistent with aerobraking atmospheric passes, is proposed. The guidance algorithm is based on optimal control solutions to the energy minimization problem and uses variable drag area for trajectory control achieved through articulated solar panels. The algorithm includes three control modes to limit heat rate, heat load, or both while attempting to maximize energy depletion. A closed-form approximate solution of the equations of motion for aerobraking atmospheric passes is used to generate steering commands in real time. Numerical simulation of aerobraking at Mars illustrates the performance of the algorithm modes for a range of initial conditions. Results indicate that the guidance algorithm increases nominal energy depletion by approximately 1600\% relative to the uncontrolled case over a single aerobraking pass, equivalent to an increase in of approximately 1600\%. Monte Carlo simulation analyses show that dispersed flight performance is consistent with nominal performance; the standard deviation of the depleted energy is at maximum 13.8\% of the mean, and the maximum difference between the mean and the maximal energy depletion solution is lower than 1.4\%.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces an optimal trajectory planner for spacecraft rest-to-rest attitude transfers subject to input saturation, angular velocity, and nonconvex exclusion cone constraints. The proposed solution adapts the Projection-Operator-Based Newton’s Method for Trajectory Optimization (PRONTO) to address the nonlinearity of the unit quaternion manifold. The system constraints are then handled using a modified interior point method designed to remain applicable when an intermediate solution estimate is infeasible. Through an extensive numerical study, the proposed solution is compared with a state-of-the-art commercial solver, its computational efficiency is demonstrated, and its unique ability to provide feasible intermediate solutions is highlighted. These results strongly indicate PRONTO as a suitable real-time optimal maneuver planner for spacecraft attitude control.},

  abstract     = {In space missions, numerical techniques for minimizing the fuel consumption of spacecraft using low-thrust propulsion are desirable. Among various nonlinear optimization methods, convex optimization has been attracting attention because it allows optimal solutions to emerge robustly and requires short computation times. In particular, trajectory design in the three-body problem near the Lagrange points involves instability and nonlinearity. Hence, this study considers the application of convex optimization to trajectory design with low-thrust propulsion in cislunar space and verifies that this technique performs well, even for sensitive and highly nonlinear dynamics. Specifically, the convex optimization scheme is applied in the transfer from a halo orbit to a near-rectilinear halo orbit where both are periodic as defined in the circular restricted three-body problem. As a further step, the transfer problem is transitioned to an ephemeris model. In addition, extensive investigations of the dependence on various parameters used in convex optimization are conducted, and a trajectory corrections maneuver method is constructed combined with the convex optimization process. This investigation provides valuable insight into the convex optimization technique in the three-body problem and facilitates the estimation of low-thrust trajectory designs for complex space missions.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an analytical library for maneuvering of an underactuated spacecraft around a central target with application to remote inspection. Free-flying small spacecraft are an attractive option for in situ remote inspection but require maneuvering strategies that are computationally simple, such that they can be implemented on a small spacecraft computer, while still allowing for constraints like plume impingement and underactuation to be included. An analytical maneuver library provides a suboptimal solution but can be computed without the need for numerical optimization. In addition, the low fuel cost of maneuvers means that the degree of suboptimality of the analytical maneuvers is marginal. To develop the library, forced circular motion is used in order to place the spacecraft in a controllable state such that external disturbances can be rejected. From there, trajectories can be designed in order to manipulate the circular motion and accomplish maneuvers such as joining the circular motion from rest or changing the circle’s radius. Conditions under which plume impingement is guaranteed to be avoided are developed, and applications of the maneuver library to point-to-point maneuvering and landing on/docking to a rotating target are shown.},

The proposed strategy can be applied to both the impact time control and the impact time and angle control guidance problems. Furthermore, it does not require any forms of time-to-go estimation, numerical iterations, and linearization procedures. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness, robustness, and energy efficiency of the proposed guidance strategy in comparison with other existing guidance strategies.},

The coefficients of the polynomial are obtained by satisfying the boundary conditions on the look angle, at the launch and impact points together with imposing the respective field-of-view constraints of the midcourse and terminal phase seekers. Analytical conditions are derived among design parameters to achieve a strictly decreasing look-angle variation with range. Further analysis is carried out showing that the guidance law achieves a reducing acceleration demand in the terminal phase as well as a zero acceleration demand at the impact point.

This is accomplished using a constant-thrust bilinear tangent guidance law in conjunction with an optimal Lambert algorithm and a Newton–Raphson predictor–corrector targeting scheme. This simple approach is capable of planning a plethora of different free-time and fixed-time single-burn, burn–coast intercept, or burn–coast–burn bilinear tangent maneuvers from an initial state/orbit to a desired state/orbit. For the study case of asteroid Bennu, when used with thrust levels that are greater than 5\% of the surface acceleration of asteroid Bennu, the CTMT algorithm is able to converge on 99\% of orbital transfers initiated from a circular, 1.5 km, terminator orbit. Furthermore, many of the continuous-thrust maneuvers calculated by the CTMT algorithm are the optimal constant-thrust trajectories between two states in the small-body dynamical environment, and they are able to be calculated hundreds of times faster with the CTMT algorithm than with state-of-the-art nonlinear optimization algorithms. Ultimately, the CTMT algorithm shows promise as a candidate for future autonomous guidance applications.},

The proposal distribution is constructed by running a parallel unscented Kalman filter to drive particles in regions of high expected likelihood and achieve a high effective sample size. The bounds are then computed by an inexpensive tuning of the importance weights via numerical optimization. A Branch &amp; Bound algorithm over simplexes with a Lipschitz bounding function is employed to achieve guaranteed convergence to the lower and upper bounds in a finite number of steps.

The problem is nonconvex. A philosophically new perspective is introduced to take advantage of modern convex optimization. Through a novel analysis the NMC problem is shown to be equivalent to a two-dimensional constrained optimization problem. This conceptually simpler interpretation enables two numerical approaches to be investigated, one based on convex relaxation and the other linearization-projection. It is established that while each approach is able to lead to the solution to the NMC-injection problem in a subset of the possible cases, their domains of applicability complement each other to cover all possible cases. A hybrid algorithm is designed that combines the strengths of the two approaches and enables the application of convex optimization to solve the NMC-injection problem in all cases where the solution exists, without the need for any user-supplied parameters or initial guesses. The effectiveness of the hybrid algorithm is demonstrated in finding the numerical solutions to the NMC problem reliably and rapidly.},

  abstract     = {A novel robust path-following flight controller for multiple quadrotors carrying a slung payload is proposed. The payload is manipulated by a group of quadrotors with cables so that every agent shares the payload weight. The system is decomposed into the payload subsystem and the quadrotor attitude subsystems. The controller is hierarchical. The outer loop is a robust path-following controller that stabilizes the payload subsystem. An uncertainty and disturbance estimator is designed to estimate and eliminate the disturbances. The inner loop is an attitude tracker implemented on each quadrotor that follows the target attitude generated by the outer-loop controller. The overall stability of the complete system is shown using the Lyapunov method. Simulations and flight demonstrations show that the controller can stabilize the slung load according to the given path command under exogenous disturbances.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a positionable rotor structure for a quadcopter allowing each of its rotors to be positioned independently in a finite course and in forward and backward movement to increase robustness against disturbances such as wind. At first, the quadrotor motion dynamics are analyzed, and its dynamic model is derived by calculating translational and angular momenta. A hybrid controller with dual interconnected units is designed to achieve acceptable performance. The primary unit determines the common quadruplet control inputs of the quadrotor by an adaptive finite-time sliding-mode algorithm for all the translational and rotational degrees of freedom. The secondary unit uses primary controller outputs to specify each rotor’s suitable position to enhance the drone performance and robustness. Some correction steps are used to calculate more feasible rotor positions. Besides showing the proposed control system’s performance, simulations verify the effectiveness of rotor positioning on the quadrotor stability in harsh conditions. For the case study, up to 70\% increase in the capacity of disturbance rejection and an over 30\% reduction in power consumption compared to conventional drones are observed.},

The stability analysis of the multi-agent system, which is based on the generalized Nyquist theorem, is converted to finding a minimum gain positive definite Hermitian perturbation and a minimum phase unitary perturbation in the feedback path of the loop transfer function. Further, this paper provides a framework to compute the input delay margin of the multi-agent system based on the phase perturbation of the loop transfer function. Specifically, two constrained minimization problems are solved to calculate the gain, phase, and input delay margins of the multi-agent system. Necessary and sufficient conditions concerning the stability of the multi-agent system independent of gain and phase perturbations and input delay are also stated. The theoretical results are then applied to compute the gain, phase, and input delay margin of a cooperative system wherein each agent is an unmanned F-16 VISTA aircraft with short-period dynamics.},

Each candidate extremal from Pontryagin’s maximum principle is embedded into a parameterized family of extremals, and two no-fold conditions for the projection of the parameterized family onto state space to be a diffeomorphism are devised. By the theory of field of extremals, the no-fold conditions are related to the classical second-order conditions for the absence of conjugate points or focal points. Thus, the no-fold conditions are sufficient to ensure the candidate extremal to be locally optimal if the initial state is fixed. When the initial state is not fixed but lies on a manifold, an additional second-order optimality condition involving the geometry of the initial constraint manifold is established. A numerical procedure for testing all the second-order conditions is presented, allowing to check the optimum of each candidate extremal. Finally, three fuel-optimal orbital transfer problems in the Earth–moon–spacecraft system are computed, demonstrating and verifying the developments of the paper.},

An analytical method is proposed to estimate the optimal velocity increment of a multirevolution impulsive transfer, taking account of the perturbation. First, for a phasing problem where the differences in semimajor axis, inclination, ascending node, and argument of latitude at the termination of the transfer are eliminated, two linear equations derived from the first-order necessary conditions are solved to determine the normal components of the impulses. Then, the radial and tangential components of the impulses are determined by solving another two linear equations, thereby eliminating the difference in the eccentricity vector. In a classical debris removal scenario, the proposed method shows better accuracy than previous analytical methods and even a method based on a deep neural network. The computational efficiency of the method is also much higher than that of the existing semi-analytical method. In addition, the estimated transfer process is in good agreement with the exact one in some cases, and so the method shows potential for preliminary designs of impulsive trajectories.},

The complete six-degree-of-freedom formulation of the Udwadia–Kalaba-based pose tracking controller generating exact real-time control forces and torques is presented. For design purposes, the method assumes a precise knowledge of the system parameters and states, along with perfect control action by the actuators. The exponential convergence of the constraint dynamics is proven using the Lyapunov stability theory. Simulation results demonstrate exponentially stable position and orientation tracking for close-proximity operations in perturbed low Earth orbits.

  abstract     = {Electromagnetic formation flight (EMFF) uses the electromagnetic force to control the relative positions of multiple satellites without using conventional fuel-based propulsion. To compensate for the electromagnetic torque generated alongside the electromagnetic force, in most previous studies, all satellites were assumed to have reaction wheels (RWs) besides electromagnetic coils. However, the RW-loaded angular momentum becomes nonuniformly distributed among the satellites, because the electromagnetic torque usually differs between satellites. Without a proper control scheme, this deviation increases over time, and the RWs become saturated quickly, preventing the attitudes of the satellites from being controlled. In this study, a new controller is proposed that enables the electromagnetic force and torque to be controlled simultaneously. The EMFF kinematics derived from the conservation of angular momentum are used for the controller design. This controller can control satellites without saturating the RWs, and only one set of RWs is required among all satellites. The combination of the proposed controller with a simple unloading control exclusive to the chief satellite results in the elimination of the accumulation of angular momentum in the entire system. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated through numerical simulations of the formation maintenance and formation reconfiguration of a five-satellite system.},

The orbiting probe relies on optical and laser navigation while attitude measurements are provided by star trackers and gyroscopes. The asteroid gravity field inhomogeneities are assumed to be unknown a priori. The state and gravity model parameters are estimated simultaneously using an unscented Kalman filter. The proposed gravity model identification enables the application of a learning-based predictive control methodology. The predictive control allows for a high degree of accuracy because the predicted model is progressively identified in situ. Consequently, the tracking errors decrease over time as the model accuracy increases. Finally, a constellation mission concept is analyzed in order to speed up the model identification process.

  abstract     = {This paper develops a global and general characterization of the gravity field around small celestial bodies, which commonly have heterogeneous mass distributions. The availability of such a characterization is important in providing guidance for close-proximity exploration missions, rover deployments, and dynamic studies. The determination of the gravitational potential is formulated as a boundary value problem for Laplace’s equation, which can be solved using the boundary element method. To address the near-singularity arising from the fundamental solution, a semi-analytic form of the boundary integral with an adaptive collocation strategy is derived, and the virtual boundary method (VBM) is incorporated. The existence and uniqueness of the analytic continuation of gravitational potential inside the small body are proved by investigating the convergence of arbitrary derivatives on the boundary, which serves as the necessary condition of the application of VBM. Furthermore, the well-posed nature of the boundary integral equation expressed as a single-layer representation on the virtual boundary is proved using the Lax–Milgram theorem, which guarantees the robustness of VBM. Simulations conducted on comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko and asteroids (216) Kleopatra and (433) Eros demonstrate the ability of the proposed characterization to provide a global high-fidelity gravity field.},

Two chaotic oscillatory systems as well as the well-known problem of identifying the central force field from position-only observation data are considered to validate the developed approach. The simulation results considered in the paper demonstrate the performance of the developed approach in learning unknown nonlinear system dynamics accurately with fewer basis functions as compared with classical least-squares regression techniques and emerging deep learning approaches.

  abstract     = {Spacecraft swarms can achieve mission objectives otherwise impossible by monolithic satellites. To this end, swarms need to autonomously reconfigure their relative motion while complying with spacecraft constraints. Convex optimization provides safety and efficiency for arbitrary reconfigurations at high computational cost. Comparatively, closed-form solutions are computationally efficient but do not guarantee optimality and compliance to constraints in general cases. This work proposes a novel control architecture with Lyapunov functions and artificial potentials based on relative orbit elements that promise the numerical efficiency of closed-form solutions and the general applicability of convex optimization solvers. The novel Lyapunov functions are designed using analytical lower bounds calculated using the current control tracking errors. When the functions are used with a feedback control scheme modeled after the optimal, closed-form solutions for binary system reconfiguration, the resulting controller is both computationally and efficient. To address safety and state constraints in general, reference governors based on artificial potential functions enable computationally efficient collision avoidance using only neighbor state information. The controllers are validated in example mission simulations representative of Starling-1 and the Van Allen Swarm. In these missions, the controllers demonstrate safe, -efficient, and computationally tractable swarm reconfiguration, enabling future swarming missions.},

The iteration variable is fit using the new transformations and customized tree data structures, leading to a single 1-megabyte coefficient file. The interpolated initial guess seeds a root-solver that typically converges in 1–2 iterations. The new vercosine formulation solver is rigorously tested across the complete domain. Compared to Gooding’s state-of-the-art method, the solver is 1.7–2.5 times faster and maintains accuracy even for the so-called ultra-revolution problem. First- and second-order sensitivities of the output terminal velocities with respect to the input flight time and terminal positions are derived via a general method for differentiating a root-solved process. The new sensitivity expressions are exact and 6–17 times faster to compute than finite difference approximations. The new quadratic model of the Lambert problem solution results from an optional postprocessing step and is useful for a variety of estimation and optimization applications.},

A discrete feedback control method using this orbit representation that can be used to autonomously maneuver to arbitrary target orbits is designed. Full rendezvous is accomplished in two distinct phases: orbit matching and a phasing maneuver, which match the five-degree-of-freedom orbit and along-track position, respectively. Once within a short distance of the target position, the spacecraft could enter a close-proximity mode if higher precision is required, such as for docking. The method is verified in simulations, and the usage is compared to two-impulse transfer and rendezvous and continuous low-thrust trajectories. Effects of perturbations are also examined quantitatively. The developed control method is shown to give similar expenditure to unbounded impulsive maneuvers while being applicable to arbitrary orbits, as it avoids singularities or linearizing the dynamics. It is usable by small spacecraft using infrequent, impulsive actuation, which may improve the feasibility and robustness of small spacecraft missions.},

The concept of the bouncing return trajectory is proposed, which takes off and lands at the same point on the asteroid surface. The spin rate of a spherical lander is controlled before each impact to change its postimpact velocity so that it can be driven into the bouncing return trajectory and remains in the vicinity of its original landing site until it finally rests on the surface. First, the properties of bouncing return trajectories are investigated based on a spherical model. Based on the contact dynamics, the analytical solution of the required spin rate to change velocity is derived. Next, candidate deployment trajectories of the proposed method are studied under different asteroid parameters. Finally, the feasibility and robustness of the method are verified using a model of the asteroid Bennu. It is found that the proposed deployment method can achieve a precise landing if the surface environment is ascertained and largely reduce the landing dispersion under an uncertain environment. This paper provides a novel idea for future asteroid lander deployment and surface exploration missions.},

Each component of the position vector is approximated using a finite Fourier series as a function of time; these approximations are then used to design a trajectory that satisfies the equations of motion and the constraints, at discrete points, as well as the problem boundary conditions. The R-FFS method leverages the three-body problem characteristics to achieve all the required plane change without the use of propulsion. The trajectory is divided into phases: escape, intermediate, and capture. The escape phase is further divided into segments. The phase of the trajectory near the L1 Lagrange point is designed first and is always a thrust-free phase. This thrust-free phase is optimized to achieve the required plane change, enabling planar trajectories in the other phases. The initial guess needed by the solver, in the escape and capture phases, is generated using an analytic approximation developed in this paper. The numerical results show that the R-FFS can generate three-dimensional transfers to high lunar orbits, low lunar orbits, and halo orbits, while meeting constraints on the maximum thrust level of the engine.},

Ideally, such uncertainty and associated risks must be properly quantified and taken into account in the process of trajectory design, ensuring a sufficiently low risk of causing hazardous events. To bridge the gap between the ideal goal and current practice in mission design, this paper extends Lawden’s primer vector theory and develops a solution method to solve the problem of low-thrust trajectory optimization under state uncertainty. The new primer vector, termed stochastic primer vector, provides an analytical open-loop optimal control law that respects a probabilistic path constraint with a user-specified confidence level (chance constraint). A numerical aspect of the indirect method is also extended by introducing a smoothing approach across constraint corner discontinuities, enabling efficient solution methods for constrained optimal control problems. The validity and effectiveness of the theoretical development are demonstrated with two numerical examples, which clarify the behavior of chance-constrained optimal low-thrust trajectories and confirm through Monte Carlo simulations that the designed trajectories indeed satisfy the imposed constraints under uncertainty with the prescribed confidence level.},

A state-space model of the flexible aircraft is obtained by means of an aeroelastic computation and system identification from frequency data. The controllers’ performance is evaluated through their capability to reduce shear force, bending, and torsion moments on different locations of the aircraft in response to different types of discrete gusts and continuous turbulence; the constraints of the sensors and the actuators are taken into account. The gain in performance due to the use of lidar is assessed, and a tradeoff is discussed concerning the optimal measurement distance. Finally, the closed-loop robustness is assessed by simulations where different types of uncertainties are applied to the system.},

Because the position kinematics are not influenced by model uncertainties, the nonlinear dynamic inversion control is applied. On the contrary, the flight path dynamics are perturbed by both model uncertainties and atmospheric disturbances; thus the incremental sliding mode control is adopted. Lyapunov-based analyses show that this method can simultaneously reduce the model dependency and the minimum possible gains of conventional sliding mode control methods. Moreover, the attitude dynamics are in the strict-feedback form; thus the incremental backstepping sliding mode control is implemented. Furthermore, a novel load reference generator is designed to distinguish the necessary loads for performing maneuvers from the excessive loads. The load references are realized by the inner-loop optimal wing controller, whereas the excessive loads are naturalized by flaps without influencing the outer-loop tracking performance. The merits of the proposed control architecture are verified by trajectory tracking tasks in spatial von Kármán turbulence fields.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes a novel time-delayed control scheme for suppressing the body-freedom flutter of a flexible flying-wing drone and verifies its robustness. The simple formulation and strong robustness of the proposed control scheme are of particular interest. The procedure of designing the proposed delayed controller includes the following three steps. First, the displacement and velocity signals from the wingtip are taken as the input signals to delayed feedback, and the ailerons are used as the control inputs. The proportional gain, derivative gain, and specific value of a time delay are taken as control parameters. Second, the proportional and derivative gains are determined by checking the stable region for various time delays. Finally, a single time delay is determined according to both the critical stability condition and the stability margins. The stability and robustness of the closed-loop system are analyzed in time domain and frequency domain. The numerical results demonstrate that the flutter boundary of the flexible flying-wing drone can be expanded by up to 35\% while retaining strong robustness via the proposed delayed controller.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes a frequency-domain method for the identification of multi-input control equivalent turbulence input models. Such models can be identified from flight data gathered in specific turbulent environments, such as behind a ship or near a rooftop vertiport, and used to accurately simulate an aircraft’s response to turbulence. Identification of control equivalent turbulence input models has previously been done in the frequency domain for single-input/single-output applications or using a two-step time- and frequency-domain approach for multi-input/multi-output applications. In this paper, the frequency-domain approach is extended to account for the possible correlation between the measured control inputs and aircraft states (when flight data are collected closed loop) and to handle multi-input/multi-output applications. Several simulation examples are provided that demonstrate that known turbulence models can be accurately identified, for both open- and closed-loop simulations. The results validate the multi-input control equivalent turbulence input model frequency-domain identification approach proposed in this paper.},

  abstract     = {Flight test maneuvers and dynamic modeling techniques were developed for determining aircraft moments of inertia from flight test data. Full nonlinear rigid-body rotational equations of motion were used in the analysis, with aerodynamic moment dependencies modeled by linear expansions in the aircraft states and controls. Aerodynamic parameters were estimated simultaneously with inertia parameters using equation-error modeling applied to flight test data from maneuvers designed specifically for this problem. The approach was demonstrated using a nonlinear F-16 simulation, then applied to a remotely piloted subscale aircraft flight test. Errors in the aircraft moment of inertia parameters determined from simulated F-16 flight test data were less than 6\% compared to the true values in the simulation. Flight test results for the subscale aircraft were within 6\% of ground-test values obtained using the same aircraft.},
