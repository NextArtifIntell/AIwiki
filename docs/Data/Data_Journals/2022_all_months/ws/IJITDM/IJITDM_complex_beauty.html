  abstract     = {In many real-world situations, the cost and revenue performance of heterogeneous decision making units (DMUs) should be assessed while uncertain data are presented. The exiting data envelopment analysis (DEA) models have dealt with the economic efficiency of nonhomogenous DMUs without considering random performance measures. In this paper, a stochastic DEA approach is, therefore, proposed to estimate meta-frontier stochastic cost and revenue efficiencies under the convex technology. To illustrate, group cost and revenue efficiencies and meta cost and revenue efficiency scores under convex metatechnology are measured using cost-based and revenue-based chance-constrained DEA models. Furthermore, the deterministic frameworks of approaches are provided. Cost and revenue gap ratios and sources of meta-frontier stochastic cost and revenue inefficiencies are also handled. An empirical study of the banking industry is used to show the applicability and reliability of the proposed technique.},

  abstract     = {The tourism industry is one of the important revenue sectors in today’s world. Millions of visits are made monthly to different countries across the planet. Some countries host more tourists than others, depending on the availability of factors that would fascinate visitors. Tourism demand can be affected by different factors, which may include government policies, insecurity, political motive, etc. Being an important sector, policymakers/governments are keen on models that would provide an insight into the inherent dynamics of tourism in their country. Especially in forecasting future tourist arrivals, as it will greatly assist in decision making. Several tourism demand models have been presented in the literature. The best practice is to have a model that would account for uncertainty in estimations. In this paper, an ANN-Polynomial-Fourier series model is implemented to capture and forecast tourist data for Turkey, Japan, Malaysia, and Singapore. The proposed model is a combination of the artificial neural network (ANN), polynomial fitting (poly), and Fourier series fitting (Fourier). The proposed model is designed to capture the data trend component using the polynomial fitting, the data seasonal component using the Fourier series fitting, and other data anomalies using the artificial neural network. Multistep ahead forecasting is made for each of the studied tourist data, and estimation uncertainties are covered by generating multiple forecast paths (Monte Carlo forecast). According to estimations, Turkey will expect a 10.22% increase in 2021 compared to the tourist arrivals it received in 2020. Japan is expected to have a 92.42% decrease in 2021 compared to the tourist arrivals it received in 2020. Malaysia is also expected to have a 54.81% decrease in 2021 when compared to the number of tourists it received in 2020. Finally, Singapore will expect a 70.55% decrease in 2021 compared to the number of tourists it received in 2020.},

The nonGLOCALisation of these brands are due to some unseen hindrances. This paper is unique in its aim to analyze the challenges faced by local mobile phone supply chains (MPSC) from entering the global market in an Indian context. We analyze the barriers’ entry by combining the IVIFs-DEMATEL method with Choquet Integral; also, we compare the obtained results to those from the IVIFs-DEMATEL methodology. The differentiated analysis reveals that ‘Equipment Vendor Restrictions’ and ‘Lack of Awareness about Reverse Logistics’ are the main hindrances preventing local manufacturers from reaching the global space. Furthermore, the findings of this study suggest that ‘Carrier Aggregation Complexity’, ‘Equipment Vendor Restrictions’, and ‘Challenge to Recycling of Plastics’ are vital factors nonconducive towards the smooth working of local mobile makers across the country. The results can help domestic policymakers to improve their decision-making while trying to find ways for the globalization of the mobile phone sector.},

Machine learning techniques have been very successful in developing recommendation agents through the analysis of eWOM in the e-commerce context. However, such methods are fairly unexplored in the medical tourism context through the analysis of user-generated content. This research is the first attempt to analyze eWOM in medical tourism websites for tourists’ preferences mining using machine learning techniques. The results of the eWOM analysis revealed that the learning techniques are able to effectively analyze online reviews and accurately predict their preferences for their decision-making process in medical tourism. Compared to the methods which rely solely on the supervised learning techniques, the method evaluation results demonstrated that the use of fuzzy clustering and text mining approaches can be an important stage of eWOM analysis in the prediction of medical tourists’ preferences.},

In terms of experimental design, this paper adjusts the price limit to explore the path of the reform of the price limit. We also cancel the price limit to explore the necessity of price limits in China’s A-share market. After simulations, the experimental results of this paper show that relaxing the price limit will improve market quality. When we adjust the price limit from 10% to 20%, market volatility increases slightly, market liquidity increases and market pricing efficiency improves. When we cancel the price limit, market volatility increases significantly, market liquidity increases and market pricing efficiency decreases significantly.

Despite being a widely used statistical technique, the classical CA is not able to demonstrate the uncertainty in real-life problems. To address this issue, a new Interval-valued Hesitant Fuzzy CA approach is proposed to represent the uncertainty caused by human doubt. Due to the nature of operations defined on Hesitant Fuzzy Sets, it is hard to integrate the fuzzy calculations directly into the classical CA. Thus, a new hesitant expected value method is proposed to reveal the independence between two categorical variables. As the output of the proposed approach, an interval-valued hesitant fuzzy correspondence map consisting of rectangles of different sizes representing the amount of the hesitancy is constructed. The applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated by a simple but effective illustrative example.},

  abstract     = {The design of complex systems goes through a multi-view paradigm in which separate teams, from different viewpoints, build partial source models describing the system. These source models are called heterogeneous models since they are expressed in different languages. The main objective of this paper is to provide an approach — called CAHM for Collaborative Alignment of Heterogeneous Models — that leverages collaborative engineering and especially group decision-making principles to ensure the overall consistency of heterogeneous source models. This approach defines two sub-processes: a first one to collaboratively match heterogeneous models to develop the inter-model correspondences and a second one ensuring the consistency of the produced model of correspondences in case of model evolution. In this paper, we restate the basis of the CAHM approach, then, we detail the second sub-process that aims at maintaining the coherence of the overall system. This sub-process handles the evolution of source models by managing the impact of these evolutions on the established model of correspondences. It incorporates mechanisms to calculate the impact of changes, as well as mechanisms to formalize the group decision-making, while addressing the inconsistencies that may occur due to changes. CAHM is illustrated and validated on a real example of a hospital emergency department case study.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a methodology which blends sensitivity analysis (SA) and fuzzy arithmetic for managing uncertainty in project financing transactions. Specifically, we adopt the perspective of the equityholders and use the average return on equity (ROE) to measure shareholder value creation and, in particular, the financial efficiency of the equity investment. We cope with uncertainty via global and local SA and fuzzy arithmetic; we use the fuzzy version of the well-known (global) Gamma indicator and we introduce the fuzzy versions of two (local) importance measures, the differential importance measures (DIM). We then apply them to the pro forma financial statements drawn up by the analyst for measuring and ranking the impact of the key accounting parameters on the resulting values and we show how the uncertain accounting and financial magnitudes of the project company affect the financial efficiency. Among the advantages of this analysis, aimed to enhance the managerial insights generated by the financial model and to lead to appropriate managerial actions, we focus on the attractiveness of fuzzy calculus and possibility theory to represent and compute all relevant financial data that appear in project financing and budgeting, where available information is characterized by incompleteness or nonstatistical uncertainty. In this context, fuzzy computing and appropriate SA techniques, based on application of the extension principle, allow complete investigation of the project characteristics.},

Through this classification, inventory items are managed in an efficient way. In this paper, we argue the benefits of cross-fertilization of both Artificial Intelligence (AI) and MultiCriteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques to carry out the ABC classification of inventory items. For this purpose, we develop some new hybrid inventory classification models based on metaheuristics (AI techniques) to generate the criteria weights and on Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method (MCDM technique) to compute the overall weighted score of each item on which the ABC classification is performed. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed classification models with respect to some classification models from the literature, a comparative study — based on a service-cost analysis and three real datasets — is conducted. The computational analysis demonstrates that our proposed hybrid models are competitive and produce satisfactory results. The results have also shown, that our proposed models outperform some existing models from the literature .},

Risk assessment is an effective tool to evaluate risk factors and reduce the number of accidents in such industries. In this study, a novel risk assessment method is proposed using three-stage hybrid method based on Fine–Kinney risk assessment method to evaluate the risk factors encountered in subway constructions and take necessary precautions against possible accidents. Accordingly, in order to deal with the drawbacks of the Fine–Kinney risk assessment method, a novel hybrid approach, which includes Fine–Kinney, analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and multiple multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis (MULTIMOORA) methods, is suggested under interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) environment to handle uncertainty in the risk evaluation. To demonstrate the applicability and benefits of the proposed hybrid risk assessment method, a real-life case study in subway construction is presented. To determine the weights of three risk parameters in Fine–Kinney method and the risk priority of occupational risk factors in subway construction, IVIF-AHP and IVIF-MULTIMOORA methods are performed, respectively. Then, a sensitivity analysis is applied to confirm the robustness of the proposed method. Finally, a comparative analysis is carried out to check the consistency of the ranking of risk factors obtained in proposed method. The results prove that the proposed risk assessment method generates consistent and reliable results.},

This contributes to health informatics and behavioral literature by clarifying the complex interplay between patients’ satisfaction and determinants of continuity behavior in telemedicine’s domain. The findings provide novel insights into predictions of complex patients’ attitudes toward telemedicine continuity, and dynamic changes in adoption trends thereby assisting health professionals, global health experts, policymakers, and IS community in making higher quality informed decisions for people-centered future models of care.},

  abstract     = {In multi-criteria group decision-making, how to generate a consensus-based solution that is satisfactory to most of the decision makers, is always a critical research issue. In this paper, with consideration of the satisfaction levels of decision makers, a new group consensus reaching method with distributed preference relations (DPRs) is proposed to generate the consensus-based solution with high satisfaction level. In the proposed method, the consensus measurement of DPRs is constructed in terms of decision makers’ risk attitudes to help justify whether the predefined consensus requirement is satisfied. Afterwards, the satisfaction level of each decision maker on each criterion is constructed from the differences between assessments and rankings provided by decision makers and those aggregated by a group of decision makers. Based on the satisfaction levels of decision makers, a new feedback mechanism including identification rules and direction rules is designed to generate acceptable recommendations to decision makers who may need to modify their opinions. The modified opinions will help to generate the consensus-based solution that is satisfactory to most of the decision makers. To demonstrate the applicability and validity of the proposed consensus reaching method, a real case of evaluating safety performance of an enterprise is investigated.},

  abstract     = {To encompass uncertainty and vagueness of information, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was often extended into fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (FMCDM) under an uncertain environment. However, the extension of AHP was rarely constructed on interval-valued fuzzy numbers. Recently, interval-valued fuzzy numbers were utilized for decision-making to obtain more messages than others. For AHP extended under a fuzzy environment into fuzzy AHP, fuzzy computations are critical to derive priorities of pairwise comparison matrices. Although AHP’s approximate computations including the normalization of row arithmetic averages may be adopted to the fuzzy environment, the fuzzy extension of AHP is still complicated for division and multiplication of fuzzy numbers, especially interval-valued fuzzy numbers. To resolve complicated ties, a utility representation function of interval-valued fuzzy numbers in fuzzy AHP is used for yielding vectors consisting of priority representations of fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices on evaluation criteria based on objective, alternatives based on evaluation criteria, and more hierarchies. Then, sum product of multiplying the priority representation vectors is derived to form the utility representations of alternative performance indices, and alternative performance indices are represented by their corresponding utility representations. Therefore, FMCDM problems are easily solved by fuzzy AHP, i.e., combining AHP with the utility representation function under an interval-valued fuzzy environment.},

The clustering features acquired at the end of the study will guide the determination of sustainable supplier criteria and potential new suppliers according to the sector and business line in future studies. The first step of the three-stage model is to apply the best–worst method to determine the weights of the criteria. At the second stage, suppliers are clustered together by the k-means algorithm and silhouette index method. At the third stage, suppliers are divided into categories, and suggestion policies for each supplier category are included. Then, sensitivity analysis has been performed to analyze the effects of variations of criteria weights on the result of the proposed model. Finally, to express the integrated method, a real-life sustainable supplier selection problem is solved and suppliers are categorized according to their similarities. Following evaluation, it was seen that the environmental management system and waste management criteria were the most critical criteria in the categorization of suppliers. When its reasons are investigated, sectoral characteristics come into prominence. The results indicate that the proposed model fits well as a multicriteria decision-making tool for sustainable supplier selection and evaluation decisions. Finally, it is predicted that this model will evaluate new suppliers or new products/services to be procured and selected from the set of features.},

However, PERFs require both theoretical and practical information to figure out their characteristics and negative health effects on employees. This paper proposes an easy-to-follow sustainable ergonomic guide that includes the theoretical and practical information about the calculation details of PERFs, a decision-making (DM) tool to evaluate ergonomic risk factors, and a formula to calculate the total ergonomic risk score of a company. In the DM process, the Pythagorean fuzzy extensions of the Analytical Hierarchy Process were utilized to evaluate PERFs with respect to the social, technical, environmental, and economic criteria. To show the applicability of this guide, a real-world application was conducted in a company located in Ankara. According to the results, technical criteria were determined as the most critical ( w = 0 . 4 5 9 ), followed by the social, i.e., health-related factor ( w = 0 . 3 2 0 ). The total risk score of the company was calculated using the measurement of the PERFs and the coefficients obtained from the DM process. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis was conducted to validate the robustness of the guide. The main contribution of this paper is that a formula that can be utilized to calculate the total ergonomic risk score of any type of company was developed, based on the fuzzy DM technique and Threshold Limit Values of risk parameters.},

Inefficiency of the first projection (obtained in the first stage) is applied in the unit rank score. All units are classified in separate classes and all units of each class are ranked. Pareto-efficient projections (practical benchmarks) are obtained for all inefficient units. The proposed model is always feasible and unit invariant.},

  abstract     = {The positioning of roadside units (RSUs) in a vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication system may have an impact on network performance. Optimal RSU positioning is required to reduce cost and maintain the quality of service. However, RSU positioning is considered a difficult task because numerous criteria, such as the cost of RSUs, the intersection area and communication strength, affect the positioning process and must be considered. Furthermore, the conflict and trade-off amongst these criteria and the significance of each criterion are reflected on the RSU positioning process. Thus, this work proposes a new RSU positioning framework based on multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) in the context of the V2I communication system. Three stages are completed for this purpose. First, a real-time V2I hardware is developed to collect data. The developed hardware consists of multiple mobile nodes (i.e., cars with sending–receiving hardware devices) and physical RSUs. The RSUs and the devices in the cars are connected via the nRF24L01 + PA/LNA transceiver module with Arduino Uno. Second, seven testing scenarios are identified toward acquiring the required data upon the connection of the V2I devices. Moreover, three evaluation attributes (i.e., number of packet losses [PKL], cost and ratio of intersection area [RIA]) are used to evaluate each scenario. A decision matrix is constructed on the basis of the crossover between ‘RSU positioning scenarios’ and ‘multi-evaluation attributes (i.e., PKL, cost and RIA)’. Third, the RSU positioning scenarios are ranked using MCDM techniques, such as the integrated analytic hierarchy process (AHP), entropy and group Vlsekriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR). Furthermore, the Borda voting approach is used to aggregate multiple individual rankings into a uniform and final rank. Results indicate the following: (1) integrating AHP, entropy and VIKOR is effective for solving RSU positioning problems; (2) the VIKOR ranking results for individuals vary; (3) the rank of scenarios obtained from the group-VIKOR-based Borda voting context shows that the second scenario, which consists of four RSUs distributed along the street with a maximum distance of 200 m between them and 2-m high antennas, is the best in terms of optimally placing the RSUs; and (4) significant differences are observed amongst the scores of the groups, indicating that the ranking results are valid.},

  abstract     = {It is desirable to prevent traffic accidents by focusing on elderly people’s brain characteristics. The attention level during driving depends on the amount of information-processing resources. This study first aimed at investigating the effects of the change in attention levels on the electroencephalogram (EEG) waves during the graded working memory tasks for a traffic situation. With the increase in memory loads, reaction times were delayed in the elderly than the young group. The difficult tasks activated the induced δ and θ powers in the frontal midline area primarily in the elderly, during the selective task for a target. The elderly could retain the attention level because of the activated slow EEG responses, regardless of the task performance, although the increased δ wave may reflect drowsiness. Because the assistance system based on drivers’ brain signals can prevent car accidents, this study also aimed at evaluating the analytical method to automatically discriminate the different attentional tasks from the EEG signals. Compared with k -nearest neighbors and artificial neural networks, support vector machines more accurately classified attention levels (i.e., task difficulty) during working memory tasks reflecting a change in the induced δ and θ waves. This result can be related to a brain-computer interface system to judge the task difficulty during driving and alert a driver to danger. The experimental tasks for this study were limited because they involved simulations only in which participants recognized guided boards and removed irrelevant information. Real-time judgments should be investigated using EEG data to improve systems that can alert drivers to oncoming dangers.},

  abstract     = {For decreasing service centers’ selection risks in emergency facility location selection, it is crucial to have selected candidate service centers within deeply detailed facility location selection model. To achieve this, a new approach developed in this article involves two stages. In the first stage, the fuzzy multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) model for evaluation of the selection of candidate service centers is created. For the aggregation of experts’ assessments of candidate service centers (with respect to attributes) aggregation operators’ approach is used. Experts’ assessments are presented in fuzzy terms with semantic form of triangular fuzzy numbers. For the deeply detailed facility location selection modeling and for the intellectual activity of experts in their evaluations, pairwise interactions between attributes of MAGDM model are considered in the construction of the second-order additive triangular fuzzy valued fuzzy measure (TFVFM). The associated triangular fuzzy probability averaging (As-TFPA) aggregation operators’ family is constructed with respect to TFVFM. Analytical properties of the As-TFPA operators are studied. The new operators are certain extensions of the well-known Choquet integral operator. The extensions, in contrast to the Choquet aggregation, consider all possible pair-wise interactions of the attributes by introducing associated fuzzy probabilities of a TFVFM. At the end of the first stage, a candidate service center’s selection index is defined as As-TFPA operator’s aggregation value on experts’ assessments with respect to attributes. At the second stage, fuzzy multi-objective facility location set covering problem (MOFLSCP) is created for facility location selection optimal planning with new criteria: (1) maximization of candidate service centers selection index and classical two criteria, (2) minimization of the total cost needed to open service centers and (3) minimization of number of agents needed to operate the opened service centers. For the constructed two-stage methodology a simulation example of emergency service facility location planning for a city is considered. The example gives the Pareto fronts obtained by As-TFPA operators, the Choquet integral-TFCA operator and well-known TOPSIS approach, for optimal selecting candidate sites for the servicing of demand points. The comparative analysis identifies that the differences in the Pareto solutions, obtained by using As-TFPA operators and TFCA operator or TOPSIS aggregation, are also caused by the fact that TFCA operator or TOPSIS approach considers the pair interaction indexes for only one consonant structure of attributes. While new As-TFPA aggregations provide all pairwise interactions for all consonant structures.},

  abstract     = {Manufacturing companies sometimes suffer from unexpected production disruptions/interruptions events (DIEs), affecting the production performance and cost. Since DIEs vary in type and cause, predicting the characteristics of their corresponding production downtimes is a challenging task. Although efforts have been devoted to forecast/prevent specific types of DIEs, such as machine-related events, it is still difficult to deal with the uncertainty caused by a combination of production DIEs of various types. Moreover, the absence of a realistic scenario generator incorporating DIEs has been a challenge in production scheduling under uncertainty. This study investigates the potential use of a hybrid data-driven approach in incorporating the uncertainties of a wide range of DIEs. In this approach, a random forest (RF) method and probability distributions are integrated to forecast the DIEs. The study was carried out based on the recorded DIEs in a Canadian company producing assembly parts for automotive industry. The performance of the proposed methodology for forecasting the production DIEs is evaluated by determining the predicted total downtime (TD) in percent of the expected processing time. The proposed hybrid model yields an overall accuracy of 92.82% in predicting the TD, compared to an overall accuracy of 75.64% when a single RF is used for prediction.},

  abstract     = {Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) is a sub-discipline of operations research aimed at evaluating alternatives in consideration of various criteria. It is used by practically everyone in their daily lives and professional settings. Seeing the great value of MCDM, we conduct a comprehensive review to propel its innovation and development forward. Compared with any other reviews, we do not focus on introducing its methods, but on tracing its evolution and characteristics. As a general rule, every discipline has its own developing laws. They can be understood on various levels and can point out the direction the discipline is heading for. We firmly believe that our work can bring insight into MCDM’s frontiers and trend, which can eventually provide guidance on how to conduct the future research. In the first half of the paper, we investigate MCDM’s paradigm through literature review and colloquially divide its story into four stages: the Stone Age, the Iron Age, the Industrial Age and the New Stage. The first three stages symbolise its debut, growth and prosperity. Each one has distinctive thoughts, techniques and application, and to some extent hints the major works of the next stage. Since the turn of the 21st century, the paradigm has been once again experiencing dramatic changes, suggesting that it is on the threshold of a new era. Thus, in the second half of the work, a bibliometric analysis of the present stage ensues. Put simply, we take a global view of the stage by visualizing the stage’s publication quantity, publication distribution, and research categories. Then we design a snowballing co-citation method to explore its movements. The results demonstrate that MCDM is a dynamic, worldwide study for which China is the most productive country and the USA plays a pivot role in scholar communication. Method reviews, straightforward methods and MCDM-oriented fuzzy sets are predominant frontiers. The application, however, always changes with the requirements of the times. Now, it mainly refers to energy, environment, and supplier selection, while issues like sociology, tourism, education, etc. also emerge at a fast speed. Apart from this, experts have gradually shaken off the fetters of the traditional research style and are increasingly willing to structure methods and select application areas with a more personal touch. In the future, how to improve reviews, methods and fuzzy sets, how to understand and draw inspirations from society needs, and how experts can tailor MCDM to accommodate specific problems might be the pressing concerns.},

Decision criteria interact in many of these problems, and traditional aggregation techniques, which are usually linear methods, cannot be exploited to consider these interactions and exert correlations between criteria. In such cases, nonadditive aggregation methods have attracted the attention of many researchers. This study presents a novel model based on the best-worst method (BWM) and the multi-criteria fuzzy Choquet integral technique to apply the interaction between the criteria. In the proposed model, we have reduced the effect of the inconsistency rate detected on the fuzzy measure (or Choquet capacity) by taking into account the positive or negative interaction between the criteria.},

Basically, the control plane is an isolated process and operates on control layer. The control layer encompasses controllers which provide a global view of the entire SDN. The Controller selection is more crucial for the network administrator to meet the specific use case. This research work mainly focuses on obtaining a better SDN controller. Initially, the SDN controllers are selected using integrated Analytic Hierarchy Process and Technique for Order Preference Similarity to Ideal Solution (AHP and TOPSIS) method. It facilitates to select minimal number of controllers based on their features in the SDN application. Finally, the performance evaluation is carried out using the CBENCH tool considering the best four ranked controllers obtained from the previous step. In addition, it is validated with the real-time internet topology such as Abilene and ERNET considering the delay factor. The result shows that the “Floodlight” controller responds better for latency and throughput. The selection of an optimum controller-Floodlight, using the real-world Internet topologies, outperforms in obtaining the path with a 28.57% decrease in delay in Abilene and 16.94% in ERNET.

  abstract     = {Worldwide demand for fish products is increasing continuously. Literature evidence indicates that there is a persistent decrease in ocean fisheries’ supply. Aquaculture bridges the gap between the reduced ocean fish supply and increased world fish food demand. Sustainable and profitable aquaculture is firmly facilitated by selective fish species. Species selection has been achieved through deeply analyzing the manifold and complex interrelationships between the numerous subjective risk categories intricate in aquaculture. Apparently an analytical system able to analyze massive subjective stakes in terms of its quantifiable equivalent that aids selecting an optimal fish species is nontrivial. This research provides quantifiable metrics that eases the analytical struggle towards the subjective aspect of species selection. The novelty involves providing hybrid multi-criteria-based viable decision support methodology that analyses extensive aquaculture domain knowledge and inference and emulates the logic and reasoning process so as to choose an optimal fish species for aqua farming. The methodology is based on the assessment of several species in accordance with analyzing numerous associated criteria and sub-criteria of risk factors. This research consists of nineteen sub-criteria which were classified under five comprehensive heads of evaluation criteria such as environmental, nutritional, disease outbreaks, biotic and physiological risk categories. The weight scores for each criteria and sub-criteria were determined using the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Processing (FAHP) method. Consequently using the derived priority weights, the best fish species to choose from several alternative species is identified based on the relative closeness values and ranks assigned to them by applying the fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. A case study is performed on five varieties of most favored fish species for consumption to exemplify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The sturdiness of the suggested model is validated against the two standing multiple criteria decision-making approaches such as fuzzy ordered weighted average and fuzzy extent analysis–fuzzy weighted average methods. The research outcome strongly aids aqua farmers to identify an optimal fish species.},

This article presents a decision support system for working vessels to determine best practice for the reduction of fuel consumption. Requirements for the system are defined through interviews with crew and observations on board vessels. Case studies are used for illustrating the usefulness. The use of generators onboard is analyzed using the software. It is found that the generators are not running optimally, but the crew can use the software to re-organize and find the most fuel-efficient loading range for the generators on board.},

Results revealed that COVID-19 majorly put its impact on nation, business and behavior followed by the impact on society and environment. All these impacts can be overcome by adopting solutions like strong and clear policies formation and its implementation, financial packages to industries to boost up the economy, firm determination of top management, safety of the workforce and tax reduction on sustainable products.

  abstract     = {A fundamental issue about installation of photovoltaic solar power stations is the optimization of the energy generation and the fault detection, for which different techniques and methodologies have already been developed considering meteorological conditions. This fact implies the use of unstable and difficult predictable variables which may give rise to a possible problem for the plausibility of the proposed techniques and methodologies in particular conditions. In this line, our goal is to provide a decision support system for photovoltaic fault detection avoiding meteorological conditions. This paper has developed a mathematical mechanism based on fuzzy sets in order to optimize the energy production in the photovoltaic facilities, detecting anomalous behaviors in the energy generated by the facilities over time. Specifically, the incorrect and correct behaviors of the photovoltaic facilities have been modeled through the use of different membership mappings. From these mappings, a decision support system based on ordered weighted averaging operators informs of the performances of the facilities per day, by using natural language. Moreover, a state machine is also designed to determine the stage of each facility based on the stages and the performances from previous days. The main advantage of the designed system is that it solves the problem of “constant loss of energy production”, without the consideration of meteorological conditions and being able to be more profitable. Moreover, the system is also scalable and portable, and complements previous works in energy production optimization. Finally, the proposed mechanism has been tested with real data, provided by Grupo Energético de Puerto Real S.A. which is an enterprise in charge of the management of six photovoltaic facilities in Puerto Real, Cádiz, Spain, and good results have been obtained for faulting detection.},

  abstract     = {Web services are globally utilized by clients to accomplish the required functionality over the web. As a result of its popularity and flexibility in usage, thousands of functionally similar web services are available over the network. Hence, it becomes necessary to select the optimal web service to satisfy the clients’ need. Various methodologies like machine learning, genetic algorithm, bio-inspired techniques, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods and many others aid in the process of selecting the best web service from thousands of alternatives. This paper aims in proposing a relatively new MCDM approach to solve the selection issue and thereby proposes a novel framework incorporating the proposed MCDM method to aid in the process of service selection. Reference ideal method (RIM) is a state-of-the-art MCDM technique to select the optimal web service based on user inputs. In spite of its popularity, this method is found to have multiple pitfalls which make the selection process less effective. This paper proposes a novel MCDM methodology named improved RIM (I-RIM) to overcome the existing pitfalls in RIM. The paper also proposes a novel framework which combines the power of graphics processing unit (GPU) and I-RIM to enhance the efficiency of the selection process. The proposed I-RIM when parallelized using GPU is found to outperform the parallelized MCDM techniques taken for study. The results also imply that the I-RIM is more consistent and stable towards the ranking process. It is also evident that the proposed framework which incorporates I-RIM outperforms RIM in terms of execution time, mean reciprocal rank and Spearman’s correlation coefficient which makes the framework more stable and reliable, thus, making it suitable for real-time web service selection.},

  abstract     = {Scientific explorations and research in the Antarctic region have specific issues which need to be handled with special measures. Clothing of the scientists is one of the main problems. The clothes are expected to be enduring against compelling conditions and they must have certain features to ensure the safety and comfort of the scientists. Polar clothing is a field that is yet to be studied with different engineering approaches. To generate a better understanding, the polar clothing can be approached as a multiple criteria decision-making problem because many criteria such as layer number, material type, and waterproofness should be considered while evaluating the various alternatives. In this evaluation, expert judgments are used because no strict objective rules determine the conditions of the polar clothing. Also, possible influences among these criteria should be revealed and considered while reaching a decision. In order to deal with the uncertainty and vagueness of the expert judgments, this study proposes a Pythagorean fuzzy version of DEMATEL which is one of the well-known multiple criteria decision-making tools with the aim of evaluating the related selection attributes affecting the decision and searching for the potential influences among them. Since Pythagorean fuzzy sets provide a wider preference domain to the experts, this version was developed as a contribution to the literature. Also, the decision process is kept Pythagorean fuzzy until a conclusion is reached so that there is no early defuzzification problem. The method’s application on overcoat selection for the Antarctic region reveals the relations among attributes, such as “Water Vapor Permeability”, “All-Weather Protection” and “Performing Best in Dry/Wet State”. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to find the changes in influences.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, environmental problems have attracted the attention of many craftsmen and researchers. They have developed various policies and practices to protect the environment throughout the supply chain. Since suppliers are one of the supply chain partners, paying attention to these policies by them will be very effective in keeping the supply chain green. In today’s dynamic environment, there is uncertainty in all decisions of the organizations. The wood and paper industry also faces uncertainty in choosing green and environmentally friendly suppliers. These uncertainties must be taken into account when selecting suppliers. Decision-making techniques will cover uncertainty if developed in a gray environment. Many techniques have been developed in a gray environment. But using a combination of DANP and MABAC techniques in a gray environment will be very useful because of the benefits of each. Therefore, using the combination of DANP and MABAC in a gray environment in order to select a green supplier in the wood and paper industry is a gap that is felt and in this paper we try to overcome it. The research findings show that the identified criteria will be very effective in selecting the green supplier and Gray DANP–MABAC can be used for managers’ decisions in the wood and paper industry.},

However, these websites have to be evaluated to ensure that they reach their final goal. The use of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) models in website evaluation is relatively new and not many models have been tested for this purpose. Comparisons of such models have been implemented in various domains but not for the purposes of environmental website evaluation. The main objective of this paper is on presenting the procedure of comparison of MCDM models spherical by providing in detail the steps that have to be followed. This process was implemented for website evaluation and investigated the comparative performance of the TOPSIS and VIKOR models. This comparison process involves reliability analysis of the questionnaire and the sample of decision makers, pairwise comparisons of the models by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient and estimation of the Cohen’s Kappa for testing the inter-rater comparability, using the models as raters. Furthermore, a sensitivity and robustness analysis of those models is implemented, which also has not been implemented before in the application of those models in website evaluation. The tests implemented and presented in this paper reveal that the reasonable disagreement that was often observed among the methods did not affect their reliability. As a result, MCDM models proved very effective for evaluating websites of environmental content.},

Due to its noteworthy practical use, soft computing-based techniques, especially fuzzy clustering, can be considered one of those contemporary approaches. Although there have been various fuzzy-based clustering applications in segmentation, intuitionistic fuzzy sets that have the complimentary feature have appeared in limited studies, especially in a comparative context. Therefore, this study extends the current body of the pertaining literature by providing a comparative assessment of intuitionistic fuzzy clustering. The comparison was carried out with two other well-known segmentation techniques, k -means and fuzzy c -means, based on transaction data that belong to Turkey’s two major cities. Over 10,000 records of customers’ data were processed for segmentation purposes, and the comparative approaches were presented. According to the results, the intuitionistic fuzzy clustering approach outperformed the other methods in terms of the clustering efficiency index being utilized. The validity of the segmentation structure obtained by the superior approach was ensured via nonsegmentation variables. The comparative assessment and the potential managerial implications could be considered as a contribution to the corresponding literature. This study also compares the effects of the different parameter values used in the proposed model.},

First, we define a new ranking method for interval type-2 fuzzy set to compare the interval type-2 fuzzy evaluation information and the expectation. Second, we give a relative distance for interval type-2 fuzzy set to get the distance between the interval type-2 fuzzy evaluation information and expectation. Third, we use the prospect theory, the new defined ranking method and the new defined distance formula to obtain the comprehensive prospect value.

  abstract     = {Inventory cost control is an essential factor in supply chain management. If the supplier’s inventory is insufficient, then the chance to trade the product will be reduced. The manufacturer’s inadequate material inventory will have an effect in termination of production, delays, and a waste of resources and time. On the other hand, postponed transportation will certainly raise costs such as transportation costs and cancellation of orders. Therefore, the operation costs of enterprises will be more, which will lower profits. In conventional supply chains, inventory costs control is not feasible for the view of the entire supply chain. The main intent of this paper is to plan for intelligent inventory management using blockchain technology under the cloud sector. The inventory management of the supply chain includes “multiple suppliers, a manufacturer, and multiple distributors”. The proposed inventory management models consider some significant costs like “transaction cost, inventory holding cost, shortage cost, transportation cost, time cost, setup cost, backordering cost, and quality improvement cost”. This multi-objective cost function is minimized by a novel hybrid optimization algorithm; the concept of WOA is integrated to produce the new algorithm which is termed as Whale-based Multi Verse Optimization (W-MVO) algorithm. For securing the data of distributors, using blockchain technology in a cloud environment helps from the leakage of data to other unauthorized users. Once the cost is reduced in all aspects based on the proposed hybrid optimization algorithm, the distributer will store the concerning data in the blockchain under the cloud sector, where each distributer holds a hash function to store its data, which cannot be restored by the other distributers. The valuable performance analysis over the conventional optimization algorithms proves the effective and reliable performance of the proposed model over the conventional models.},

  abstract     = {Context. This paper deals with bilateral joint decision making in supply chains, and more specifically focuses on coordinating the decisions taken by the supplier and the producer in lot sizing. Research gap. Previous existing works in lot sizing have modeled the coordination task as a bi-level optimization problem. Unfortunately, the bi-level model causes a hierarchy between the two actors by making the leader imposing the decisions that suits his/her interests to the follower. This induces a significant conflict of interest between the two stakeholders because the leaders benefit is always greater than the follower’s one. Objective. The main goal of this work is to attenuate the conflict of interest issue between both actors by proposing a multi-objective model that alleviates the hierarchy and creates a win–win situation. Method. We propose an effective multi-objective lot sizing model, called Supplier-Producer Multi-Objective Lot Sizing (SP-MOLS); that alleviates the hierarchy between the actors’ objectives by assigning them the same importance degree and hence optimizing them simultaneously. The resolution of our SP-MOLS model using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), as an effective meta-heuristic search engine, provides a set of trade-off solutions, each expressing a compromise degree between the two actors: the supplier and the producer. Results. To validate our approach, we use five test problems each containing 100 instances with a planning horizon of 10 periods and we analyze the obtained trade-off solutions using the compromise degree and the gap between costs as main consensus metrics. The obtained results reveal that a small sacrifice in the leader’s benefit could produce a significant improvement in the follower’s one. For instance, a 10% increase of the producer’s cost may generate a 42% decrease in the supplier’s one. Reciprocally, a 0.4% increase of the supplier’s cost may generate a 49% decrease in the producer’s cost. Method algorithmic improvement. As solutions of interests for both stakeholders are usually located within the extreme regions of the Pareto front, we propose NSGA-II with Focus on Extreme Regions (NSGA-II-FER) as a new variant of NSGA-II that focuses the search in the extreme regions of the Pareto front thanks to a modified crowding measure that is adaptively managed during the evolution process. This variant has shown its ability to eliminate dominance-resistant solutions and thus to come up with better extreme regions. Based on the experimental results, NSGA-II-FER is shown to have the ability to provide the decision makers with more convergent and more diversified extreme non-dominated solutions, expressing better trade-off degrees between both actors’ costs. Managerial implications. The promising results obtained by our proposal encourage decision makers’ to adopt a multi-objective approach rather than a bi-level one. From our personal perspective, we recommend running the three models (the multi-objective model and the two bi-levels ones); then analyzing the solutions of all models in terms of compromise degrees and logistic costs. This would allow both actors to observe how the hierarchy incurred by the bi-level models increases conflicts, while the multi-objective one generates solutions with much improved consensus degrees. Such observations will convince the supply chain stakeholders to adopt our multi-objective approach, while keeping an eye on the bi-level models’ solutions and the consensus degrees. Finally, we also recommend focusing on the extreme regions of the Pareto front since they contain rich solutions in terms of consensus. Such solutions are more convincing in the negotiation process and thus could lead to better win–win situations.},

As part of the case study, the project team undertook a broad investigative approach using focus group (interviews), observation, exploration of potential data sources, identification of knowledge leaders and information technology systems. The metadata framework comprised two separate but interconnected metadata groups, (1) metadata elements to describe the metadata source and (2) metadata elements to describe the datasets held in each data source. The metadata framework was populated to describe data sources and data held in each of the sources. The data catalogue created by this process showed that it was accomplishable and appropriate to describe data sources and datasets via a metadata framework.},

  abstract     = {Due to increasing environmental regulation and customers’ demand for environmentally friendly products, organizations have been required to adopt sustainable manufacturing practices by implementing clean technology (Cleantec) to manufacture green products. By adopting environmental practices, organizations can also achieve qualitative and quantitative benefits that help them remain competitive in the market while meeting governmental environmental policies, such as lowering energy and the cost of materials. The significant number of articles addressing sustainability in manufacturing published in the past few years attests to the importance of the topic. However, not many studies have been developed to understand the decision-making process in sustainable manufacturing. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to conduct a systematic literature review on the application of multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) methods in sustainable manufacturing. A total of 158 papers, published between 2009 and 2018, met the criteria set in the research methodology. The 158 papers were then analyzed and classified into seven categories: (i) SM domain, (ii) activity within the organization, (iii) decision goals, (iv) decision-makers involved (group or individual), (v) uncertain data, (vi) SM aspects (social, environmental, and economic), and (vii) MADM methods. Among the results, we identified that AHP is the most applied MADM method and, regarding the activities of the organization, MADM methods have been the most frequently applied to strategy management and supply chain. We also identified a tendency to consider uncertain and imprecise data in the decision-making process. Another result is that all the three domains — economic, environmental and social — were considered in most of the papers, followed by the combination of the economic and environmental perspectives. In the conclusion, some recent trends and future research directions are highlighted.},

  abstract     = {The creation of digital marketing has enabled companies to adopt personalized item recommendations for their customers. This process keeps them ahead of the competition. One of the techniques used in item recommendation is known as item-based recommendation system or item–item collaborative filtering. Presently, item recommendation is based completely on ratings like 1–5, which is not included in the comment section. In this context, users or customers express their feelings and thoughts about products or services. This paper proposes a machine learning model system where 0, 2, 4 are used to rate products. 0 is negative, 2 is neutral, 4 is positive. This will be in addition to the existing review system that takes care of the users’ reviews and comments, without disrupting it. We have implemented this model by using Keras, Pandas and Sci-kit Learning libraries to run the internal work. The proposed approach improved prediction with 7 9 % accuracy for Yelp datasets of businesses across 11 metropolitan areas in four countries, along with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2 1 % , precision at 7 9 % , recall at 8 0 % and F1-Score at 7 9 % . Our model shows scalability advantage and how organizations can revolutionize their recommender systems to attract possible customers and increase patronage. Also, the proposed similarity algorithm was compared to conventional algorithms to estimate its performance and accuracy in terms of its root mean square error (RMSE), precision and recall. Results of this experiment indicate that the similarity recommendation algorithm performs better than the conventional algorithm and enhances recommendation accuracy.},

As a direct advantage, this method can accommodate the possibility to handle with asymmetry in the uni or bimodal behavior. We provide the estimation procedure of this method, and we check the predictive performance when compared to other traditional classification methods using simulation studies and many real datasets with different application fields. The ASGNB is a powerful alternative to classification tasks when lie the presence of asymmetry of bimodality in the data and outperforms well when compared to other traditional classification methods in most of the cases analyzed.},

In this paper, we develop a multi-objective decision model that minimizes both the repair time (affected by lead times) and the repair costs. Our proposed model also considers the movement of the defective components to be performed by multiple transportation modes such as highway, railway, and airway. We use the epsilon constraint method to generate the Pareto frontier and analyze the trade-off between total repair costs and total repair time. We demonstrate the approach on an example problem.},

  abstract     = {Decision-making problems often require characterization of alternatives through multiple criteria. In contexts where some of these criteria interact, the decision maker (DM) must consider the interaction effects during the aggregation of criteria scores. The well-known ELECTRE (ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité) methods were recently improved to deal with interacting criteria fulfilling several relevant properties, addressing the main types of interaction, and retaining most of the fundamental characteristics of the classical methods. An important criticism to such a family of methods is that defining its parameter values is often difficult and can involve significant challenges and high cognitive effort for the DM; this is exacerbated in the improved version whose parameters are even less intuitive. Here, we describe an evolutionary-based method in which parameter values are inferred by exploiting easy-to-make decisions made or accepted by the DM, thereby reducing his/her cognitive effort. A genetic algorithm is proposed to solve a regression-inspired nonlinear optimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper addressing the indirect elicitation of the ELECTRE model’s parameters with interacting criteria. The proposal is assessed through both in-sample and out-of-sample experiments. Statistical tests indicate robustness of the proposal in terms of the number of criteria and their possible interactions. Results show almost perfect effectiveness to reproduce the DM’s preferences in all situations.},

It is necessary for the supplier to make trade-offs between the cost and benefit of the second production run, then decide whether to conduct the second production run. We investigate the supplier’s optimal input quantity decision in each production run and obtain the supply chain members’ expected profits. As a comparison, the mode with one production chance is also developed. We find that two production chances can help improve the performance of the supply chain under yield uncertainty. A revenue-sharing contract is introduced to coordinate the supply chain with two production chances, and efficient profit allocation is achieved through adjusting the revenue-sharing ratio and the wholesale price.

In fact, the possibility of transporting the wounded victims to one of several hospitals and the dynamic changes in healthcare resource availability make the decision process more complex. To tackle this problem, we propose a multicriteria decision support service, based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, that aims to avoid overcrowding and outpacing the capacity of a hospital to effectively provide the best care to victims by finding out the most appropriate hospital that meets the victims’ needs. The proposed approach searches for the most appropriate healthcare institution that can effectively deal with the victims’ needs by considering the availability of the needed resources in the hospital, the victim’s wait time to receive the healthcare, and the transfer time that represents the hospital proximity to the disaster site. The evaluation and validation results showed that the assignment of hospitals was done successfully considering the needs of each victim and without overwhelming any single hospital.},

  abstract     = {Along with the developments of numerous MaOO algorithms in the last decades, comparing the performance of MaOO algorithms with one another is also highly needed. Many studies have attempted to manipulate such comparison to analyze the performance quality of MaOO. In such cases, the weight of importance is critical for evaluating the performance of MaOO algorithms. All evaluation studies for MaOO algorithms have ignored to assign such weight for the target criteria during evaluation process, which plays a key role in the final decision results. Therefore, the weight value of each criterion must be determined to guarantee the accuracy of results in the evaluation process. Multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methods are extremely preferred in solving weighting issues in the evaluation process of MaOO algorithms. Several studies in MCDM have proposed competitive weighting methods. However, these methods suffer from inconsistency issues arising from the high subjectivity of pairwise comparison. The inconsistency rate increases in an exorbitant manner when the number of criteria increases, and the final results are affected. The primary objective of this study is to propose a new method, called a Novel Fuzzy-Weighted Zero-Inconsistency (FWZIC) Method which can determine the weight coefficients of criteria with zero consistency. This method depends on differences in the preference of experts per criterion to compute its significance level in the decision-making process. The proposed FWZIC method comprises five phases for determining the weights of the evaluation criteria: (1) the set of evaluation criteria is explored and defined, (2) the structured expert judgement (SEJ) is used, (3) the expert decision matrix (EDM) is built on the basis of the crossover of criteria and SEJ, (4) a fuzzy membership function is applied to the result of the EDM and (5) the final values of the weight coefficients of the evaluation criteria are computed. The proposed method is applied to the evaluation criteria of MaOO competitive algorithms. The case study consists of more than 50 items distributed amongst the major criteria, subcriteria and indicators. The significant contribution of each item to the algorithm evaluation is determined. Results show that the criteria, subcriteria and their related indicators are weighted without inconsistency. The findings clearly show that the FWZIC method can deal with the inconsistency issue and provide accurate weight values to each criterion.},

  abstract     = {Broad Learning System (BLS) has been proven to be one of the most important techniques for classification and regression in machine learning and data mining. BLS directly collects all the features from feature and enhancement nodes as input of the output layer, which neglects vast amounts of redundant information. It usually leads to be inefficient and overfitting. To resolve this issue, we propose sparse regularization-based compact broad learning system (CBLS) framework, which can simultaneously remove redundant nodes and weights. To be more specific, we use group sparse regularization based on ℓ 2 , 1 norm to promote the competition between different nodes and then remove redundant nodes, and a class of nonconvex sparsity regularization to promote the competition between different weights and then remove redundant weights. To optimize the resulting problem of the proposed CBLS, we exploit an efficient alternative optimization algorithm based on proximal gradient method together with computational complexity. Finally, extensive experiments on the classification task are conducted on public benchmark datasets to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed CBLS.},

  abstract     = {The logistic regression model is one of the most widely used classification models. In some practical situations, few samples and massive uncertain information bring more challenges to the application of the traditional logistic regression. This paper takes advantages of the hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) in depicting uncertain information and develops the logistic regression model under hesitant fuzzy environment. Considering the complexity and uncertainty in the application of this logistic regression, the concept of hesitant fuzzy information flow (HFIF) and the correlation coefficient between HFSs are introduced to determine the main factors. In order to better manage situations with small samples, a new optimized method based on the maximum entropy estimation is also proposed to determine the parameters. Then the Levenberg–Marquardt Algorithm (LMA) under hesitant fuzzy environment is developed to solve the parameter estimation problem with fewer samples and uncertain information in the logistic regression model. A specific implementation process for the optimized logistic regression model based on the maximum entropy estimation under the hesitant fuzzy environment is also provided. Moreover, we apply the proposed model to the prediction problem of Emergency Extreme Air Pollution Event (EEAPE). A comparative analysis and a sensitivity analysis are further conducted to illustrate the advantages of the optimized logistic regression model under hesitant fuzzy environment.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we introduce a data mining method to identify biased and/or misleading outlooks for future performance of various factors, such as income, corporate profits, production, countries’ GDP, etc. The method consists of several components. One very important component involves building a general model, where the dependent variable is a factor suspected of projecting an over-optimistic impression in some records. Explanatory variables in the model are viewed as representing the potential for the satisfactory performance of the dependent variable. The second component involves evaluating the potential for the individual records of interest (specific countries, corporations, production facilities, etc.), and allows us to identify possible gaps between the upbeat/optimistic projections into the future (of the dependent variable) versus low and/or declining potential. In other words, low and/or declining potential basically tells us that the optimistic future performance of the dependent variable is unattainable, and could also represent misleading or deceitful information. The important novelty of this study is the capability to identify a highly exaggerated outlook of future performance, by utilizing a soft regression tool and the concept of “performance potential”. The process is explained in detail, including the conditions for successful evaluations. Case studies to evaluate expected economic success are presented.},

  abstract     = {Multiple criteria sorting (MCS) dedicates to assigning alternatives to one of the predefined ordered categories according to their evaluation information on multiple criteria. The utility (value) function-based sorting is a popular MCS procedure, which requires decision-makers to express their preferences through assignment examples. By taking the assignment examples as reference alternatives, the additive value function, as the preferred model of a decision maker, can be built using the preference disaggregation technique. However, the existing literature hardly considered people’s hesitancy when determining assignment examples, and ignored applying linguistic evaluation information on qualitative criteria. To fill these research gaps, this study proposes a value-driven MCS procedure with probabilistic linguistic information considering uncertain assignment examples. Specifically, the probability linguistic term set, as a flexible information representation tool, is introduced to express the hesitancy of decision-makers regarding assignment examples and the performance of alternatives on qualitative criteria. Besides, to comprehensively reflect the preference of a decision-maker, a weighted additive value function is proposed based on the preference disaggregation technique to calculate the comprehensive scores of alternatives in which the weights are determined by the best-worst method. Finally, a case study on the sorting of down coats for sale demonstrates the applicability and superiority of our proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Finding good solutions to clique partitioning problems remains a computational challenge. With rare exceptions, finding optimal solutions for all but small instances is not practically possible. However, choosing the most appropriate modeling structure can have a huge impact on what is practical to obtain from exact solvers within a reasonable amount of run time. Commercial solvers have improved tremendously in recent years and the combination of the right solver and the right model can significantly increase our ability to compute acceptable solutions to modest-sized problems with solvers like CPLEX, GUROBI and XPRESS. In this paper, we explore and compare the use of three commercial solvers on modest sized test problems for clique partitioning. For each problem instance, a conventional linear model from the literature and a relatively new quadratic model are compared. Extensive computational experience indicates that the quadratic model outperforms the classic linear model as problem size grows.},

  abstract     = {Site selection is a multi-dimensional optimization problem that influences a wide variety of stakeholders from local communities and authorities to governments, environmental protection agencies, etc. Locating an energy project as well as transportation infrastructure projects, for instance, are of great strategic importance and are connected to the top-level regulations and policy levels. These problems are significant from strategic levels to the productivity of a single construction project level, from energy to transportation and from infrastructure to residential buildings. A large number of publications in this field of study prove this significance. However, regarding the variety of applications, managerial decision levels, and the growing number of studies, it is important to comprehend the latest trends and conclude an appropriate research path in this field. This study is mainly focused on the application of MADM methodologies on locating problems by which many studies are carried out and have a high coincidence with the locating problem environment. Consequently, 425 studies are considered in this study, and 217 more relevant papers are selected for the subsequent reviews. Based on the results, Energy projects are by far the most frequent field of study in this regard which are considered as renewable and nonrenewable categories. Also, environmental planning and sustainable site selection are of secondary importance.},
