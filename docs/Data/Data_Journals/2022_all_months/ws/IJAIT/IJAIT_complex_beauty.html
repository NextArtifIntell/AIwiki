  abstract     = {With a high rise in deaths caused due to novel coronavirus (nCoV), immunocompromised persons are at high risk. Lung cancer is no exception. Classifying lung cancer patients and Covid-19 is the primary aim of the paper. For this, we propose a deep ensemble neural network (VGG16, DenseNet121, ResNet50 and custom CNN) to detect Covid-19 and lung cancer using chest CT images. We validate our model using three different datasets, namely SPIE AAPM Lung CT Challenge (1503 images), Covid CT dataset (349 images), and SARS-CoV-2 CT-scan dataset (1252 images). We utilize a k (= 5) fold cross-validation approach on the individual deep neural networks (DNNs) and a custom designed CNN model architecture, and achieve a benchmark score of 96.30% (accuracy) with a sensitivity and precision value of 96.39% and 98.44%, respectively. The proposed model effectively utilizes diverse models. To the best of our knowledge, using ensemble DNN, this is the first time we analyze chest CT images to separate lung cancer from Covid-19 (and vice-versa). As our aim is to classify Covid-19 and lung cancer using chest CT images, it helps in prioritizing immunocompromised persons from Covid-19 for a better patient care. Also, mass screening is possible especially in resource-constrained regions since CT scans are cheaper. The long-term goal is to check whether AI-guided tool(s) is(are) able to prioritize patients that are at high risk (e.g., lung disease) from any possible future infectious disease outbreaks.},

The existing approaches to detecting integer overflow errors rely on data/control-flow analysis of the code or execution of the code with test cases. This paper presents a supervised learning approach to predicting whether each method in a given Java program has an integer overflow error by treating the source code as text. Built upon real-world programs, our Java dataset covers all integer data types and operations in Java, the methods for preventing integer overflow errors, and adversarial samples. We have evaluated six classification models, BERT, DistilBERT, codeBERT, Code2Vec, fastText, and NBSVM. They represent different text embedding techniques for dealing with source code. The experiment results show that BERT and its variants have outperformed other models. We have applied the resultant BERT model to eleven real-world projects, including JDK13.0 and ten top-ranked GitHub projects, and revealed 181 integer overflow errors. In addition, we have evaluated the classification models with a C/C++ dataset. The result is similar to that of the Java dataset.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown remarkable performance in enormous computer vision applications over the years, and many works have been done for human activity recognition (HAR) using CNN. However, most of deep learning-based architectures require large training data and plenty of computational resources. Therefore, we proposed a simple and efficient deep learning model for human activity recognition, which works on complex visual data and require less computational resources. In the proposed work, we designed a novel CNN architecture by stacking the repeated components called micro-networks to incorporate multiscale processing in the network layers. We have used a feature fusion strategy to pass the previous layer’s abstract complementary information to the next adjacent layer, believing that each layer encapsulates specific feature maps. Therefore, the hidden complementary information can potentially enhance the feature discrimination capacity of the network and help in learning the network. The proposed architecture is fully trained from scratch with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer at 0.05 initial learning rate and a softmax classifier is used for activity recognition. The merit of the proposed method over standard deep learning models is its computational efficiency in terms of learnable parameters and computational resources. The proposed model gives good performance on small as well as large size datasets. For authentication of the proposed method several extensive experiments are conducted on publically available datasets, namely UCF-101, HMDB-51, YouTube, and IXMAS datasets. The results have shown the outperformance of the proposed method over the existing state-of-the-art methods.},

It relies on the fact that self-driving will be the getaway of the transportation future. The ADC technology has expanded as it does not require human assistance. For ACD to be fully utilized, Machine Learning (ML) tools, such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), are required. However, ACD technology uses tools like a camera, GPS, Ultrasonic Sensor (US), and others, which work together to produce accurate ACDs. While adopting ACD, several issues need to be addressed such as carves, blurry, unclean, shadow, sunlight, pedestrians, and weather conditions. The paper proposes a new method to detect when a portion of a road line is missing due to weather conditions or old marking, protecting pedestrians and cars. For lane detection, the DNN model and Hough transform are used. CULane datasets including training and testing samples were used in the experiments. The results show high accuracy levels of 92%, indicating the ability to detect road lanes.},

  abstract     = {The complexity and frequent fluctuations of economic data pose a significant challenge to forecasting studies. In order to predict financial data more accurately, we build a fusion model for predicting financial data based on the idea of decomposition-recombination by combining the Sooty Tern Optimization Algorithm (STOA), Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN). Firstly, after finding the optimal parameters of the VMD by the STOA, adjust the parameters of the VMD and decompose the financial data, remove the residual from the series, and constitute the remaining necessary information within the financial data into new series modeled by applying the SVM. Finally, calculate the error between the predicted and actual values. Notably, the residual is treated specially in the modeling. A Double-layer BPNN model is used to establish a mechanism to increase the sensitivity of the model fluctuations. The influence factor series and the residual are introduced as input variables to the BPNN to establish a mapping relationship between them and the error series. The results show that the model improves data utilization through five experiments, solves the problem of the VMD insensitivity to fluctuations, and improves the prediction accuracy of financial time series effectively.},

However, the tracking of the target is a major constraint in finding the underwater target. This paper devises a model for underwater target tracking considering radar signals. Radar signals are subjected to the image reconstruction process to make them suitable for further processing. The gridding is the next step, which is utilized for generating the grids to focus on each region in a precise manner. The features like Ridgelet transform and Local Gabor XOR Pattern (LGXP) are produced. Data augmentation is the next process, which helps to reduce the size of data by performing resizing. At last, the tracking of targets is performed from each grid with a Deep neuro fuzzy network (DNFN). Here, DNFN training is performed with Exponential-Competitive Swarm Optimization (E-CSO), which is derived by integrating Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) and Competitive Swarm Optimization (CSO). The proposed E-CSO-based DNFN offered high efficiency with a maximal detection rate of 98.8%, minimal Mean square error of 0.012, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 17.883.},

  abstract     = {Feature Selection (FS) is an important preprocessing step in data analytics. It is used to select a subset of the original feature set such that the selected subset does not affect the classification performance significantly. Its objective is to remove irrelevant and redundant features from the original dataset. FS can be done either in offline mode or in online mode. The basic assumption in the former mode is that the entire dataset has been available for the FS algorithm; and the FS algorithm takes multiple epochs to select optimal feature subset that gives good accuracy. In contrast, the FS algorithms in online mode take input data one instance at a time and accumulate knowledge by learning each one of them. In online mode each instance of the original dataset is considered as training and testing sample as well. The offline FS algorithms require long time periods, if the data to be processed is large such as Big data. Whereas online FS algorithms will take only one epoch to learn the entire data and can produce the results swiftly which is highly desirable in the case of Big data. This paper deals with the online FS problem and provides a novel Feature Selection algorithm which uses the Sparse Gradient method to build a sparse classifier. In this proposed method, an online classifier is built and maintained throughout the learning process and feature weights, which are limited to a particular boundary limit, are reduced in a step by step decrement process. This method creates sparsity in the classifier. Effectively, the built classifier is used to select optimal feature subset from the incoming data. As this method reduces the weights in the classifier in step by step manner, only those important features which have value higher than the boundary survive from this repeated decrement process. The resultant optimal feature subset is formed using these non-zero weighted features. Most significantly, this particular method can be used with any learning algorithm. To show its applicability with different learning algorithms, various online feature selection models have been built using Learning Vector Quantization, Radial Basis Function Networks and Adaptive Resonance Theory MAP. In all these models, the proposed Sparse Gradient method is used. The encouraging results shows the effectiveness of the proposed method with different learning algorithms in medium and large sized benchmark datasets.},

Using resampling methods to accumulate samples or entries from the minority class or to drop those from the majority class can be considered the best solution to this problem. The focus of this study is to propose a framework pattern to handle any imbalance dataset for fraud detection. For this purpose, Undersampling (Random and NearMiss) and oversampling (Random, SMOTE, BorderLine SMOTE) were used as resampling techniques for the concentration of our experiments for balancing an evaluated dataset. For the first time, a large-scale unbalanced dataset collected from the Kaggle website was used to test both methods for detecting fraud in the Tunisian company for electricity and gas consumption. It was also evaluated with four machine learning classifiers: Logistic Regression (LR), Naïve Bayes (NB), Random Forest, and XGBoost. Standard evaluation metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy have been used to assess the findings. The experimental results clearly revealed that the RF model provided the best performance and outperformed all other matched classifiers with attained a classification accuracy of 89% using NearMiss undersampling and 99% using Random oversampling.},

The probabilistic recognition of incomplete objects, however, remains an active field with challenging issues related to their degree of incompleteness and associated issues due to shadows, illumination and other visual characteristics. Object incompleteness here means that only a small portion of a known object is visible and not low-resolution or deformation of that object. The employment of various single machine-learning methodologies for accurate classification of the incomplete objects did not always provide a robust answer to all challenging issues or requires a very long training list of variations of each object. In this paper, we present the initial results using Local-Global (L-G) graphs and Voronoi (V) diagrams methodologies associated with machine learning to generate probabilistic matches of objects with varying degrees of incomplete views. The first results with limited use of synthesis of views are promising and have triggered an interest to continue the efforts for recognizing incomplete objects in a progressive way with synthesis of views of segmented regions that compose an object.},

  abstract     = {Pervasive Computing (PC) opens up the room for the adoption of devices very close to end users that gives the opportunity to interact with them and execute various applications to facilitate their every day activities. Pervasive applications are supported by the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) as well as the Edge Computing (EC) that offer vast infrastructures where data can be collected and processed. EC acts as the mediator between the IoT and the Cloud becoming the middle point where data are transferred before they become the subject of processing by Cloud services. IoT devices can assist in the collection of data and EC nodes could play the role of intermediate processing points executing the desired tasks requested by applications. Any processing can be affected by the presence of missing values that may jeopardize the quality of the outcomes. In this paper, we propose a setting where EC nodes play the aforementioned processing role for data reported by IoT devices and adopt an ensemble scheme for data imputation in the case where missing values are present. Our model relies on the local view of the IoT devices reporting a data vector with a missing value, the view of the group that consists of the IoT nodes with a high similarity in the reported data and a probabilistic approach that reveals the statistics of data as realized in the group of similar reports. The proposed scheme continuously detects the correlation between the incoming data streams and efficiently combines the available data vectors before it is in a position to suggest replacements for missing values. The envisioned aggregation mechanism is capable of resulting the appropriate replacements aligned with the aforementioned views on the collected data. Our ensemble model relies on a number of similarity metrics and statistics to derive the final outcome. The paper reports on the description of the proposed model and elaborates on its validation based on various evaluation scenarios.},

This paper is a step towards these issues. First, it provides a labelling counterpart for the structure semantics of Recursive Argumentation Frameworks (RAF). Second, it investigates the complexity of decision problems associated with RAF. This investigation shows that, for the higher expressiveness offered by these enriched systems, the complexity is the same as for classical argumentation frameworks. As a side contribution, a new semantics for RAF, the semi-stable semantics, and a new process for translating RAF into Argumentation Frameworks without higher-order attacks (AF), are introduced. Finally, new notions which are the counterparts of equivalent notions already existing for AF (among them, the Strongly Connected Components — SCC) are defined and investigated in order to involve them in the future development of algorithms for computing RAF labelling semantics.},

  abstract     = {To evaluate clustering results is a significant part of cluster analysis. Since there are no true class labels for clustering in typical unsupervised learning, many internal cluster validity indices (CVIs), which use predicted labels and data, have been created. Without true labels, to design an effective CVI is as difficult as to create a clustering method. And it is crucial to have more CVIs because there are no universal CVIs that can be used to measure all datasets and no specific methods of selecting a proper CVI for clusters without true labels. Therefore, to apply a variety of CVIs to evaluate clustering results is necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel internal CVI – the Distance-based Separability Index (DSI), based on a data separability measure. We compared the DSI with eight internal CVIs including studies from early Dunn (1974) to most recent CVDD (2019) and an external CVI as ground truth, by using clustering results of five clustering algorithms on 12 real and 97 synthetic datasets. Results show DSI is an effective, unique, and competitive CVI to other compared CVIs. We also summarized the general process to evaluate CVIs and created the rank-difference metric for comparison of CVIs’ results.},

One of the several classes of tractable problems that exist contains all the problems with a restricted structure of the constraint scopes. This paper studies community structure, a particular type of restricted structure underpinning a class of tractable SAT problems with potentially similar relevance to CSPs. Using the modularity, it explores the community structure of a wide variety of problems with both academic and industrial relevance. Its impact on the search times of several general solvers, as well as one that uses tree-decomposition, is also analysed to determine whether constraint solvers exploit this type of structure. Nearly all CSP instances have a strong community structure, and those belonging to the same class have comparable modularity values. For the general solvers, strong correlations between the community structure and the search times are not apparent. A more definite correlation exists between the modularity and the search times of the tree-decomposition, suggesting that it might, in part, be able to take advantage of the community structure. However, combined with the relatively strong correlation between the modularity and the tree-width, it could also indicate a similarity between these two measures.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian network is a graphical model that is widely used to perform probabilistic reasoning. However, learning the structure of Bayesian network is a complex task. In this paper, we propose a hybrid structure learning algorithm that has two phases: a constraint-based phase to reduce the search space and a score-and-search phase that employs case-injected genetic algorithms for determining the optimal structure from the reduced space of structures. We use a case-injected genetic algorithm-based hybrid approach for the structure learning in order to improve the learning accuracy over similar problems. A case-injected genetic algorithm is the augmentation of a case-based memory with the Genetic Algorithm (GA). Thereby, it finds near-optimal solutions in fewer generations compared to GA. Our method stores relevant or partial solutions in a case-base while solving the problems and utilizes those stored solutions on new similar problems. We use small-to-very large networks for assessing our viability of our approach. In this paper, a series of experiments are conducted on datasets generated from four benchmark Bayesian networks. We compare our method against GA-based hybrid approach and a state-of-the-art algorithm, Max-Min Hill Climbing (MMHC). Presented results indicate an enhanced improvement of our approach over GA and MMHC in learning the Bayesian network structures.},

In this study, we focus on the issue of multi-rules-based classification for evidential data, i.e., data where imperfection is modeled via the belief functions theory. In this respect, we introduce a new algorithm called PWEviRC. This latter involves a two-level pruning technique to remove redundant and noisy rules. Finally, it applies the Dempster rule of combination to fuse the selected rules and make the final decision.

There is substantial evidence about this since netizens implicitly or explicitly agree to trust virtually every Web service they use ranging from Web-based mail to e-commerce portals. Moreover the methodological framework for trusting individual netizens, primarily their identity and communications, has considerably progressed. Nevertheless, the core of fact checking for human generated content is still far from being substantially automated as most proposed smart algorithms capture inadequately fundamental human traits. One such case is the evaluation of the profile trustworthiness of LinkedIn members based on publicly available attributes available from the platform itself. A trusted profile may indirectly indicate a more suitable candidate since its contents can be easily verified. In this article a first order graph search mechanism for discovering LinkedIn trusted profiles based on a random walker is extended to higher order ranking based on a combination of functional and connectivity patterns. Results are derived for the same benchmark dataset and the first- and higher-order approaches are compared in terms of accuracy.},

  abstract     = {As a prominent semi-supervised learning algorithm, co-training can make full use of a few labeled samples as well as a quantity of unlabeled samples to train robust classifiers, thus it is widely researched in the last decades. However, there are still two severe problems in existing co-training methods: firstly, data used in co-training needs at least two sufficient and redundant views, but few practical datasets can meet it. Secondly, because there are a few labeled samples in the initial stage, the initial classifiers trained by co-training are usually too weak to correctly label unlabeled samples, which may bring in noisy labels for the following training process. To deal with these problems, we propose a co-training algorithm by predicting confidence of unlabeled neighbors (termed LCN-CoTrain). Specifically, LCN-CoTrain first defines an entropy-based view division method to generate redundant views. Meanwhile, LCN-CoTrain introduces a novel labeling confidence prediction strategy, which takes the nearest unlabeled neighbors into consideration when calculating the labeling confidence of a certain sample. To validate the efficiency of our proposed LCN-CoTrain algorithm, we experiment on four UCI datasets and compare LCN-CoTrain with several representative co-training methods. The experimental results indicate that our proposed LCN-CoTrain can learn robust classifiers and outperform most of baseline methods.},

This paper proposes a robust Laplacian of Gaussian operator connected domain controller squeeze excitation residual network (LCSE-ResNet) for marine man-made target classification based on optical remote sensing imagery. Vessel and oil platform candidate regions in remote sensing images are extracted by the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) operator and the connected domain controller, which are input into the classification neural networks in the following. It is a whole End-to-End structure from original remote sensing images to the precise target information. That clouds, ripples, and the other man-made target disturbances can be excluded effectively means the better robust character in the actual application. Some shape and size features of vessels and oil platforms are considered in the LCSE-ResNet structure, which improves the explanation of the final results. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LCSE-ResNet can effectively detect marine man-made targets and effectively distinguish vessels and oil platforms.},

In this paper, a novel approach to generate high-quality industrial defect images from extremely few samples is proposed. We design a generative adversarial network (GAN) for this task. Mode collapse is a common problem of GANs when training data is insufficient, thus, fully convolutional network and Markovian discriminator are applied to eliminate this problem. In order to generate images of high resolution, we also propose a novel sampling strategy to balance memory consumption and training quality. Experiments illustrate that our model is capable of generating high-resolution industrial defect images from extremely few samples of various categories. With the generated “artificial samples”, the classification and detection models outperform superior accuracy compared to the same models with the original rare samples. Thus, this approach can increase the intelligence of defect inspection systems.},

  abstract     = {EEG is a personal privacy information, that is difficult to share data and not conducive to the study of sleep staging. In this paper, the Federated Learning (FL) method is introduced to solve the problem of data island in sleep staging EEG signals. To simulate the distribution of different user data, we introduce the K-means algorithm into EEG dataset partitioning and transform it into a non-independent and identically distributed unbalanced dataset. Then, based on the classic Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) network, we analyse the privacy leakage problem in FL, and Differential Privacy (DP) is used to protect the privacy of user EEG data. Next, we analyse the reason for the accuracy loss between FL and Centralized Learning (CL), and the effect of the imbalance of the data distribution of each client. We propose a self-adaptive batch method to adaptively balance the batch size of each client, and experiments show that the training results of imbalanced datasets can be improved. Finally, when the accuracy of the model does not reach the historical best value in the set epoch interval, the Mandatory Optimization Strategy (MOS) is used to further improve the accuracy and reduce the randomness of the model. The DP-FL based on the self-adaptive batch and MOS strategy is tested on our dataset and the Sleep-EDF Database Expanded dataset, which not only protects user privacy but also achieves the same accuracy as CL. The accuracy is 82.88% on our dataset and 91.81% on the subset of the Sleep-EDF Database Expanded dataset.},

  abstract     = {Embracing generative models to the inpainting realm has resulted in its overwhelming acceptability as an image editing technique. However, these generative inpainting techniques tend to be cumbersome in view of the large memory footprint and resources consumed during the operation. This accounts for why images above 2k resolution are far from being considered as input for inpainting operations. In the present era of super-resolution, where human eyes are accustomed to viewing images beyond 6k and 8k, inpainting algorithms were not at par with the resolution benchmark. This paper proposes a high-resolution inpainting algorithm that addresses these concerns. To improve the computational overhead, the proposed architecture follows a hierarchically scaled 2-stage generative inpainting network. The proposed framework showcases a novel approach of injecting a blind Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network network in an inpainting scenario. The resolution lost in the first phase is regained by the embedded pre-trained Real-ESRGAN model employed in the final phase. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the proposed method was performed using various datasets. Results obtained on comparing with the state-of-the-art inpainting methods were promising and ought to be a big leap towards super-resolution inpainting methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the popular problem of short text clustering. Since the short text documents typically exhibit high degrees of data sparseness and dimensionality, the problem in question is generally considered more challenging than the traditional clustering scenarios. Our proposed solution, named VEPH, is based on a novel algorithm that was published recently with the aim of optimally clustering short text documents. VEPH includes two stages: During the first stage, the original text vectors are projected on a lower dimensional space and the documents with projection vectors lying on the same dimensional space are grouped in the same cluster. The second stage is a refinement process which attempts to improve the quality of the clusters that were generated during the previous stage. The quality of a cluster is determined by its homogeneity and completeness and these are the two primary design criteria of this stage. Initially VEPH cleanses the clusters by removing all dissimilar elements, and then, it iteratively merges the similar clusters in a hierarchical agglomerative manner. The proposed algorithm has been experimentally evaluated in terms of F1 and NMI, by employing three datasets with diverse attributes. The results demonstrated its superiority over other state-of-the-art works of the relevant literature.},

  abstract     = {Optical networks are one of the fastest data communication networks, which use optical fiber cables for transmitting data in the form of light pulses between sender and receiver nodes. As the quality of optical signal deteriorates when increasing the distance among terminal nodes, expensive electronic devices (regenerators) must be deployed in the network to recover the signal quality. The objective of Generalized Regenerator Location Problem (GRLP) is to minimize the number of installed regenerators, while weighted variant (WGRLP) assumes different installation costs (weights) of potential regenerator locations and minimizes the sum of regenerator installation costs. In this study, an improved variant of Basic Variable Neighborhood Search (iBVNS) was developed as a metaheuristic solution approach to both GRLP and WGRLP. Computational results provided by the proposed iBVNS on all available data sets from the literature are compared with the results of existing solution methods for GRLP and WGRLP. The obtained results show that the proposed iBVNS quickly reaches optimal or near-optimal solutions and in many cases improves upper bounds provided by exact method. In addition, the conducted non-parametric statistical tests indicate that iBVNS outperforms all heuristic approaches proposed earlier in the literature for the considered problems.},

Many approaches that use sentiment dictionaries and machine learning have been proposed until now. In this paper, we present a new feature that is extracted using dependency parsing and an emotion lexicon. This feature, along with n-grams, syntactic n-grams and lexicon-based features, is used to classify the tweets. We also use custom dictionaries to identify slang words, SMS short forms, emoticons and word contractions. The performance of various classification algorithms and ensemble techniques is compared.

In this paper, we study the construction of a neural machine translation model by the neural network structure. Firstly, the neural machine translation model is constructed using the neural network structure, which is simplified based on the neural network structure and achieves good performance while reducing the training complexity. To address the problem that neural machine translation cannot make good use of linguistic knowledge, a neural machine translation model with lexical sequence information is proposed. Based on the translation model of a bidirectional neural network incorporating attention mechanism, syntactic analysis is performed to obtain lexical sequence information, and then it is incorporated into the encoder part of the translation model in the form of bidirectional encoding, and the background vector is formed together by vector splicing. To address the problem that the Chinese-English language sequences of any length in the encoder part are encoded into a fixed dimensional background vector, an attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically adjust the degree of influence of the context at the source language end on the target language sequences to improve the translation model’s ability to deal with long-distance dependencies. To better reflect the contextual information, this paper further proposes a machine translation model based on migration learning and neural network and conducts a comparative analysis for various translation models to verify the effectiveness of the model performance improvement.},

  abstract     = {Mobile robot path planning (MRPP) plays an irreplaceable role in the process of intelligent robots and practical artificial intelligence. The traditional global path planning methods have some shortcomings, such as difficulty in digging into environmental information and finding the optimal path effectively. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a negative gradient differential biogeography-based optimization (NG-DBBO), which has strong local search ability and global optimization ability. Firstly, we present a differential migration approach to increase the population diversity in the iterative process of NG-DBBO, which can realize the information sharing between feature solutions effectively. Then a negative gradient descent strategy based on negative gradient descent is introduced to improve the learning rate, which not only enhances initial global search ability, but also avoids premature convergence. Noteworthily, the convergence of the algorithm is analyzed for single-peak and multi-peak problems respectively. After that, NG-DBBO is combined with the cubic spline interpolation to realize MRPP by the defined coding method and fitness function. The simulation experiments are used to demonstrate the availability of our method, which consist of two parts. In the first part, we select 23 benchmark functions to verify the accuracy and convergence speed of the NG-DBBO algorithm. The practicability of path planning in different environments is demonstrated in the second part.},

Moreover, sleep scoring is based on fixed epoch lengths usually of 30 seconds, which leads to an information loss problem. In this paper, we propose an automatic unsupervised sleep scoring model. The aim of our work is to consider different epoch’s durations to classify sleep stages. Therefore, we developed a model based on Hierarchical Multi-Agent Systems (HMASs) that presents different layers where each layer contains a number of adaptive agents working with a specific time epoch.

The correct guidance of public opinion has also become an important thing in the ideological work of universities. Undergraduates are in an important period of formation and development of thoughts that they are easily to be incited by cyber-rumors. Therefore, it is particularly important to obtain the data of political public opinion in universities and position the hot topics for early detection of political public opinion tendency, which can also avoid the outbreak of major security incidents. With such consideration, this paper obtains multi-source political public opinion data from BBS, Tieba and Weibo of SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY (SYSU) through crawler. We study a text feature extraction method based on Word2Vec &amp; LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation), which improves the high-dimensional sparsity in traditional Vector Space Model (VSM) text representation. Meanwhile, based on the classical Single-pass clustering algorithm, this paper studies the Single-pass &amp; HAC clustering algorithm. In addition, a measurement method of hot topic is defined to calculate the heat value of political public opinion. Dictionary and rule based method is used to improve the accuracy of sentiment tendency analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that the effect of topic detection and positioning based on LDA &amp; Word2Vec and Single-pass &amp; HAC algorithm is better than other methods.},

  abstract     = {Image recognition technology is an important branch of artificial intelligence research, using the computer to process, analyze and understand the image, in order to identify different patterns of objects. Image recognition technology is currently used in a wide range of applications, such as face recognition, fingerprint recognition, terrain survey, license plate recognition, etc. However, due to the possible existence of multiple categories in images, the blurring of graphic boundaries affects the results of image recognition. In this paper, we propose a multi-category multi-task image recognition method based on deep metric learning (MMDML). Specially, we combine triplet loss function and softmax loss function to construct the loss function, and take ResNet-50 network training to fit the optimal loss function for image recognition. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, our method is compared with the other two methods on three common image recognition datasets, namely ImageNet, PASCALVOC, and Caltech. And the experimental results show that our algorithm has the highest Rank-1 and mAP on three datasets.},

  abstract     = {When using deep learning methods to model natural language, a recurrent neural network that can map input sequences to output sequences is usually used. Considering that natural language contains more complicated syntactic structures, and the performance of cyclic neural networks in long sentence processing will decrease, scholars have introduced an attention mechanism into the model, which has improved the above problems to a certain extent. The existing attention mechanism still has some shortcomings, such as the inability to explicitly obtain the known syntactic structure information in the sentence, and the poor interpretability of the output probability. In response to the above problems, this article will improve the attention mechanism in the recurrent neural network model. Firstly, the prior information in the natural language sequence is constructed as a graph model through syntactic analysis and other means, and then the graph structure regularization term is introduced into the sparse mapping. A new function netmax is constructed to replace the softmax function in the traditional attention mechanism, thereby improving the performance of the model and making the degree of association. The input values corresponding to larger input samples are closer, making the output of the attention mechanism easier to understand. The innovation of this paper mainly lies in that the weight calculation method which can be widely used in the attention mechanism is proposed by combining the deep learning model with statistical knowledge, which opens a channel to introduce the prior information for the deep learning model in natural language processing tasks.},

  abstract     = {English has become the most widely used language in the world. Everything we do in study, life and work is closely linked with English. With the continuous development of computer technology, machine translation is becoming more and more mature. The convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and language learning is getting increasingly close, which brings great impact and challenge to the language education industry, but also provides an opportunity for the synchronous promotion of the development of the language education industry. With the further development of AI, machine translation can better meet the needs of most general translation, but in the face of professional, diversified, detailed and complex communication translation tasks containing human emotion, machine translation is still difficult to replace human translation. In order to improve the English translation ability of university students, this paper uses AI to propose the innovative factor based Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization-Convolutional Neural Network (QPSO-CNN) algorithm. Through the experiment, at first, the obtained dataset can ensure the accuracy and diversity of the collected results of English translation feature samples to the maximum extent, and the trained QPSO-CNN can be used to analyze the accuracy of the English translation ability of university students. Then, by comparing the convergence curve of QPSO-CNN and back propagation-CNN (BP-CNN), it is concluded that the proposed QPSO-CNN in this paper has been greatly improved in terms of model accuracy and convergence speed.},

In general, there are two ways to protect our rights. Firstly, we can find the applicable legal provisions by reading a large number of relevant cases and analogy. The other way is to employ lawyers who will play a key role in the trial process. However, both the approaches have some difficulties. The first difficulty lies in the need of finding similar cases in a large number of legal documents, and the second difficulty is in choosing an appropriate lawyer. In this work, we aim to build a legal consultation system through the excavation of a large number of judicial documents, and provide help in the process of protecting people’s rights. Our work mainly contains three parts that are designing collection framework, proposing text expression method and improving the method of lawyer recommendation.

Furthermore, by introducing the blockchain in the infrastructure to enable the trustable medical exchange and effectively creates a large set of distributed medical data lake from various participated hospitals. We will introduce the medical coin, a virtual token, to vitalize digital service within the blockchain and create common interests among data generators, data vendors, and data users.We aim to create business models on top of its therapeutic effectiveness and unlock the academic and commercial value of medical data ecosystem.},

Their solution strategies often require evaluating domain-dependent subspaces on the big data and selecting the best result. As the data space in these problems is so vast that it is infeasible to scan the data once, we need domain-specific methods for identifying promising and manageable subspaces with a high density of solutions before looking for individual ones. To this end, we introduce kernels to represent some properties of the statistical quality, average density, or probability of solutions in a subspace to prune subspaces with suboptimal kernels. We classify various past approaches based on their analysis methods and illustrate each by an example. Our results confirm that kernels can effectively harness the complexity of solving big-data applications.},

  abstract     = {The human body’s major organ is the skin, and it protects human beings from the outside environment. Detecting skin disease at an earlier stage is a big challenge because of the similar appearance of skin disease. Although skilled dermatologists find it challenging to forecast skin lesions due to lack of contrast between adjoining tissues. Therefore, there is a need for an automated system that can detect skin lesions timely and precisely. Recently Deep Learning (DL) has attained outstanding success in the diagnosis of various diseases. Thus, in this paper, a transfer learning-based model has been proposed with help of pre-trained Xception model. The Xception model was modified by adding layers such as one pooling layer, two dense layers and one dropout layer. A new Fully Connected (FC) layer changed the original Fully Connected (FC) layer with seven skin disease classes. The proposed model has been evaluated on a HAM10000 dataset with large class imbalances. The data augmentation techniques were applied to overcome the unbalancing in the dataset. The new results showed that the model has attained an accuracy of 96.40% for classifying skin diseases. The proposed model is working best on Benign Keratosis and the values of precision, sensitivity and F1 score are 99%, 97% and 0.98 respectively. This method can provide patients and doctors with a good notion of whether or not medical assistance is required, thus, avoiding undue stress and false alarms.},

The proposed system employs a cascade style architecture with increasing thresholds for achieving accurate detection. The framework makes use of highly efficient Feature Pyramid Networks (FPNs) to detect objects of small sizes, and various scales which are the main challenge in low-altitude aerial images. FPNs aim to resolve scale variation problems in object detection by combining features of multiple levels. The experiments have been performed on a complex low-altitude aerial dataset VisDrone which has multiple categories of classes. The FPN-Cascade detector has been supported by slicing the data horizontally and vertically that resulted in an advancement of 8% mAP when compared with the base detector. The experiments compare the FPN-Cascade performance on the standard as well as augmented VisDrone dataset. A concrete methodology about the training process, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation methods for Cascade RCNN on the VisDrone dataset is highlighted. The proposed framework achieves state of the art 30.04% mAP value on the VisDrone dataset.},

  abstract     = {Partial label learning is a rising weakly supervised learning framework that deals with the problem that each training instance is associated with a set of candidate labels, where only one is correct. The dimensionality reduction mechanism can effectively improve the learning system’s generalization performance. However, due to the ambiguity of the ground-truth label, it is hard to use traditional dimensionality reduction methods directly on partially labeled data sets. Existing research attempts to exploit the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) strategy to reduce the dimensionality of partial label training examples. Unfortunately, this method still suffered from false-positive labels. This paper proposed an LDA-based dimensionality reduction approach named SDIMR for partially labeled datasets. On the one hand, introduce the manifold regularization term with semantic difference information to perform dimensionality reduction procedures and simultaneously maintain the local manifold structure. On the other hand, the iterative process alternates between dimensionality reduction and disambiguation. Briefly, our approach consists of three stages: Firstly, utilize the graph structure with semantic difference information to describe the topological information in the feature space. Secondly, we propose a new objective function containing manifold regularization terms to reduce the dimensionality of original training data to generate a new training data set. Finally, the k-nearest neighbor method is employed to disambiguate the dimensionality-reduced data. Extensive experiments on artificial and real-world data sets show that our method can be comparable to state-of-the-art partial label learning algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In transportation, drivers’ state directly affects traffic safety. Therefore, an accurate driver’s fatigue detection is crucial for ensuring driving safety. Real-time and accurate technology is needed for driver fatigue detection. To address this problem, this article proposes a fatigue detection method based on an improved deep learning and personalized framework. First, clustering is applied to face size, and cluster numbers are used to determine the number of detection layers. Then, the size of anchor boxes is set according to the face size. In the proposed framework, the number of convolutional networks is set according to the principle that the receptive field should match the face size in the predicted feature map. Finally, a variety of fatigue features are learned by minimizing the loss function. In addition, a personalized face fatigue detection method is put forward for building a fatigue detection framework to judge the driver’s fatigue status more reasonably. The experimental results show that the proposed method based on an improved clustering method and local receptive field can improve the detection speed of driver’s fatigue while maintaining high detection accuracy. The proposed method can reach 125 fps by using GPU GeForce GTX TITAN, which satisfies the real-time requirement. In addition, the personalized framework can achieve high detection accuracy while keeping acceptable speed. The proposed model can accurately and timely detect driver fatigue, which can help to avoid accidents.},

The subjects were invited to perform an emotion identification of aria segments to build a multi-classification standard dataset of differences in subjects’ emotion identification. A dual-channel neural network model was proposed, and three neural networks based on it were adopted to predict the emotion perception tendencies of the categorical groups with three attributes. Subjects were clustered according to the predicted values of the emotion perception tendencies towards the sample test group, followed by a comparison of the clustering results with the actual attribute group classifications. As suggested by the experimental results, the neural network accurately predicted the classification groups’ emotion perception tendencies with the three attributes of the subjects.

  abstract     = {In this paper, an expanded multilayer perceptron (EMLP) neural network is proposed to automatically segment angiodysplasia regions in wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) images The main idea is to minimize the distance between the input image and the corresponding binary ground truth, i.e., the mask image. After the training phase, when a test image is given to the network, the lesion pixels will be close to “one” and the other pixels will be close to “zero” and finally, the lesion area can be segmented using thresholding. Since angiodysplasia lesions appear in images with different spectrums of red color, the classical MLP neural network cannot be trained with a wide range of red color, hence leads to undesirable network accuracy. To solve this problem, we proposed an EMLP neural network for image segmentation. In the EMLP neural network, neurons are divided into several groups, each of which is for learning a spectrum of the lesion. The EMLP is able to learn a wider range of red colors. The proposed method is able to segment WCE images containing angiodysplasia faster than the existing methods. Our investigation shows that our method also outperforms existing methods in terms of segmentation scores.},

It is immensely essential to manage network congestion as well as to minimize the travel time of the growing traffic load on the road network. Traffic signals may play an important role in managing the mounting traffic. This work relies on reducing the total time lag at the traffic signals, thus reducing the overall travel period. The model is designed on a bi-level framework. The overall wait time is optimized at the traffic signals by the upper level while the User Equilibrium (UE) is estimated by the lower level. Biologically inspired metaheuristic methods like Bat Algorithm (BA), Genetic algorithms (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and many others demonstrated optimized outcomes for bi-level problems. To improve the desirability of the metaheuristic techniques an innovative method encapsulating the desirability of both BA and GA is proposed to evaluate the traffic optimization problem (TOP). While BA helps in faster convergence GA diversifies the search space. A comparative analysis has been carried out with the parent algorithms as well as an existing ACO-GA-based model. It was observed that the proposed BA-GA method performs better than the rest of the techniques.},

Due to different weights of the factor, an analytical method based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is proposed to analyze the affecting factors of acoustic insulation performance. The orthogonal array results show that the main factors affecting acoustic insulation are membrane thickness, membrane preload force and attached mass. A factor-weighted k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classification approach is proposed to predict different levels of acoustic insulation, which also provides a reference for the analysis of acoustic insulation. The experimental results demonstrate that when k = 3, the maximum classification accuracy of acoustic insulation is 98.2% by using AHP-kNN approach, which makes the accuracy for acoustic insulation is higher than other three baselines.},

  abstract     = {In recent times, marine fish species recognition becomes an important research area to protect the ocean environment. It is a tough and time-consuming operation to manually detect marine fish species on the ocean floor. Depending on the situation, extensive sample efforts may be required. These efforts might be harmful to the marine ecosystem. Automated classification methods are capable of properly classifying these fish on a consistent basis. An increasing number of people are becoming interested in utilizing electronic monitoring and reporting with artificial intelligence for the aim of fish identification and enhancing present techniques. It is becoming more usual to use video and pictures of fish (either underwater or on ships) in fishing operations. These techniques are operational, transportable, and non-invasive, and they provide high-quality pictures at a lower cost than traditional approaches. Automated image processing techniques such as Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) are now available, and they may be customized to perform efficient fish species identification and segmentation. In this aspect, this paper presents an Intelligent DL based Marine Fish Species Classification (IDL-MFSC) technique. The proposed IDL-MFSC technique involves three major processes such as pre-processing, fish detection and fish classification. Primarily, Weiner filtering-based noise removal process takes place as a pre-processing step. In addition, Mask R-CNN (Mask Region Based Convolutional Neural Networks) with Residual Network as a backbone network is used for fish detection. Moreover, Optimal Deep Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (ODKELM) based classification method is employed for determining the class labels of the marine fish species in which the parameter tuning of the DKELM model takes place using Water Wave Optimization (WWO) technique. The performance of the proposed method is tested using an openly accessible Fish4Knowledge dataset. The experimental result highlights the supremacy of the IDL-MFSC technique over the recent techniques with respect to various measures.},

  abstract     = {The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has affected the normal life of people around the world and has forced them to maintain social distance, self-quarantine and closing of many businesses. So, the people wish to share the information regarding the pandemic through social media e.g. Twitter. The key objective of this paper is to identify the sentiment associated with the pandemic by utilizing the tweets regarding the Coronavirus (COVID-19) and by using the python libraries to perform the task. We analyze the sentiment of people when Coronavirus has attained a peak level using the machine, deep learning techniques and TextBlob. We have classified the sentiments into positive and negative classes using the Machine Learning (NB, SVM, Logistic regression) approaches and deep learning-based Bi-LSTM model. The Bi-LSTM approach has achieved better accuracy (0.87) compared to the traditional machine learning models for Twitter sentiment classification. From the overall analysis, we could conclude that people are confident and they express more positivity towards the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Such an analysis will help the policy and decision-makers to address the needs of the public appropriately.},

  abstract     = {In Internet of Things (IoT) business applications, healthcare records and medical web service management have emerging technologies tremendous amount of data in daily transactions. The cloud service providers have attracted the attention of a huge number of user requests based on different Quality of Service (QoS) factors. The data gained researchers attention to predict user behavior through the production of IoT applications. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based techniques have a great impact on analyzing and detection of web service segmentation and user behavior in selecting and allocating online services and online stores with wireless communications and smart devices. This research improves the Redundancy, Frequency, and Maintenance value (RFM) model to evaluate healthcare records using a hybrid Grouping Genetic Algorithm (GGA) and Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithms. In this hybrid method, using the GGA algorithm, the features selection is applied to find the optimal features for healthcare records of customer segmentation. After that, by applying the RFM model on the data output of the genetic algorithm, the data are clustered. Finally, by applying the DBSCAN algorithm, the most suitable case for clustering will be selected. The simulation results show that the accuracy of the genetic algorithm is 97% and the final clustering accuracy is 92%.},

Stakeholders can consult a web application for determining the risk-based class of a medical device based on the relevant legislation. The described approach is generally applicable to any other analogous cases of decision-making based on legislative regulations. One of the main advantages of using argumentation is the explainability and the high modularity of software permitting the extension and/or modification of the code when new relevant regulations become available.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of the semantic representation of words based on explicit basis word vectors. We focus on explicit semantic vectors in which each basis vector is equivalent to a unique word. In this paper, we propose a new approach to represent semantic vectors explicitly. The approach consists of three steps: First, we introduce two new factors called word similarity (WS) and the number of zeroes (NZ) for choosing informative context words. Second, we propose a dependency distance method by incorporating the syntactic relations of the words in the sentences. This means that the method uses not only semantic information but also syntactic one. Third, we propose two shifting methods based on WF and WS factors to eliminate the bias of the PPMI matrix. In this work, we use the ukWaC corpus to select context words and compute co-occurrence matrices. Then, we examine the results on MEN, RG-65, SimLex-999, and WordSim353 test sets. We report the performance in comparison with a Baseline in which, the word frequency has been used. The Baseline method uses a window to fix the influence of the neighboring words. Our approach improves the Spearman correlation coefficient for MEN, RG-65, SimLex-999, and WordSim353 datasets by 3.87%, 10.25%, 5.04%, and 5.24%, respectively. So, the experiment results show that the proposed context words selection, incorporating dependency distance, and using the WF-based shifting method significantly improve the performance.},

  abstract     = {The problem of vehicle redeployment in multi-period systems is studied in this paper. It is a sequential decision making problem that involves optimizing an objective over some planning horizon composed of multiple periods. In this work, the problem is handled with a hybrid local search and Q-learning algorithm. It integrates local search into the Dyna-Q algorithm and combines the system’s tactical and operational decision levels to find a multi-period policy for sharing vehicles between stations while optimizing the objective. Tests were carried out on synthetic and real instances, and the obtained results show how local search integration can improve the basic Dyna-Q algorithm.},
