  abstract     = {With the improvement in image processing and using the fact that eye movement can persist even with severe paralysis condition, we have developed a device that enables a severely paralysed patient to communicate. The device developed makes it possible for the patient to communicate in “yes” or “no” with the movement of the eyeball alone. In the proposed work, we have used Raspberry Pi as the main processor and Python as programming tool. A 5-megapixel camera is used to read eye movement, a speaker is used to speak “yes” or “no” for the patient and a normal power bank is used to supply the proposed setup. The designed device is efficient, cost-effective, lightweight, and can easily fit on the head.},

  abstract     = {This paper reports additional evidence of the high-pass filtering properties of the intensity-curvature functional (ICF). Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the human brain is used to calculate its ICF. MRA and ICF are direct Z-transformed. The pulsetransfer function (PTF) of the ICF is defined as the inverse Z-transform of the ratio between Z-space of ICF and Z-space of MRA. The image space of PTF is calculated and is direct Z-transformed. MRA is reconstructed through inverse Z-transform of the ratio between Z-space of ICF and Z-space of PTF. MRA reconstruction proves correctness of the approximated approach and adds evidence to the assumption that ICF is a high-pass filter. This research provides two novelties: (1) additional evidence that ICF is a high-pass filter and (2) a medical image processing technique that proves correct that the PTF of a high-pass filter (ICF) can be approximated by the ratio between Z-space of ICF and Z-space of MRA. It follows that MRA can be reconstructed using the inverse Z-transform of the ratio between Z-space of ICF and Z-space of PTF.},

  abstract     = {There is a widely shared and potentially well-justified enthusiasm for autonomous field-deployed (FD) wearable, implantable, and environmental sensors for the continuous monitoring of a variety of chronic conditions, such as diabetes, depression, irritable bowel syndrome, and soil nitrate depletion. These FD sensors are often viewed as miniaturized versions of laboratory-based or point-of-care (POC) biosensors, with the primary focus being on material development and mechanical form factor challenges (e.g., stretchability, flexibility, and biocompatibility). In this article, we highlight that the FD sensors are fundamentally different compared to lab-based or POC sensors. We borrow concepts from biology (e.g., bacteria) to quantify the fundamental challenges inherent to such sensors and strategies to overcome them.},

Especially, HfO 2 and ZrO 2 based ferroelectrics are promising for negative capacitance electronics due to their compatibility with modern transistor manufacturing processes. Recently, first negative capacitance transistors have been demonstrated. However, further investigations on the microscopic origin of negative capacitance in HfO 2 - and ZrO 2 -based ferroelectrics are needed. Lastly, opportunities for negative capacitance beyond transistors are discussed.},
