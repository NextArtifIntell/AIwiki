  abstract     = {A person’s preference to select or reject certain meals is influenced by several aspects, including colour. In this paper, we study the relevance of food colour for such preferences. To this end, a set of images of meals is processed by an automatic method that associates mood adjectives that capture such meal preferences. These adjectives are obtained by analyzing the colour palettes in the image, using a method based in Kobayashi’s model of harmonic colour combinations. The paper also validates that the colour palettes calculated for each image are harmonic by developing a rating model to predict how much a user would like the colour palettes obtained. This rating is computed using a regression model based on the COLOURlovers dataset implemented to learn users’ preferences. Finally, the adjectives associated automatically with images of dishes are validated by a survey which was responded by 178 people and demonstrates that the labels are adequate. The results obtained in this paper have applications in tourism marketing, to help in the design of marketing multimedia material, especially for promoting restaurants and gastronomic destinations.},

Here, we model social networks as fuzzy directed graphs to propose an application-oriented propagation process. To this aim, we investigate an interesting relationship between zero forcing set concept in graphs and IM problem in social networks. In spite of its attractive theory, its implementation is not efficient in the real world. Thus, we improve the fuzzy zero forcing set concept and suggest our fuzzy propagation model, simultaneously. Moreover, we present a polynomial time complexity algorithm to solve IM problems under the proposed propagation process. In particular, we consider a propagation parameter to control the size of the seed set and its coverage. Also, experimental results on some real world social networks show that the propagation model finds optimal and flexible seed set.},

  abstract     = {End users who cannot afford to collect and label big data to train accurate deep learning (DL) models resort to Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) providers, who provide paid access to accurate DL models. However, the lack of transparency in how the providers’ models make predictions causes a problem of trust. A way to increase trust (and also to align with ethical regulations) is for predictions to be accompanied by explanations locally and independently generated by the end users (rather than by explanations offered by the model providers). Explanation methods using internal components of DL models (a.k.a. model-specific explanations) are more accurate and effective than those relying solely on the inputs and outputs (a.k.a. model-agnostic explanations). However, end users lack white-box access to the internal components of the providers’ models. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel approach allowing an end user to locally generate model-specific explanations for a DL classification model accessed via a provider’s API. First, we approximate the provider’s model with a local surrogate model. We then use the surrogate model’s components to locally generate model-specific explanations that approximate the explanations obtainable with white-box access to the provider’s DL model. Specifically, we leverage the surrogate model’s gradients to generate adversarial examples that counterfactually explain why an input example is classified into a specific class. Our approach only requires the end user to have unlabeled data of size 0 . 5 % of the provider’s training data and with a similar distribution; given the small size and unlabeled nature of these data, they can be assumed to be already available to the end user or even to be supplied by the provider to build trust in his model. We demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on two ML tasks: image classification and tabular data classification. The locally generated explanations are consistent with those obtainable with white-box access to the provider’s model, thus giving end users an independent and reliable way to determine if the provider’s model is trustworthy.},

  abstract     = {The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) provides a systematic approach to the evaluation of alternatives based on pairwise comparison matrices (PCMs) under multiple criteria. As human evaluation is not always accurate and precise, each component of a PCM showing relative importance has been expressed by an interval or a fuzzy number. In this paper, we treat a PCM whose components are represented by twofold intervals. The twofold intervals are composed of inner and outer intervals showing the range of surely acceptable values and the complement of the range of surely unacceptable values for relative importance, respectively. One may apply a fuzzy AHP approach by building a trapezoidal fuzzy number from the inner and outer intervals. However, this approach does not always fit the given information. Because the twofold interval information ambiguously specifies the range of acceptable values for the relative importance. Then we appropriately translate this information into a set of intervals including the inner interval and included in the outer interval, assuming that the decision-maker evaluates the priority weights implicitly as intervals. We investigate the decision analysis based on the twofold interval PCM. Three conflict resolution methods are proposed for treating the inconsistency in the twofold interval PCM. Parametric methods for visualizing possible alternative orderings are proposed. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the differences between the proposed approach and the previous approaches.},

We consider the case where the possible ranges are given by fuzzy sets in this paper. The set-inclusive constraints with fuzzy coefficients have been treated by a necessity measure. However, the usual necessity measure cannot express well the decision-maker’s requirement about the trade-off between the robustness level and the satisfaction level of the constraints. We extend the necessity measure to incorporate the trade-off between the robustness level and the satisfaction level of the constraints. We apply the extended necessity measure to LP problems with fuzzy coefficients. After the problem is formulated and reduced to the conventional programming problem, we propose a solution algorithm.

  abstract     = {The primary memory of the computer gets corrupted due to microparticles that possess a great deal of energy. This causes transient kind of errors and it is called subtle errors. High corruption of data in computer systems has been occurred because of these errors. Major sources of subtle errors include ionic particles, huge radiations say example alpha, beta and gamma rays, protons, neutrons etc., When TCAM configuration changes from 120 nm to 20 nm technology, there was a drastic increase in subtle errors more than multiples of eight. Devices operated in low power regions are more prone to subtle errors. Memory storage devices like secondary memory element called cache, registers are more feasible to subtle errors. 1 Behavior of subtle errors never damage circuit configuration but changes the information content leading to erroneous data. The proposed architecture is called N -SEARCH KEY TCAM, where in this system, it has been predicted that occurrence of subtle errors are very small. This innovative method of detecting and correcting both single and burst type of subtle errors has many modules like TCAM, Multiplexer, control circuit and Error correction code frame. Moreover, the proposed architecture N-SEARCH KEY ternary memory uses a special LUT for matching process. A key named Search key was generated which contains don’t care bits for matching subtle errors. Unlike regular TCAM, this design uses sequential LUT which enhances matching time of order O ( wn log2 n ) . Initially, proposed scheme have been used to find single bit subtle errors by changing forbearance factor ( F ) and chances of occurrence of error among TCAM information. The design was enhanced to detect multiple subtle errors and rectified the same. If match not occurs with predetermined information, then IP filter forbids the unauthorized users from using global network resources, thus providing better information security. By the proposed method, number of improper segregation ratio decreases with increase in Forbearance ratio parameter and time required to detect and correct the same is also considerably reduced. By controlling the forbearance factor F , the best duration schemes can be chosen. Through the given architecture, average time consumption for error checking of subtle errors would range from 0.6 to 0.7 μ s.},

The second wave caused more losses in the economy than the first wave and increased the death rate. To avoid this, various methods were developed to find infected cases during the regulated national lockdown, but the infected cases still harmed unregulated incidents.

Forecasting systems based on ML have shown their importance in interpreting perioperative effects to accelerate decision-making in the potential course of action. ML models have been used for long to define and prioritize adverse threat variables in several technology domains. To manage forecasting challenges, many prediction approaches have been used extensively. The paper shows the ability of ML models to estimate the amount of forthcoming COVID-19 victims that is now considered a serious threat to civilization. COVID-19 describes the comparative study on ML algorithms for predicting COVID-19, depicts the data to be predicted, and analyses the attributes of COVID-19 cases in different places. It gives an underlying benchmark to exhibit the capability of ML models for future examination.},

  abstract     = {Social platforms have become one of the major sources of unstructured text. Investigating the unstructured text and interpreting the meaning is a complex job. Sentiment Analysis is an emerging approach as the social platforms have lot of opinionated data. 1 It uses language processing, classification of texts and linguistics to retrieve the opinions from the text. Twitter is a micro blogging site which is popular amongst the social users as it is a vast open data-platform and it witnesses lot of sentiments. Twitter Sentiment Analysis is a process of automatic mining of user tweets for opinions, emotions, attitude to derive useful insights into community opinions and classify the opinions as well. Due to the enormous increase in the number of collaborative tweets, it has become complex to identify the terms that carries sentiments. Also, the unstructured tweets may have non-relevant terms and reduce the classification accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a Social-Spider Lex Feature Ensemble Model-Based Syntactic-Senti Rule prediction Recurrent Neural Network Classifier (S 2 LFEM-S2RRNN) to obtain better classification accuracy. Twitter is used as source of data and we have extracted the tweets using Twitter API. Initially, data pre-processing is done to remove unwanted data, symbols and content terms are extracted to improvise the dataset. Then, the significant lexical content terms are extracted employing the proposed Social Spider Lex Feature Ensemble Model (S 2 LFEM) based on Syntactic-Senti Rule Prediction. The semantics 4 of the terms are analysed on the verbs, subjectivity of the tweet patterns to count the overall weightage of tweets. Based on tweet weightage Recurrent Neural Network is trained to classify the tweets int to positive, negative and neutral. The experiment results show that the proposed classifier outperforms the existing models for sentiment classification in terms of accuracy with a performance score 94.1%.},

  abstract     = {News methods are the main source of news for people around the world. However, there was a surprising rise in social media spread in later periods due to the significant increase in technology and updates. Fake news is as old as the news industry - misinformation, hoax, propaganda and satire have been around for a long time. So fake news is untrue and false information without proper evidence. Auto-detection technology is being built and studied on artificial intelligence and deep learning to address fake news’s rise and spread. This method’s efforts have been made to automate the process of fake news detection. This existing machine learning method has less classification accuracy, and multiple combination Machine learning methods have not consumed memory usage; it provides a higher false rate. Overcome this problem by introducing a deep learning method, namely Radial Restricted Boltzmann Machines with Functional Neural Network (R 2 BM-FNN), to reduce memory usage from a large set of training data. Initially, to apply the Count Victories distribution for data preprocessing to remove the stop words and unrelated text from data sets.

  abstract     = {Sepsis is a common and deadly condition that must be treated eloquently within 19 hours. Numerous deep learning techniques, including Recurrent Neural Networks, Convolution Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory, and Gated Recurrent Units, have been suggested for diagnosing long-term sepsis. Regardless, a sizable portion of them are computationally risky and have precision problems. The primary issue described is that output will degrade, and resource utilization will expand proportionately as the volume of dependencies grows. To overcome these issues, we propose a G-Sep technique utilizing Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit Algorithm, which consumes much less resource to detect the disease and in a short time with better accuracy than the existing methods to diagnose the sepsis. AI models could assist with distinguishing potential clinical factors and give better than existing conventional low-execution models. The proposed model is implemented utilizing Conda and Tensorflow Framework using the California Inpatient Severe Sepsis (CISS) Patient Dataset. The comparative simulation of the various existing models and the proposed G-Sep model is done using Conda and Tensor frameworks. The simulation results revealed that the proposed model had outperformed other frameworks in terms of mean average precision (mAP), receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), and Area under the ROC Curve (AUROC) metrics linearly.},

  abstract     = {Associated path detection is considered as the major concern of the traditional shortest path issue. The associated path is generally represented by the shortest distance among the source and destination. In the transportation network, distance or cost detection may identify this associated path. Specifically, it is very important to discover the shortest distance that has a minimum number of nodes, and it will give the most optimized result. In this paper, the Fuzzy based Pareto Optimal (FPO) approach is used to discover the shortest paths in a network graph. Initially, the FPO technique finds the shortest paths in a network by using set of rules. Then, the Lexicographical model uses a set of rules to rank the shortest distance based on minimum distance value. From the ranking results, the optimal shortest path is selected based on the proposed Ant Lion Optimization (ALO) algorithm. So, this paper achieves multi objectives like shortest path ranking and selection of the optimal shortest path. Time, distance or cost, convergence time, fitness function, and mean square error are the parameters used to relate the performance of the proposed technique with state-of-the-art techniques. Comparative results display the robustness and proficiency of the proposed system with several works.},

The traditional TS prediction models take more prediction time, overfitting and under-fitting of training data.

In this study, learning process of the Cellular Automata (CA) is performed by the Support Vector Regression (SVR) method. The better discretize property of the SVR increases the learning rate and reduces the complexity of the CA. The proposed model is named as a Range Regression Automata Model based on Support Vector (RRAMSV) and this model calculates the multiple temperature attributes like soil temperature, air temperature, relative humidity and soil humidity. The proposed RRAMSV method has higher performance in most of the time-series prediction compared to Range Linear Regression (RLR), Range Logistic Regression (RLOR) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) — Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).

  abstract     = {Game Theory (GT) is the study of strategic decision making. By virtue of its importance, several GT based methodologies for Feature Selection (FS) are proposed in recent times. FS problem can be abstracted as a game by considering each feature as a player and their values as their strategies. Additionally, overall goal of the game is set to classify a data instance appropriately. Most of the existing GT based FS techniques are restricted to Zero Sum Games, Non-Zero Sum Games and Cooperative Games. The classical setting of assuming that all the details of players are known to all players cannot hold in many real-world problems. When the given features are independent, they cannot be treated alike and a characteristics based uncertainty persists among the features. This uncertainty is handled by none of the game forms used in the existing methods. Unlike the mentioned game techniques, Bayesian Games (BG) address the games with imperfect information. This paper investigate the FS problem in terms of BG and proposes a novel method to select the best features. The proposed BG based FS method is a filter type FS method and it starts with identifying Principle Features (PF) and proceeds to play global pairwise Bayesian games between those PF to obtain feature scores. Later, the features are ranked using these scores. In the final stage, a forward selection method with Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to evaluate the classification performance of the ranked features and helps in the selection of the optimal set of features. Besides these, to improve the scalability of the proposed method MapReduce paradigm is exploited. In order to show the efficacy of the proposed method, experiments are carried out with seven real-world datasets from UCI and Statlog repositories. The promising results showed a significant improvement in the classification performance with fewer selected features than which is achieved using the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Decisions in real-life can be adversely affected by various uncertainty-sources such as perception-diversity, data-structure and analytical tools. Fuzzy clustering can successfully handle the uncertainties while recognizing patterns in any given data. Nevertheless, type-1 fuzzy clustering techniques has uncertainties on account of precise-nature of primary memberships. Type-2 fuzzy clustering are preferred by many researchers to manage uncertainty in its type-1 version. In type-2 fuzzy clustering, order of fuzziness (fuzzifier) is obtained by interval-valued or general type-2 fuzzy sets. Interval type-2 fuzzy clustering can reduce the computational complexity of type-2 fuzzy set mathematics. However, general type-2 fuzzy clustering scrutinizes uncertainty in fuzzifier using linguistic sets. Interval and general type-2 fuzzy clustering algorithms include type-reduction approaches to obtain type-1 fuzzy sets. Besides, full type-2 fuzzy c-means can be used as a foundation approach in type-2 fuzzy inferences. Although this algorithm includes precise-fuzzifier, it gives a point of view to practically calculate secondary memberships. In this paper, an adaptive type-2 fuzzy clustering algorithm is proposed to manage the uncertainty-sources with a self-reduction procedure. Several numerical results and comparisons are given to demonstrate the achievement of this proposed algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with type-1 and type-2 versions for various multi-dimensional pattern sets from UCI-patterns, Berkeley segmentation database and a real-life application related to sustainable supplier selection in an automotive industry. Consequently, the proposed algorithm reveals fast, convenient and precise results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we have proposed a stochastic Knapsack Problem (KP) based mathematical model for small-scale vegetable sellers in India and solved it by an advanced Genetic Algorithm. The knapsack problem considered here is a bounded one, where vegetables are the objects. In this model, we have assumed that different available vegetables (objects) have different weights (that are available), purchase costs, and profits. The maximum weight of vegetables that can be transported by a seller is limited by the carrying capacity of the vegetable carrier and the business capital of the seller is also limited. The aim of the proposed mathematical model is to maximize the total profit of the loaded/traded items, with a set of predefined constraints on the part of the vegetable seller or retailer. This problem has been solved in a Type-2 fuzzy environment and the Critical Value (CV) reduction method is utilized to defuzzify the objective value. We have projected an improved genetic algorithm based approach, where we have incorporated two features, namely refinement and immigration. We have initially considered benchmark instances and subsequently some redefined cases for experimentation.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a method that improves multiplicative consistency based on a fractional programming model to derive the normalized intuitionistic fuzzy priority weight vector from an intuitionistic fuzzy preference relation. To do so, a new definition is formulated that captures previous definitions for multiplicative consistency of intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations. A transformation formula is proposed to convert the normalized intuitionistic fuzzy priority weight vector into a multiplicative consistent intuitionistic fuzzy preference relation. By using the properties of some function, we construct a deviation matrix and prove that the elements in the intuitionistic fuzzy preference relation corresponding to the largest value in the deviation matrix is the most inconsistent. This method not only preserves a lot of the original preference judgments, but also reduce many operations in comparison with previous methods to improve multiplicative inconsistency. Several numerical examples are given to convince the proposed model and method.},

  abstract     = {Generally, in every decision-making process under the fuzzy domain, ranking of fuzzy numbers is indispensable. Although such approaches are abundant, yet a universally accepted approach is not apparent. Hence, newer methodologies have been developed since its inception. In many instances, defuzzification techniques are being criticized as these methodologies are based on intuition and the geometry of the fuzzy numbers. Furthermore, in many instances the reasonable properties that a ranking method should follow are not being verified. However, in the current study, a novel defuzzification technique is being developed with the notion of value and multiple of a ambiguity inclusion-exclusion function, 𝜃 , with ambiguity at various decision levels. The current method perfectly obeys the intuition and the geometry of the fuzzy numbers. Adding to this, it should be emphasized that the current methodology follows all the reasonable properties of a ranking method. Furthermore, new properties are stated and proved which illustrate the novelty of the present method. Furthermore, the shortcomings and drawbacks of the existing methods are overcome by the current methodology. Noteworthy, the current method ranks the fuzzy numbers and their corresponding images consistently, which was not evident in most of the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {The main intention of this paper is to develop a new intelligent framework for web page classification and re-ranking. The two main phases of the proposed model are (a) classification, and (b) re-ranking-based retrieval. In the classification phase, pre-processing is initially performed, which follows the steps like HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) tag removal, punctuation marks removal, stop words removal, and stemming. After pre-processing, word to vector formation is done and then, feature extraction is performed by Principle Component Analysis (PCA). From this, optimal feature selection is accomplished, which is the important process for the accurate classification of web pages. Web pages contain several features, which reduces the classification accuracy. Here, the adoption of a new meta-heuristic algorithm termed Opposition based-Tunicate Swarm Algorithm (O-TSA) is employed to perform the optimal feature selection. Finally, the selected features are subjected to the Enhanced Convolutional-Recurrent Neural Network (E-CRNN) for accurate web page classification with enhancement based on O-TSA. The outcome of this phase is the categorization of different web page classes. In the second phase, the re-ranking is involved utilizing the O-TSA, which derives the objective function based on similarity function (correlation) for URL matching, which results in optimal re-ranking of web pages for retrieval. Thus, the proposed method yields better classification and re-ranking performance and reduce space requirements and search time in the web documents compared with the existing methods.},

The magnificent performance reported by machine learning and deep learning methods in the previous epidemic has encouraged researchers to develop systems with these methods to diagnose COVID-19. Methods: In this paper, an ensemble-based multi-level voting model is proposed to diagnose COVID-19 from chest x-rays. The multi-level voting model proposed in this paper is built using four machine learning algorithms namely Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel, and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). These algorithms are trained with features extracted using the ResNet50 deep learning model before merging them to form the voting model. In this work, voting is performed at two levels, at level 1 these four algorithms are grouped into 2 sets consisting of two algorithms each (set 1 — SVM with linear kernel and LR and set 2 — RF and KNN) and intra set hard voting is performed. At level 2 these two sets are merged using hard voting to form the proposed model. Results: The proposed multilevel voting model outperformed all the machine learning algorithms, pre-trained models, and other proposed works with an accuracy of 100% and specificity of 100%. Conclusion: The proposed model helps for the faster diagnosis of COVID-19 across the globe.},

In this paper, a novel method, called Minimum Information Gain Roughness (MIGR), is proposed to select the clustering attribute based on information entropy with rough set theory. To evaluate its performance, three benchmark UCI datasets are chosen to be clustered by using MIGR. Then, the resulting clusters are compared to those which are resulted from applying Min-Min-Rough (MMR) and information-theoretic dependency roughness (ITDR) algorithms. Both last-mentioned techniques were already compared with a variety of clustering algorithms like k-modes, fuzzy centroids, and fuzzy k-modes. The Global purity, the overall purity, and F-measure are considered here as performance measures to compare the quality of the resulting clusters. The experimental results show that the MIGR algorithm outperforms both MMR and ITDR algorithms for clustering categorical data.},

  abstract     = {Today’s datasets are usually very large with many features and making analysis on such datasets is really a tedious task. Especially when performing classification, selecting attributes that are salient for the process is a brainstorming task. It is more difficult when there are many class labels for the target class attribute and hence many researchers have introduced methods to select features for performing classification on multi-class attributes. The process becomes more tedious when the attribute values are imbalanced for which researchers have contributed many methods. But, there is no sufficient research to handle extreme imbalance and feature selection together and hence this paper aims to bridge this gap. Here Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), an efficient evolutionary algorithm is used to handle imbalanced dataset and feature selection process is also enhanced with the required functionalities. First, Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization is used to transform the imbalanced datasets into balanced one and then another version of Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization is used to select the significant features. The proposed methodology is applied on eight multi-class extremely imbalanced datasets and the experimental results are found to be better than other existing methods in terms of classification accuracy, G mean, F measure. The results validated by using Friedman test also confirm that the proposed methodology effectively balances the dataset with less number of features than other methods.},

At first, the process is performed by inputting the data to the Course subscription matrix for constructing the matrix based on learner interest and courses. Here, course grouping is performed using Interval type-2 Fuzzy Local Enhancement Based Rough K-means Clustering. Furthermore, the course is matched with input data based on entropy and angular distance. Finally, the sentiment classification is performed using the Ontology-based approach SentiWordNet and Deep Neural Network (DNN). Here, the DNN is trained with the proposed BWO algorithm, and thus the course recommendation is attained by offering a suitable course recommendation to learners.},

This paper develops a novel 3-tuple linguistic distance-based model to evaluate whether an overall respondents perception meets a firm’s expectation (“go”) for new product development. The respondent’s perception is collected by a Kansei-based survey as an interval-linguistic term. Then, an expected distance between the firm’s expectation and the respondent’s perception is computed by a target-based Manhattan distance measure. The expected distance is compared with a threshold to shows that what product attribute meets the firm’s expectation based on customers’ perceptions. A real case study of Thai-tea soy milk packaging design is provided. The proposed model is compared to the existing model to show its effectiveness and applicability. Experimental results show that the proposed model can effectively point out the inferior product attributes, which leads to redesign the product until all product concepts meet the target attributes before launching the product to the market. Thus, it can significantly reduce the risk of failure of the product in a real market. This paper has significant contributions in that it allows respondents to provide their opinions with uncertainty by providing an interval linguistic assessment, handles a bias of the heterogeneity of respondents by determining the weight of respondents, and overcomes limitations of existing models by applying target-oriented linguistic terms.},

The considered system in this paper is a large-scale system. So, the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy approach which uses nonlinear local models is applied to estimate the nonlinear system to reduce the burden of modeling. The model predictive control (MPC) is a practical application that is useful for all systems but the problem is the online computational cost. For large-scale systems, this problem is the online computational burden. Besides, it leads to conservative or even no solution. By the proposed method, more relaxed solutions are achieved. First, the T-S system with nonlinear local models is adopted. Second, the hierarchical optimization scheme is considered for the optimization part of the MPC. Third, by inspiring the H ∞ performance, uncertainties and disturbances that are appeared are reduced. Moreover, the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are used to solve the proposed method that the computational burden significantly is reduced at the same time. Simulation results are finally presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

  abstract     = {This article builds the fuzzy clustering algorithm for interval data (FCAI). In the proposed algorithm, we use the overlap distance as a criterion to cluster for interval data. The FCAI can determine not only the suitable number of clusters, the elements in each cluster but also the probability of assigning the elements to the established clusters at the same time. In addition, we also consider the convergence of the proposed algorithm by the theory and illustrated it by the numerical examples. The FCAI is applied well in image recognition, a problem with many challenges nowadays. Using the Grey Level Co-occurrence matrices (GLCMs), we propose a novel texture extraction approach to generate featured intervals. The complex computations of the FCAI can be performed conveniently and efficiently by the established Matlab program. We utilize the corrected rand indexes (CR) to find the suitable number of clusters while a partition entropy (PE) and partition coefficients (PC) are applied to argue the quality of fuzzy clusters. As a result, the experiments on the data sets having different characteristics and elements show the reasonableness of the proposed algorithm and its advantages in comparison to the existing ones.

  abstract     = {Context-aware recommender systems (CARS) are a key component in businesses, notably in the e-transactions domain, since they assume that reviews, ratings, demographics, and other factors may determine customer preferences. On contrary, while evaluating the sentiment underlying the reviews and the rating score, consumers’ opinion is typically conflicting. As a result, a framework that employs either a review or a rating for top-N recommendation directs to produce unsatisfied recommendations in addition to a meager rating problem and high computation time. To overcome all the problems, a novel sentiment enhanced stacked autoencoder (SSAE) with context-specific hesitant fuzzy item hierarchical clustering (CHFHC) approach is proposed which employs online and offline phases. In the offline-phase, the meager user-item rating matrix is smoothed by learning the users’ concrete preference to a complete matrix by the SSAE approach. They are clustered offline using the CHFHC approach into context-based similar item clusters. In the online-phase, the active user gets context-based recommendations from the most similar cluster that matches the active users’ current context situation. Hence the SSAE_CHFHC approach improves the quality of Top-N recommendation corresponding to the exact contextual situation of the active user with a minimal recommendation computation time. Experiments on the (5-core) Amazon and yelp datasets proved that the intended SSAE_CHFHC framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms on a variety of evaluation measures.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering algorithm is an important and popular clustering algorithm which is utilized in various application domains such as pattern recognition, machine learning, and data mining. Although this algorithm has shown acceptable performance in diverse problems, the current literature does not have studies about how they can improve the clustering quality of partitions with overlapping classes. The better the clustering quality of a partition, the better is the interpretation of the data, which is essential to understand real problems. This work proposes two robust FCM algorithms to prevent ambiguous membership into clusters. For this, we compute two types of weights: an weight to avoid the problem of overlapping clusters; and other weight to enable the algorithm to identify clusters of different shapes. We perform a study with synthetic datasets, where each one contains classes of different shapes and different degrees of overlapping. Moreover, the study considered real application datasets. Our results indicate such weights are effective to reduce the ambiguity of membership assignments thus generating a better data interpretation.},

  abstract     = {In recent times, bacterial Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) analyses becomes a hot study topic. The AMR comprises information related to the antibiotic product name, class name, subclass name, type, subtype, gene type, etc., which can fight against the illness. However, the tagging language used to determine the data is of free context. These contexts often contain ambiguous data, which leads to a hugely challenging issue in retrieving, organizing, merging, and finding the relevant data. Manually reading this text and labelling is not time-consuming. Hence, topic modeling overcomes these challenges and provides efficient results in categorizing the topic and in determining the data. In this view, this research work designs an ensemble of artificial intelligence for categorizing the AMR gene data and determine the relationship between the antibiotics. The proposed model includes a weighted voting based ensemble model by the incorporation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks (HRNN), shows the novelty of the work. It is used for determining the amount of “topics” that cluster utilizing a multidimensional scaling approach. In addition, the proposed model involves the data pre-processing stage to get rid of stop words, punctuations, lower casing, etc. Moreover, an explanatory data analysis uses word cloud which assures the proper functionality and to proceed with the model training process. Besides, three approaches namely perplexity, Harmonic mean, and Random initialization of K are employed to determine the number of topics. For experimental validation, an openly accessible Bacterial AMR reference gene database is employed. The experimental results reported that the perplexity provided the optimal number of topics from the AMR gene data of more than 6500 samples. Therefore, the proposed model helps to find the appropriate antibiotic for bacterial and viral spread and discover how to increase the proper antibiotic in human bodies},

The goal of an automatic text summarization is to preserve the key information and the overall meaning of the article to be summarized. In this paper, a graph-based approach is followed to generate an extractive summary, where sentences of the article are considered as vertices, and weighted edges are introduced based on the cosine similarities among the vertices. A possible subset of maximal independent sets of vertices of the graph is identified with the assumption that adjacent vertices provide sentences with similar information. The degree centrality and clustering coefficient of the vertices are used to compute the score of each of the maximal independent sets. The set with the highest score provides the final summary of the article. The proposed method is evaluated using the benchmark BBC News data to demonstrate its effectiveness and is applied to the COVID-19 Twitter data to express its applicability in topic modeling. Both the application and comparative study with other methods illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {In the present times, artificial-intelligence based techniques are considered as one of the prominent ways to classify images which can be conveniently leveraged in the real-world scenarios. This technology can be extremely beneficial to the lepidopterists, to assist them in classification of the diverse species of Rhopalocera, commonly called as butterflies. In this article, image classification is performed on a dataset of various butterfly species, facilitated via the feature extraction process of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) along with leveraging the additional features calculated independently to train the model. The classification models deployed for this purpose predominantly include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM). However, each of these methods tend to focus on one specific class of features. Therefore, an ensemble of multiple classes of features used for classification of images is implemented. This research paper discusses the results achieved from the classification performed on basis of two different classes of features i.e., structure and texture. The amalgamation of the two specified classes of features forms a combined data set, which has further been used to train the Growing Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN), resulting in higher accuracy of the classification model. The experiment performed resulted in promising outcomes with TP rate, FP rate, Precision, recall and F-measure values as 0.9690, 0.0034, 0.9889, 0.9692 and 0.9686 respectively. Furthermore, an accuracy of 96.98% was observed by the proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {In this paper problem of offline signature verification has been discussed with a novel high-performance convolution Siamese network. The paper proposes modifications in the already existing convolution Siamese network. The proposed method makes use of the Batch Normalization technique instead of Local Response Normalization to achieve better accuracy. The regularization factor has been added in the fully connected layers of the convolution neural network to deal with the problem of overfitting. Apart from this, a wide range of learning rates are provided during the training of the model and optimal one having the least validation loss is used. To evaluate the proposed changes and compare the results with the existing solution, our model is validated on three benchmarks datasets viz. CEDAR, BHSig260, and GPDS Synthetic Signature Corpus. The evaluation is done via two methods firstly by Test-Train validation and then by K-fold cross-validation ( K = 5), to test the skill of our model. We show that the proposed modified Siamese network outperforms all the prior results for offline signature verification. One of the major advantages of our system is its capability of handling an unlimited number of new users which is the drawback of many research works done in the past.},

Researchers have focused on designing algorithms using deep learning models based on statistical information to address the challenges of traditional payload and port-based traffic classification techniques. Internet of Things (IoT) and Software Defined Network (SDN) are two popular technologies nowadays and aims to connect devices over the internet and intelligently control networks from a centralized space. IoT aims to connect billions of devices; therefore, classification is essential for efficient processing. SDN is a new networking paradigm, which separates data plane measurement from the control plane. The emergence of deep learning algorithms with SDN provides a scalable traffic classification architecture. Due to the inadequate results of payload and port-based approaches, a statistical technique to classify network traffic into different classes using a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is presented in this paper. This paper provides a classification method for software defined IoT networks. The results show that, contrary to other traffic classification methods, the proposed approach offered a better accuracy rate of over 99 %, which is promising.},

Since its outbreak, infectious disease has rapidly spread across the globe. The testing methods adopted by the medical practitioners gave false negatives, which is a big challenge. Medical imaging using deep learning can be adopted to speed up the testing process and avoid false negatives. This work proposes a novel approach, COVID-19 GAN, to perform coronavirus disease classification using medical image synthesis by a generative adversarial network. Detecting coronavirus infections from the chest X-ray images is very crucial for its early diagnosis and effective treatment. To boost the performance of the deep learning model and improve the accuracy of classification, synthetic data augmentation is performed using generative adversarial networks. Here, the available COVID-19 positive chest X-ray images are fed into the styleGAN2 model. The styleGAN model is trained, and the data necessary for training the deep learning model for coronavirus classification is generated. The generated COVID-19 positive chest X-ray images and the normal chest X-ray images are fed into the deep learning model for training. An accuracy of 99.78% is achieved in classifying chest X-ray images using CNN binary classifier model.},

  abstract     = {The quality of food and the safety of consumer is one of the major essential things in our day-to-day life. To ensure the quality of foods through their various attributes, different types of methods have been introduced. In this proposed method, three underlying blocks namely Hyperspectral Food Image Context Extractor (HFICE), Hyperspectral Context Fuzzy Classifier (HCFC) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Food Quality Analyzer (CFQA). Hyperspectral Food Image Context Extractor module is used as the preprocess to get food attributes such as texture, color, size, shape and molecular particulars. Hyperspectral Context Fuzzy Classifier module identifies a particular part of the food (zone entity) is whether carbohydrate, fat, protein, water or unusable core. CNN for Food Quality Analyzer module uses a Tuned Convolutional Layer, Heuristic Activation Operation, Parallel Element Merge Layer and a regular fully connected layer. Indian Pines, Salinas and Pavia are the benchmark dataset to evaluate hyperspectral image-based machine learning procedures. These datasets are used along with a dedicated chicken meat Hyper Spectral Imaging dataset is used in the training and testing process. Results are obtained that about 7.86% of average values in various essential evaluation metrics such as performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity have improved when compared to existing state of the art results.},

  abstract     = {Experiential and stochastic learning algorithms for improving the time consumed in robot’s part micro-assembly procedures are presented. A comprehensive comparison of the results with other recent algorithms is described. The experiential learning algorithm unites the neighboring sections in a manner that is very similar to the larger united section based on the specified criterion. If the experiential learning algorithm is consecutively repeated, the micro-assembly dynamics analysis chart will be not only minimized in the number of sections, but also formed such that each united section will have one selected optimal plan with the lowest modified fuzzy metric distance within its own section. Thus, if the new input appertaining to the section is merely identified, the final selected plan within the section will execute the related task quickly and accurately thus resulting to a significant improvement in the time spent in the part insertion. Through the stochastic learning algorithm extended from the crisp set domain to the fuzzy set domain, based on the probability of a fuzzy event and the modified fuzzy metric distance, to deal well with the uncertainties arising during the micro-assembly procedure, if one specific plan among the feasible plans is successively selected to solve its confronting micro-assembly problems, the probability that the selected plan will be continuously chosen will increase as a consequence of compensation, namely, a higher value of membership degree is continuously allocated to the selected plan. As a result, the selected control plan with the highest probability of success and the lowest degree of uncertainty acquired by the stochastic learning facilitates the stabilization of the execution phase of the part insertion task. The degree of uncertainty, which is measured by a modified fuzzy metric distance and related to the task execution of the micro-assembly, is used as a criterion to select the most valid plan. The results demonstrate that the micro-assembly stuck problems can be successfully resolved by the experiential and stochastic learning algorithms.},

  abstract     = {By analyzing users’ behavior data for personalized services, most state-of-the-art methods for user preference modeling are often based on batch-mode machine learning algorithms, where all rating data are assumed to be available throughout the training process. However, data in the real world often arrives sequentially and user preference may change dynamically. The real-time characteristics of rating data make the algorithms for preference modeling challenging to suit real-world online applications. By the user preference model (UPM) based on Bayesian network with a latent variable (BNLV), uncertain relationships among relevant attributes of users, objects and ratings could be represented, in which user preference is represented by the latent variable. In this paper, we propose an online approach for parameter learning of UPM. Specifically, we first extend the classic Voting EM algorithm by using Bayesian estimation in terms of the situation with latent variables. Consequently, we propose the algorithm for learning parameters of UPM from few and sequentially-changing rating data to reflect the gradually changing preferences. Finally, we test the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm by conducting experiments on various datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method in various measurements.},

  abstract     = {Many modern applications such as sensor networks produce probabilistic data. These data are collected into an uncertain database. To interpret uncertainty and to mine frequent patterns in an uncertain database, all possible certain databases are considered, which generates an exponential number of combinations and makes the mining problem highly complicated. In practice, mining is interactive, which makes the discovery of frequent itemsets in an uncertain database even more challenging. The objective of interactive mining is to shorten the time that is required to obtain the desired patterns in the iterated lengthy mining process. The time-consuming mining process in an uncertain database is exacerbated by repeated processing if the mining is performed from scratch. Therefore, we propose an interactive mining algorithm called iDIP to solve this problem. The iDIP algorithm adopts an approximation mechanism to mine the patterns and prunes candidates by using the existing patterns. Comprehensive experiments using both real and synthetic datasets show that iDIP outperforms the well-known re-mining-based MB algorithm for 4.3 times faster on average. In addition, iDIP has good linear scalability.},

The basic objective of this model is to minimize the risk of portfolio while maximizing expected return of the portfolio. The proposed model is based on the Mean Absolute Deviation Model (MAD) proposed by Konno-Yamazaki. Considering the uncertainty of expected returns in the Mean Absolute Deviation Model, the problem was remodeled with fuzzy logic approach. In the application section, the proposed model has been applied to two different indexes, namely Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE-30) and Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 (S&amp;P 500). In application, 64-month return movements of stocks traded in both indexes between 01.01.2016-30.04.2021 were used. In order to examine the effectiveness of the model, firstly, monthly return data for both indexes were modeled with the Mean-Absolute Deviation method and the Mean Variance method.

  abstract     = {Malignant liver tumors are considered as one of the most common cancers and a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. While using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction from ultrasound (US) images and tasks thereafter, most works focus on pre-trained architectures using transfer learning which can sometimes cause negative transfer and reduced performance in medical domain. A new method based on Pascal’s Triangle was developed for feature extraction using CNN. The convolutions and the kernels in Pascal’s Triangle based CNN (PT-CNN) are according to the coefficients at each level of Pascal’s Triangle. Due to the fuzzy nature of US images, the input layer takes a combination of the image and its neutrosophically pre-processed components as a single unit to improve noise robustness. The proposed CNN when implemented as a backbone for feature extraction for binary classification, gave validation accuracy &gt; 90% and test accuracy &gt;95% than other state-of-the-art CNN architectures. For tumor segmentation using Mask R-CNN framework, the aggregated feature maps from all convolutional layers were given as the input to the region proposal network for multiscale region proposals and to facilitate the detection of tumors of varying sizes. This gave an F1 score &gt; 0.95 when compared with other architectures as backbone on Mask R-CNN framework and simple U-Net based segmentation. It is suggested that the promising results of PT-CNN as a feature extraction backbone could be further investigated in other domains.},

It has been an amazing topic through recent years. Later studies proposed algorithms and heuristics to either accelerate seed selection process or introduce new diffusion models. Two of important aspects in diffusion are trust and time. There have been several studies in either aspect, but to our best knowledge there is a great lack in considering both time and trust together in articles. Still one other important problem is the propagation of negative ideas. It is obvious that we cannot neglect this type of effects and must find a way to reduce it or “ USE ” it in a wise way. We chose to use this effect against their selves and maximize the positive effect. In addition, we considered time constraint to better sculpt the real world in our diffusion model. We used a greedy based framework to select seed nodes. By utilizing an approximation for marginal influence, the seed selection process is accelerated. Comparing with other related methods, results show the superiority of our proposed method while dealing with two important and complex matters.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the researches on Question Answering (QA) systems attract progressive attention with the enlargement of data and the advances on machine learning. Selection of answers from QA system is a significant task for enhancing the automatic QA systems. However, the major complexity relies in the designing of contextual factors and semantic matching. Motivation: Question Answering is a specialized form of Information Retrieval which seeks knowledge. We are not only interested in getting the relevant pages but we are interested in getting specific answer to queries. Question Answering is in itself intersection of Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, Machine Learning, Knowledge Representation, Logic and Inference and Semantic Search. Contribution: Feature extraction plays a major role for accurate classification, where the learned features get extracted for enhancing the capability of sequence learning. Optimized Deep Belief network model is adopted for the precise question answering system, which could handle both objective and subjective questions. A new hybrid optimization algorithm known as Lioness Adapted GWO (LA-GWO) algorithm is introduced, which mainly concentrates on high reliability and convergence rate. This paper intends to formulate a novel QA system, and the process starts with word embedding. From the embedded results, some of the features get extracted, and subsequently, the classification is carried out using the hybrid optimization enabled Deep Belief Network (DBN). Specifically, the hidden neurons in DBN will be optimally tuned using a new Lioness Adapted GWO (LA-GWO) algorithm, which is the hybridization of both Lion Algorithm (LA) and Grey Wolf optimization (GWO) models. Finally, the performance of proposed work is compared over other conventional methods with respect to accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Yager have proposed the extending set measures to Pythagorean fuzzy sets, which is able to efficiently solve the problems of uncertain information representation in Pythagorean fuzzy environment. However, the Pythagorean fuzzy sets represent a limited range of fields, while the q -rung orthopair fuzzy sets can represent many fuzzy sets, including the Pythagorean fuzzy sets, Fermatean fuzzy sets, and intuitionistic fuzzy sets. In order to extend the extending set measures to Pythagorean fuzzy sets to a broader range, the paper proposes the extending set measures to orthopair fuzzy sets, which can extend the extending set measures to Pythagorean fuzzy sets to q -rung orthopair fuzzy environment. The extending set measures to orthopair fuzzy sets combined with level sets, measure, principle extension and Choquet Integral, which can greatly extend the ability of representing unknown information and processing unknown information. If the q -rung orthopair fuzzy sets degenerate into to Pythagorean fuzzy sets, then the extending set measures to orthopair fuzzy sets will be generated as the extending set measures to Pythagorean fuzzy sets. Numerical examples are designed to prove the effectiveness of the proposed models and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can extend the extending set measures to Pythagorean fuzzy sets to q -rung orthopair fuzzy environment successfully and solve issues of decision making under q -rung orthopair fuzzy environment effectively.},

We study the application of variational iteration method in finding the approximate solution of SIR model with fuzzy initial value. The presented method have been applied in a direct way without linearization, disretization or perturbation. Result obtained by this method and fuzzy initial value shows that both are in excellent agreement which indicates their affectiveness and reliability.},

  abstract     = {We consider a generalization of aggregation and fusion functions when some of their inputs or outputs are undefined. For simplicity, we represent undefined values by a single NaN (not-a-number) value. We define four main methods of treating undefined values, observe some of their properties, and compare them with several mainstream implementations and norms for handling NaN values. Finally, as a case study demonstrating the apparatus&#39;s usefulness, the formalism is applied to the discrete fuzzy transform technique. The formalism allows us to prove a generalized approximation theorem for fuzzy transforms, which removes previously required restrictions on fuzzy partitions for sparse input data.},

  abstract     = {The paper attempts to bridge the gap between widely accepted models of biological systems based on the Tsetlin automata acting in random environment and traditional artificial neural networks that consist of the McCalloch and Pitts neurons. Using recently developed algebra with uninorm and absorbing norm aggregators, we consider the neurons as extended Tsetlin automata that implement multi-valued not - xor operator applied to the aggregated inputs and internal states, and then construct the network using these neurons. The inputs of the neurons are specified by the synapses that implement multi-valued joined and and or operations. We demonstrate that for favorable (in the sense of learning) states the suggested neurons act similarly to the traditional neurons, while for unfavorable states they immediately change their activity to the reverse one. Such properties of the neurons both results in the correct activity of the network and demonstrates better correspondence with the logics of natural neural networks.},
