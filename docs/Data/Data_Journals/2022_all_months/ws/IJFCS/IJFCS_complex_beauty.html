  abstract     = {With the rapid development and advances of very large scale integration technology and wafer-scale integration technology, multiprocessor systems, taking interconnection networks as underlying topologies, have been widely designed and used in big data era. The topology of an interconnection network is usually represented as a graph. If any two distinct vertices x , y in a connected graph G are connected by min { deg G ( x ) , deg G ( y ) } vertex (edge)-disjoint paths, then G is called strongly Menger (edge) connected. In 1996, Opatrny et al. [16] introduced the DCC (Disjoint Consecutive Cycle) linear congruential graph, which consists of n nodes and is generated by a set of linear functions F with special properties. In this work, we investigate the strong Menger connectivity of the DCC linear congruential graph ùí¢ = G 2 t ( F , 2 p ) with faulty vertices or edges, where 2 ‚â§ t ‚â§ p ‚àí 1 , p ‚â• 5 , F = { f i ( x ) | f i ( x ) = ( 2 i ‚àí 1 b + 1 ) x + 2 i ‚àí 1 c , 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ t } , gcd ( c , 2 p ) = 1 and b is a multiple of 4 . In detail, we show that ùí¢ ‚àí S is strongly Menger connected if | S | ‚â§ 2 t ‚àí 4 for any S ‚äÜ V ( ùí¢ ) . Moreover, we determine that ùí¢ ‚àí S is strongly Menger edge connected if | S | ‚â§ 2 t ‚àí 2 for any S ‚äÜ E ( ùí¢ ) . Furthermore, we prove that, under the restricted condition Œ¥ ( ùí¢ ‚àí S ) ‚â• 2 , ùí¢ ‚àí S is strongly Menger edge connected if | S | ‚â§ 4 t ‚àí 6 and t ‚â• 3 for any S ‚äÜ E ( ùí¢ ) . In addition, we present some empirical examples to show that the bounds are all optimal in the sense of the maximum number of tolerable edge faults.},

  abstract     = {The vertex (edge) connectivity has been regularly used to measure the fault tolerance and reliability of interconnection networks, while it has defects in the assumption that all neighbors of one node will fail concurrently. To overcome this deficiency, some new generalizations of traditional connectivity have been suggested to quantize the size or the number of the connected components of the survival graph. The g -component (edge) connectivity, one generalization of vertex (edge) connectivity, has been proposed to characterize the vulnerability of multiprocessor systems based on the number of components of the survival graph. In this paper, we determine the g -component (edge) connectivity of a family of networks, called the round matching composition networks R M C N s , which are a class of networks composed of t ( t ‚â• 4 ) clusters with the same order, linked by r perfect matchings. By exploring the combinatorial properties and fault-tolerance of R M C N s , we establish the g -component (edge) connectivity c Œ∫ g + 1 ( G ) = g k ‚àí g 2 + 3 g for 2 ‚â§ g ‚â§ k + 3 and k ‚â• 2 , c Œª 3 ( G ) = 2 k + 3 and c Œª 4 ( G ) = 3 k + 4 for k ‚â• 4 .},

  abstract     = {A new framework to measure distances (similarity) between formal languages and between grammars based on distances between words is introduced. It is based on approximating languages by their finite subsets and using monotone sequences of such finite approximations to define an infinite language in the limit. Distances between finite languages are defined and extended to distances between monotone sequences of finite languages leading to distances between infinite languages. The framework captures several distances studied in the literature. Context-free grammars with energy are introduced to enable finite approximations emphasizing ‚Äúsyntactically important‚Äù parts of words. Grammars with energy are also used to extend distances between monotone sequences of finite languages to distances between context-free grammars. A basic toolkit for monotone sequences of finite languages and distances between languages resp. grammars is provided. As part of this toolkit a non-symmetric version of distances is defined, providing additional characterisation of distances in general. Additional properties of distances between grammars are derived by restricting the‚Äúenergy use‚Äù of grammars with energy. Some methods of estimating the distances are presented to be used in cases where the distance is not computable or difficult to compute.},

A structural synthesis method for Programmable Logic Controller programs is proposed. First, a real-time specification pattern language, RTSPS4Syn, is proposed. Under the condition that there is no circular dependency between the specification items, the implementations of a specification item are assembled structurally from the implementation of its scope and property expression; and the programs for the specification items are concatenated according to the order of priority and dependency to obtain the synthesized program. This paper presents a method to eliminate the circular dependence of specifications, such that the synthesis approach can be applied to specifications with circular dependency. Furthermore, this paper presents an approach for setting the preset values of timers when considering tolerance on the duration of the delay. The synthesis method does not need to check the conflict and determine the nondeterministic part of the specifications. These problems are solved in existing research by constraint solving in PSPACE.},

Finally, a helmet dataset is constructed from this paper, and a K-means clustering algorithm is used to cluster the helmet dataset and select the appropriate a priori candidate frames.

The DEA-Malmquist was used to evaluate the total factor productivity on the sample of 22 Chinese domestic and foreign-funded life insurance companies. A fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was also used to analyze the configuration of determinants affecting technical efficiency. The results show that the overall operating efficiency of life insurance companies in China is relatively satisfying. The changes in total factor productivity are mainly caused by changes in technical efficiency and changes in efficiency. However, changes in scale efficiency have little effect on Chinese domestic and foreign-funded life insurance companies. There is a significant difference in the operating efficiency between Chinese domestic and foreign-funded life insurance companies. In contrast, the operating efficiency is slightly higher than that of foreign-funded life insurance companies, which is mainly reflected in the difference in pure technical efficiency. The realization path of a life insurance company‚Äôs operating efficiency is primarily composed of high employee education and low overclosing ratio, high employee education and low reinsurance ratio, and all-factor positive investment. The weak employee quality and excessive overclosing are the main reasons for the low operating efficiency of some enterprises. This paper systematically analyzes the impact of the organization‚Äôs internal structure on the operating efficiency of life insurance companies. Finally, based on the configuration perspective, we explain the internal logic and path of achieving better operating efficiency. In the end, we also provide decision-making references for further improving the efficient operation of life insurance companies in China.},

Furthermore, the paper studies the optimal decision-making of supply chain based on the bilateral green input of producers and retailers, and designs a revenue-sharing contract(RSC) to coordinate the SAPSC. The main results are as follows: Compared with TAM, the demand for products under GAM is greater. And the producers and retailers are more profitable. The basic greenness and marketing level of the products have a driving effect on green development of SAPSC. The RSC is conducive to encouraging supply chain members to make green inputs. Finally, by analyzing the contract parameters and supply chain parameters, the validity of the contract and the correctness of the conclusion are verified.},

  abstract     = {A portfolio selection problem with cardinality constraints has been proved to be an NP-hard problem, and it is difficult to solve by the traditional optimization methods. This study considers it to be a hybrid of a classical feature selection problem and a standard mean-variance (MV) portfolio selection model. In particular, we propose a new hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm that combines an enhanced binary honey badger algorithm (EBHBA) with quadratic programming to address this issue. First, we employ the proposed EBHBA algorithm to select a portfolio of K stocks from N candidate stocks. Second, based on its choice we transform the problem into a mean-variance model, whose objective function could be defined as the fitness function of EBHBA. Finally, the optimal solution to the model could be found with the quadratic programming method. We also test our approach using the benchmark data sets available at the OR-Library involving real capital markets, where indices are derived from major stock markets around the world. Computational results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a satisfactory result for portfolio selection with cardinality constraints and perform well in searching non-dominated portfolios with high expected returns.},

  abstract     = {Coal mining work has always been a high-risk job, although mining technology is now regularly very mature, many accidents still occur every year in various countries around the world, most of which are due to gas explosions, poisoning, asphyxiation and other accidents. Therefore it is important to monitor and predict both underground mine air quality. In this paper, we use the GCN spatio-temporal graph convolution method based on spectral domain for multivariate time series prediction of underground mine air environment. The correlation of these sequences is learned by a self-attentive mechanism, without a priori graph, and the adjacency matrix with an attention mechanism is created dynamically. The temporal and spatial features are learned by graph Fourier transform and inverse Fourier transform in TC module (temporal convolution) and GC module (graph convolution), respectively. Besides, the corresponding experimental predictions are performed on other public datasets. And a new loss function is designed based on the idea of residuals, which greatly improves the prediction accuracy. In addition, the corresponding experimental predictions were performed on other public datasets. The results show that this model has outstanding prediction ability and high prediction accuracy on most time-series prediction data sets. Through experimental verification, this model has high prediction accuracy for dealing with multivariate time series prediction problems, both for long-term and short-term prediction.},

Many deep learning models are used for text sentiment analysis, and the BiTCN model has good efficacy on sentiment analysis. However, in the actual semantic expression, the contribution of each word to the sentiment tendency is different, BiTCN treats it fairly and does not pay more attention to the key sentiment words. For this problem, a sentiment analysis model based on the BiTCN-Attention is proposed in this paper. The Self-Attention mechanism and Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism are added to BiTCN respectively to form BiTCN-SA and BiTCN-MHSA, which improve the weight of sentiment words and the accuracy of feature extraction, to increase the effect of sentiment analysis. The experimental results show that the model accuracies of BiTCN-SA and BiTCN-MHSA in the JingDong commodity review data set are 3.96% and 2.41% higher than that of BiTCN, respectively. In the comment data set of DianPing, the accuracy of BiTCN-SA and BiTCN-MHSA improved by 4.62% and 3.49%, respectively, compared with that of BiTCN.},

The Kriging surrogate model based on improved quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm was used to establish the limit state equation of contact stress for the VH-CATT cylindrical gear based on the stress-strength interference theory. The state equation of contact stress of the VH-CATT cylindrical gear was obtained with higher precision. Also, the strength degradation model with gamma distribution was established by using the P-S-N curve to estimate the parameters of the strength degradation model with gamma distribution. The reliability sensitivity of the VH-CATT cylindrical gear was analyzed by improved first order second moment method (AFOSM) based on the limit state equation of contact stress of the VH-CATT cylindrical gear, the reliability of gear considering strength degradation was studied by using the improved first order second moment method (AFOSM). The analysis results show that the failure rate decreases with the increase of pressure Angle, tooth width, modulus and tooth radius. The failure rate increases with increasing torque. Strength degradation has a certain influence on the reliability of gear and opinion. And the reliability of the gear is lower than that of the opinion, Strength degradation has a greater influence on the failure probability of gear, at the same time, the reliability of the gear pair decreases with the strength degradation. After 15000 hours of operation, the reliability of the gear pair is only 0.63155.},

  abstract     = {The concept of vehicular platooning is emerging due to its self-driving capability, whereas a set of cars are arranged closely and that can drive safely even in high speed. Moreover the communication can also takes place between two platoons and hence the platoon leader can control the speed and direction. Traffic difficulties, like as collisions and delay at road junctions, need the use of platoon mechanisms. The most efficient vehicle traffic management in platoons is acknowledged in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) for improving energy efficiency, road capacity, and road safety. Essentially, it is critical to analyse the connection characteristic of any two platoons in order to improve connectivity. As a result, under bi-directional platoon architecture, the possibility of connectivity between platoon members and Road Side Units (RSUs) is generated. Providing Quality of Service (QoS) to automotive network is difficult issue because elements such as asynchronous transmission or high mobility, crowded and fragmented channels, hardware defects, and various vehicular gadgets. As a result, it is extremely desired to utilize and distribute resources efficiently. Despite the existence of other bio-inspired meta-heuristic optimization methods, the Bacterial Foraging Algorithm has the benefit of simplicity and efficiency, and so may be used to a wide range of engineering applications. However, in the event of sophisticated analysis, the constraint is a lower convergence rate. To improve resource allocation, this study employs the Improved Bacterial Foraging Optimization based Channel Allocation (IBFOCA) technique. Set of channels allocated to platoon members are signified as bacteria‚Äôs position. By using latency, Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SINR) and Quality of Service (QoS), available channel is initially determined. This approach is used to find a channel that is acceptable for platoon members. Simulation results are used to examine the presentation of multi-channel distributions in platoons utilizing suggested optimization strategy. Signal-to-interference ratio is lowered by 29 decibel, throughput is raised by 69 kilobits per second, collision probability is reduced by 21.4 percent, and average batch size is 57 percent with a delay of 49 milliseconds.},

  abstract     = {Different recommendation algorithms, which often use only a single type of user-item engagement, are plagued by imbalanced datasets and cold start problems. Multi-behavior recommendations, which takes advantage of a variety of customer interaction including click and favorites, can be a good option. Early attempts at multi-behavior suggestion tried to consider the varying levels of effect each behavior has on the target behavior. They also disregard the meanings of behaviors, which are implicit in multi-behavior information. Because of these two flaws, the information isn‚Äôt being completely utilized to improve suggestion performance on the specific behavior. In this paper, we take a novel response to the situation by creating a unified network to capture multi-behavior information and displaying the MBGCNNN model (Multi-Behavior Graph Convolutional Neural Network). MBGCNN may effectively overcome the constraints of prior studies by learning behavior intensity via the user-item dissemination level and collecting behavior interpretation via the items dissemination level. Practical derives from various data sets back up our model‚Äôs order to leverage multi-behavior data. On real methods, our approach beats the average background by 25.02 percent and 6.51 percent, respectively. Additional research on cold-start consumers supports the viability of our suggested approach.},

  abstract     = {One of the deadliest diseases in the world is brain cancer. Children and adults are also susceptible to this malignancy. It also has the poorest rate of survival and comes in a variety of shapes, textures, and sizes, depending on where it is found. Bad things will happen if the tumour brain is misclassified. As a reason, early detection of the right kind and grade of tumour is critical in determining the best treatment strategy. Brain tumours may be identified by looking at magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pictures of the patient‚Äôs brain. The manual method becomes time-consuming and may lead to human mistakes due to the huge quantities of data and the different kinds of brain tumours. As a result, a computer-assisted diagnostic (CAD) system is needed. Image categorization methods have advanced significantly in recent years, particularly deep learning networks, which have achieved success in this field. In this case, we used a multilayer stacked probabilistic belief network to accurately classify brain tumors. Here the MRI brain images are Pre-processed using the Hybrid Butter worth Anisotropic filter and contrast Blow up Histogram Equalization. Followed by pre-processing, the denoised image can be segmented by using the bounding box U-NET segmentation methodology. Then after segmenting the target, the specialized features regarding the tumor can be extracted using the In-depth atom embedding method. Then they obtained can reduce feature dimensionality by using the Backward feature eliminating green wing optimization. The extracted features can be given as input for the classification process. A Multilayer stacked probabilistic belief network is then used to classify the tumour as malignant or benign. The suggested system‚Äôs efficacy was tested on the BraTS dataset, which yielded a high level of accuracy. Subjective comparison study is also performed out among the suggested technique and certain state-of-the-art methods, according to the work presented. Experiments show that the proposed system outperforms current methods in terms of assisting radiologists in identifying the size, shape, and location of tumors in the human brain.},

  abstract     = {Cyber-physical systems in a smart city environment offer secure computations in addition to robust resources and secure information exchanges. From the security aspect, the selection of legitimate computing resources is considered the most trustworthy measure for preserving user and data privacy. However, the outlier information results in false computations and time-consuming privacy measures for smart city users. This article introduces the Computation Annealed Selection Process (CASP) for combating outlier information in cyber-physical system networks. This process is assimilated with different infrastructure units in the smart city in an adaptable fashion. The adaptive measure administers information and user privacy through mutual time-key-based authentication. Information privacy is endured until the smart city provider provides a valid service interval. W2The service interval is evaluated for its consistency in maintaining the privacy and is validated using decision-tree learning. The decision tree performs interval classification and key assignment recommendations. Based on the decisions, the privacy is either prolonged or withdrawn for the information exchanged between the users and service providers. This process is repeated until the end of the service interval, identifying the outlier information in legitimate intervals. The proposed process improves detection, legitimacy rate, interval time, and interval rate by 7.57%, 10.4%, 13.15%, and 7.59%, respectively.},

Data was collected for the months of July, August, and September regarding the test, positive, recovery, and dead results for covid-19 cases in Erbil, Iraq. Based on the obtained data‚Äôs, new modified Lagrange Interpolating polynomial method was derived and proof. The modified Lagrange interpolation polynomial method is very important tool for analyzing, predicting, forecasting, and interpolating high-order polynomials. Moreover, we model, predict, and investigate the test, positive, recovery, and dead results for covid-19 cases in Erbil, Iraq within certain period of time. Our results are well validated and supported by MATLAB.},

  abstract     = {Steganography is a data hiding method mainly used in the security purposes. While hiding more data in the embedding process the data may be lost and also cause some security problems. To avoid this problem a Steganography Embedding method is used. In this manuscript, Steganography Embedding method based on Cohen‚ÄìDaubechies‚ÄìFeauveau Discrete Wavelet Transform (CDF-DWT) technique to data hiding application using Elgamal algorithm is proposed. In this the cover image is taken for hiding the secret data. Then the cover image edges are detected and filtered with Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) method. Then the input secret data is encrypted with Elgamal algorithm. Then the secret data is hided under cover image for obtaining the stego image by process of Embedding using CDF DWT technique. In this data in the stego images are unreadable. To get readable secured data is extracted from the stego image and the data‚Äôs are decrypted to get secured secret data. The objective of this method is to safe guard the secret using Steganography method and to increase embedding efficiency, Embedding capacity and carrier capacity and to reduce the execution time. The MATLAB simulation results of the proposed CDF DWT technique with Elgamal algorithm portrays better outcomes such as Peak to Signal Noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean Square Error (MSE) (lower), Bit Error Rate (BER) was Lower, Execution time provides is lower, Carrier Capacity and Embedding Capacity are much higher and the values are compared with the existing method such as Elliptic Galois in cryptography and in the Steganography method with Adaptive Firefly Algorithm (EGC-AFA), Reversible Data hiding within Encrypted images Via Adaptive Embedding Strategy with block selection (RDHEI-AES), Double Linear Regression Prediction based Reversible Data Hiding in Encrypted Image (DLRP-RDHEI) respectively.},

Towards this, the discrete Fourier transform (Walsh‚ÄìHadamard) plays a pivotal tool. The work in this paper is dedicated towards the algebraic and numerical degrees, together with the relationship between weights of Boolean function and their Walsh transforms. We introduce Walsh matrices and generalize them to any arbitrary Boolean function. This improves the complexity in computation of Walsh‚ÄìHadamard and Fourier transform in certain cases. We also discuss some useful results related to the degree of the algebraic normal form using Walsh‚ÄìHadamard transform.},

We introduce a suitable model of automata, the h-lexicalized one-way restarting automata (h-RRWW), and compare the properties of their input languages, which are the languages considered traditionally in automata theory, to the properties of the so-called basic and h-proper languages. These languages form the basic components for LSA. With respect to their input languages, h-RRWW-automata are not sensitive to the size of the read/write window and they allow computations that are far from being correctness preserving. On the other hand, for their basic and h-proper languages, h-RRWW-automata ensure that the resulting computations are completely correctness preserving, and they yield infinite ascending hierarchies of language classes within the regular, the context-free, and the context-sensitive languages that are based on the size of the read/write window.},

A double-head pushdown automaton is a slight generalization of an ordinary pushdown automaton working with two input heads that move in opposite directions on the common input tape. In every step one head is moved and the automaton decides on acceptance if the heads meet. Demanding the automaton to work input-driven it is required that every input symbol uniquely defines the action on the pushdown store (push, pop, state change). Normally this is modeled by a partition of the input alphabet and is called a signature . Since our automaton model works with two heads either both heads respect the same signature or each head owes its own signature. This results in two variants of input-driven double-head pushdown automata. The induced language families on input-driven double-head pushdown automata are studied from the perspectives of their language describing capability, their closure properties, and decision problems.},

  abstract     = {Reversible forms of computations are often interesting from an energy efficiency point of view. When the computation device in question is an automaton, it is known that the minimal reversible automaton recognizing a given language is not necessarily unique, moreover, there are languages having arbitrarily large reversible recognizers possessing no nontrivial ‚Äúreversible‚Äù congruence. Building atop on our earlier result, we show that the corresponding decision problem is N L -complete, and that even in the case when there are only finitely many such reversible recognizers, the largest one among them can be exponentially larger than the minimal automaton. Both results hold for the case of binary alphabets.},

With the whole multiset being enclosed in a vesicle, sending it to a target cell can be indicated in those simple rules working on the multiset. As derivation modes we consider the sequential derivation mode, where, if possible, one rule is applied in a derivation step, and the set maximally parallel derivation mode, where in each derivation step a non-extendable set of rules indicating the same target cell is applied. With the set maximally parallel derivation mode, computational completeness can already be obtained with tissue P systems having a tree structure, whereas tissue P systems even with an arbitrary communication structure are not computationally complete when working in the sequential mode. Adding polarizations ‚Äî only the three polarizations ‚àí 1 , 0 , 1 are sufficient ‚Äî allows for obtaining computational completeness even for tissue P systems working in the sequential mode.},

In this paper, we study the Antenna Orientation ( AO ) and Antenna Orientation and Power Assignment ( AOPA ) problems, two important issues in DWSNs. In the AO problem, given a set V of sensors equipped with directional antennas with beam-width ùúÉ = œÄ / 3 , the objective is to determine an orientation of the antennas and a minimum transmission range r = O ( 1 ) such that the induced symmetric communication graph is connected. We prove that the AO problem is NP-hard. We then extend our proof technique and show that the AOPA problem for DWSNs equipped with œÄ / 3 directional antennas is also NP-hard where we have to determine an orientation of the antennas as well as a power assignment r to the nodes such that the resulting symmetric communication graph is connected, and (2) Œ£ u ‚àà S r ( u ) Œ≤ is minimized ( Œ≤ is the distance-power gradient, 2 ‚â§ Œ≤ ‚â§ 6 ).
